An introverted kinda soul,
The earth did open, 
swallow whole,

Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',

Her next of kin who lived in sin, 
was asking god to let her in,

Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',

I'm a man, a liar,
Guaranteed in your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,

An extroverted kinda girl,
did tour the world with MC5,

Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',

Her younger sister, had a blister 
where I kissed her on her thigh

Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',
Careenin',

I'm a man a liar
Guaranteed in your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
got a place inside it,
I'm a man a liar
Guaranteed in your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,
I'm a man a liar
Get into your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
got a place inside it,
I'm a man a liar
Guaranteed in your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
I got a place inside it,
I'm a man a liar
Guaranteed in your bed,
I gotta place it on the rack,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,
got a place inside it,
