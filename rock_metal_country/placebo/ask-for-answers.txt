Time to pass you to the test. Hanging on my lover's breath.
Always coming second best. Pictures of my lover's chest.
Get through this night, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.
Always falling to the floor, softer than it was before.
Dog boy - media whore, it's who the hell you take me for.

Give up this fight, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.
These bonds are shackle free, wrapped in lust and lunacy.
Tiny touch of jealousy, these bonds are shackle free.

Get through this night, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free

Get through this, there are no second chances.
This time. To ask the sea for answers.
