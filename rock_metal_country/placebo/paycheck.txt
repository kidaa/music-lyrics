Consumed by the one's who made her
She's a faker, always let's me down
dressed up like a capital shaker
pull the  that judgement let her down
I'll have your guts for garters, just for starters
don't you make me frown
she could've been a nutter
so I had to cut the mother down
Slacker, wasting half is life on sniffing glue
now he's a foreman working for the red the white and blue
plain sailing, safe surfing
public peeling, back stab

Confused by the one's who break her
She's a faker, never makes a sound
undressed like a soul in prayer
buy a share, pay her by the pound
I'll have your face for breakfast
I'm in excess, need of a stroke down
she could've been a nutter
so I had to cut the mother down
Slacker, wasted half is life on speed
now he's reformed and working for the red the white and blue
plain sailing, shoulder rubbing
dental flossing, back stab

Pay - check, Pay - check

Save the best for later
be careful not to stain the sheets now
you god damn liar
take me higher

I never wanted the real thing, I never wanted the real thing
I never wanted the real thing, I never wanted the real thing
I never wanted the real thing, I never wanted the real thing
I never wanted the real thing

Slacker, wasted half is life on sniffing glue
now he's reformed, working for the red the white and blue
plain sailing, wife swapping
stool pigeon, back stab.

Pay - check, Pay - check

save the best for later
be careful not to stain the sheets now
you god damn liar
pants on fire

cold 
but this one really takes the piss
it's likely to proquandry
I deserve so much more than this.
