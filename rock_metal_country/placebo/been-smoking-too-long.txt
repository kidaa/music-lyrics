'yeah, I really, um, I really, I really wanted to kind of like,
to capture some kind of like moment, but maybe it's better if I'm sober...'

Wake up in the morning, I look at my clock
it's way past noontime, I'm late for work.
Tell me what have I done wrong
nothing can go right with me it must be that I've been smoking
too long

Go to fix me some breakfast, I ain't got no food
take me a shower, the water don't feel no good.
Tell me what have I done wrong
and nothing can go right with me must be that I've been smoking
too long

I got opium in my chimney, no other life to choose
nightmares made of hash dreams, the devil in my shoes.
What have I done wrong
yeah nothing can go right with me it must be that I've been smoking
too long

When I'm smoking, smoking, put my worries on a shelf
try not to think about nothing, don't wanna see myself
What have I done wrong
and nothing can go right with me it must be that I've been smoking
too long

In this blues I'm singing, there's a lesson to be learned
you go round smoking, you're gonna get burned
Fuck me what have I done wrong
nothing can go right with me must be that I've been smoking
too long
too long.
