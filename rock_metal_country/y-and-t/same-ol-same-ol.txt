Yeah Yeah Yeah Owww Oww hmmm hmmm

First time you said that you were leaving
I cried cuz you said you didn't need me
But the second that I started seeing somebody else
It's when ya had to come back to me 
gone continued movin now I'm better
I moved on
To someone who would treat me better
But now you're tripping cuz you see I aint all by myself
And you won't let be me boy

[CHORUS:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone
Everytime you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you wanna come home 
And you're alone 
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' sad scenario
Everytime you say you wanna be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know its the Same Ol' Same Ol'

Ooohhhh
You thought that you could keep on dreaming
This too you think that I won't keep on moving 
I admit it for a minute 
You was having your way
What can I say
I wasn't over you oh no
Things change You and me 
Best forget itno no babe
No more playing i admit it
Don't you get it boy 
You take it back tryin to say like it was yesterday 
But boy 
But you never really ever cared about me
Cause if you ever really cared about me
Then it wouldnt take another man 
To make you understand
That you want me oh
Cause if you really ever cared about me
You wouldn't ever broken my heart, left me
And now you wanna come back and call me up

[CHORUS:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone
Everytime you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you wanna come home 
And you're alone 
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' sad scenario
Everytime you say you wanna be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know its the Same Ol' Same Ol'

[BRIDGE:]
