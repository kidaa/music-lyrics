I see you all the time
You're watching me
You're not the only one who notices me
Something about the way you flash your smile
That makes me feel like I should stay for a while

Only secretly you talk to me ohh
I can't understand why
You feel the need to hide
Deep down in your heart you know how you feel oh
Boy just keep it real with me
You can't be wastin' my time no no

[CHORUS:]
Boy you play too many games
So baby try if you may
I see straight through ya
Cuz deep down you wanna be mine
I bow my head and I pray
We'll be together someday
I'm gonna love ya
Cuz deep down you wanna be mine

The sweetest things you do
Happen when no one's there
But when they come around 
Baby you seem so scared
You know I dig you
And I know you feel it too
Don't let your boys control you
Man, they're makin' the rules

Only secretly you talk to me yeah
I can't unnderstand why
You feel the need to hide
Deep down in your heart you know how you feel
Boy just keep it real with me
You can't be wastin' my time well nooo

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x's]

Just like the rising of the morning sun
Baby you shine before my very eyes
Won't somebody tell me tell me why
You failed to realize what you feel inside whoa oh

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Oh only secretly you talk to me
When I say let's go you never speak
You act like you don't know me baby

Deep down you wanna be mine
