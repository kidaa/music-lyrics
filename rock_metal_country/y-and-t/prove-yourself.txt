If you really want me babe
Prove yourself to me

Straight up uh huh
Get real alright
Just tell me what you feel yeah
Wise up uh huh
Be true
If it's gonna be just me and you

Let's wait a while and think it over think it over
I don't know why you behave this way mmmm yeah
Don't you think that I know you
And all the things you say
This is what you gotta do
You gotta change your ways
Wise up
Step back
If you want this love to last
