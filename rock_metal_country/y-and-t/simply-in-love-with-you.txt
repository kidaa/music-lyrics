Everyone tells me this feeling will pass
But I got a feeling that this is a feeling that was meant to last
You took my heart with your first hello
And sooner or later I'll find the courage to let you know
That you got a hold
Down deep in my soul
That goes from here to infinity
You'll always be the one I need
As long as I have breath in me
I'll never give up on your love as long as I live

[CHORUS:]
Baby I'll give you the best I've got
If that's not enough than I don't know what
To be complicated's the hardest to do
I'm simply in love with you
Run to me baby and hold out your hand
I'll give you more love than one guy can stand
Whatever you want baby that's what I'll do
I'm simply in love with you

Simply in love

They say all good things come to those who wait
And I'd wait forever because it's useless to resist our fate
So stop runnin' 'round here and you will find
Later or sooner my baby you know that you're gonna be mine
So don't waste your time
Get deep and sublime
And go from here to infinity
You'll always be the one I need 
As long as I have breath in me
I'll never give up on your love as long as I live

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Always gonna love you baby [repeat]
Simply in love
Simply in love

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Simply in love with you
