I've been waiting
Watching you from a distance baby 
Thinkin', wonderin'
If you're gonna be here with me
You're on my mind baby all the time
I hope someday you will realize that

[CHORUS:]
Sooner or later
You're gonna be mine
I want you forever 
I can't stop now
I wish you could love me
The way I love you
But sooner or later
I will get to you

Something tells me
That you and I should be together
So I won't wait
Run away to something better
You're on my mind baby all the time
I hope someday you will realize that

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I never thought that I could feel this way

I ain't gonna hurt you
I promise my love is truuuuuuuue

Sooner or later sooner or later
You're gonna be mine

But sooner or later
