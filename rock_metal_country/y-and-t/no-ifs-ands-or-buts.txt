No Ifs Ands Or Buts 

Baby, can I get your number? 
I wonder if you wanna get with a real thing 
Tell me what you need 
I guarantee that I'll never do you wrong 
So bring it on, my love is strong 
Tell me what you want 

I know that you're shy 
But you caught my eye 
You don't know what you do to me 
Whenever you're around 
I want you to know I'm down 
I'll never let you go 

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of 
They say I'm too young for me to understand 
About a man 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it 
I know how I feel about you 
And I, boy I know that it's true 
That I'm diggin' you 
And all that I want is someone like you 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby 
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will 

Baby, I know that I'm young 
But I ain't dumb 
Tell you exactly what I want in love 
For me, and I... 
And I will never do those things to you 
That other girls would do to you 

I know you're shy but won't you 
Give me a chance and I'll show you 
Whenever you come around 
I want you to know I'm down 
And I'll never let you go 

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of 
They say I'm too young for me to understand 
About a man 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it 
I know how I feel about you 
And I, boy I know that it's true 
That I'm diggin' you 
And all that I want is someone like you 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby 
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will 

Break it down for me 
Oh, oh oh oh ah ah ah 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it 
I know how I feel about you and I 

I know, I know 
That I'm young 
I'd never do you wrong 
And I will never do those things to you 
That other girls would do to you 

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of 
They say I'm too young for me to understand 
About a man 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it 
I know how I feel about you 
And I, boy I know that it's true 
That I'm diggin' you 
And all that I want is someone like you 
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby 
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will
