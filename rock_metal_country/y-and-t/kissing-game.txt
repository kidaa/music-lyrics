Kissing Game

Hey yeah
I like
I like the way
I like 
I like
I like

All summer long we've been together
And I never felt so good
Cuz when I'm with you
It's such a good time yes it is
And when you get next to me
You make my heart beat fast
You threw me back when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
Cuz I can't get enough
Cuz I like

CHORUS:
I like the way 
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
I like the way
You keep me looking forward to another day

Now we've got it good
We have it all it seems
We're living dreams yeah
This is our time
Cuz we're commit to be just you and me
This is the new
Where two young hearts can break in two
But I know our love will always be there

REPEAT CHORUS

Yeah ohh
I like the way
Keep me looking forward to another day another day
I like the way I like the way
Ohh I like the way
The way you love me baby
I like the way
I like
I like
Hey I like the way 
I like the way we play
Hey hey hey

I like
I like the way
The way
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
