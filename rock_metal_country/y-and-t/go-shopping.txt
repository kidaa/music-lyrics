Follow me go shopping
Me go shopping
Gonna follow me go shopping
Then me go shopping with you 

Brooklyn and Bronx - LA to Manhattan
L.A. we go dance
And then we go shopping
On Saturdays I took her out
To the supermarket
Food is in the trolley
And roses in the basket
I remember when I used to walk it
It's impossible to carry water in a basket 

Follow me go shopping
Me go shopping
Gonna follow me go shopping
Then me go shopping with you 

And now I love her so much
She was smooth and never rough
She use her tongue like a paint brush 

Then we go shopping 

Her name was Mary Mitten
Soft like a kitten
The diamond that she wore
Makes my eye glisten
I told her not to kiss him
But she wouldn't listen
On my back she bit and
On her chest my name written
Just below her nipple
Her stomach filled with ripple 

And follow me go shopping
Me go shopping
Gonna follow me go shopping
Then me go shopping with you
