1 2 3 4 [in German] 

We are standing here 
Exposing ourselves 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

We're being watched 
and we feel our pulse 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

We look around 
and change our pose 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

We start to move 
And we break the glass 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

We step out 
And take a walk through the city 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

We go into a club 
And there we start to dance 
We are showroom dummies 
We are showroom dummies 

[repeat to fade] 
We are showroom dummies
