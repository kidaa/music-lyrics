Panic, frenzy
My love is near
Panic, frenzy
My love is here
But there's one thing,
I know I need you to deliver me
with all the speed of candy
Whoa I'm a sugar queen, so,
shoot me with the speed that I need,
Panic la la la la 5 a.m.
My love sleeps. Panic 6 a.m.
My mind creeps
But there's one thing,
I know I need you to deliver me
with all the speed of candy
And when it's over, my teeth will be like glue
It's true, that's all I need
Come on and feed me, candy
Candy, we're all on the sugar team, so,
shoot me with the speed that I need
it's the speed that I need [x3]
