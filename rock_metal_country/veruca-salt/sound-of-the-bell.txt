I found a place where we can talk.
I found a way to reach a middle gound.
Keep your castle in my sandbox.
Build it up so we can burn it down.
Anyway I love my man,
love to keep him spinning 
round and round.
Keep him feeding love from my hand.
Any way to turn him inside out.
I don't wanna go 
down like the sunlight.
I don't wanna go 
out like the moonlight.
I don't wanna be found at 
the sound of the bell.
The sound of the bell [x2]
Meet me up and down again.
Every time is sweeter than the last.
Once you get a taste of impact,
you're always hungry for the crash.
I don't wanna go 
down like the sunlight.
I don't wanna go 
out like the moonlight.
I don't wanna be found at 
the sound of the bell.
The sound of the bell [x2]
And this is everything 
I have loved,
yeah I have loved.
Break my heart.
Down, I don't wanna go 
down like the sunlight.
I don't wanna go 
out like the moonlight.
I don't wanna be found at 
the sound of the bell.
The sound of the bell [x2]
I don't wanna go 
down like the sunlight.
I don't wanna go 
out like the moonlight.
I don't wanna be found at 
the sound of the bell.
The sound of the bell [x2]
I don't wanna be found 
in the searchlight.
I don't wanna be dim 
like a nightlight.
