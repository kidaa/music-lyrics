I've never met her, and I don't mind
I've seen her face a thousand times
she hides behind her hair
I wonder if her love is like mine
Face up, I'll face the day
three weeks, you flew away
I'll never blame her
I'll never let you make me hate a girl that way
touch down, I hear the score
I watched you slide out through the backdoor
I've never met her, but when I do
I'll thank her from saving me from you
