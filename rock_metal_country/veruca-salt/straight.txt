You sleep better when you're,
you sing better when you're
You need me more when you're straight.
Is this the weekend
Is that your girlfriend
No, she's green and innocent.
You smoke her like she's incense.
You smile. [x3]
Stay straight for me. [x2]
I'll wait till summer's over,
I'll love you through October.
I'll give you everything.
I'll trade you anything for her.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Stay straight for me. [x3]
