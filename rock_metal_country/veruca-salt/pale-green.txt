I am fourteen
Wrapped in a white sheet
Rain's coming through the window
The moon lands on my feet
I am pale green
I think she laced it with pcp
I feel like I'm in hell now
I want my dad [x2]
I am somewhere far from sleep sleep sleep
And look at me now
It's seven in the morning
You're dreaming while it's storming
I miss you,
I miss you without warning
I am somewhere far from sleep
