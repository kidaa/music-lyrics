It's a shame you
have a mind of your own now
Shame on you,
completely setting the tone now.
I caught you,
bleeding under my skin now
I fought you, but you're beginning to win now
Well I don't care,
I swear it's my turn now
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah [x3]
you gotta get in glimmer, shimmer
sparkle while you can
Train crashing,
falling off of the tracks now
Whip cracking
at the small of my back now
I failed you
and they're beginning to talk now
I nailed you
until you're walking the walk now.
Well I don't care,
I swear it's my turn now
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah [x3]
you gotta get it glimmer, shimmer
sparkle while you can
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah [x8]
Shimmer, yeah [x2]
shimmer like a good girl
