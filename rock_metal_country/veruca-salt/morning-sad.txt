Wake up and talk to me, 
it's a long time since last night.
I know we said things, 
the saddest things,
and I'm not sure it was wise. 
When the morning sad,
you don't look back, 
but you sure don't look ahead.
The morning sad, 
you know the morning sad.
The morning sad, never had it 
so bad, never had it so bad.
I'm writing desperate songs, 
while you're fast asleep inside.
I could try to sing, until it rings, 
but my voice comes out uptight.
So when the morning sad,
you don't relax no you 
cannot clear your mind.
The morning sad, 
you know the morning sad.
The morning sad, never had it 
so bad, never had it so bad.
I tried a little, I tried 
a lot. I'm not a window
and you've seen through 
everything I've got.
Oh I don't think that I'll be 
safe until everyone's awake.
Everybody, anybody, yeah.
So wake up and talk to me, 
such a long time since last night.
I know we said things, 
the maddest things
and I'm not sure who was right.
When the morning sad,
you don't attack but you're
much too weak to fight.
The morning sad, 
you know the morning sad.
The morning sad, never had it 
so bad, never had it so bad.
never had it so bad. [x7]
