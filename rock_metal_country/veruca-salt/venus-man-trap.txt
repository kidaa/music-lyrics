Waiting for opportunity to strike.
I have been your biggest fan. 
What a tour.
A little blow to cure your fright,
it's what it takes to trap a man.
Water me, I am not a desert plant,
and there was life before you. 
When I close
Will I wear my blue eyes 
When I open
This time 
When I close
Or should I wear my green eyes
When I open 
That shine and shine
When I close 
Will I wear my green eyes
When I open,.. I love you [x4]
In my room, 
Underneath the microscope.
I thought you knew, 
I was always full of hope.
But you could only help yourself. 
When I close
Will I wear my blue eyes 
When I open
This time. 
When I close
Or should I wear my green eyes
When I open, oh.. 
That shine and shine
When I close 
Will I wear my green eyes
When I open,.. I love you [x4]
Will I wear my blue eyes 
This time
Or should I wear my green eyes
That shine and shine 
When I close
Will I wear my blue eyes 
When I open
This time 
When I close, oh..
Or should I wear my green eyes
When I open, open.. 
That shine and shine
When I close 
Will I wear my green eyes
When I open,.. I love you [x4]
