don't thank me for what you got
I've given you love I've given you too much thought
don't blame me for sinking the ship
you're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
only you know [x4]
don't thank me for what you got
I've given you love I've given you too much thought
don't shame me for calling it quits
you're a hopeless sinner and an optimist
only you know [x4]
hey, don't hate me for what you got
I've given you drugs I've given you too much fun
don't blame me for flunking the test
I would rather think that you were honest
don't blame me cause you got caught
you've given me up, you've taken everything I got
those lies came straight from your mouth
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout
only you know [x4]
don't use me as your last crutch
I've taken you in, I've trusted you way too much
don't wear me around your wrist
you should've thought it through before you blew it
same day, same life, different person
your ghost, my pride, perfect 
don't hate me for what you got
I've given you love, I've given you too much thought.
don't shame me for sinking the ship
you're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
don't hate me for what you're not 
I'm aiming your gun
I'm lining up the perfect shot
don't waste me
on something stupid like this
I would rather die than take your bullet [x5]
only you know [x8] your bullet different person
