I crawl out of sight for you, dear
I melt with the night, I disappear
I won't have more fun with you
never get drunk with you
I'll let you go for good
I've pulled it apart for you dear
I wait for my heart to shift gear
I'll let you down for good
I'll never go back to you
never shoot smack with you
I'll let you go for good [x3]
