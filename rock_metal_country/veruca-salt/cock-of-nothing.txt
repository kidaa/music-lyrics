Hold me up, I cannot stand
I'm nothing, I'm your man
Feel like blur, I know you can
I'm nothing, I'm your man
Hold me up, I hold you down
And you'll be thankful
you have found a man, like me
If I'm bad, you'll smack my hand
Little baby, little man
forty pounder in the sand
Cock of nothing, I'm your man
Hold me up, I hold you down
And you'll be thankful
you have found a man, like me
Oh no, here I go
See I can't connect
If I can't control
And see I can't release,
no I can't let go,
And I can't let you go
Hold me up, I hold you down
And you'll be thankful
you have found a man,
like me [x3]
