Cut the back, pull the stuffing
Cut the girl down to nothing
Feed the boy
Disinfect the house
Disinherit [x3]
And it's creeping up my spine
And it's clutching at my throat
And it's seizing my tongue
And I'm numb
And it's feeding on my face
And it's foaming at the mouth
And it's gnawing on my bones
And he's rolling up his sleeve
And he feeds me
And he's memorizing me
And he's making his mark [x2]
Stop the car
Still the engine
Save your best until now
Dig your nails in
