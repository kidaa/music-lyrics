Goodbye 25, 
you were a good year for the girls.
Goodbye 25, 
you'll be the goldfinch, 
I'm the harpies.
There's something in the unity, 
forget humility.
Oh, what's coming over me 
is awesome, awesome.
God forgive me, 
I know it's so awesome, awesome.
Heaven help me, 
I know it's a fine place to be.
Goodbye indolence, 
your filthy left hand kept me down.
Goodbye cowardice, 
you'll be the tigris, 
I'm euphrates.
There's something in the unity, 
forget humility.
Oh, what's coming over me 
is awesome, awesome.
God forgive me, 
I know it's so awesome, awesome.
Heaven help me, I know, 
I know it's a fine place to be.
And it's a fine place to be [x4]
There's something in the unity,
what's coming over me.. 
oh go f*** humility.
We're awesome, awesome.
All the salts go, 
I know it's so awesome, awesome.
Everybody I know, 
I know it's a fine place to be.
And it's a fine place to be [x2]
Yeah it's a fine place to be [x2]
Oh it's a fine place to be. 
Yeah it's a fine place to be. [x2]
