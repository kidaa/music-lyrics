You wait in the car on the side of the road
Let me go and stand a while
I want to know you're there but I wanna be alone
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun against the wind
I walked out in a field
The grass was high
It brushed against my leg
I just stood and looked out at the open space
At a farmhouse out a ways
And I wonder about the people who lived in it
And I wonder if they were happy and content
And were there children and a man and a wife
And did she love him and take her hair down at night
If I stray too far away from you
Don't go out and try to find me
It doesn't mean I don't love you
It doesn't mean I won't come back and stay beside you
It only means I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I always used to go
La la la...
If only for a minute or two
I want to know what it feels to be without you
To know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun against the wind
