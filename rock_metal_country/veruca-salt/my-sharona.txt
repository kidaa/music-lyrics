Oh my little pretty one, my pretty one
When you gonna give me some time sharona
Oh you make my motor run, my motor run
Gun it coming off of the line sharona
Never gonna stop
Give it up
Such a dirty mind
Always get it up
From the touch of the younger kind
My My My My My Whoa
My Sharona
Come a little closer huh
Will ya huh
Close enough to look in my eyes sharona
Keeping it a mystery gets to me
Running down the length of my thighs sharona
Never gonna stop
Give it up
Such a dirty mind
Always get it up
From the touch of the younger kind
My My My My My Whoa
My Sharona
When you gonna get to me, get to me
Is it just a matter of time sharona
Is it destiny destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind sharona
Never gonna stop
Give it up
Such a dirty mind
Always get it up
From the touch of the younger kind
My My My My My Whoa
My Sharona
My My My My My Whoa
My Sharona [x4]
