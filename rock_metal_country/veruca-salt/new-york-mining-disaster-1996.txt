I'm going down,
and I don't know when
I'm coming up again
Oh I'm going down
said I don't know when
I'm coming up again.
When did I slip
Where did I miss you
When did I trip over you
and when will I fly over you
oh I'm going down 
and I don't know when
I'm coming up again. [x2]
Dark has come
I'm not afraid though
I can become anyone
and I don't want anyone, no
I'm going down
and I don't know when
I'm coming up again
Oh I'm going down
said I don't know when
I'm coming up again
There was a love,
I shot it down
There was a trust,
I shot it down
Oh there was a life,
I shot it down
