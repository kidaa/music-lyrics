That was a time for falling;
I knew you well.
There was no time
for calling me when you fell.
This is a time to take cover
in a wishing well.
Summer was blowing
all over me when you fell.
Sailors can take all the breathing
out of the sail.
I took a trip when you needed me.
When you fell,
waters were driving me to a deep place
I closed my eyes to see your sweet face,
a Coke can beside me
I slept in hell.
Angels can be so deceiving
when they love you well.
Did you think you would be leaving me
These are some lavender flowers
in a broken shell
I know it's broken..
They comfort me ever since
the day when you fell.
When you fell,
waters were dancing
in a dark place; I closed my eyes
to see your determined face.
My secret inside me,
I slept in hell.
This is a time for believing
in fairy tales.
One in which you are brought back to me.
Wolf,... I cried wolf. [x3]
