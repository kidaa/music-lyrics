My life, just got grim
My life, on account of him
You had a chance
You could have made it okay
Are you really gonna marry her on
Halloween Day [x2]
Your wife is torn apart
Beware of her haunted heart
I thought you had a chance chance
I'd thought you'd make it okay
I never really thought you'd marry her on
Halloween Day [x2]
And something's spooky in the pit of my heart
And something's stirring in the trunk of my car
Under this itching on the roof of my mouth says
Don't go out [x2]
Don't go out after, go out after
dark [x3], after dark [x2]
After dark on
Halloween Day [x2]
My life, just got grim
My life, on account of him
On account of him [x3]
