We got a cutter in the bathroom
She kinda busted out of high school
She's seventeen and she likes the taste
It's too late
It's too late
For such an innocent face
Such an innocent face
You got an innocent
Lalalalala
You're an innocent

You can't see when the lights are down
You can't see what they're saying now
The kind of face that sparks a cash flow
You got a cover shoot in t-t-t-tokyo
You got an innocent face
You got an innocent
Lalalala
What a waste

You show up you're on the A-list
And no one knows how much you hate this
You won't eat without a gun to your head
You won't eat without a gun to your head
You're such a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
You're such a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty mess
