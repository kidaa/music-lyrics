When you've had enough, 
and you've got it bad enough
and you can't let go. 
When it comes to blows,
and you start to overflow, 
and you can't get home.
It's a subtle kind of cruel, 
it taps my spine.
Here I'm drawing a line, 
I'm asking please.
Don't you wanna 
be happy with me [x2]
I'm afraid if you 
don't come around soon,
I'll turn sadder 
than you ever were,
and you'll learn 
lonliness is worse
you've gotta try.
December's all alone, 
and he's calling 
me on the phone
but he sounds so cold. 
He says he loves me so,
but how would I ever know
Certain words grow old.
It's a vicious kind of catch, 
it sides me blind.
Now I'm out of my mind, 
I wanna scream.
Don't you wanna 
be happy with me [x2]
I'm afraid if you 
don't come around soon,
I'll turn sadder 
than you ever were,
and you'll learn 
lonliness is worse
you've gotta try.
Love liked me long ago,
it had a way of making 
everyone the same.
But how the angels 
must laugh and sigh
to hear me pleading with you,
and needing you this way.
Oh why don't you 
wanna be happy with me [x2]
I'm afraid if you 
don't come around soon,
I'll turn sadder 
than you ever were,
and you'll learn 
lonliness is worse
you've gotta try to 
stay mine all the way
Don't you wanna 
be happy with me [x2]
I'm afraid if you don't 
come around soon,
I'll turn sadder than 
you ever were.
