I don't believe what you said
I can go anywhere
I can hold my head up
I can breathe in the air
I'm not officially dead
I still have a heart
I'm not officially dead, yeah
I still have a heart
do you remember the times 
you ride my bike past my house
I wanna know you so bad 
know you inside and out
you're officially dead
you don't have a heart
you're officially dead, yeah
you don't have a heart
you're officially dead
you don't have a heart
you're officially dead
see me, feel me, touch me, please me..
was it easy just to leave me 
just to leave me dead
I know you can't let me go
it's all in your head
you want me back in your arms
back in your bed
we're officially dead
we don't have a heart
we're officially dead
we don't have a heart [x4]
officially dead 
we're officially dead [x2]
officially dead [x3]
