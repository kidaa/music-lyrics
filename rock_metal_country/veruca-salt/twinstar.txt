Flying, when all I want to do is die.
Feels like you're flying.
Oh god I wish that I could fly.
You wanna lift me up but
you don't know and you don't see
I'm stuck in my ways,
stuck in my ways.
Breathing, when all
I wanna do is drown.
You keep on breathing,
and I keep on sinking down.
You wanna lift me up but
you don't know and you don't see
I'm stuck in my ways,
stuck in my ways.
I'm stuck in my ways.
You keep on breathing,
and I keep on sinking down.
You wanna lift me up but
you don't know and you don't see
I'm stuck in my ways,
stuck in my ways.
I'm stuck in my ways. [x2]
