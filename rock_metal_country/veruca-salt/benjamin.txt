Take me away, I know 
I could use the rest.
I wanna clear up this mess.
I need a few days, 
with my good sense.
I need a few good days.
Benjamin, no.. oh.. [x2]
Benjamin, no.. 
where did you go No, no..
When you were falling from my tree, 
I was not scared.
I thought you'd 
meet me back up there.
It never dawned on me 
you were home free.
It never dawned on me, no.
Benjamin, no.. oh.. [x2]
Benjamin, no.. where 
did you go No, no..
You said that I could 
tie you down, no [x5]
Take me away, I know 
I could use the rest.
