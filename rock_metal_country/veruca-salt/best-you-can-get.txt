she's all crazy and shit
she shows us her tits
she's just a corn-fed white-bred chick
born in the right zip code
she comes with a gold card
she'll never have to pay for it
what would she do without you [x2]
what would she do
He's not afraid of the future
he's hot off the platter
he's been handed a blank check

he's brung an agenda
and he's got a place to put it

that you can get
the best that you can get
is this the best that you can get
the best that you can get
I'm not afraid of the ocean
afraid of devotion
I've got the balls to prove it
what would I do without you [x3]
is this the best that you can get
what would I do
