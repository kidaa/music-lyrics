Bright you are
And bigger than both of us
Though I'm a star
I can't burn that bright
Tiger car swerving forward into us
Now here we are
Sleeper car
Now you're backing into me
Oh where you are
Feels good for now
Although my arms ache
harder than they ever have
You drive so far
Sleeper car
Now you're backing into me
Oh where you are
Feels good for now
Although my arms ache
harder than they ever have
You drive so far [x2]
