You didn't notice I was gone.
Cause you were tying up your arm.
And when I stand on my head, 
you never react.
I can't get you to crack. [x2]
not one f***ing smile.
But when it comes right down to it,
I'm gonna run right back to him, 
I wanna be smack dab with him.
I've grown to love his stoneface so [x2]
I've grown to love it.
A sneaky goddess got my man. 
That kinda love don't understand him.
And when I swallow my gum, 
you never react.
I can't get you to crack. [x2]
not one f***ing smile.
But when it comes right down to it,
I'm gonna run right back to him, 
I wanna be smack dab with him.
I've grown to love his stoneface so [x2]
I've grown to love it.
Swallow hard until you, 
I'll be the one to thrill you.
I'll be the first to kill you. 
And if you won't die I will.
And when I short sheet the bed, 
you never react.
I can't get you to crack. [x5]
not one f***ing smile.
But when it comes right down to it,
I'm gonna run right back to him, 
I wanna be smack dab with him.
I've grown to love his stoneface so [x2]
I've grown to love it.
