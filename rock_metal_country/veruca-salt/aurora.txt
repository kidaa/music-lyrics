How could you be everything
We were cracking you up to be
We're cracking ourselves up too
We're cracking ourselves up to be you
Had you in my hand
Now where'd you go, Aurora
See you up ahead,
but I don't know if I can go as far as you go
Everything keeps happening
And it's happening to me
I'm losing sight of its meaning
You blew away the meaning
I had it in my hand
Now where did it go, Aurora
I see you up ahead,
but I don't know if I can go as far as you go
And everyone keeps telling me that this is good
I needed you to tell me it was good too
Had you in my hand
Now where'd you go, Aurora
I see you up ahead,
but I don't know if I can go as far as you go
