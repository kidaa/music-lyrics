I'm afraid I will never change.
It's ok, I am not ashamed.
I can say that my bed is made.
You can bend me,
shape me, anyway...
You can bend me,
shape me anyway you want me.
I maintain I am not in pain.
How I try not to place the blame.
I came late to an early game.
You can bend me,
shape me, anyway...
You can bend me,
shape me, anyway...
You can bend me,
shape me anyway you want me.
When I was five,
I took a dive.
When I was ten,
I walked again.
When I was fifteen,
I kept my motor clean.
When I was twenty,
I got plenty.
When I was twenty-five... [x2]
