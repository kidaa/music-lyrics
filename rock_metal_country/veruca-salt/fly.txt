Twice bitten, twice baked.
Twice led down the same mistake.
Try me on a Saturday.
Try me. Try me.
Fine fool for a holiday.
Slow sun in a Spanish way.
One heart for one week of May.
Why me Why me
Twice given to yesterday.
Ripe for a foray with fate.
Fly me home to heaven's gate.
Fly me. Fly me. Fly.
Twice bitten, twice baked.
Twice led down the same mistake.
Try me on a Saturday.
Try me. Try me. Try me.
