This is my fav'rite disease.
I am sleepy with these dreams.
The TV is on.
It is seeping into me.
It is guiding my dreams.
It is only three,
so it's Jeopardy.
You can go and burst
my tiny bubble,
blow me off without a care
but I am sleeping where I want to.
This is my fav'rite time.
I can sleep until the phone rings,
and I doubt that it will.
You can go and burst
my tiny bubble,
blow me off without a care
but I am sleeping where I want to.
