I wind you up, 
then I wait here for the melancholy.
I give you up, 
while you sit here in all your glory.
I never thought you would, 
I never knew you could.
But now you're gone, 
and I don't think I care.
I sold your love down the river 
for a bow and arrow.
Euphoria has just been here 
and she's looking terrible.
I've never sunk this low, 
it's better if you go.
When you're nearby, 
I see you and want you to try..
to love me like a monster, 
one last time.
Control me like a father, 
one last time.
Stay with me till I'm stronger, 
one last round.
To kick me when I'm down, 
don't kick me when I'm down.
I never thought you would, 
I never understood.
And that's why I'm weak 
and I want you to try.
To make me an example, 
one last time.
To drag me through the cycle, 
one last time.
To make me a disciple, 
one last round..
will get me to the ground, 
you'll get me on the ground.
I'll see you around, 
yeah I'll see you around. 
One last time.
and I'll see you around, 
yeah I'll see you around.
