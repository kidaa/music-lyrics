Zero, one, two, three, 
four days without you. Eight, nine,
now we're five times two [x3]
Words won't do. 
Words won't do it. Words..
can't stay true. 
Words won't get me through it.
Honey please, seize me. 
I know what I need. Plan B,
some security. [x3]
Words won't do. 
Words won't do it. Words..
can't stay true. 
Words won't get me through it.
Don't make me prove it.
In the heat of the waiting, 
when I'm starting to stall.
I can see what you're saying, 
but I don't hear you at all.
I don't hear you at all [x5]
Words won't do. 
Words won't do it. Words..
can't stay true. 
Words won't get me through it.
Don't make me prove it.
Words won't do. 
Words won't do it. Words..
can't stay true. 
Words won't get me through it.
Don't make me prove it. [x4]
