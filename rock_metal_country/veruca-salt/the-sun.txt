Lighter than light
A feather
Floating into sight
Higher than I
Remember
I know you'll make it better
If I have to I will drive to the sea
To bring you to me

The sun
Rolling backwards
The day
Racing after
The wind
Rushing under
The night
Is the hardest time

So this is life
Together
The glamour and the grace
Brighter than bright
December
The winter on your face
And you're safe

The sun
Rolling backwards
The day
Racing after
The wind
Rushing under
The night
Is the hardest time

It's all right
It's ok
You're the master
It's all night
It's all day
It's all disaster
The saddest sound
Is down my hall
It's the saddest sound of all
I hear you scream
I hear you call

The sun
Rolling backwards
The day
Racing after
The wind
Rushing under
The night
Is the hardest time
