I'm just trying to live this life of mine.
The more I look the more I'm blind.
And all I ask for is peace of mind.
But all I want is a piece of you. A piece of you...
Well I lost my way today back home from work
the snow felt like dust, I felt like dirt.
Happens every time I start to search
for that long lost piece of you. A piece of you...
Well the last time I was sure of anything,
I sold my heart, I wore your ring.
And now the queen has lost her king.
And all I want is a piece of you.
