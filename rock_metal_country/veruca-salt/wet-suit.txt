roll the dice
now I wipe the tears from the skies
play your hand
how I love my marlboro man
say your prayers
cause you've got enemies everywhere
your wetsuit is keeping you warm
in your cold bed, I'll never be torn from you
try to keep it together
you try your best to forget her
silly me, always a sucker for monogamy
honesty seems to bring out the better in me
wish I knew another way to ruin the day for you
your wetsuit is keeping you warm
in your cold bed I'll never be torn from you
try to keep it together
you try your best to forget her
I just can't leave you this way
when you're not okay
trains will pass through here someday
and take you away
but you won't let me hit the ground
when my heart slows down
your wetsuit is keeping you warm
in your cold head I'll never be torn from you
try to keep it together
you try to keep it together
keep us together ahhhhh [x4]
