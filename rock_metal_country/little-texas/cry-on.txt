Track 10 - Time 3:07
There's been a chain of tears
That's been a-holdin' me here
'Cause you know how much I hate to see you cry
Well before I go
I just wanna let you know
This is the last time that you'll hear me say goodbye
So baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on
Every time before
When I was headed for the door
You misty eyes would always make me stay
This hurtin' you
Is somethin' I never wanna do
But you know you can't keep me here this way
So baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on
Yeah
Baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on
You know you're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on
You can just cry on
Yeah yeah you can just cry on
