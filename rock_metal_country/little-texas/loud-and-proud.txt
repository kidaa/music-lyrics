Porter Howell/Sam Gay
Track 1 - Time 3:30
Show me a mountain
Tell me it can't be climbed
I'll find my way through any shadow of doubt
And I'll meet you on the other side
I love a good challenge
Send them all my way
I'll rise to any occasion
I am not afraid 
To be loud and proud
And givin' in to nothin'
Livin' and a lovin'
I'll never get enough
And all the ups and downs
I take 'em as they come
And I'll be right here standing my ground
Loud and Proud
Now I'm not sayin'
That it ain't no way to be
But livin' inside the lines
Never did nothin' for me
Life is good
Cranked up to ten
Show me a place where the whole world stops
And I'll see it as a place to begin
'Cause I'm loud and proud
And givin' in to nothin'
Livin' and a lovin'
I'll never get enough
And all the ups and downs
I take 'em as they come
And I'll be right here standing my ground
Loud and Proud
I see no reason to hide under covers
Shy away from love
Because you might get burned
You never know what you might be missin'
Life is a mission
Far as I'm concerned
So live it loud and proud
Givin' in to nothin'
Livin' and a lovin'
I'll never get enough
And all the ups and downs
I take 'em as they come
And I'll be right here standing my ground
Yeah I'll be right here standing my ground
Loud and Proud
Loud and Proud
Yeah I'm Loud and Proud
Oh yeah
Loud and Proud
