Porter Howell/Dwayne O'Brien/Tom Shapiro
Track 2 - Time 3:15
You really got a good one in
You hit me where it hurts
Just so you wouldn't get the best of me
I fired back somethin' worse
I put you down
You show me up
Good for you
Good for me
Bad for us
We keep goin' around and 'round
When's it gonna stop
Real love's not a matter of
Who comes out on top
I won't back down
You won't give up
Good for you
Good for me
Bad for us
It's a game of who's to blame
And we're keepin' score
One of us wins the battle
We both lose the war
Still we won't say
Enough's enough
Good for you
Good for me
Bad for us
To proud to say
Enough's enough
Good for you
Good for me
Bad for us
Good for you
Good for me
Bad for us
