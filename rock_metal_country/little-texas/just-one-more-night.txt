Track 9 - Time 3:32
Although I know people change
I always thought we could stay the same
Now you wanna be on your own
I'm just someone that you've outgrown
So before you close that door
And say you don't love me anymore
I won't ask you not to leave
But there's one thing I need
Just one more night
A night to remember
Somethin' warm to hold when you're gone
And from now on
If love ever croses my mind
I'll think of you
It's just one more night
This is the night when we forget our love has died
It all fades away as your body touches mine
One more time
Another day is gone
Another night is comin' on
And I'll miss you more
Than the night before
It's just one more night
A night to remember
I remember that night every night since you've gone
And from now on
If love ever crosses my mind
I'll think of you
It's just one more night
It's just one more night
It's just one more night
A night to remember you by
It's just one more night
It's just one more night
