Porter Howell/Chuck Jones
Track 12 - Time 3:45
She cut her teeth on the Rollin' Stones
It's Only Rock 'n Roll was her favorite song
But these days she's had a little change of heart
Now she's into fiddle and slide guitar
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
It happened to her overnight
She woke up and saw the neon light
No one could have seen it comin'
She turned into a honky-tonk woman
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
All her old records are covered in dust
She's got her favorite country station on from dawn 'till dusk
Now head-banging slam-dancing ain't her thing
She says it ain't got nothin' if it ain't got twang
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
It happened to her overnight
She woke up and saw the neon light
No one could have seen it comin'
She turned into a honky-tonk woman
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
It happened to her overnight
She woke up and saw the neon light
No one could have seen it comin'
She turned into a honky-tonk woman
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
She used to be a rock 'n roll baby
But now she's country crazy
