You were never really mine, it's plain to see
But when you're in love
You believe almost anything
I never knew just how far I'd let myself go
Til I feel for a heart that was too hard to hold
Chorus:
I should have known you could break my heart
Should have known you could walk away
I should have known not to fall so far
Should have known it could end this way
Touch a raging fire and you're gonna get burned
But everybody has to love and learn
You showed me just how much I didn't know
About the ways that love can come and go
I'd have turned it around or found a way out
If I'd only known then what I know now
Chorus
Touch a raging fire and you're gonna get burned
But everybody has to love and learn
Everybody has to love and learn
