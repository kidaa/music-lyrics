Just like everyone else
I've seen hard times, they come and they go
When all the work I put in
Just doesn't work out there's one thing I know.
Chorus:
Cause the only thing I'm sure of
Is I don't know what I'd do without your love.
You and me together will always be enough
From now until forever even when times get rough
I know that I can depend on your love
And that's the only thing I'm sure of.
I been losing my mind
Breaking my back since I don't know when
When I finally get home
the next thing I know I'm leaving again.
Just when I think that I'm gonna quit it
You're the one that keeps pulling me through.
Chorus
If it all starts to fall down around me
You'll be standing right here by my side.
Chorus
I know that I can depend on your love
And that's the only thing I'm sure of
