Track 1 - Time 3:42
My daddy always a gentle man
Never the kind to ever force his hand
He would always be the last one to raise his voice
If anybody ever put us down
Well you can bet that he would stand his ground
Then he would tell me son sometimes you got no choice
You've got to kick at little and cause a stir
Sometimes you got to make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
Yeah you got to kick a little and be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you want to finish last
You've got to kick a little
Some people judge you by the way you look
They see you once and say you ain't no good
Feels like they're never goona take you for who you are
That's when you have to stand up and be strong
And go the extra mile to prove 'em all wrong
Just remember when they push you way too far
You've got to kick at little and cause a stir
Sometimes you got to make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
Yeah you got to kick a little and be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you want to finish last
You've got to kick a little
You've got to kick at little and cause a stir
Sometimes you got to make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
Yeah you got to kick a little and be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you want to finish last
You've got to kick a little
