Track 6 - Time 
Heaven knows life's got its twists and turns
Walls to climb over and bridges that burn
But if you were lost on the other side
I'd walk straight through the fire
All in the line of love
If your darkest fears from your wildest dreams
Ever come for you they'll have to go through me
To keep you safe from the world outside
I would stand and fight
All in the line of love
Right from the start
When I gave you my heart
I made a promise I'll keep for all time
Girl I do what I do
Only for you
I'd even lay down my life
And never ask why
'Cause it's all in the line of love
I'd give up my dreams watch 'em all fade
Take what I had and give it all away
For one more day with you by my side
I'd trade my hopes and desires
All in the line of love
Right from the start
When I gave you my heart
I made a promise I'll keep for all time
Girl I do what I do
Only for you
I'd even lay down my life
And never ask why
'Cause it's all in the line of love
Girl I do what I do
Only for you
I'd even lay down my life
And never ask why
'Cause it's all in the line of love
