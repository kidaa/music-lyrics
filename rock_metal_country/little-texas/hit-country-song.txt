Track 9 - Time 3:01
Babies and puppies and high school football games
Veterans and factories and fresh fields of hay
Grandma and Grandpa just rockin' along
I am a hit country song
Rifles, gunracks and old pick-up trucks
Winos and hobos that ran out of luck
A cafe on Main Street that's been there so long
I am a hit country song
A jukebox and a barstool and old faded love
Mama and Papa, and the good Lord above
Radios and rodeos, horses and trains
The old West, the homeless, neon and rain
Cheaters and lovers and bein' alone
I am a hit country song
A jukebox and a barstool and old faded love
Mama and Papa, and the good Lord above
A good dog and a good cause
And a good love gone wrong
I am a hit country song
I am a hit country song
