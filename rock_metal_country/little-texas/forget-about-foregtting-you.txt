You'd think that I'd have better things to do
than to sit around and think of you
After what you put me through
Oh, you'd think baby after all this time
I wouldn't let you cross my mind
And break my heart in two.
Chorus:
and Lookin' back I see clearly now
I always thought that someday
I'd get over you somehow.
But your memory stays
It just won't go away
I've done all that I can do.
I should just forget about forgetting you.
I thought that I could make it on my own,
I could learn to live my live alone.
But time has only proved me wrong
Oh, I thought that I could find somebody new
To help to get me over you,
But I'm still hangin' on.
Chorus
But your memory stays
It just won't go away
I've done all that I can do
I should just forget about forgetting you.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah.
