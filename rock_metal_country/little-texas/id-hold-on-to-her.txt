Track 2 - Time 3:04
Guess I had my chance
My one shot at true romance
Only a fool would let it slip through his hands
So take it from the one
Who dreams about the way things were
If I were you I'd hold on to her
I've known her long enough
I've seen her eyes when she's in love
And I can tell that you're all that she's thinkin' of
So take it from the one
Who dreams about the way things were
If I were you I'd hold onto her
Now she's just beautiful words
On a page I have turned
And I'm longing to hold her
And tryin' to get over a bridge that I shouln't have burned
If I were you I'd hold onto her
So just treat her right
Keep her safe and warm at night
Give her your love and you'll have the love of your life
Just take it from the one
Who dreams about the way things were
If I were you I'd hold on to her
If I were you I'd hold on
