Track 10 - Time 3:07
If I don't get enough of you
I can't think I can't sleep
If I don't get enough of you
I can't eat I get weak
Without you there to hold me tight
I can't make it through the night
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I don't get enough of you
If I don't get enough of you
I don't act like I should
If I don't get enough of you
It's a fact I'm no good
I'm bringin' everybody down
I ain't no fun to be around
I don't like the man I turn into
If I don't get enough of you
You've done somethin' to me
It just took one touch
Your love goes right through me
And I can't get too much
If I don't get enough of you
Get my time get my share
If I don't get enough of you
Seems like life just ain't fair
Why should I have to do without
You're all I ever think about
Nothin' else is gonna do
If I don't get enough of you
You've done somethin' to me
It just took one touch
Your love goes right through me
And I can't get too much
If I don't get enough of you
I can't think I can't sleep
If I don't get enough of you
I can't eat I get weak
Without you there to hold me tight
I can't make it through the night
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I don't get enough of you
You know I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I don't get enough of you
