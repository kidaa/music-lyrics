Track 4 - Time 2:55
You roll out your red carpet
Say welcome to my love
Lately I've been wonderin'
If you're gonna roll it back up
With every hungry kiss
From your sweet lips
Baby you lift my feet off the ground
You got me rockin' in a cradle of love
And I don't want to fall out now
'Cause it's a long way down
Up here on the wire
The further out I get
The more you keep remindin' me
I'm workin' without a net
With every hungry kiss
From your sweet lips
Baby you lift my feet off the ground
You got me rockin' in a cradle of love
And I don't want to fall out now
'Cause it's a long way down
Oh yeah
Sampson had Delilah
Well Adam he had Eve
Darlin' please please tell me
What you got up your sleeve
With every hungry kiss
From your sweet lips
Baby you lift my feet off the ground
You got me rockin' in a cradle of love
And I don't want to fall out now
With every hungry kiss
From your sweet lips
Baby you lift my feet off the ground
You got me rockin' in a cradle of love
And I don't want to fall out now
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
