Track 8 - Time 4:23
I know you're hurtin'
Feelin' uncertain
'Cause love's never happened
Like you hoped it would
So scared of trying
It's just the fear of flyin'
You say you're through with takin' chances
For good
You can run but you can't hide
You can keep it all inside
Take it from a fool who's tried it all
Pay attention to a friend
Who swore he'd never fall again
You're gonna answer
When you get the call
When love finds you
Sneaks up behind you
With eyes that see through
All of your charades
You can't deny it
So don't even try it
Love's gonna change you
No matter what you say
You can run but you can't hide
You can keep it all inside
Take it from a fool who's tried it all
Pay attention to a friend
Who swore he'd never fall again
You're gonna answer
When you get the call
You never know for sure
Where that love might be
Halfway around the world
Or in the heart of a friend like me
You can run but you can't hide
You can keep it all inside
Take it from a fool who's tried it all
Pay attention to a friend
Who swore he'd never fall again
You're gonna answer
When you get the call
Oh you're gonna answer
When you get the call
You're gonna answer
When you get the call
