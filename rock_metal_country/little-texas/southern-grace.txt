Track 4 - Time 5:42
First time I felt the magic of her kiss
Was under a Carolina moon
Sweet Southern style
Tender but a little wild
For me no other love will ever do
Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace
You should see the way she walks into a room
It's almost like her feet don't touch the floor
But when the chips are down
Her feet are firmly on the ground
I could never ask for any more
Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace
She's got me fallin' in her eyes again tonight
Lost in lovin' arms as the world goes by
Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman
There ain't nothing like a woman
No there ain't nothing like my woman
Southern grace
