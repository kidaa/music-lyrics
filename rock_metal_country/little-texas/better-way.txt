Track 7 - Time 3:36
It's only been a week
But I ain't had no sleep
Since you've been gone
I thought I was strong enough to take it
But I'm too weak to make it on my own
I still curse the day
I let you walk away
That's right where I went wrong
Well I'm losing sanity
I made a fool of me
Now you're gone
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
Than to sit here thinkin' about you all the time
Listenin' to these sad sad songs
Mixin' memories with old forgotten wine
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
I could paint circles
'Round the rainbows
In the sky
I could wipe away
The shadows of doubt
Weepin' in your eyes
I could even walk on water
And soar were eagles dare to fly
Dare to fly
Or go bathin' in the beauty of my sorrows
On an early mornin' high
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
Than to sit here thinkin' about you all the time
Listenin' to these sad sad songs
Mixin' memories with old forgotten wine
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
Listenin' to these sad sad songs
Mixin' memories with old forgotten wine
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
There's got to be a better way to lose my mind
