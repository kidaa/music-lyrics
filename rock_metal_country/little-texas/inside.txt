Track 7 - Time 3:25
Down a winding gravel road
There's an old country church
A stranger who just passes by
Will never know it's worth
But you can walk in any Sunday
And it'll open up your eyes
So much love is in there waiting
But you have to look inside
A man out on the street knows more
Than we will ever learn
About how cold the world can be
And how our backs can turn
You can walk right up and ask him
What went wrong with his life
But you'll never know the answer
Until you look inside
Inside all of us
There's a good no one sees
Outside we may not show it
But it can bring us to our knees
When we realize what's been missin'
Has been there all the time
We have never seen it
'Cause we've never looked inside
Sometimes I may seem distant
Like I'm not really there
You see a wall around me
And you think that I don't care
But my love for you runs deeper
Than words can describe
My heart is always open
Just take a look inside
Inside all of us
There's good no one sees
Outside we may not show it
But it can bring us to our knees
When we realize what's been missin'
Has been there all the time
We have never seen it
'Cause we've never looked inside
We will never see it
Until we look inside
