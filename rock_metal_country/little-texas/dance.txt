Porter Howell/Dwayne O'Brien
Track 6 - Time 2:58
Take your time and watch your step
You'd better get it right
Or you'll get left behind
The way you're dancin' I can tell
That someone else is on your mind
You'd better dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better hold on to the one that loves you
You'd better turn around before we're through
And dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better dance
And that sparkle in your wanderin' eye
Has struck you blind as far as I can see
Take one step back and look again
You're gonna leave with him
Or stay with me
You'd better dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better hold on to the one that loves you
You'd better turn around before we're through
And dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better dance
Well now we've gone this long
Don't let it slip through your hands
Dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better hold on to the one that loves you
You'd better turn around before we're through
And dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better hold on to the one that loves you
You'd better turn around before we're through
And dance with the one that brung ya
You'd better dance
Yeah
