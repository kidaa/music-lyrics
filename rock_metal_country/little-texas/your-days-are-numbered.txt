Porter Howell/Dwayne O'Brien
Track 6 - Time 3:29
She cries and tells me she needs your love
And that's she's not giving up so easily
She tries to hold on to promises
I can't help but wish she was holdin' on to me
Your days with her are numbered
You're running out of time
She's been cryin' on my shoulder
And it won't be long 'til she's mine
So leave - leave her alone again
She knows where you've been she's not blind
They say that misery loves company
An one day she'll come to me and she won't cry
Your days with her are numbered
You're running out of time
She's been cryin' on my shoulder
And it won't be long 'til she's mine
Now I learn how to love her
As you drive her away
So I'll just dry her eyes and count the days
Until she's mine to stay
Your days with her are numbered
And it won't be long 'til she's mine
No it won't be long 'til she's mine
