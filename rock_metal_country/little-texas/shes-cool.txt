I'm here to tell you it might sound strange
She's on a different groove
Her state of mind is subject to change
She's got an attitude
She's cool
Ain't no doubt about it
She's cool
Gotta shout about it
She's cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She never walks she knows how to fly
You got to take my word

Just like a mockingbird
She's cool
Saying it again
She's cool
Something in the wind
She's cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She won't stay the night
She won't give in
She's gonna do what's right
Oh, she's so cool
She's cool
Hangin' on the wire
She's cool
Dancin' in a fire
She's cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
