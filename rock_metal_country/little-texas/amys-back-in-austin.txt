Track 3 - Time 4:36
We left Texas on a windy night
In a beat-up Chevy van
We loaded it up with our innocent dreams
And all the love we had
We didn't know then how hard it was
Livin' on our own
I'd find her cryin' late at night
Talkin' to the folks back home
I wonder what went wrong
And where is she now I'd love to know
I bet Amy's back in Austin
Workin' at the LaZona Rosa Cafe
I remember the night we lost it
And the day she went away
Was it the angry words or did she miss her momma
I don't know but it don't feel right
I bet Amy's back in Austin
And I'm missin' her tonight
Workin' ten hours in a West Coast sun
Can make the days so long
And watchin' the moon crashin' into the ocean
Alone sure gets old
I remember how sweet it was
Where is she now I need to know
I bet Amy's back in Austin
Workin' at the LaZona Rosa Cafe
I remember the night we lost it
And the day she went away
Was it the angry words or did she miss her momma
I don't know but it don't feel right
I bet Amy's back in Austin
And I'm missin' her tonight
Could this desert wind
Carry me back again
With my heart in my hand
Baby, baby I'm missin' you
Was it the angry words or did she miss her momma
I don't know but it don't feel right
I bet Amy's back in Austin
And I'm missin' her missin' her tonight
Oh I bet Amy's back in Austin
I bet Amy's back in Austin
I bet Amy's back in Austin
I bet Amy's back in Austin
I bet Amy's back in Austin
I bet Amy's back in Austin
