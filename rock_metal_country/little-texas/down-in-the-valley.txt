Track 3 - Time 2:00
Well it's six o'clock in the morning
And the sun is on the rise
I been sittin' here drinkin
All through the night
What in the world am I gonna do
Now that I don't have you
Well I ain't able to get you off my mind
Well the grass couldn't be any bluer
You can hear the weepin' willow cry
And the sky has slowly gotten closer
Down in the valley with a Rocky Mountain high
Well the moon will always climb
Over the top of the hill
The rain will always die
Give it time I know it will
But this storm within my soul
It will never die I know
Nobody will ever know just how I feel
Well the grass couldn't be any bluer
You can hear the weepin' willow cry
And the sky hass slowly gotten closer
Down in the valley with a Rocky Mountain high
Well the grass couldn't be any bluer
You can hear the weepin' willow cry
And the sky has slowly gotten closer
Down in the valley with a Rocky Mountain high
Alright
