Sure I think about you now and then
But it's been a long, long time.
I've got a good life now, I've moved on
So when you cross my mind....
Chorus:
I, So, And try not to think about
What might have been
'Cause that was then
And we've taken different roads
We can't go back again, there's no use giving in
And there's no way to know
What Might Have Been.
We could sit and talk about this all night long,
And wonder why we didn't last
Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know
But we'll have to leave them in the past.
Chorus
That same old look in your eyes
It's a beautiful night
I'm so tempted to stay
But too much time has gone by
We should just say goodbye
And turn and walk away.
Chorus
No, we'll never know
