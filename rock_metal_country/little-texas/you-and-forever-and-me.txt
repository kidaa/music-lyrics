Porter Howell/Stewart Harris
Track 4 - Time 3:44
The moon is off my shoulder
The sun is in my eyes
Almost to my hometown
It's just another mile
Memories surround me
Of an old familar time
Life was simple then
When your love was mine
There's a cool wind 
On the desert tonight
I can almost see your golden hair
Flyin' in the moonlight
And ooo it was a restless kinda free
When it was you and forever and me
I pull off the highway
On your side of town
Make the turn past the railroad tracks
As the sun goes down
I remember how you would wait
By the front porch light
You were always ready
To take a midnight ride
There's a cool wind 
On the desert tonight
I can almost see your golden hair
Flyin' in the moonlight
And ooo it was a restless kinda free
When it was you and forever and me
Sometimes love gets lost
And it's never found
But I just had to see
If you're still around
There's a cool wind 
On the desert tonight
I can almost see your golden hair
Flyin' in the moonlight
And ooo it was a restless kinda free
When it was you and forever and me
Ooo it was a restless kinda free
When it was you and forever and me
