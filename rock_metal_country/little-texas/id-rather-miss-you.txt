Porter Howell/Dwayne O'Brien
Track 8 - Time 3:58
I could forget you
I could make new plans
Find someone to help me
Spend this time on my hands
I could pick up the pieces
Even fall in love again
But until I do
I'd rather miss you
And live with the memories
The nights when you held me
Will carry me through
And if I have to choose
Between living without you
And learning to love someone new
Then I'd rather miss you
From the first time I saw you
'Til the day we said goodbye
You were the best thing
Ever walked into my life
So I'll just keep waiting
Hoping you'll come back again
But until you do
I'd rather miss you
And live with the memories
The nights when you held me
Will carry me through
And if I have to choose
Between living without you
And learning to love someone new
Then I'd rather miss you
And if I have to choose
Between living without you
And learning to love someone new
Then I'd rather miss you
Then I'd rather miss you
Then I'd rather miss you
