Track 5 - Time 3:23
So you think I'll be alright
And I'll forget you in time
And I won't want you here with me every night
And we can still be friends once in a while
Think again
'Cause maybe you're wrong
How can I just be friends
With someone I've loved for so long
What were you thinkin'
When you turned your back and walked away
Who do you think you're leavin'
Did you think I'd let it end this way
What were you thinkin'
If you're gonna break my heart
You'll have to do it the hard way
And if you're really gonna tear us apart
Can't you think of something better to say
Than you'll always love me
But you need some time
You're only trying tell me goodbye
Stop tryin' to be so kind
What were you thinkin'
When you turned your back and walked away
Who do you think you're leavin'
Did you think I'd let it end this way
What were you thinkin'
I would never want to leave you
But if I were to leave you
I would never leave this way
How could you leave me this way
What were you thinkin'
When you turned your back and walked away
Who do you think you're leavin'
Did you think I'd let it end this way
What were you thinkin'
What were you thinkin'
Baby what were you thinkin'
