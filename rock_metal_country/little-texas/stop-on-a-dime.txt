Start out easy, take it slow
Once you get started
You don't know where love will go
But you think you're ready for another time around
It's nothing you can't handle
And you think you've got it down.
Chorus:
So/Cause you fall in love and it picks you up
And it takes your heart for a ride
After too many bad roads this heartbroken fool knows
That love can stop on a dime.
Next thing you know, you've gone too fast
And you'd do anything just to try to make it last
But you keep on going even though you see the signs
Still believing that it won't go wrong this time
Chorus
Now it's over, said and done
Just another love you thought would be the one
You don't know where you're going
But you don't like where you've been
You try to tell yourself you won't go back again
Chorus
