Track 8 - Time 3:40
I've been sittin' at home
All alone
Feeling sorry for myself
Since my baby's been gone
Now it's an everyday thing
But tonight it's gonna change
I've got to get out
Lord it's been way to long
I need a night I'll never remember
To take this load off of me
Put some living back in my life
Get out in the bright lights
Shake her memory free
If I have to spend my last two dollars
I'm gonna get where I want to be
I spent the whole day trying to forget her
I need a night I'll never remember
I'm gonna call my friends
I'm getting out again
Let everybody know
I'm still alive
We're gonna dance all night
Just like old times
I might miss her in the morning
But tonight I'm gonna let it ride
I need a night I'll never remember
To take this load off of me
Put some living back in my life
Get out in the bright lights
Shake her memory free
If I have to spend my last two dollars
I'm gonna get where I want to be
I spent the whole day trying to forget her
I need a night I'll never remember
I'm goin' to turn it up pour it on drag it out
Go till I forget about the way things were
Only one thing that can stop me now
I hope I don't run into her
If I have to spend my last two dollars
I'm gonna get where I want to be
I spent the whole day trying to forget her
I need a night I'll never remember
Yeah, I spent the whole day trying to forget her
I need a night I'll never remember
