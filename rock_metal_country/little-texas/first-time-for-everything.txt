Porter Howell/Dwayne O'Brien
Track 2 - Time 4:01
I don't stay out all night
I don't close down the bars
And I don't make a fool of myself
Well, I don't drink too much
And I don't get too loud
And I don't ever raise too much hell
But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That I haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what I might do
'Cause if I've learned anything
There's a first time for everything
I don't call up old flames
'Cause I don't have a blackbook
I don't spend all my time in the past
I don't wake up with strangers
'Cause I don't sleep around
No I don't believe in love that won't last
But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That I haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what I might do
'Cause if I've learned anything
There's a first time for everything
Yeah yeah
When I somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what I might do
'Cause if I've learned anything
There's a first time for everything
Yeah yeah
'Cause if I've learned anything
There's a first time for everything
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
