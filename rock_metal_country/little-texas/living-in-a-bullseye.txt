Track 7 - Time 3:10
One two three four
I heard the whistle blowin' as I pulled in the gate
I knew without lookin' I was already late
Prayin' the boss wouldn't catch me again
Sweatin' bullets while I was sneakin' in
I'm livin in a bullseye ground zero
It's kinda scary when the arrows fly
I ain't tryin' to be no superhero
I duck and cover just to stay alive
Livin' in a bullseye
Eight hours later at a half past five
I'm listenin' to my radio and pullin' in the drive
The music tellin' me a thing that's good
So I'm crossin' all my fingers and I'm knockin on wood
'Cause I'm livin in a bullseye ground zero
It's kinda scary when the arrows fly
I ain't tryin' to be no superhero
I duck and cover just to stay alive
You know I'm livin' in a bullseye
I know the minute that I get home
I finally made it through the danger zone
The part of my day that I love the best
When her lovin' wraps around me like a bullet-proof vest
'Cause I'm livin in a bullseye ground zero
It's kinda scary when the arrows fly
I ain't tryin' to be no superhero
I duck and cover just to stay alive
Livin' in a bullseye ground zero
It's kinda scary when the arrows fly
I ain't tryin' to be no superhero
I duck and cover just to stay alive
Livin' in a bullseye
