Dwayne O'Brien/Jim Rushing
Track 9 - Time 3:22
For all of my good intentions
Heartfelt every one
I've left so much love unspoken
So much of life I've left undone
I could've made a difference
I just never made the time
Now yesterday's gone forever
And today ain't far behind
Should've taken that job in Dallas
Or the one in San Antone
Should've left that girl in the city
And married the one back home
I'd love to run back through the years
To tell her I was blind
But yesterday's gone forever
And today ain't far behind
Let go
Got to let it go
Wishing wouldn't change it anyhow
I know
I got to let 'em know
All I can ever hope to change is here and now
So when I wake up tomorrow mornin'
Gonna finally make the time
Tell some people how much I love them
And that I've made up my mind
To make the most of every moment
Really live while I'm alive
'Cause yesterday's gone forever
And today ain't far behind
Yesterday's gone forever
And today ain't far behind
