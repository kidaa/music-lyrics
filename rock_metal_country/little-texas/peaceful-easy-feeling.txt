Track 10 - Time 4:18
I like the way your sparklin' earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Oh but she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go
And I got a peaceful, easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and friend
But this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing I'm already standing
Yes I'm already standing on the ground
