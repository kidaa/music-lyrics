Too country what's that 
Is it like too Republican or too Democrat 
Is it too far to the left 
Too far to the right 
Too straight down the middle 
Is it too black or too white 

Are the biscuits too fluffy is the chicken too fried 
Is the gravy too thick are the peas too black-eyed 
Is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang 
Are there too many lemons in mama's lemon meringue 

Too country what's that 
It is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpa's old hat 
Is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique 
Is the question too strong or the answer too weak 

Are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright 
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night 
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream 
Is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too clean 

Is the grace too amazing is the steeple too tall 
Are there too many "yes sir's", "yes ma'am's" 
And "how're y'all's" 
Is the message too real too close to the bone 
Do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home 
Is honest and true just not in demand 
Too country 
Too country 
Too country 
I don't understand
