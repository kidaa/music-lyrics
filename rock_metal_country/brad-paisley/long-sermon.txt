They've read the scripture, they've passed the plate 
And we're both prayin' he don't preach late 
But he's gettin' "Amens," and that's just our luck 
Yeah, it's eighty-five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up 

Chorus
Oh you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun 
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat'll run 
I tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith 
Like a long sermon on a pretty Sunday 

Well it's been rainin' all week long 
I woke up this mornin', the dark clouds were gone 
We've both been raised not to miss church 
But on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts 

Chorus 

See that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass 
How much longer is this gonna last 

Chorus
