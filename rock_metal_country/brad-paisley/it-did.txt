A single red rose and a table for two
A nice chardonay and an ocean view
Ships comin in and stars comin out
We sat and we talked till the place closed down
Then we took a long walk down on the beach
Her in that white dress and her bare feet
We stopped and we watched the lighthouse light
And pulled her close and i held on tight
And i said to myself
It doesnt get better than this
No it doesnt get better than this

And it did
It did
Whoa it did

Fastforeward to that next spring
We were lookin for a preacher
Pickin out rings
Family comin in and friends comin out
To that white church on the outskirts of town
Me in that tux fightin butterflies
Tears of joy in the mommas eyes
Her daddy walkin her down the aisle
He lifted that veil and i saw that smile
And i said
To myself
It doesnt get better than this

No it doesnt get better than this

But it did
It did
Oh it did

Just when i start thinkin its as good as it can get
This crazy life does somethin just to let me know
I haven't seen anything yet

Nine months later nearly to the day
There we were flyin down the interstate
Car weavin in and car weavin out
Through traffic runnin every red light in town
Delivery room and the doctor comes in
I'm right beside and shes squeezin my hand
One more push and a baby cries
Sweet little angel with his momma's eyes
And i said
To myself
It doesnt get better than this
No it doesnt get better than this

But it did
It did
Oh it did
Yes it did
