West Texas forecast more of the same 
Sunny and mild no chance of rain 
That old John Deere tractor ain't moved in days 
Oh, but he's out there climbin' back on 
Because he's yet to admit that his crops are all gone 

She stares out the window fightin' back tears 
And watches him wastin' his time in the fields 
They're havin' problems payin' the bills 
And she knows that it won't be long 
Before the bank finally places a lien on the farm 

Chorus
And the tractor keeps rollin' 
The dust rises high 
Creating the only cloud in the sky 
He's holdin' his ground 
But it's gettin' tough 
He's keepin' his faith 
In the Lord up above 
And prayin' for rain 
Through a cloud of dust 

Yesterday somethin' in town caught his eye 
The old hardware store had a help wanted sign 
He thought about stoppin' but he drove on by 
'Cause he just can't bear to let go 
After all it's the only life he's ever known 

Chorus 

Yeah, he's holdin' his ground 
But it's gettin' tough 
He's keepin' his faith 
In the Lord up above 
And prayin' for rain 
Through a cloud of dust 

West Texas forecast more of the same 
Sunny and mild no chance of rain
