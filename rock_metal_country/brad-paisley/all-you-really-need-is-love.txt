So you say you wanna tie the knot 
And you're askin' me if I think that the two of you have got 
What it takes to make it work 
Well one thing's for sure 
All you really need is love 

Let me say I'm happy for you both 
And here's a little something that the two of you should know 
If you want to do it right 
Just take my advice 
All you really need is love 

And a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations 
A minister, a white dress, and of course a congregation 
And flowers and music and candles and cake 
And a bunch of rice for folks to throw as you drive away 

Now what's that expression on your face 
You're lookin' kind of pale, is everything OK 
Don't worry you'll be fine 
If you just keep in mind 
All you really need is love 

And bridesmaids and groomsmen and a wedding coordinator 
And food for the reception, you'll need someone to cater 
Did I forget to mention it'll take a couple rings 
And of course a P.A. system if you're wantin' me to sing 

Now you look so happy you could cry 
And that explains the tear drops I see wellin' in your eyes 
Don't worry you'll be fine 
If you just keep in mind 
All you really need is love 

I'm sure I'm tellin' you something you already knew 
All you really need is love
