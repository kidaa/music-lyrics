I remember working on a rooftop
In the hot summer sun all day
Now I work two hours a night
It feels a lot more like play

'Fore Kenny joined the band
He used to hang dry wall
Ben worked down at Valentino's
So when you see us up here and think
Man they're lucky
You don't have to tell us 'cause we know

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're laughing all the way to the bank
'Cause it all just seems so funny
A bunch of guys like us
In a big tour bus
Making that easy money

Desperado hauled cattle
Grady drove trucks
Justin had a hot dog stand
Kevin sold records
And Brent sold shoes
And Gary was a garbage man

[Repeat chorus]

I used to have an ex-girlfriend
That didn't understand
She said boy you're going nowhere fast
You oughta get a real job
Why don't you quit that band
Now she can kiss my backstage pass

[Repeat chorus 2x]
