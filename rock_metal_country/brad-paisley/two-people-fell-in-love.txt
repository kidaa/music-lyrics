A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room 
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon 
'Fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May 
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things 
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives 
The world's a better place for all he's done 
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive 
It's all because two people fell in love 

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek 
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans 
The whole Wilson family's lined up fillin' their paper plates 
They've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states 
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew 
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one 
Now five generations get together every June 
All because two people fell in love 

1st Chorus 
There ain't nothin' not affected 
When two hearts get connected 
All that is, will be, or ever was 
Every single choice we make 
Every breath we get to take 
Is all because two people fell in love 

Well, I recall a young man who was driftin' aimlessly 
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be 
But in a little caf right off of fourteenth avenue 
With a whole lotta help from up above 
We met and things sure turned around for me and you 
And all because two people fell in love 

2nd Chorus 
Baby, there ain't nothin' not affected 
When two hearts get connected 
All that is, will be, or ever was 
I'm glad your dad could not resist 
Your mama's charms and you exist 
All because two people fell in love 

Tag 
You know, to me it's all so clear 
Every one of us is here 
All because two people fell in love 

A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room 
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
