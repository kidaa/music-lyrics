Finally got that promotion I worked hard to get
One that came with a company car
When they gave me the keys they said son you can bet
Keep it up and you'll really go far

[Chorus]
But what good is all that knowin'
The best thing that I had goin'
Is gone

My good friends come around to hang out now and then
And they joke, man you've sure got it hard
With this house on the hill and a white picket fence
And the grass sure is green in the yard

[Repeat chorus]

Well I squandered my time trying to buy everything
Gave her all that I thought she deserved
Now I know all the things that she wanted were free
And I should have been home holdin' her

[Repeat chorus]
