There ain't a woman in the world that wants to hear the word yes
When she asks if you think that she looks chubby in that dress
And if she cooks all day you better eat it with a smile
It doesn't matter if it tastes just like bad gravy on a Goodyear tire

Yeah, yeah, yeah all right so you bend the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin' that you'll have to get use to

[Chorus]
'Cause that's love you'll see
We all commit a little bit of perjury
Ah but that's no crime if you ask me, that's love
You're starin' at a burnt steak 
You bite the bullet and you clean your plate
And then you go on and on about how great it was
That's not a lie, that's love

Well it's the very same thing that she does for you
When she doesn't bring up the fifteen pounds that you need to lose
And every time she runs her fingers through your hair
And she says she kinda likes the way there's not as much of it there

Yeah, yeah, yeah well all right so she bends the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin' that you have to get use to

[Repeat chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah well all right so you bend the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin' that you'll both gonna do

'Cause that's love you'll see
We all commit a little bit of perjury
You say I like it when your momma comes to visit us
That's not a lie, that's not a lie, that's love
