Every day  I clock out 
And head straight to her house 
We cuddle up on the couch 
But it always ends the same ole way 
I'm drivin' home and it's incredibly late 
Something's got to change, 'cause 

I've been wrapped around her finger 
Since the first time we went out 
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me 
When the lights go out 
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger 
I'm wrapped around 

Went to the bank took out a loan 
Went and bought the perfect stone 
Called up her dad on the phone 
I'm takin' him to dinner Sunday night 
I've never been so nervous in my life 
I want to do this right, 'cause 

I've been wrapped around her finger 
Since the first time we went out 
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me 
When the lights go out 
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger 
I'm wrapped around 

Yes sir I love her very much 
I know it's only been seven months 
But that's long enough 

I've been wrapped around her finger 
Since the first time we went out 
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me 
When the lights go out 
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger 
I'm wrapped around 

I think it's time to put a ring on the finger 
I'm wrapped around
