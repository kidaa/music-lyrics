O they tell me of a home far beyond the sky
O they tell me of a land far away
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O the land of the cloudless day
O the land of the uncloudy day
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
