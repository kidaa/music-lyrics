Hollywood never fails to make a sequel 
For each and every movie that does well 
Why can't love be more like that 
Where the best ones get a second chance 
And that way though you're gone 
It wouldn't be that long 'til 

I'd see you in part two 
And we'd pick up where we left off 
When I lost you 
And we'd fall in love again 
And change the way the story ends 
Yeah, we'd bring back me and you 
In part two 

Lookin' back we had so much to look forward to 
The kind of love that deserves to be continued 
And if this were only Tinseltown 
By now they would have figured out 
A way for you and I 
To give it one more try and 

I'd see you in part two 
And we'd pick up where we left off 
When I lost you 
And we'd fall in love again 
And change the way the story ends 
Yeah, we'd bring back me and you 
In part two 

Yeah, we'd fall in love again 
And change the way the story ends 
Yeah, we'd bring back me and you 
In part two
