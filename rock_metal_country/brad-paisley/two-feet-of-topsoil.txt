Yesterday I thought that I was low as I could get 
I had hit rock bottom ever since you up and left 
But this morning when I saw you with 
Somebody else, well needless to say 
That's when I started sinking even lower 
And as far as where I am at today 

There's two feet of topsoil 
A little bit of bedrock, limestone in between 
A fossilized dinosaur 
A little patch of crude oil 
A thousand feet of granite underneath 
Then there's me 

I was kinda hopin' I could dig my way back out 
A couple dozen roses maybe get you back somehow 
But the love in your eyes as you talked to him 
Today was plain to see 
So I ain't gonna get involved, but 
Should you change your mind 
Well you know right where I'll be 

There's two feet of topsoil 
A little bit of bedrock, limestone in between 
A fossilized dinosaur 
A little patch of crude oil 
A thousand feet of granite underneath 
Then there's me
