Well hey, hey Mr. Policeman 
Bet I can drive faster'n you can 
C'mon hoss lets have some fun 
Go on shoot me with a radar gun 
You look bored and I sure am 
Catch me if you can 
Hey hey mr. policeman 
I got a 75 firebird trans am 
With a 455 up under the hood 
Me and my brother got it runnin good 
Wake up behind me in a mole grey van 
Catch me if you can 
Go on turn on your blue lights sooo pretty! 
You know you want to I just flew by 
I can see you feel it now 
Hows my dust taste in your mouth? 
C'mon smokey its time to race 
Lets have us a high speed chase 
Well hey hey mr. policeman 
Chopper in the air and a couple of swat vans 
That's not fair they're blockin the road 
Now where am I supposed to go? 
Time to use my backup plan 

Catch me if you can 
Hey hey mr. policeman 
Bet I can run faster'n you can 
With your big pot belly 
And your cowboy boots, 
100 bucks says you won't shoot 
I know these woods like the back of my hand 
Come on catch me if you can 
Go on turn on your spotlight sooo shiny!! 
I got runnin shoes and im younger than you 
And I got all night 
Theres no way you're keepin up with me 
Just go on back to the Krispy Kreme 
If you wanna quit I understand 
Catch me if you can 
Hey hey mr. policeman 
I said hey hey mr. policeman 

Im in the jailhouse now 
I'm in the jailhouse now 
They told me once or twice 
Son, please respect my authority 
I'm in the jailhouse now
