Darlin' I've been standin' here just watchin' you all night 
And I think I've even caught you watchin' me a couple times 
If I don't ask I'll never know 
This may sound dumb, but here we go 
Do you believe in love at first sight 

Me neither 
I'm glad that we agree 
Believe me 
That's a big relief 
Well, this place is awful crowded 
And this music is so loud 
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat 
Me neither 

It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast 
I was only checkin', that's the reason that I asked 
Relationships need time to grow 
You and I should take this slow 
And darlin' tell me, would you like to dance 

Me neither 
I was just bein' polite 
Thank goodness 
My feet are much too tired 
I'm sure you're tired too 
I can see an empty booth 
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while 
Me neither 
We'd never get along 
I'm thinkin' there's no chemistry at all 
This has been a waste of time 
And I'm runnin' outta lines 
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song 
Me neither
