You may think I'm wrong for you 
And you're wrong for me
To look at us on paper 
I would have to agree
It could have been the moon light
Or it could have been the wine 
But the way that we were acting 
Hell it could have been the moon shine 

And oh we're do we go from here
I don't know 
But baby one thing's clear
Some mistakes are too much fun
To only make once

There's this little straight stretch 
Just south of here
It's great for mashing down the gas 
And trying out fifth gear
But it's also a speed trap
Twice I've gotten caught
But something bout it calls to me 
And I can't seem to stop

And oh you have the same effect
I know I'll just keep coming back
Some mistakes are too much fun
To only make once

Well there are things in life that I regret 
And even more that haven't happened yet
But it would be a shame if our little fling
Always stayed a onetime thing
Someday if we're lucky
We'll get old enough to finally be embarrassed 
By the crazy things we've done
Be just like our parents 
Responsible and bland
No risk, no excitement 
Hey lets get it while we can 
Cause

Some Mistakes are too much fun
To only make once
Love like this is too much fun 
To only make once
