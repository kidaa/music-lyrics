Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Do you miss me like I miss you, is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings and you think I'm on the line
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine

[1st Chorus]
Does it thunder and lightnin' even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine

Is it raining at your place just like it is over here
If it is then sweetheart like me I know you're scared
I just called you to console you like any old friend would do
Is it raining at your house and by the way I still love you

[Repeat Chorus]
