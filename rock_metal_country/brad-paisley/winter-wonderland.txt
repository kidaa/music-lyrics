Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
It's a beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
And here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

[Chorus]
Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Jim Ed Brown
We'll sing "Pop A Top" with Mr. Snowman
When chapel bells are ringing all around

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Yeah we'll face unafraid
That plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
