She's 98 lbs. workin down at the Dairy Queen 
With an Oval V home perm and braces. 
And he's long haired no job and just 19 
They've got a baby on the way and 
They're off to the races 

In love look at em go 
Now what in the world 
Could go world could go wrong? 
Don't tell them the odds 
Its best they don't know. 
If love was a plane, nobody'd get on.

At the Ivy at lunchtime in Beverly Hills 
The popparazi are gathered outside 
Cause' an actor and an actress are having lunch 
And according to Extra and Entertainment Tonight 

They're in love,
Look at em go 
Now what in the world could go wrong? 

Don't tell them the odds, 
Its best they don't know, 
If love was a plane nobody'd get on 

Imagine now the pilots voice on the intercom 
Right before we leave the ground 
Saying folks thanks for flying with us 
But theres a six in ten chance we're goin down 
But that's the strangest thing about this emotion, 
Even knowng our chances are small, 
We line up at the gate with our tickets 
Thinking, somehow were different 

I mean after all 
We're in love look at us go!
Now what in the world could go wrong?
To hell with the odds we'd rather not know
If love was a plane, nobody'd get on 
Ya, if love was a plane nobody'd get on
