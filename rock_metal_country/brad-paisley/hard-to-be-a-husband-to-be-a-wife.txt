You wouldn't believe the number of times I've heard somebody say 
How come some guy, some handsome prince, hasn't swept you away 
But I take off on that tour bus, a different city every night 
And doing what I love to do makes it hard to be a wife 

You wouldn't believe the number of times I've been asked that myself 
Folks can't understand why a heart like mine is still on the shelf 
But I'm married to my music and I have been most my life 
That makes it hard to be a husband 
It makes it hard to be a wife 
Cause I'd rather play the Grand Ole Opry 
Than go out to dinner and a movie 
Right now I'm not thinkin' bout a family of my own 
Cause the band's on stage and I'm late for my show 

There's folks who think my life is lacking 
Cause my time at home is usually spent packing 
You might assume that I don't' have a clue what love's about 
Oh, but I know love 
Of that I have no doubt 
Cause you wouldn't believe the way it feels to hear somebody say 
Your song sure means a lot to me 
It got me through a real tough day 
And if hearing words like that means giving up my social life 
Then I've got all the friends I need on that front row 
And I've got all the friends I need on that back row 
And we can't see those folks unless we're never home 
And that makes it hard to be a wife 
And hard to be a husband 
And hard to be a wife
