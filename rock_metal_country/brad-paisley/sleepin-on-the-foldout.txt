Chorus
Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth 
Why did I do what I did 
I should'a known better than to lie 
But it's too late and so tonight I'm 
Sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed

Instead of tellin' her the whole staff 
Spent the day out on the lake 
And now I'm 

Chorus 

Yeah, I'm sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed
