That sleepy little campfire poppin kinda craklin 
We were Heatin up th pork and beans 
Bubu said man it don't get any better than this 
If you know what I mean
We sat there for a minute listinig to the crickets 
Thinkin this is pretty hard to beat 
Til Jr stood up spit in the fire 
Said boys I hate to disagree 

But if a bus load of women, really good looking women,
Just suddenly pulled in here 
Old joe t garcia showed up with fajitas and a 100 gallon keg of beer and Haggard dropped by
And brought Willie with him
And they started takin requests 
Well don't get me wrong boys this is pretty good
But it could get better than this

Bill mance and Hank parker floated by in a boat 
And volunteered to be our fishin guides 
And richard petty pulled up in the old '43 car 
And asked us if we wanted a ride 
We'd all sit around singin poncho and l

Lefty playing poker and smoking big cigars 
Now don't take offense y'all im perfectly content 
Just sittin here under the stars

But if a bus load of women, really good lookin women,
Just suddenly pulled in here 
And Old emril degasi showed up with kilbasi 
And a 100 gallon keg of beer 
If Haggard dropped by and brought willie with him 
And they started takin requests 
Don't get me wrong boys this is pretty good 
But it could get better than this

But if a bus load of women, really good lookin women, 
Just suddenly pulled in here 
And little jenny pikins showed up with fried chicken 
And a 100 gallon keg of beer 
Mearl Haggard dropped by and brought willie with him 
And they started takin requests 
Don't get me wrong boys this is pretty good 
But it could get better that this
