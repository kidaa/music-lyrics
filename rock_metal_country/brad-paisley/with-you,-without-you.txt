You really left your mark
On this old house
And this old heart
I see you everywhere
And when I close my eyes
You're still there
And I know
You want me to move on
Start living a new life
Start writing a new song
Don't worry, I ain't going to ask you
To come back and love me
Baby you don't have to
Cuz I can be in love with you, without you

It's not that hard at all
It's like you're out of town
Just forgot to call
Just because you walked away
Doesn't mean my feelings have to change
Now I know

You want me to move on
Stop living an old life
Stop singing an old song
Don't worry, I ain't going to ask you
To come back and love me
Baby you don't have to
Cuz I can be in love with you, without you

Ohhhh and If you're gone for good
I know you'll go far
Cuz how I fell about you
Don't matter where you are

Yeah... and I know
You want me to move on
Start living a new life
Stop singing an old song
But I can be in love with you
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
I can be in love with you, without you
