Well I love her 
But I love to fish 
I spend all day out on this lake 
And hell is all I catch 
Today she met me at the door 
Said I would have to choose 
If I hit that fishin' hole today 
She'd be packin' all her things 
And she'd be gone by noon 

Well I'm gonna miss her 
When I get home 
But right now I'm on this lakeshore 
And I'm sittin' in the sun 
I'm sure it'll hit me 
When I walk through that door tonight 
That I'm gonna miss her 
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite 

Now there's a chance that if I hurry 
I could beg her to stay 
But that water's right 
And the weather's perfect 
No tellin' what I might catch today 

Well I'm gonna miss her 
When I get home 
But right now I'm on this lakeshore 
And I'm sittin' in the sun 
I'm sure it'll hit me 
When I walk through that door tonight 
That I'm gonna miss her 
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite 

Yeah, I'm gonna miss her 
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite
