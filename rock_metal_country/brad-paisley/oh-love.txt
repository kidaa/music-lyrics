[Brad Paisley]
Strong like a mother holds her child
Free as horses running wild
And real as a prayer on a lonely night
And sure as the ocean tide

[Both]
Oh love
Oh love
Oh the many colors that you're made of 
You heal 
You bleed
You're the simple truth 
And you're the biggest mystery
Oh love
Oh Love

[Carrie Underwood]
Deep as the life from Gods own breath
And it's even after death
Gone like the sunset

[Brad Paisley]
You can break a heart in pieces 
Put it back together again

[Carrie Underwood]
You can break down sweet forgiveness
You're the one that never ends

[Both]
Oh Love
Ooooohhhh
Ooooohhhh
Oh love 
Oh love 
Oh the many colors that you're made of 
You heal 
You bleed 
You're the simple truth 
And you're the biggest mystery
Oh love
Oh love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
