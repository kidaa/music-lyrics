Every morning the last couple of weeks 
In between shaving and brushing my teeth 
I'd lean on the sink and practice my lines 
By now you would think they'd be memorized 

But leave it to me to come all this way 
Get down on one knee and forget what to say 
I'm at a loss, should have known this is how it would be 
'Cause you have that effect on me 

I must admit I still don't understand 
Why I lose my head holding your hand 
There's no explanation, no simple excuse 
For this intoxication I feel around you 

And now truth be known since I've met you girl 
I've been walkin' around in my own little world 
One look in my eyes and darlin' any fool could see 
That you have that effect on me 

You've had your eyes on a two carat ring 
I finally went out and I bought it 
Right now it's at home sittin' on my TV 
Would you believe I forgot it 

But you can't blame me 'cause it's plain to see 
That you have that effect on me 
Yeah, you have that effect on me 
Girl, you have that effect on me
