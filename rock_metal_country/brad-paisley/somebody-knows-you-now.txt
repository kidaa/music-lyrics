You used to say you wanted someone to know you inside out
And as I look back on things well congratulations baby
Somebody knows you now

All of this time you told me you wished that you could figure yourself out
You say you're still a mystery but no not really not to me
Yeah somebody knows you now

[Chorus]
I got a hundred bucks that says right now your hair's up in a clip
Your socks don't quite match and you're bitin' your lip
I can finish your thoughts or pick the right restaurants
Even order for you 'fore you sit down
Yeah somebody knows you now

So no matter where you life's path leads
Remember me somehow
And feel a little warm inside knowin' that somewhere tonight
Somebody knows you now

Well baby all your mystery
Like you and me is history
'Cause somebody knows you now
