You know I'm stubborn, set in my ways, said I'd never 
Fall in love, used all the old cliches 
But just now when you called and my heart rate hit the roof 
I realized it's time to eat my words and face the truth 

So come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing 
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings 
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat 
While the oak trees sprout dollar bills 
And I look you in the eye 
To finally say the words I swore I'd never say 
In my whole life 
So come on over tonight 

I called my buddies, they're comin' too 
After the way I ran my mouth they can't 
Believe it's true 
They're bringin' pizza and sweet tea 
And I hope that you don't mind 
But they said they've gotta see this 
And they promise to be quiet 

So come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing 
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings 
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat 
While a big ol' bolt of lightning 
Strikes me not just once, but twice 
As I say the words I swore I'd never say 
In my whole life 
Yeah, come on over tonight 

Me fallin' in love, that's one of those things 
That I swore would never come true 
But I'm startin' to think that nothin' is impossible now 
That I found you, nothin' 

Yeah, come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing 
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings 
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat 
See the premiere performance of demons on ice 
As I say the words I swore I'd never say 
In my whole life 

Say, come on over 
Hey, come on over 
Said, come on over tonight
