It was a cold and dark December night
But a star still lit the sky
Away in a manger you heard a baby cry
It was the cry of the Son of God
A little baby boy
Born in that manger to bring the world joy

[1st Chorus]
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God is with you all the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day

Many people soon gathered round that tiny run down barn
They knew not of what they saw
Then came three all dressed in fancy robes, silks and furs
This was the first indication of the importance of his birth

[2nd Chorus]
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God will lead the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day

We expected a soldier to save us from our plight
All dressed in shiny armor, ready for a fight
But instead he sent a little baby boy
All filled with love happiness
To bring the world joy

[3rd Chorus]
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God will lead the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day
