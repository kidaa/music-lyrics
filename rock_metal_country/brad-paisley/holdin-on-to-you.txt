I'm holdin' on to you 
When I close my eyes 
You're still in my arms 
And we never said goodbye 
And it's all that I can do 
To go on with my life 
But that's supposed to be the reason 
Why I'm here tonight 

In a downtown restaurant with a friend of a friend 
Well she sure likes to talk and I ain't heard a single word she's said 

Chorus
Oh, but every now and then I nod 
And I pretend to pay attention 
And I say things like, "uh huh" 
And, "yeah, you're right" and "are you kiddin'" 
And I laugh when it seems 
Like the right thing to do 
It's hard to hold a conversation 
Holdin' on to you 

I'd give anything 
Just to hear your voice 
Or see you look at me and smile 
Oh but what I miss the most 

Is holdin' on to you 
'Cause here I am tonight 
Starin' at a woman 
Who's the last thing on my mind 

Chorus 

When I close my eyes 
You're still in my arms 
And we never said goodbye
