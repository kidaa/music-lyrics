feat. Alan Jackson

I'm sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey and hot 7 Up
Out in the parkin' lot

You can hear the band playin'
Right through the walls
Ain't no cover charge
Ain't no last call
Out in the parkin' lot

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love to see the neon dancin' on the gravel
And I love to hear the pickup trucks as they come unraveled
Some 've given up
Some 've given in
Looks like everybody's lookin' for a friend
Out in the parkin' lot

Whoops, there's a couple
Who could not wait to get home
They're probably in love so let's leave them alone
Out in the parkin' lot

There's a couple of cowboys
Puttin' up their dukes
But there weren't much to it after both of 'em puked
Out in the parkin' lot

[Repeat chorus]

Now the band is on the bus
And they're all loaded up to leave
But the drummer's got a girlfriend 
And she's tuggin' at his sleeve
Out in the parkin' lot

[Repeat chorus]

I'm sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey and hot 7 Up
Out in the parkin' lot
