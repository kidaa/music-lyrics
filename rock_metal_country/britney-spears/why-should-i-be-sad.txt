They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you
I just told them set of lies
Couldn't see what's on inside
Thought there'd be real panic for you

Exchanged my vows
And said it all
Woman, let's prepare to fall
Even, screaming did it for you
Remember it?

My friends said you would play me
But I just said they're crazy
While I was crying, praying
Was it true?

Well, should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
Stupid freaking things
Or should I get bad or sad
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
Goodbye
It's time for me to get it on
OK
I'm tired of singing sad songs
All right
It's time for me
Britney, let's go

I sent you to Vegas
With a pocket roll of paper
Don't put no ultimatiums on you
I thought what could separate us
But it just seemed to break us
Only brought the playa part of you
Hey baby, what's your name?

Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams
People let us in magazines
Tell me who'd I do that for, who?

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
Stupid freaking things
Or should I get bad or sad
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
Goodbye
It's time for me to get it on
OK
I'm tired of singing sad songs
All right
It's time for me
Britney, let's go

It's time for me to move along
Goodbye
It's time for me to get it on
OK
I'm tired of singing sad songs
All right
It's time for me
Britney, let's go

And don't you worry
About our angels
All the magazines trying to analyse
Seeing things in the Us subsection
There'll get good guidance
And be trained well
Don't worry I'll keep a little secret
When I ask this question

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
Stupid freaking things
Why should I get back the sack?
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
Goodbye
It's time for me to get it on
OK
I'm tired of singing sad songs
All right
It's time for me
Britney, let's go

It's time for me to move along
Goodbye
It's time for me to get it on
OK
I'm tired of singing sad songs
All right
It's time for me
Britney, let's go

Yeah
Baby, come on
