Hey!? Is this thing on? 

        I saw him dancing there by the record machine 
        I knew he must have been about seventeen 
        The beat was going strong 
        Playing my favourite song 

        And I could tell it wouldn't be long 
        until he was with me 

        YEAH Me 

        And I could tell it wouldn't be long 
        until he was with me 

        YEAH With me Singin'

        So put another dime in the jukebox, Baby

        He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name" 
        That don't matter," he said, "'cause it's all the same." 
        I said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?" 
        And next we were moving on 
        and he was with me, yeah, me 
        And we were moving on
