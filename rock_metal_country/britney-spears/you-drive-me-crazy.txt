Baby, I'm so into you
You got that Somthin, what can I do
Baby, you stood me around
The Earth is movin, but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin, it's easy to see
Lovin you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[CHORUS:]
You Drive me crazy

Ohh...Crazy, But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin of you keeps me up all night

Tell Me, Your so into me
That im the only one you will see
Tell me, im not in the blue
That i'm not wastin, my feelins on you

Lovin you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Repeat CHORUS]

Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, Im in to deep
Crazy, But it feels alright
Every Day and Every Night

[Repeat CHORUS]

You Drive Me Crazy You drive me crazy baby
Ohh..Crazy, But It Feels Alright
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night
