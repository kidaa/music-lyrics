Forever 
Its been hours seems like days since you went away 
And all I do is check the screen to see if you're okay 
You don't answer when I phone, guess you want to be left alone 
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul and this is what I'll say 

Chorus: 
I'm sorry, oh so sorry, can't you give me one more chance 
To make it all up to you 
E-mail my heart and say our love will never die and I 
I know you're out there and I know that you still care 
I know that you still you care 
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive 
Forever, e-mail my heart 

I can see you in my mind,coming on the light 
And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times 
Here's a picture of us two, I look so good on you 
And can't you please forgive me for the hurt I've put you through 

[Chorus] x 2
