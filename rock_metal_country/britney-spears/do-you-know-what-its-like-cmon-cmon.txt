Don't you tell me, tell me I'm not the kind of girl
That you wanna take home, c'mon make me your own
Do you even know what I like
Jus what I'm feeling for, what I adore
Baby, take the time to realize, 
I'm not the kind to sacrifice, the way I am
So if you wanna be my man
Walk a mile in my shoes 
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that, if you wanna stay around
I'm telling you, you got to figure me out
Take your time or you'll lose
This is my game, my rules
I can see obviously,
 Baby you don't know what it's like to be me
Don't you get it twisted boy
I want you too, but you got my heart to win before I let you in
And that deceives you baby, I'm not the other ones baby
I need someone to love
Baby, take the time to realize, 
I'm not the kind to sacrifice, the way I am
So if you wanna be my man
Walk a mile in my shoes 
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that, if you wanna stay around
I'm telling you, you got to figure me out
Take your time or you'll lose
This is my game, my rules
I can see obviously,
 Baby you don't know what it's like to be me
Baby to know me, you can show me
That your love for me is true
I'll give you everything a girl could give
Don't you wanna be my man
Walk a mile in my shoes 
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that, if you wanna stay around
I'm telling you, you got to figure me out
Take your time or you'll lose
This is my game, my rules
I can see obviously,
 Baby you don't know what it's like to be me
