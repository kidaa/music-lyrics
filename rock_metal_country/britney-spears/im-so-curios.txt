BREAK:
So curious
So curious 
VERSE 1:
I'm so curious about our love
I don't understand
Why you don't take my hand
And tell me you care you care 

I see all the signs
But if you wanna be mine
Don't leave me up in the air 

Oh baby
You better let your love show
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know
Let me go 

CHORUS:
I'm so curious
Do you love me
Do you wonder the way that I do I do
I'm so curious
What do you think of me of me
Boy, am I just a game
or do you feel the same as I do 

BREAK:
So curious
So curious 

VERSE 2:
I'm so curious about our love
If it's make-believe
why don't you set my heart free
and tell me goodbye goodbye
But if it's for real
tell me you feel for me
way deep down inside 

Oh baby
Is this goodbye or hello
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know
Let me go 

CHORUS:
I'm so curious
Do you love me
Do you wonder the way that I do I do
I'm so curious
What do you think of me of me
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do 

BREAK:
So curious
Yeah, yeah 

BRIDGE:
All day and night I just dream of you of you
I think about all the things that we could do
I'm dying for and I'm feeling for the day
when you could open up and say
you feel the same 
you feel like I do yeah 

CHORUS:
I'm so curious
Do you love me me
Do you wonder the way that I do I do
I'm so curious so curious
What do you think of me of me
Boy, am I just a game
or do you feel the same the same

I'm so curious

What do you think of me of me
Boy, am I just a game
or do you feel the same as I do
