There's too much of this noise, boy let's get a seat
So you can talk sweet to me
I see these other boys but you got me on the dance floor
And now you're like buying me drinks
You's a sexy guy and I wonder why
We could have some fun, so don't be shy
Baby just enjoy what's on you're mind
Party and have a good time
It's getting hectic in here, it's getting chaotic
I'm rocking and rolling, no stopping
We're going until it's over
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, I think it's so chaotic

Chorus:
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire
Burning up the dance floor
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger
Tell me do you want more
Everybody blink your lights
File in from the left to right
Ooh, I'm fire, ooh, I'm on fire
Burning up the dance floor
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy it's chaotic

There's too much of this sound, I'm on the prowl
So please don't turn me down
I'm having so much and fun and we ain't done
I'm gonna tell you now
DJ is my friend so let's begin
I'm gonna do my dance until the end
Baby just get down let's paint the town
Everybody here is getting wild
It's getting hectic in here, it's getting chaotic
I'm rocking and rolling, no stopping
We're going until it's over
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, I think it's so chaotic

Chorus

Look at what you do to me
Melting down for all to see
I can't help it, no I can't
Burn it down so we can dance
Look at what you made me do
I can't get enough of you
Turn me in, you turn me out
Just don't put the fire out

Chorus
