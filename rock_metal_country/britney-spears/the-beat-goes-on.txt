Drums Keep Pounding Rhythm To The Brain 
La Dee Da Dee Dee 
La Dee Da Dee Da 

Wait Till You Have Reached The Age 
Blah Blah 
History Has Turned The Page 
Blah Blah 

We Still Want To Hear A Brand New Thing 
Uh Huh 
We Still Need A Song To Sing 
Uh Huh 

And The Beat Goes On 6x 

Drums Keep Pounding Rhythm To The Brain 
La Dee Da Dee Dee 
La Dee Da Dee Da 

Love Is The First Thing Last Thing On Our Minds 
Run To Love Until The End Of Time 

And The Beat Goes On 4x 

And The Beat Goes 

And The Beat Goes 

And The Beat Goes On 

Drums Keep Pounding Rhythm To The Brain 
La Dee Da Dee Dee 
La Dee Da Dee Da 

We Still Move To A Rhythm Just Like This 
We Still Dream Of Sharing Our First Kiss 

And The Beat Goes On 4x 

Drums Keep Pounding Rhythm To The Brain 
La Dee Da Dee Dee 
La Dee Da Dee Da

Well Our Kids Are Turning Faster Everyday Everyday 
We Still Want To Dance The Night Away 

And The Beat Goes On 
And The Beat Goes On 
And The Beat Goes On 
And The Beat Goes On 
To Fade
