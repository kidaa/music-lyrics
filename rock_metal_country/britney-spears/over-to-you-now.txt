Over to you now
Do you like this, this place that I'm bringing you to?
Cuz I do
Oh my God!

I know this place
It's still a secret
And I don't think you've ever been
It's kinda hard to find the entrance
You need some juice
But you'll love it once you get there

This special place
It's in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot
And then it's pumping
So are you ready to go down?

Chorus:
So, it's over to you now
So, it's over to you now
It's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you behave
You might be chosen
Just read the fire?
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned yeah
So baby whatcha' waiting for

Chorus:
So, it's over to you now
So, it's over to you now
It's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking
Yeah
So, it's over to you now
So, it's over to you now
It's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Do you like this, this place that I'm bringing you to?
Do you feel that, huh?
Do you like that?
I thought you would
Cuz I do
Oh my God!

Chorus:
So, it's over to you now
So, it's over to you now
It's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking
Yeah
So, it's over to you now
So, it's over to you now
It's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God!
