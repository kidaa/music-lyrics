Ah Oh Oh
Ah Oh Oh 

Friends Say I'm Away 
Because I'm Down With You Every Day 
They Say Break Away
I'm Missing Out On The Fun And Games
But You Smile And The Words They Tell Me Quickly Disappear 
You Speak And There's Is No Other Voice That I Can Hear 

I Spend My Days Ooh Ooh With You I Spend My Days 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You Thinking About You Babe 
I Spend My Days All Day All Night With You With You 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You 

You Stay On My Mind Oh 
And I Think About You All The Time All The Time 
Day And Night 
Feels So Right 
And For Us There Is No End In Sight Ooh 

Each Day That I Spend Around You 
Passes By Too Fast 
Each Night That I Spend Without You 
Is Longer Than The Last

I Spend My Days I Spend My Days With You Thinking About You Babe 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You All Day All Night 
I Spend My Days My Days With You Thinking About You 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You Thinking About You Babe 

Ooh You Know I Can't Get Enough Of You Can't Get Enough Yeah 
Uh Uh You Know That 24 Hours Won't Ever Ever Do Never 

I Spend My Days I Spend My Days With You Thinking About You Babe 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You All Day All Night 
I Spend My Days My Days With You Thinking About You 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You Thinking About You Babe 

I Spend My Days I Spend My Days With You Thinking About You Babe 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You All Day All Night 
I Spend My Days My Days With You Thinking About You 
I Spend My Nights My Nights Thinkin' About You Thinking About You Babe
