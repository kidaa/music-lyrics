Heart, I know Ive been hard on you
Im sorry for the things Ive put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see

Oh, heart, Im not sure its been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
Theres just one way to learn, sometimes well get hurt
And right now its our turn

Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
Youre my strength, youre my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If youll, if youll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hangin' in
And well find love again
