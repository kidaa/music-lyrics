Walking Through Time Looking For An Answer 
How Can It Be This Way 
What Have I Done 
I Just Can't Help But Wonder 
How Everything Could Change 

Chorus 1 

'cause You Have Turned My World Around 
Since You Came Along No 
After This Love Was Found It Seems Like We Can't Go On 

Chorus 2 

Deep In My Heart 
I Know There's Only You 
And Right From The Start I Always Knew 
I Never Let Go 
'cause Love You So 
Ohhoohh I Want You For The Rest Of My Life 

Some People Search What Seems To Be A Lifetime 
To Find A Love Like This 
And Here We Are 
With Everything We Wished For 
I Never Felt Such Bliss 

Chorus 1 2 

There Comes A Chance In Everyones Life 
And I Beleive It Won't Happen Twice 
Now Since I've Felt The Glory Of Love 
I Want Spend Forever 
And Ever With You 

2x Chorus 2 

Deep In My Heart 
Deep In My Heart 
I Want You For The Rest Of My Life 
I Want You For The Rest Of My Life
