Do u feel this? 
I know you feel this 
Are u ready? 
I don't think so 

Somebody give me my truck 
So I can ride on the clouds 
So I can turn up the base like 

Somebody pass my guitar 
So I can look like a star 
And spend the cash like 

-Bridge- 
What u gonna do when the crowd goes ayo 
Why u standing on the wall? 
Music's starting everywhere! 
So why don't u just move along? 

-Chorus- 
I see u looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

Now you all in my grill 
Cause I say what I feel 
Only rock to what's real 
Bump bump 

But I can't do that with you 
I'll be here with my crew 
You can roll if you can 
Don't be a punk punk!!! 

-Bridge- 
What u gonna do when the crowd goes ayo 
Why u standing on the wall? 
Music's starting everywhere! 
So why don't u just move along? 

-Chorus- 
I see u looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

I see u looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

-Instrumental- 

Uh huh 

I see you lookin over here 
Can't you tell I'm having fun? 
If you know it like I know 
You would stop!!! 
Staring at us 
And get your own space 
And do something!!! 

-Chorus- 
I see u looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

I see u looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't u do something? 

F***!!! 
Do something!!! 
Why don't you do something?!
