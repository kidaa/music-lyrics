You know I'm one of a kind;
Boy what's this I see,
This girl she looks just like me,
Blond hair and dressed to a T,
You tell me how can this be,
If she knew I was the one,
Who used to turn you on,
Yeah,
But you don't want to talk about it
When you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
That she can't do the thing I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face and my name
And it eats you up inside

[CHORUS]
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy 
And when you look in my eyes 
Is it hard for you to realize 
She'll never be me

Why can't you see it girl
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
Does she know I was the one
Who use to turn you on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it
When you think you can find someone
to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
You can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

[Chorus fades out]
