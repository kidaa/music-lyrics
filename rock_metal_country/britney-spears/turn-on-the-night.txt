Lets go 
        Lets get out on the town 
        something's going on 
        and I wanna be around 
        Something's not right 
        If I don't get out tonight 

        Turn On the night 
        make sure everything all right 
        Hair done, nails done right 
        best bet I'll be home at 5:00 
        cause when I go out 
        I go all out 
        Me and my girls 
        nothings in our way 
        turn on the night 
        turn on the night 

        Aint no man gonna change my mind 
        cause best bet I'll be going home by myself 
        cause you know me 
        you gotta hit me one more time 
        before I give you the time of day 
        wanna drive me crazy? 
        show me how you dance 
        if you can move your hips the way I move mine 
        let me see, let me see 

        Turn On the night 
        make sure everything all right 
        Hair done, nails done right 
        best bet I'll be home at 5:00 
        cause when I go out 
        I go all out 
        Me and my girls 
        nothings in our way 
        turn on the night 
        turn on the night
