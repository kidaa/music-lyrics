[Bonus Track]

Baby, I'm lying all alone
Pillow, is all I have to hold
can't feel you, God it isn't fair
without you I still wanna take you there

Don't hang up
It's just gettin serious damn
Your making me delirious
Don't hang up
'til I'm finished with you
I'm not alone don't hang up
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
even when I'm lonley, and now I'm coming too don't hang up
I'm not alone 
I can still feel you
feel you when im lonley, and now im coming too

Tell me, tell me what you see
feel me, feel me underneath
slowly, we began to breath
hold on, hold on to your release

Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious damn
Your making me delirious
Don't hang up
Untill im finished with you
I'm not alone dont hang up
I'm not alone I can still feel you
even when I'm lonley, and now I'm coming too dont hang up
I'm not alone 
I can still feel you
feel you when I'm lonley, and now I'm coming too

You're far way, we'll find away
oh baby now, let's make it right
close your eyes damn

Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious damn
Your making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until im finished with you
I'm not alone don't hang up
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
even when I'm lonley, and now I'm coming too don't hang up
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
feel you when I'm lonley, and now I'm coming too

Don't Hang Up

Don't you feel me too?
Close your eyes...
