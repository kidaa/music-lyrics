This is a story about Mona Lisa

Ladies and gentlemen I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa and how she suddenly fell
You see everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I'm taking over, to release her from her spell

Chorus:
She's the original, yeah, yeah
She's unforgettable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible, yeah, yeah
She's so unpredictable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

She was taken under
Drowning in her sea
Running like an angel
She was crying and could not see
And see everyone's watching as she starts to fall
They want her to breakdown and be a legend of her fall

Chorus:
She's the original, yeah, yeah
She's unforgettable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible, yeah, yeah
She's so unpredictable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

Ladies does that make you cry?
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really dies
Everyone may we have a moment of silence right here

Chorus:
She's the original, yeah, yeah
She's unforgettable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible, yeah, yeah
She's so unpredictable , yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
That she's home, that she's home
She's the original, yeah, yeah
She's unforgettable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible, yeah, yeah
She's so unpredictable, yeah, yeah
She wants you to know, yeah
That she's home, she's home, she's home
