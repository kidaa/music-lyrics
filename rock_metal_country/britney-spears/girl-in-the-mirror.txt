::Verse 1::
There's a girl in the mirror,
I wonder who she is,
Sometimes I think I know her,
Sometimes i really wish I did,

::Pre-Chorus 1::
There's a story in her eyes,
Lullabies and goodbyes,
When she's looking back at me,
I can tell her heart is broken, easily

::Chorus::
'Cause the girl my the mirror,
Is cryin' in tonight,
And there's nothing I can tell her,
To make her feel alright,
Oh, the girl in my mirror,
Is cryin' 'cause of you,
And I wish there was something,
Something I could do

::Verse 2::
If I could, I would tell her,
Not to be afraid,
The pain that's she feeling,
The sense of loneliness will fade,

::Pre-Chorus 2::
So dry your tears and rest assured,
Love will find you like before,
When she's looking back at me,
I know nothing really works that easily

::Chorus 2::
'Cause the girl my the mirror,
Is cryin' in tonight,
And there's nothing I can tell her,
To make her feel alright,
Oh, the girl in my mirror,
Is cryin' 'cause of you,
Oh I wish there was something,
I wish there was something,
Oh, I wish there was something I could do

::Bridge::
I can't believe it's part of me,
That the girl in the mirror,
The girl in the mirror,
Is me...

I can't believe what I see, no, oh
Oh, the girl in my mirror,
The girl in my mirror, is me,
Oh, is me

::Repeat Chorus 2::
