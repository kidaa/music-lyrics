You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't
Blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have
To pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way
Like you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around
You think
I might back down
But I won't
Think that
I might have doubts
But I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just
Let me, let me be
Think that
You know me now
But you don't
Think that I can't
Stand on my own
It ain't my philosophy
Won't you just
Let me, let me be

Trust in my instincts
Trust that I know
What's right
These are the reasons
That keep you up
At night at night
Tell me "Go slow"
This is my flow
'Cause you don't know
Know what I know
Let me tell you
How it feels
Baby it's time that
You see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way
Like you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

You think
I might back down
But I won't
Think that
I might have doubts
But I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just
Let me, let me be
Think that
You know me now
But you don't
Think that
I can't stand
On my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just
Let me, let me be

Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go

You think
I might back down

Think that
