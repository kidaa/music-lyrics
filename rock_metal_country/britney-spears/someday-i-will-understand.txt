Nothing seems to be
The way that it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth
In me, and tell me somebody's
Watching over me
And that is all I'm praying is
Chorus:
That some day, I will understand
God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby
Now don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop
Just stop and listen to your tears
They're all you've got
It's in you, you see somebody's
Watching over you
And that is all I'm praying is
Chorus:
That some day
You will understand
God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but baby someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby, you'll see it all in your baby
No moment will be more true
Than the moment I look at you
It's in you
You see somebody's
Watching over you
And that is all I'm praying is
Chorus:
That some day
You will understand
God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but baby someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll sec it all in your baby, you'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby, you'll see it all in your baby
