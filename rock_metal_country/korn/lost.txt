Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide
Always screwing with my mind, that thorn in my spine 
Oh sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time 
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine 

Wait! to see it before my eyes 
Why! do I run away 

Looking all the time at your face so blind 
Feeling uptight, always the same fight 
Hey man now decide, go ahead take your time 
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine 

Wait! You can only see one side 
Why! Play yourself out 'dat way 
Why! You and me always hang 
Wait! Weren't you were my friends 

The pain in which I could not feel!!! 

Hey man look inside, now you need your own life 
Remember me guy That thorn in your spine 
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine 
Remember me guy That thorn in your spine 

[chorus]
