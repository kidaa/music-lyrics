A man is crying, takes me to a certain place.
Which I don't often mind.
You see a family walking.
Always thinking of being somewhere else in
time. 
So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.
Please give me some of me back.
The feelings I had. 

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you
. It doesn't matter.
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth.
I can't handle.

Let's get this party started.
I'm sick of being you.
You make me feel insane.
We don't give to you.
Let's get this party started.
You make me feel insane.
I want to be the one.
To make myself sane. 

Time is ticking, it makes me feel content.
With what I have inside.
Constant paranoia surrounds me.
Everyone I see is out to get me. 

So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.
Please give me some of me back.
The feelings I had. 

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you.
It doesn't matter.
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth.
I can't handle. 

Let's get this party started.

You make me feel insane.
