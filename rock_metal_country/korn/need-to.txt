I, I am confused, fighting myself 
Wanting to give in, needing your help 
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you, but inside I'm fine 

Can you see it in me 
Skin cold from touch 
Each day confronted with what I have done 
You pull me closer, I push you away 
You tell me it's okay, I can't help but fell the pain

I hate you! 
Why are you taken 
I love you! 
I feel so helpless 
Why is it you 
ripping my insides each time I'm with you 
why do I try 
why do I really need to 
Why!! 
Fuck you, bitch! 
need to. . . fuck. . .
