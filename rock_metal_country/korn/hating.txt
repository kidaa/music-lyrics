My life is such a waste
Begging on something to work this time
But why can't I relate
Feeling all I do is get what's mine
Holding on to faith, never gave me nothing but despair
So why do I create just to be swallowed

I can't take we have a start
I can't take we got a fantasy 
Come what may we are the stars
I can't wait I'll take what's mine

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find

I Cannot take this place
Burning up inside this space of mine
So why can't I replace, feelings I find hard to really find
I try but I can't taste
Memories they always fuck with me
So why do I create just to be swallowed

I can't take we have a start
I can't take we got a fantasy 
Come what may we are the stars
I can't wait I'll take what's mine

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find, 
find, find, find, find, find, find, find

All my feelings have been eating onto me
Feed inside, is there something wrong
with me

I can't take we have a start
I can't take we got a fantasy 
Come what may we are the stars
I can't wait I'll take what's mine

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find, 
find, find, find, find, find, find, find
