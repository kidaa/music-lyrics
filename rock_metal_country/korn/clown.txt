Just fucking do it damn it! 
*click* *click* 
I wanna get a twist. I wish we could put twist 
on a fucking tape. . . stupid 
Wanna hear it 
Fuck you! Fuck you! 
Huh Hueh 
Goooo! 
Okay. . . you piece of shit! 

Anger inside builds within my body 
Why'd you hit me What have I done 
You tried to hit me! 

-Do you want me to begin, if you like 
The pain will begin  Your pain will begin 
Throw your hate at me with all your might 
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me! 
You tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder then me 
What's with you boy Think hard. 
A tatooed body to hide who you are 
Scared to ne honest, be yourself 
A cowardly man! 

I don't run around trying to be what's not within me 
Look into my eyes, I am free 
You're just a wanna-be 

To come out 

Hit me because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown 

Clown you ain't shit. Turn around and get your face split. 

I'm just too fucking little! [3x]
I'm just a fucking mental! [4x]
