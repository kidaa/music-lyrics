Go! 

I can, in every way
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes to me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind
It runs away 
It's so predictable 

I can, in every way, feel the stress that tangles up inside 
Too blind to see, emptiness and sorrow of their lives 
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties 
You ask me 
It's so predictable 

I'm gonna try 
I'm gonna die 
I'm gonna try 

another day 
Silence overwhelms my mind 
who is to say 
If I have the time, oh why 
should I pray 
for all the hate to go away 
another day 
I can never break free 
You wait for me 
I call out to you 
Another day 
I'll live forever!
