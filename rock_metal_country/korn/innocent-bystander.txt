I know it's not like me to you
Hold back but this time I knew rape
You must be silent to increase the volume

In your head
Blood run red

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

You ripped your own self in two let's
Swear I had nothing to do switch
With what's been done
You know you can't but you can

In your head
Blood run red

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

Standing at the edge here
Enough for me to hover by the bit here
Enough you see I kiss you with my head - fear
So wrong that they will never reap our deaths clear

Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!

Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
