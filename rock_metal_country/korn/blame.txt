So I think you are a fool
Hanging on my every word
I'm getting ugly, So I'm ugly..

Tear me from your hearttttttlllliiifee
Tearing me apart.

So I thought you'd disappear
Being alone is what you fear
Are you lonely
Yes, lonely.

Tear me from your hearttttttlllliiifee
Tearing me apart.

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are.

The time is coming
Gone Insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you're to blame

The time is coming
You've gone insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you're to blame

Blame [x4]

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are. [x2]
