You came into my life without a single thing.
I gave in to your ways, which left me with nothing.
I've given in to smiles, I fell for all your games.
I wish so bad right now, I hadn't let you win.

Won't you get the fuck out of my face? Now!

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow, live your life insecure.
Feel the pain of your needles as they shit into my mind.

I scream without a sound, how could you take away
everything that I was - made me a fuckin' slave.
Your face that I despise, your heart inside that's gray.
I came today to say - you're fucked in every way

Won't you get the fuck out of my face? Now!

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow. Live your life insecure.
Feel the pain of your needles as they shit into my mind.

You stole my life
Without a sigh
You suck me dry

Won't you get the fuck out of my face? Now!

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow. Live your life insecure.
Feel the pain of your needle as they shit into my mind

You stole my life
Without a sigh
You suck me dry
