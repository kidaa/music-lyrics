This sunny Sunday
Is a good day to go
Guess you want me to stay
Well then let me know
And I hate to say
It's been a waste of time
I hate to interrupt the flow

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

You say you'd love to
But you've lots left to do
Almost decided to stay 'cause of you
And I hate to tell you to exchange your dreams
For a one-way ticket, no return

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Why, why
What you hanging up for?
What you doing that for?
What you breaking up for?
Why, hushabye

I hate to interrupt the flow
For a one way ticket, no return

This sunny Sunday is a good day to go

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Hushabye
Why, why, why I
What you breaking up for?
Why
Hushabye

We've wasted it, our time is up
