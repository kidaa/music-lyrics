This shit right here is for you.
On your faces I can see.
You all think it's up on me. 
I'm about to break.
This is my fate
Am I still doomed to a life
Of misery and hate. 

You would have never known.
What I've done for you.
What you may put me through.
I'd do it for you.
I could have never lived.
If it wasn't for you.
