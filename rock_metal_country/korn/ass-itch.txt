I hate writing shit, it is so stupid. What's my problem today?
Maybe I'm depressed, maybe I'm helpless to what comes out my hand?

Pain, pain x2

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid. Why do I feel this way?
Feelings in my heart, I'm in way too far. Can't - it won't go away...

Pain, pain x2

Before dawn, my song is dying.
Before dawn, my song is dying.

I hate writing shit, ain't looking forward to it. What's fucked up today?
Writing all this time, feeling all that's mine come right out my hand.

Pain, pain x2

Before dawn, my song is dying.
Before dawn, my song is dying.

Tell me now I want to know, is that me inside you see?
Ah, is this fair, I gotta let this song inside me... free.

Set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free

It just set me free x8

Before dawn, my song is dying.
Before dawn, my song is dying.

That's why I die.
That's why I try.
