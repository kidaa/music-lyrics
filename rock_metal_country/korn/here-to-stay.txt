This time, taking it away
I've got a problem, with me getting in the way,
Not by design.
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror.
I won't have to see the pain Bleed, Bleed 
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For what's inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh I can not give anymore.

My mind is done with this
Okay, I've got a question. 
"Can I throw it all away"
Take back what's mine
So I take my time, guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein Bleed, Bleed

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For what's inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh I can not give anymore.

I'm here to stay bring it down [x4]
Bring it down [x4]
Gunna break it down [x7]
GUNNA BREAK IT!

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For what's inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh I can not give anymore.

Give anymore. [X4]
