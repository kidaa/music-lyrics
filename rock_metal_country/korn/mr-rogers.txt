Time has come, to realize what you are, what you've done tonight.
Time has come, we'll have something to talk about.
I will too.

Looking back dumb
And now I realize oh man
How much you really liked him dumb
This child's mind you terrorized oh man
You came to him dumb
He really didn't know your lies oh man
Now his innocence is gone dumb
He's that child you'd terrorized oh man

This fucking pain that I feel - You gave to me and you
This fucking pain that I feel - Because of you
My childhood is gone - Because I loved you
My childhood is gone - Because I loved you

Be my Neighbor

Looking back child
And now I realize fucker
How much you really loved him child
This child's mind you'd hypnotized fucker
You came to him child
You really didn't know his lies fucker
Now his innocence is gone child

This fucking hate that I feel -- you gave to me and you
This fucking pain that I feel -- because of you

My childhood is gone -- because I loved you

Be my neighbor
Be my neighbor
My neighbor

Thought you told me everybody was my neighbor? They took
advantage of me and then they took this understanding. I wish I wouldn't
have watched you, but then you made my childhood a failure...

What a fucking neighbor!

I hate you

Be my neighbor

This fuckin' hate I feel
This fuckin' pain that I feel
My childhood is gone
My childhood is gone
This fuckin' hate that I feel
This fuckin' pain that I feel
My childhood is gone
My childhood is gone

I will too
