What's your lie 
Fuck you 
Warm lips, a big smile, has made your mind runs wild, 
this game you play I like the way 
You expect to grab a child, you think I'm innocent, 
not wild, take me and look see how much I'm tame 
Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
how to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
so let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear 
Warm lips, a big smile, hatred runs through your insides, 
this game you play it turns my attention each day 
You think it's all a lie, they want you to stray outta line, 
anger twisted your life, but you pay I wish I could take control, 
I wish I could let go, I wish I could break this mold, 
inside I'm so fucking cold 
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n on you 
I wish I could lose control 
I wish I could let go 
I wish I could break this mold 
inside I'm so fucking cold 
Wet fits inside so the truth unfolds I learned to lybra suffering, 
This was real, I'm dead for you with heroin 
What's come'n 
What's come'n 
What's come'n on you 
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n, 
I'm come'n on you
