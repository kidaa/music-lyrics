Hey, I'm feeling tired.
My time, is gone today.
You flew with suicide.
Sometimes, that's ok.
Hear what others say.
I'm here, standing hollow.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me. 
Day, is here fading.
That's when, I would say.
I flew with suicide.
Sometimes kill the pain.
I can always say.
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me. 

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming so sad.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground. 

falling away from me.
It's spinning round and round.
falling away from me.
It's lost and can't be found.
falling away from me.
It's spinning round and round.
falling away from me.
So down. 

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming so sad.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground. 

Pressing me, they won't go away.
So I pray, go away. 

It's falling away from me. 

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming so sad.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
