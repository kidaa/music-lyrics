Maybe I'm insane
walking on a wire
maybe I'm the same
Nothing can take me higher
tell me where to start
think I'm at the end
Right now, feeling pain
make it go away

Maybe I'm to blame
maybe I'm a Liar
maybe we're the same
nothing can stop the fire
I can't feel my heart
but I feel the shame
Nothing left to say
soon I'll fade away

These places all I ever
think about is lost in time
these faces taunting me I'm looking back
and they are mine

I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, then lead astray
Thinking back to times of yesterday
I could fly

I'm trying to find a better way
but I'm trapped, can't get away
All I think is about yesterday
I could fly

Maybe I'm insane
walking on a wire
maybe I'm the same
Nothing can take me higher
I can't feel my heart
but I feel the shame
Nothing left to say
soon I'll fade away

These places all I ever
think about is lost in time
these faces taunting me I'm looking back
and they are mine

I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, then lead astray
Thinking back to times of yesterday
I could fly

I'm trying to find a better way
but I'm trapped, can't get away
All I think is about yesterday
I could fly. [x2]
