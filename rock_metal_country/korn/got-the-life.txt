Hate, something, sometime, someway,
something kick off the front floor.
Mine Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give.. me.. some.. thing.. that.. is.. for.. real.
I'll never ever follow.
Get your boogie on... 
Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness.
Why This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give.. me.. noth.. ing.. just.. feel.
And now this shit will follow. 
God pains me, the more I see the life, who wants to see
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
God pains me, the more I see the life, who wants to see
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me.
I don't feel your deathly ways.
Each day i feel so hollow, inside I was beating me,
You will never see, so come dance with me.
Dance with me
Rumbiddieboo
Rum bum dee dum dee bum diddie doo

God pains me, the more I see the life, who wants to see
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
God pains me, the more I see the life, who wants to see
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Got the life.
Got... the... life.
