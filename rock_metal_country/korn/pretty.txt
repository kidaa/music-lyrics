So... so love.
Wait, but I don't realize.
Somehow, why lay
Broke, the pain between her thighs
I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for 
Skin... so cold.
Could, could someone steal a life
Save... the blame.
Wait, I got some shit to say. 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for 
RAPE! Something...
NOW! Rips my...
HEART! And takes...
MY! Soul I...
WAIT! Too late...
NOW! I feel...
RAPED! Inside...
DEATH! My soul away.... 
Away.... 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for...
