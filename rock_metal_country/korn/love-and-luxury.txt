I read your little book and... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I read your little book and... ha ha ha ha

You need a reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing ha ha ha ha ha
And everything you do
Makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

I heard what you've said, nothing new

You need a way to get along
A way to carry on
A symptom for the pain you're making
And surely you should know
That everywhere you go
There's acid in the words your faking

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

You write it, so you'd best believe it
You sold it, now your soul perceives it
You read a book, but now agree with it
The damage of betrayal
To Hell with your

reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing
And everything you do
Makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

Don't you think you should move on?
Don't you think you should move on?
