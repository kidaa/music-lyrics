Laying by my precious 
Not long ago 
Hiding behind the shadows 
Of your broken soul 
Why is it always you want something you can never have
Why did you you try to tell me 
How could you be this way 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

There you are my precious 
With your broken soul 
Rubbing my crotch, elated 
Taking control 
Why is it always 
You fuck up something you have always had 
Why'd you try to tell me 
How could you be so cold 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain 
Love racing through my veins
Can't you feel the pain 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

Here I am, just a man 
Feeling the pain, gives me life 
Relieving us is my plan 
I'd do anything to see through your eyes
Just to see through your lies 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain 

Can't you feel the pain 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain
