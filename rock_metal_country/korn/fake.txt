I can't stand the sight of you 
I can't stand what you put me through 
Your life's a lie, that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside 
I can't stand, oh, the thought of you 
I can't stand all the things you do 
What do you try to justify 
You were just too scared to be you inside 
Let!
It all go 

I look at you, all I see, is a man too afraid to really be

I can't stand what you put me through 
I can't stand even the thought of you 
Your secret lies that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside 

You try so hard to be wanted 
-False emotions tells you fronted 
I feel being a person relies on one thing: 
Be yourself, let you come through 
you're too afraid to really be 
Someone who isn't false, who dosen't care to be 
Be yourself, let you come through! 

Fake! 
-You'll regret it, you'll regret it
