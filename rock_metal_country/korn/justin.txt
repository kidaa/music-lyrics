Fuck all that bullshit! 

You watch me play.
I look away.
Your lights turn bright.
You found the light. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Take, off in space. You and I. 

You're gonna die!
Wanting me, why
I wish I your strength
Inside your soul escapes. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Take, off in space. You and I. 

Cry, into me.
Hold me... something... alright...
The kids that die listening to me. 

You are alive! 

Take, off in space. You and I stay....
Take, off in space. You and I.
Take, off in space. You and I. 

I...
