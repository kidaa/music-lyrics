Him! 

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me Made me feel upset
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads 
I am ugly. Please just go away 

Him! 
I can see inside you fine 
This blessing in disguise 
Him! 
Why do you treat me this way 
Made to hate to stay Made the hurt stay

I sound like I can never seem to escape 
all the laughing, all th pain 
If you were me, what would you do 
Nothing, probaly. You'd just throw me away 

Faget! 

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it 
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it 
It keeps going on day after day, son 
you fake, if we don't want none 
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday 
Who gives a fuck! 
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think 
I'm strange and I should be out here locked up in a cage 
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway 
You got this pretty-boy feeling 
like I'm enslaved to a world that never 
appreciated shit 
YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK AND FUCKING LIKE IT!!! 

He had my gun but he had to find the money 
He might come, but he has a body mighty
any say, anyway, don't wanna say, anyway, any say, 
going away, don't wanna say, anyway 

I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl 
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world 

All my life, who am I 

I'm just a faget! 
Faget! 
I'm a faget! 
Faget! 
I'm not a faget 
What am I 
Faget! 
You mother fucking queers!
