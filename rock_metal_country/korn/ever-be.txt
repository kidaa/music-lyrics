You're the infection my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew it, I knew it

You're basic, but hard to define
Simple yet somehow sublime
Knew you would strike again
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Polished, you shimmer when shined
But rotten and seething inside
Everyone falls for this
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, want to be god
All to be, made to be, holding the son
Throwing it, breaking it, over your grave
Sending you back to the place you once came

It must be hard to be you
Nothing's alright with you

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be/never be/wannabe [Repeat]
You will never be [Repeat]
You want to be God [Repeat]
It's all God [Repeat]
It's all gone [Repeat]
