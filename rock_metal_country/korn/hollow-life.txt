Beating the fall
I can't help but desire of falling down this time
Deep in this hole of my making I can't escape
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...lives [x7]

Fearing to fall and 
Still the ground below me calls
Falling down this time
Ripping apart all 
These things I have tried to stop
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky
Search in vane
Asking why
All alone
Where is God
Looking down
We don't know

We fall in space, 
We can't look down,
Death may come 
Peace I have found
What to say 
Am I alive, 
Am I asleep 
Or have I died

Wanting Peace
We fall in space
Wanting Peace
We can't look down,
Death may come,
Something takes a hold of me
Peace I have found 
Something takes a hold of me
I want to say my whole life,
Am I asleep 
We fall down. 

We come to this place
Falling through time, 
Living a hollow life, 
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs, 
Hollow lives...

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky
Search in vane
Asking why
All alone
Where is God
Looking down
We don't know [x2]

We fall in space
We can't look down
Death may come.
Peace I have found
