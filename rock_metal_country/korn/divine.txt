I hide only to defy you 
Take away the only love inside you
I see the face through everyone 
Inside I've just begun! 
You think I'm out to scare you 
I'm only out to prepare you for when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down! 

You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine 

Tell me why you never liked me 
Tell me wht it is you fight me Tell me why, so you'll fight me
Pull down and wait for the perfect time to take what is rightfully
mine
You think they're dumb to defy me
You said you don't want to defy me 
-You wait, to dumb run anyone . . .you don't want anyone
Oh well. . . 

You know what, Fuck you! 
I'm fed up with you! 
I'm not as good as you! 
Fuck no! I'm better than you! 

Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game! 
You try to see what you got 
Me ripping at your brain!
