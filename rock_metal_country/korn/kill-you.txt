Living life, don't you cry. My life -- pain is God.
Many nights, painful thoughts occur. Love me -- again I'm wrong.

In denial I tried to be your friend. I tried to be a good boy.
All I see, a hate deep inside. Startle me, someone save me.

Now these memories
Kill my heart
They bury me

All I want to do.... you are not my real mother
Is kill you.... so I beat and stab and fuck her

Looking back I was never ever right. You were my step
mom who always wanted me out of your sight. I would come walkin' in and
I'd say,  Hello,  but you'd slap me and make some fucked-up comment about
my clothes. But I tried to let it pass, but the pictures in my head were
with you with a knife up your ass laying dead. So I popped some more caps
in your ass. Now your son is such a fuck -- motherfucking bitch never try
to play me!

You make my life -- not so....

All I want to do....
Is kill you....

All I want to do.... you are not my real mother
Is kill you.... so I beat and stab and fuck her

Wish! You! Were dead! Now!

How.... I know

How can I cry over someone I never loved?
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Never loved.... Never loved
