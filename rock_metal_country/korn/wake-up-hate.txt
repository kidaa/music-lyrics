We got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up 
You gotta get it straight
we're gunna give it up
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up 

I am the burden of my everything, 
an open scar
I'll be reborn in hatred, 
feeling I can't love no more

I've had to suffer
I cannot wait for more.
No loving and no praying
All my hate is for the taking

We got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up 
You gotta get it straight
we're gunna give it up
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up 

I am the falling of my happiness
it is no more
Stop loving, I'm still hating
till I can not hate no more

I've had to suffer
I cannot wait for more.
No loving and no praying
All my hate is for the taking

I'm, I am filthy
wasted piece of shit

I am disgusting
take me, away

We got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up 
You gotta get it straight
we're gunna give it up
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up
We got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it safe
we're gunna wake up hate
we're gunna wake it up
