Must you keep looking at me 
before you looked the other way. 
Must you keep glaring at me 
I know you look inside, and see what you made.  

You took no pride in me 
but now I'm your everything 
it's finding out ya own me 
not all of your gloating.  

Must you keep looking at me. 
Now you see what I am. 
Trust, I knew what it was. 
I don't forget things, thinking I'm nothing.  

You took no pride in me 
but now I'm your everything 
it's finding out ya ownowe me 
not all of your gloating.  

Pride of me 
No Pride 
Why  

Must you keep looking at me 
Before you looked the other way 
Trust, I knew what it was 
I don't forget things, look what you've made.  

You took no pride in me 
but now I'm your everything 
it's finding out ya ownowe me 
not all of your gloating
