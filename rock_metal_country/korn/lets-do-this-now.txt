Run away no where
To chicken shit, two face
I'm gunna go there
The fear I cannot taste
You think you got me you laugh
You're gunna tumble down you laugh
Keep coming for me fuck off
I'll drop you on the ground

I fuck with no one
Until you get into my face

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Lets do this now [x2]

You're gunna feel how alright
I really am with you you're right
You're going no where must stop
Don't really know what to do you're right
It's going to go on fuck off
Until you run away alright
You can't control me
You best do it my way you won

I fuck with no one
Until you get into my face

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Lets do this now [x2]

Don't you know that
You can punch me?
Don't you know that
You can bring me down?
Oh my life would be so easy now
If you haven't stepped across that line
LINE!

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Lets do this now [x5]
