Lately things won't go my way.
Lately everything is grey.
It feels like something.
It feels like.. nothing 
So I came to find.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I came to find.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I'm angry for today.
Anger's the only thing I've made.
It feels like something.
No it's.. nothing. 

So I came to find.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

To live this way. 

Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me I can't
Wait to give them these feelings of hating.
Deep down inside me to all to take.
Ripping at me.
They're ripping at me.
Ripping at me. 

So I came to find.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me!
