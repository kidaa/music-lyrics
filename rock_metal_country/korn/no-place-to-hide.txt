HaHaHa! 

I see your faces and I do not understand why 
Each time I dream you standin there, right by my side
Why do you make me, you take my pride 
and in my eyes you kinda rape me, inside 

I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide which I like 

Some look at the time, I looked back into my life 
You want to touch me to see what's in my eyes 
Why do you make me remember all the hate all its shame 
Don't you hate me, sometimes 

[chorus]

I got no place to run, so don't come follow me 
I don't know where to run, so don't make fun of me 

. . .which I like. . . 

[chorus]
