I would like to search inside 
for all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem 
Can't you seem to 
search through these problems that haunt and taunt you
I smile, while you're afraid 
Your run, while you're so in pain 

Do you ever see it [out from] outside your fears 
Thinking about your life 
Thinking about your inner fears 

I would like to search inside 
for all of the things that you will hide 
What's the problem 
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you 

I want to see the life you have disguised 
The world of things that hurt you 
Kept all these useless lies 
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside 
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time 
I tried, you win 
My life is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain! 
Go!
