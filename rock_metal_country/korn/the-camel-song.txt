You can see I fly  
Disguised evil attracting everybody  
You can watch me play  
Taste your juices from me all day  

You can see I tried this all for you  
You can see I dispise all of you  
You can see I'm trying something new  
You can see me fly  

[CHORUS]
Sometime, somewhere  
Deceit leads you no where  
You try so hard  
To be the super star  

So come in with me  
Take your under sun light set you free  
Somewhere can't you see  
Going on this way  
Free you'll never be  

So you see I tried this all for you  
So you see I dispise all of you  
So you see I'm trying something new  
So you see me fly  

[CHORUS]

Just take me away  
Take me away Take me  
Take me  

[CHORUS]

Take me away..  

Take.. me.. away...
