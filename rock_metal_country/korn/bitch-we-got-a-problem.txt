For every person I've tried to be
There's another ten inside
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I'M NEVER THERE
I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU BUT NEVER HERE

And you move in a hostile way
Like you're recently wounded
I REACH FOR YOUR WRISTS TO FEEL A PULSE
YOU'RE FEELING YOURSELF FOR BOTH OF US

We got a problem, it's plain to see
We got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

All the searching we do inside
Is a futile attempt to
TO SIFT WHAT WE'RE MEANT TO NEVER KNOW
IT'S ALL SCREWED UP HOW THE RIVER FLOWS

And I know that you tried to hide
To center yourself, but
WAS I THE BEAST THAT SUCKED INTO YOU?
A REAL DARK BITCH DOWN INSIDE OF YOU?

We got a problem, it's plain to see
Bitch, we got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

Not your fucking nature
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you

And this is me, and me, and me, and me,
and me, and me, and me, and me, and me

Bitch, we got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

Bitch, we got a problem!
Yeah!
We got a problem!
Bitch, we got a problem!
We got a problem, problem, problem
We got a problem, yes, yes
We got a problem
We got a problem
We got a problem, problem, problem
