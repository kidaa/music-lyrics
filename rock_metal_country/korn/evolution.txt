I'm diggin' with my fingertips
I'm ripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searchin' for fragile bones
Evolution
I'm never gonna be refined
Keep tryin' but I won't assimilate
Sure, we have come far in time
Watch the bow break

And I'm sorry I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me

It's evolution...
Just evolution...

And I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Hold tight, I'm getting inside you
Evolution
And when we're gonna find these bones
They're gonna wanna keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by
Procreation

And the planet may go astray
In a million years, I say
'Cause motherfuckers, we're all derranged

It's evolution...
Just evolution...

And I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed

Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around

I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Why
Why do I deserve to die?
