I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation.
There's so much shit around me.
Such a lack of compassion. 
I thought it would be fun and games would be
fun and games.
Instead it's all the same it's all the same.
I want something to do.
Need to feel the sickness in you. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not
again.
Its quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh made
me bad.

All I wanna do it look for you.
And when I fix, you needed to.
Just to get some sort of attention, attention.

What does it mean to you
For me its something I just do.
I want something.
I need to feel the sickness in you
. 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not
again.
Its quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh made
me bad. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not
again.
Its quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh made
me bad. 

Just made me bad.
