Pounding, it starts again
Hurting, oh where do I begin?
Screaming, they dance around my head
Hoping, they'll maybe end up dead

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again I gotta do this right
I can't fucking given in I feel that I can fight
Can't I ever win I'll keep it on my mind
Here it comes again!

Silent it goes away
Patient, oh really should I stay?
Trying so hard to get ahead
Failure, is often where I'm lead

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again I gotta do this right
I can't fucking given in I feel that I can fight
Can't I ever win I'll keep it on my mind
Here it comes again!

Oh I must hold on
Oh I won't be gone
Oh I won't stop now
Oh I don't know how

Why I can't hold on?
Why I can't be gone?
Why I can't stop now?
Why I'm don't know how?

Here we go again again [x8]

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again I gotta do this right
I can't fucking given in I feel that I can fight
Can't I ever win I'll keep it on my mind
Here it comes again!
