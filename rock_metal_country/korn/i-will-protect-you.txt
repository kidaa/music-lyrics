What you gonna do, what you gonna feel
when suddenly I slip away?
Almost am a ghost of who I used to be
yesterday
How you gonna touch and how will you collect
the beauty when it turns to dust?
Every deal we make, the cells we generate
are both of us

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to
understand this life

Hold you in my arms and hold you in my gaze
Singing with my dying breath
Underneath this earth I resurrect your soul
and nothing less
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void
an ocean wouldn't hold the love
And everything I have and all I ever was
is not enough

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to
understand this life

I will protect you
I will protect you

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to
understand this life

This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!

I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
I will protect you
