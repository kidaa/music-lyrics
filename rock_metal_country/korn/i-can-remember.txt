I can remember when we first met  
we really had some times  
when the success started to kick in  
life turned into a mess  

Why can't we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Can we go back again  
I'm still the same man.  

You figured out really who I am  
you'll bet your life on that  
why can't you see me for what I am  
where human don't forget that that  

Why can't we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Can we go back again  
I'm still the same man.  

Stand around, don't follow me around  
playing me like a clown  
facing life not real not real  
life not real not real  
life not real not real  

Why can't we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Can we go back again  
I'm still the same man.  

SAME man!! [4x]
