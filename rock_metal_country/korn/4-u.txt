This sh*t right here is for you 
All your faces I can see 
You all think it's up, not me 
I'm about to break, this is my fate 
Am I still d**ned to a life, 
of misery and hate? 
You will never know 
What it did for me 
What you are 
Got me through 
I've done for you 
I could have, never lived 
If it wasn't, for you
