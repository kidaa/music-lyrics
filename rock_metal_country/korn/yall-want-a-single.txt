Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Boom Boom Boom Boom

What's going on today?
We gotta break away
We got a problem and
I think it's going to make us go down

They think we're all the same
And always we're to blame
For shit I think is lame
It's time to stop the game
I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say

Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that [x4]

What's going on today?
Why must it be this way?
We're going nowhere and
We're still knocking the need to bow down

They think we're all the same
And always we're to blame
For shit I think is lame
It's time to stop the game
I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say

Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that [x4]

We are the ones breaking you down
We are the hope to drown out your sounds
All Across the world you think we're to found 
All Across the world you're breaking you down

Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that shit [x4]
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, Fuck that [x6]
