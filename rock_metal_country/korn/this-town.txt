We are now the chosen toys of caddy girls and pretty boys,

suck my dick in this town. 
This town is our town, it is so glamourous, 
I bet you'd live here if you could and be one of us. 
This town is our town, so fuckin glamorous, 
I bet you'd live here if you could and be one of us. 
Change our minds like we said before, we are dreamers, 
we are whores, discarded scars like worn out cars, 
litter the streets of, this town, litter the streets of this town. 
This town is our town, it is so glamourous, 
I bet you'd live here if you could and be one of us. 
This town is our town, so fuckin glamorous, 
I bet you'd live here if you could and be one of us.
