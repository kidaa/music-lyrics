Burn! 
Buried so far away
Enter my life of nothing 

Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, burn, bite! 
Sick of the same ol' thing, 
so I dig a hole, burn, bite! 

I am so high, always 
Burying my life so slowly 

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings 
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

We enter in my bed 
Feeling like I'm God 
With the world around me 
Can't you feel this bite! 
reaming through my heart! 
screaming through my veins! 
nothing I can kill! 
screaming a lie! I! Am! 
Can't you feel my eyes out 
Can't you take my heart. . . away 
To heart 
Good-bye 

[chorus]
