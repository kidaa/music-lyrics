Away, I see it's going down
Today, Hoping in time,
Will bury all this pain
And will awake something inside

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known

Our lives, were good in everyway
Too late, time after time
Our love just turned to hate
but we stayed by each others side

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known

I keep holding on, I feel I'm where I belong
Everytime we fight, it feels so wrong
I feel so enslaved by my pride
Then we meet again

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known
