I'm facing the light
But fading to black
I'm offering peace
As I'm stabed in the back

Yet i'm feeling able
My house is made up still
With paper for doors

I've tryed to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

I'm holding the torch
But melting my fists
I'm first in the line
Yet last on the list

Yet i'm feeling able
My house is made up still
With paper for doors

I've tryed to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

Or obituary!

I tryed not to choke you NO!
But now you're dead NO!
I'm most uncertain NO!
Should I feel regret? NO!

I've tryed to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituery?

I tryed not to choke you!

Is this my overture? Or obituery?
