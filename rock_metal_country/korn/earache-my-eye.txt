[Cheech Marin:]
Dun nun nun 
Dun nun nun 
Dun Dun Dun

Orale! O-ra-le

My Momma talk to me, 
Try to tell me how to live 

But I don't listen to her, 
'cos my head is like a sieve 

My daddy, he disowned me, 
'cos I wear my sisters clothes 

He caught me in the bathroom, 
with a pair of pantyhose 

My basketball coach, 
he just kick me off the team 

For wearing high heels sneakers, 
and acting like a queen 

Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree 
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree 
Gonna tie his pecker to a tree 

Get your boogie off 

Go Head 

The world is coming to an end and I dont give a dam 

As long as I have my bitch 
Oh I'm a fuck you 

It don't bother me, if people think I'm funny 
'cos I'm a big rock star, and I make lots of money 
Money, money, money... 

Are you talking petsos 

Money, ka ching

Lots of money 

I'm so bloody rich 

Lots of money 
Lots of muthafuckin money

Ha, ha, ha 

I own shopping centres, parking lots, 
and stocks, and all that shit 

Ha, ha, ha 

I own you, ha, you too, you three 
For me, he he, oh oh 

Get your groove off 
Let's bring it back one more time Jonathan 
Jonathan on them drums, getting ever slower 
more groovin, slow that shit down 
crazy slow, come on, death, right here, slow, ah 
Don't give a fuck, break it out 
You even know, Boy George is on heroin 
We don't give a fuck

Ha, ha, ha, ha, aahh, ha, ha, ha
