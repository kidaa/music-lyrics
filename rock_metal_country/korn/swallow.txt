Fuck Yes! Whew!

Always, I'm locked in my head. No pain? You don't know what I have had...
By now, I'm so for sure. Right now, I am yours.

My sorrow
swallow
Follow me
Oh hell, no.

It came unknown to me. Paranoid, it's controlling all of me
Somehow, terror so pure. Right now, shit I'm yours.

My sorrow
I swallow
Follow me
Oh hell, no.

Was it me?
I swallow
Forget me
I don't know.

Oh hell no...

This thing, I follow. The place, I just get to fuckin' go.
A freak, that I'm sure. A freak, that is yours.

My sorrow
I swallow
Follow me
Oh hell, no.

Was it me?
I swallow
Forget me
I don't know.

I swallow
I swallow

Freak, Punk ass sissy...
I'm a freak, Punk ass sissy...
