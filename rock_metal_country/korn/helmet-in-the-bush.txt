'ello, esta Caco 
et eres Caco 
Well, you know , you fuck'n call me the Caco, okay

I keep asking, what's your lie 
It is disturbing 
This isn't mine 
Why 
Days keep passing 
A lot of time 
me 
I don't feel right 
Please God let me sleep tonight 

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in 
I just wanna know why! 

Don't give it up 
Don't hit my stick 

I keep asking 
Well, again, please try 
It is haunting 
This takes my mind 
Why 
Days keep passing 
Line after line 
me 
I don't feel right 
Please God let me sleep tonight, 
die tonight, die tonight, die tonight 

Please God help me 
Please God help me 
Please God help me from my painful situation 

Please God don't let me slip in tonight, please God 
Oh, please God don't let me chip in tonight, please God 
Oh, please GOd don't let me slip in tonight, don't let me die
Please God don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
