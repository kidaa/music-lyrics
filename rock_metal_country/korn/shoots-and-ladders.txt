Ring around the rosies 
Pocket full of posies 
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down 

Nursery rhymes are said, verses in my head 
Into my childhood they're spoonfed 
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real 
Look at the pages that cause all this evil 

One, two, buckle my shoe 
Three, four, shut the door 
Five, six, pick up sticks 
Seven, eight, lay them straight 

London bridges falling down, falling down, falling down 
London bridges falling down, my fair lady 

Nick nack patty wack, give a dog a bone 
This old man came rolling home 
. . . this old man came, 
Mary had a little lamb who's fleece was white as snow! 

Mary had a little lamb who's fleece was white as snow! 
Baa baa black sheep have you any wool 
Mary had a little lamb who's fleece was white as snow! 
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full 
Mary had a little lamb who's fleece was white as snow! 
Baa baa black sheep have you any wool 
Mary had a little lamb! 
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full
