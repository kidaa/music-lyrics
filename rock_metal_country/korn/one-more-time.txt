Always just coming in here,
starts the game
Why can't this puzzle be solved
each time it happens it's
always the same
I look down and then start to bawl

And all I see it burned my eyes
burning all inside

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over taking all that's mine
one more time.

Always this teasing 
sometimes I lose faith
where is my strength to hold on
facing existence how can I relate
Do I stand clear or move on

And all I see it burned my eyes
burning all inside

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over taking all that's mine
one more time. [x2]

Falling through this space in time
buried in this hurt of mine
falling slowly like a dream
falling through a world unseen

why can I not break this spell
I'm in darkness, is this hell
falling towards this hole I see
this is how it has to be.

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over taking all that's mine
one more time. [x2]

One more time [x2]
