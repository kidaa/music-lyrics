Lenny Kravitz
What can we scrape together
With just the flesh as evidence
Handfuls of hate
And the bittersweet ambivalence

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
'Cos I am pushin' cobwebs
And I'm folding into myself

Lenny Kravitz
Who will find me under this mean sleep

Cree Summer
How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ?
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ?

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz
You could burn a thousand days
And I would need no other light
You could die a thousand ways
And I'd still love you back to life

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
But my needs rising angry
And my loneliness like quicksand

Lenny Kravitz
Who will find me under this mean sleep

Cree Summer
How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ?
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ?

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I am lost to the longing
I am moulded by the memory

Lenny Kravitz
Had to shut down half my mind

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
Just to still the space you left behind

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
'Cos I am pushin' cobwebs
And I'm folding into myself

Lenny Kravitz
Who will find me under this mean sleep

Cree Summer
How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ?
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ?

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz
Coming back to life

Cree Summer
I had a mean sleep

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean sleep

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz
Coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean, mean sleep over you

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
I had a mean sleep

Lenny Kravitz   Cree Summer
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life

Lenny Kravitz
Coming back to life yeah

 Repeat 'til the end
