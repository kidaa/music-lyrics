thinking positivity
if you wanna be with me
i'll take you to the promised land
come on baby take my hand

stop draggin' sround

higher and higher and higher we get
i'll freak you like a sex-o-lette
you say you wanna be my wife ?
ii'll take you to another life, come on

stop draggin' around

come on baby, take my hand
i'll take you to the promised land

stop draggin' around
