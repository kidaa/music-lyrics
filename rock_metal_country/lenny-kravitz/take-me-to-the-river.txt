Al Green :

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Hey hey

Al green   BB king :

Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

Lenny Kravitz :

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all those things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Al green   BB king :

Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

Sheryl Crow / Lenny Kravitz / Al green / BB King : 

Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't take no more
Take me to the river

BB King / Lenny Kravitz

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
The sixteen candles burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know
Oh won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Al green   BB king :

Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

One more time !

Al green   BB king :

Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground
Take me to the river
