No I don't want love you, 
'Cos I know who you are,
That's why I've been staying away from you,
That is why I ever call,
Huummm, I know that you could possess my body,
And I know you could make me scrawl
I know you'd have me shaken,
Have me climbing the wall
That's why I don't wanna' love you

Lenny Kravitz
'Cos I know how you are
Sure you say you're right on and your righteous, girl
Come with me, I know you'd be right off
'Cos I know you could possess my body, 
I know you could make me crawl,
And just as hard as I fall for you girl, 
Well you know you would fall for me harder
That's why I don't want to love you

'Cos I know what you would do to my heart
You scourge me like a hot iron,
Leave me whining all alone in the dark,
'Cos I know that you would make me suffer 
I know that you would drive me wild  that's right  wild
You would take me in a circle
And when it gather you, I know you'd disappear
That's why I don't wanna' love you

Lenny Kravitz
'Cos I know you like to be in charge,
And with me you know you can't control me, baby,
'Cos you know you drive your car
I have you eating your ego  I don't think so !! 
I'd make it pocket your pride, Oh no
And just as hard as I've been loving you, oh girl, 
Well you know you'd be loving me harder

Lenny   Skin
That's why I ain't gonna' love you

Lenny

Lenny   Skin
That's why I don't wanna love you
No I don't want to love you X7
