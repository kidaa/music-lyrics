Tell me baby why can't you see that I'm feeling down
If you open your eyes you'd see that I'm wearing a frown
You'd think about yourself if you thought I was dead
Aw yeah

Baby baby you walk around like you own this town
Your whole life is a fantasy and I'm playing the clown
You talk behind my back and spend up all my bread

Is there any love in your heart oo yeah
Is there any love in your heart oo

Babe you say I'm the only one
But you're fucking all my friends
Baby all that you care about is Gucci and Mercedes Benz
You're just the kind that's up on all the latest trends

Is there any love in your heart oo yeah
Is there any love in your heart oo
