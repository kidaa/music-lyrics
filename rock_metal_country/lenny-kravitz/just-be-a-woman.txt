You ask me how should Ibe to you?
You ask me to tell you what to do
You ask me how can we make it through
You want me but don't know what to do
And I just want you to be true
Just be a woman, just be a woman

You ask me how can I make you smile?
You ask me how can I make it right?
But darling just take a look inside
The answers are within your own mind
And I just want you to be you
Just be a woman
That's all you got to do
Just be a woman
Just be a woman, Do what you got to do
Just be a woman, that's all you got to do
Just be a woman, that's all I got to say
Just be a woman
