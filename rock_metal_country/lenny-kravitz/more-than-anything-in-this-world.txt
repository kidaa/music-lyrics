More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man 

I'd walk through fire 
Stand in the rain 
I'll go to hell and back 
On a plane 
I'd scale the mountains 
Swim the seas 
I beg for mercy 
Down on my knees 

More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man, hey 

I caused you sorrow 
I've caused you pain 
But love is all we will have to gain 
I searched the whole world, Oh I 
And I want you to be my baby, hey hey. 

More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man, hey 

More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man, hey 

More than anything in this world 
More than anything in this world 
I want you, hey hey 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man, hoo 
More than anything in this world 
I wanna be your man, yeah 
Anything anything, anything, anything
