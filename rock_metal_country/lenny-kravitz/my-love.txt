My love 
Paints the desert sky 
My love 
Walks the hundredth mile 
My love 
Has an angel's smile 
My love 
My love 
Wanna lose my mind inside your head 

My love 
Is a purifier 
My love 
Is my one desire 
My love 
Always walks the earth 
My love 
My love 
Wanna lose my mind inside your bed 
Wanna lose it 
Wanna lose it 
Wanna lose myself in your bed 

Yeah !
