Just out of Monday
Run into a friend 
Down the street, down the street
Where I live 
Ah! Ah! Sad things begin
I could feel from within 
From the message, from the message
He had to give
'Bout a buddy of mine
Running out of time
Somebody past noon, shot across the room 
And now the man no longer lives 
Too bad about him, 
Too sad about him
Don't get me wrong, the man is gone 
But it's a wonder he lived this long 
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was a alley cat 
Ah! didn't care nothing about being black
Ah! Billy Jack 
Can't be no fun  can't be no fun 
To be shot, shot with a hand gun 
Body sprawled out, you without a doubt
Running people out, there on the floor, oh oh oh
Ah! Ah! Bad bloody bloody mess
Shot all up in his chest 
One sided duel, gun and a fool
What a way to go 
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was a alley cat 
Ah! Didn't care nothin' bout being Black
Ah, Ah, Billy Jack 
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
