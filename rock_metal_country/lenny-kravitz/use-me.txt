Mick Jagger:
My friends
Feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me
All you want to do is use me

Lenny Kravitz:
Uh huh but my answer
About all that use me stuff

Mick Jagger:
I, I, I, I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
You can keep on using me

Until you use me up
