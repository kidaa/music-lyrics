Talking 'bout a woman
Talkin' 'bout a man
I just can't seem to get it together
Joining hand to hand
The clock, it ticks and it tocks
But my heart is on the rocks

I'm confused, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views, yeah
I'm confused, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I can't choose

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Let me feel good inside
All I wanna do is love you, love you, love you
Instead of making you cry
But when I come around
I'd just left another on the other side of town

I'm confused, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I can't choose

I'm confused, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I can't choose

You ask me if I love you, baby
And I tell that I do
But don't you ask me if you're the only one, woman
'Cause' I can't say that it's true

Talkin' about a woman
Talkin 'bout a man
I just can't seem to get it together
Join woman to man hand to hand 
The clock it ticks and it tocks
But my heart is on the rocks

I'm confused, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I can't choose

I'm confused yeah, so confused
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I can't choose

I'm confused, yes I am darlin', so confused,
And I got to tell you something's wrong with my views,
I can't choose
I'm confused, I mercy, so confused,
And I've got to tell you something's wrong with my views
I just can't, I just can't choose
Oh yeah baby
It's a dog gone shame
