How many children must die
How many rivers run dry
How many angels must cry
For silver and gold.

Lenny
Why don't we learn
From our past
How many more years
Will we last
'Cause life is just moving so fast
For silver and gold

Vanessa
For Silver and gold
How much more time
Can we waste
How much more land
Be defaced

Lenny
Oh Yeah
'Cause soon we will all be erased
For silver and gold

Vanessa
'Cause our earth should last forever
And our lives forever on, on ...

Lenny
For God gave us all to partake

Vanessa
Why can we just learn to relate
We're pissing on our children's face
For silver and gold.

Lenny   Vanessa
For silver and gold
