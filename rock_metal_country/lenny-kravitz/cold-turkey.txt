Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky 

My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead 

Cold turkey has got me on the run 

My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone 

My eyes are wide open
I can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze 

Cold turkey has got me on the run 
Come on,
Cold turkey has got me on the fucking run 

Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again 

Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell 

Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey, cold turkey, 
Cold turkey, cold turkey, cold turkey, cold turkey, 
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, Oh, oh, oh, oooh
Cold turkey, cold turkey, cold turkey, cold turkey
Yeahhhh
