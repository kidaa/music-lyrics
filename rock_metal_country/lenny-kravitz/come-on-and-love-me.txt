I need you and I need love
I need truth and I need God
I don't know just how to say
But I love you anyway
You and I can't be too strong
Come on and love me

With the stars and moon above
Take me in your arms let love
Rule us in our hearts and in your minds
Just come here babay tell me what you feel
Oh you and I can't wait for that too long
Come on and love me

Lay your body next to mine
You don't have to take off all your cloths ooh
But if the only thing you take off is your mind
You and I gonna have a real good time
Aw you and I can't wait for that too long
Oh come on and love me
Come on and love me
Ooh ho what you feel yeah yeah
Ooh ho what's real
what'cha feel
What'cha feel now
