Remember the times we used to play
We'd sing and we'd dance all damn day
But all I do is sing the blues
But have I forsaken you by telling you
What you must do
And all I do is sing the blues
But I would never lie, let things go by
Leave you in a road to die
I would never ever say good bye

Never gonna say good bye
Never gonna say good bye

Remember the times that we
Used to share
You got to remember the times
That we used to share
That we used to share

But the only way for you to survive
Is to open your heart it will guide
You wanna stay in this world of music and life
You got to turn around
And spread a little love and get high
