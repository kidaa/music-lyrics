You came to me like a dream 
How would I know it was a scheme 
To get me to you 

Your eyes burned like fire 
Through my heart 
Although we were lifetimes apart 

Making mistakes was my game 
Oh your life, your life, I tried to rearrange 
But now I know a better way 

My my my my, my precious love 
My my my my, my precious love 

Now you're a woman 
You've got a child 
And those days, those days 
Of being wild 
They're gone with the past 
But now baby 
You still ain't got no home 
All those endless nights you've had to roam 
But I know a better way 

My my my my, my precious love 
My my my my, my precious love 

Go henry 

Yeah yeah yeah 
My my my my my, my precious love 
My my my my, my precious love 

My my my my my my my precious love 
My my my my, my precious love 
You gonna make me yeah yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ...
