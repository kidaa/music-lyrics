there were times i wasn't kind
and there were times i wasn't even around
and there were times i made you cry
so many times i had to say goodbye
when you want to talk
i'm on the phone
but now baby i am here for you alone

i'm gonna stand by my woman now
i'm gonna stand by my woman now
'cause i can't live my life alone
without a home

there were times i didn't understand
and there were times i waouldn't hold your hand
but now baby now i'm here for you
'cause baby i am so in love with you

i'm gonna stand by my woman now
i'm gonna stand by my woman now
'cause i can't live my life alone
without a home

i'm gonna stand by my woman now
i'm gonna stand by my woman now
'cause i can't live my life alone
without a home

i'm gonna stand by my woman now
i'm gonna stand by my woman now
'cause i can't live my life alone
without a home
stand by my woman now
i'm gonna stand by my woman now

'cause i can't live my life alone
without a home
without a home
