Beyond the 7th sky
There's a room where we are with God
Beyond the sun and moon
Where the angels will be our guards
Where the weather doesn't change
Everyday is summer
As the sands are numbered
Instead of cannonball grey
Do you think it's kinda strange
Or can we be lovers
as the spirit covers our electrified rage
Hold me mama
And we'll fly across the sea
Way beyond the moon and stars and sky
I'm talkin about you and God and I
Now that the time is near
I'm ready I have no fear
I know you're the one my dear
The stars will come out tonite
In time for our sacred flight
Together we'll be for life
And I will burn in your flame
Kiss me baby
Take my hand and come with me
I'm talkin' about the moon and stars and sky
I'm talkin' about you and God and I
Let's take it to the place where life was formed
And to the place where Jesus Christ was born
