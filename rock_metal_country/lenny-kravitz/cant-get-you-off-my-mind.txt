Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul
I don't wanna lose you baby
And I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live my days without you
But for now I'll have to be without you

*chorus*
I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind

Babe can't you see
That this is killing me
I don't want to push you baby
And I don't want you to be told
It's just that I can't breathe without
I feel like I'm gonna lose control
chorus
What are the rules and reasons and the dos and don'ts
Tell me baby tell me baby
What do you feel inside
chorus
