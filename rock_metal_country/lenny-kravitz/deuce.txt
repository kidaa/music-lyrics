You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce!

And baby
Stop cryin' all your tears
And baby
Do the things he says to do

Baby, if you're feelin' good
And baby, if you're feelin' nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce!

And baby, if you're feelin' nice
You know your man is workin' hard
