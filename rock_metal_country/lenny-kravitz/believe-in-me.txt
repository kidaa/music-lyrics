Where's the love we had 
When did it go bad 
Or am I just insecure 
I give all I can
Baby I'm your man
Tell me what you're in this for
Remind me 

I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me

Countless sleepless nights
Never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know you're behind me 

I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me 

I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me 

I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me
To believe in me
To believe in me
To believe in me
