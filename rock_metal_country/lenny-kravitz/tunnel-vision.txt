All I want
Is all you got
Make me happy baby
And I'll make it hot
I don't need no doctor
To tell me what to do
'Cause I know I'm goin'
Straight ahead for you

*chorus*
I've got that tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head 
Lay me down inside your flying bed

All that's yours
And all that's mine
We'll put together baby
And we can combine
We don't need no lawyer
Let's not make this long
We just need a love thing
That's beautiful and strong
chorus x2
Make it funky now
