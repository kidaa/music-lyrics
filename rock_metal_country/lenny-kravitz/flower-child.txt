Dressed in purple velvets 
With a flower in her hair 
Feel her gentle spirit 
As the champa fills the air 
She wears rubys on her fingers 
Tiny bells upon her toes 
She's the finest thing 
I've ever seen 
Love that ring inside her nose 

Flower child yeah, flower child 
Flower child oh yeah 

She's a psychedelic princess 
On a magic carpet ride 
And where her trip will carry you 
Is somewhere you can't find 
She's on a plane of higher consciousness 
Meditation is the key 
She's got her shit together 
'Cause her soul and mind are free 
Free 

Flower child, free yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
Flower child that is 
Flower child, oh yeah 
Flower child yeah 
My little flower child 
Flower child yeah 

She's a child of Martin Luther 
As a freedom fighter she 
Speaks of liberation on the land 
And on the sea 
Her eyes are made of sunshine 
And her lips are jelly sweet 

Flower child yeah 
My little flower child 
Flower child oh yeah 
Flower child yeah 
My little flower child 
Flower child oh yeah 

You gonna free me 
You gonna free me 
You gonna free free free free free yeah.
