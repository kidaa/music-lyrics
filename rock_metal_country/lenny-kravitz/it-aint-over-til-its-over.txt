here we are still together
we are one
so much time wasted
playing games with love

so many tears i've cried
so much pain iside
but baby it ain't over 'til it's over
so many years we've tried
to keep our love alive
but baby it ain't over 'till it's over

how many times
did we give up
but we always worked things out
and all my doubts and fear
kept me wondering
if i'd always be in love

so many tears i've cried
so much pain iside
but baby it ain't over 'til it's over

so many years we've tried
and kept our love alive
but baby it ain't over 'till it's over

so many tears i've cried
so much pain iside
but baby it ain't over 'til it's over

so many years we've tried
and kept our love alive
but baby it ain't over 'till it's over
