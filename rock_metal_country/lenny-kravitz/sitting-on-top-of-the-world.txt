Sittin' on top of the world 
Sittin' on top of the world 

Remember the times we used to play 
We'd sing and we'd dance all damn day 
But all I do is sing the blues 
But have I forsaken you by telling you 
What you must do 
And all I do is sing the blues 
But I would never lie, let things go by 
Leave you in road to die 
I would never ever say good bye 

Never gonna say good bye 
Gonna never yeah, never, 
Never, never, nev' 
Never gonna say good bye 
Oh ... yeah 

Remember the times that we used to share 
You got to remember the times 
That we used to share 
That we used to share 
Yeah yeah 

You got to remember the times 
Remember the times 
That we used to share 
That we used to share 
That we used to 
Share 

That we used to share 
That we used to share 
That we used to share 
That we used to share 

But the only way for you to survive 
Is to open your heart it will guide 
You wanna stay in this world of music and life 
You got to turn around 
And spread a little love and get high 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Get get high, 
Get high.
