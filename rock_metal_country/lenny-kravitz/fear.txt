I smell the fear that rains inside 
The thought of children who must oblige 
To tainted dreams and polluted seas 
The missing moon and melting trees 
A mist of doom and clouds of pain 
A toxic waste and an acid rain 
The passing of our ignorance 
A lifetime spent in abstinence 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
I living in fear, I living in fear 

Conditioned to hate and them to blame 
Their search for God is just the same 
Machines for hearts, how warped a view 
Forgeting that they're human too 
Waiting like a branded steer 
Who first will launch the burning spear 
When every day may be your last 
You think we'd learn from our past 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
I living in fear, I living in fear 
Ouh yeah yeah yeah yeah 

I smell the fear that rains inside 
The thought of so many lives denied 
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag 
And rows and rows of body bags 
No time for tears as the night falls cold 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
The day survivors crawl back in their holes 
As for the rest they're shipped back home 
Home to the rows of white tomb stones 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no, tell you no lies, yeah yeah 
Fear, I living in fear 
Ouh yeah yeah yeah yeah
