baby can't keep on running
all i want you to do is to feel with me yeah
we both are hurting
and it's gonna take a little time
to heal all the wounds and save our family

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
all i ever wanted was love

remember kissing in the moonlight ?
how we held each other all night
all i ever wanted was love

darling darling darling
don't you want to feel good inside ?
it seems i've forgotten how it feels to be
look up to the stars
and ask the heavens
to show you the truth
so that you can be free

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
all i ever wanted was love

remember kissing in the moonlight ?
how we held each other all night
all i ever wanted was love

tell me what's the answer ?
it's gotten so cloudy i just can't see
but you got your life and i got mine
are we even ?
when i know i want you
and baby you want me
all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
all i ever wanted was love

remember kissing in the moonlight ?
how we held each other all night
all i ever wanted was love
