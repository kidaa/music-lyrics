Revolution in their mind, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through. Yeah!

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise of tomorrow bringing peace in any way
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear Yeah!

So you children of the world listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave,
Or you children of today are children of the grave. Yeah!

Children of the Grave
Children of the Grave
