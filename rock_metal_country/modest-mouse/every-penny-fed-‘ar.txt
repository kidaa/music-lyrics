So you spilled every last penny into your car
And it still won't take you where you want to go
So you spilled every last penny into your car
And it still won't take you where you very far at all
So you spilled every last penny into your car
And it still won't even barely leave your home
So you spilled every last penny into your car
And it still won't take you where you need to go
So you spilled every last penny into your car
And it still won't take you where you anywhere at all
