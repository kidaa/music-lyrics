You were right I"m hangin' 'round because
Slight of hand won't separate us from them
You were right I'm underground because
Slight of hand won't separate your body from the dirt you're standing on
today
You're the good things yeah that's you...
You're the icing on the cake on the table at my wake
You're the extra ton of cash on my sinking life raft
You're the loud sound of fun when I'm trying to sleep
You're the flowers on my table when my allergies come out
You're the good things...
And help's not short when you're diggin' your grave
I'll help you dig it
So you're diggin' your grave now you're speakin' my language I'll help you
dig it
