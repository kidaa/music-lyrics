"Here it comes the place and the time that we knew that things could go
wrong"
Walk to your house on my lunch break
Here it comes
"Come inside and pour a drink"
You'll probably tell me everything you think
Here it comes
The place and the time that we knew that things could go wrong
The grass grows green, could you step away from the screen, it doesn't mean
I don't want you to be seen, just not like everyone.
Grass grows green and it's everyone.
You always told me life's a dam that breaks
Here it comes
If you sit still or if you run
Here it comes.
So now we're drownin' in birthday cakes
Here it comes
The place and the time that we knew that things could go wrong
Keep it clean. I didn't mean to be mean. Why does it always seem that I've
never won. Keep it clean and no one's ever won.
The empty promise makers said
"Here it comes"
Make a point to make no sense
Here it comes
Speak about the future in the past tense
Here it comes
"Don't look down." So what'd we do?"
Here it comes
Walkin' around with shit on our shoes
Oh, here it comes
The place and the time that we knew things would go wrong.
