Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed on the big streets
That bleed out on the highways and
Off to others cities built to store and
sell these plastic rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty
Sitting in the parking lot [x2]
Waiting to bleed on the big streets
That bleed out on the highways and
Off to other cities built to make and
store these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty
Sitting in your car with nothing
Waiting to bleed on the big streets
That bleed out on the highways and
Off to other cities built to store and sell
There's nothing
Convenient parking is way back, way back [x3]
