"Wow!" said the broken Californian down
On the beach that used to be by the beach
Town hasn't moved but's getting closer, losing ground
Making better views and close relaxing sounds
Ground sure don't like the way it's treated so now
It's moving back to the sea
Plan to hitch a ride with the river
Cuz deep down plumbing life is too cramped for me
I got wood legs and bow legs and no legs at all
Goddamn! Would you accept a collect call?
Oh no, I don't understand
I got sore eyes and poor eyes and no eyes at all
Goddamn! Would you like to take a fall?
No I don't like this plan
It was a staple of brass tacks and waxed backs
A memo left on the forehead of God
Sent sealed and signed by the saints who sang this song:
"We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation
Then one day, you'll find us sitting
in your chairs with big ideas of stocks and shares."
