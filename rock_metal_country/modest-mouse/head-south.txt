A surf rock man from the land of plenty
Surf rock mess with no surf but pine trees
Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair
And you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the
Shade of the palm tree scene
And said, "Of what a drag!
Oh what a backwards scheme,
Cuz here things go from grey
To grey and back to grey again
And they get green and go to grey
And back to grey again"
So he said," Head south!" [x12]
Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that meat?
You bleached your hair
And you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the
Shape of the palm tree scene
Surrounded, cut off jeans
And cut off jeans and cut off
Jeans are what you mean
When you say, "Head south!" [x12]
