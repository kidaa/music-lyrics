We've got everything
We've got everything
We've got everything down to a science so I guess we know everything 
We know everything
We know everything
We know everything was built to expire so I guess we've done everything 
If we carried it out to sea 
Pushed it over the edge we'd have all been through, 
Well first off Gary got drunk fell asleep in his car til about noon
Flat Top Tony got all messed up split his lip chasing cheap perfume
Well look at our boat in the bay it looks like some sad ass little canoe
We've done everything 
We've done everything
We've done everything like trial by fire so I guess we'll stop trying now
We've tried everything
We've tried everything
We've tried everything half assed and as liars and thats how we've got everything
If we carried it out to sea pushed it over the edge we could have all been through
Well no one even bothered showin' up but we still did what we should have thought through
We crashed in like waves into the stars Didn't want it didn't need it but we knew that we
Could see it so we opened up the door
We receded like waves out of the stars
Didn't want it didn't need it but we knew that we could steal it left it dying on the
Floor 
We've got everything
We've got everything
We've got everything down to a science so I guess we know everything
We've got everything
We've done everything
We've tried everything
We've got everything
We've got everything
