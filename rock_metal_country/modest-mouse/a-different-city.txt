I wanna  live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color T.V.
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color T.V.
Through the cracks in the wall
Slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars
Someone smart said nothin' at all
I'm watching T.V.
I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said, I didn't buy nothin'
So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Oh hit the deck, It's the decal man
Standin' upside down and talkin' out of his pants
I wanna live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color T.V.
