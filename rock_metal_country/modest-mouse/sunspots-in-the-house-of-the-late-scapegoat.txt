it was on the rotating eyes
it was all on the same postcard
it was all on the same damn shirt
said to sleep in the same Sear's camp house
it was all in the great state parks
it was all on the same Greyhound
it was all so many miles
beneath the dirty brown dirt
twenty miles down the islands
the biggest mall on Earth
it was all in the same rest stop
it was wall on the same damn shirt
it was all on the same Greyhound
sunspots
in the house of the late scapegoat
be aware the paint's still peeling
all muscle cars made of lead
I got myself a fine fine fine fine friend
it was all in the next gray ghost
it was all in the same damn place
the parts to pound attractive
your feeling you owe on your size is bleeding
sunspots
