Everywhere everywhere everywhere
It's all so plain it's all a plan
The sky doesn't ever end
The air just gets much thinner further up
You could keep diggin' down and down
A thousand graves down without turnin'
Around or finding hell
You find you're digging up again
Everywhere everywhere everywhere
Willful suspension of disbelief
