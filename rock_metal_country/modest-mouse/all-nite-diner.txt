Yeah, yes, yes
Have I told ya
You could really get it on?
I was at an all night diner
The sign said, "Triple X"
But they were talking about root beer
I'm just sitting down
Thinking about nothing
Looking at the thin air
Breathing up the oxygen
Have I told ya
You could really get it on?
A guy comes up, looking pretty 8-ball
Snaggletooth smile, sits down at my table
Puts his arm around me, starts to share his information
He said, he said, he said [x4] this is what he said
"I have sex, I'm always thinking about the pavement
So I can avoid premature ejaculation"
I got up, remembering to thank him
Better things to do so I'll start drinking
I'm in Tahoka, now I'm gonna hook up
With the parties, unfortunately
No one has any ideas, damn
Have I told ya
You could really get it on?
