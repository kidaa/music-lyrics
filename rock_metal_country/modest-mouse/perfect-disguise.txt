You've got the Perfect disguise and you're lookin' o.k.
From the bottom of the best of the worst, well what can I say
Cuz you cocked your head to shoot me down, down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No cuz I know the score
Need me to fall down, so you can climb up
Some fool ass ladder, well good luck
I hope, I hope there's something better up there
Cuz you cocked your head to shoot me down, down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No cuz I know the score
Well good luck believing every word that's said
I hope you have enough space in your head
I don't know, broke my back
