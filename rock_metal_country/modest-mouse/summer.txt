wake-up we're stealing cars
1996 1997 1998 we're all waiting for the year 2000
just the smell on the summer can make me fall in love
we go to the parties listen to the DJ's
dance dance dance and go crazy
she's a party queen an she's in party heaven
her clock is stuck on late
got a first name basis at 7-11
hold the slip slide taste the sweat it's salty
irrigation ditch and a swimming hole
nation-wide loved the movie
