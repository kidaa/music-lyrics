If food do you please
And you sack all the seas
And it off
Suck it off

Well, treat me like disease
Like the rats and the fleas
Ahaha! Ahaha!

Bang your head like a gong
'Cause it's filled with all wrong
Ahaha! Clang, clang, clang!

If you think you know enough to know you know we've had enough
And If you think you don't, you probably will

Our tails wagged and then fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea

Well, treat me like the sea
Oh-so salty and mean
Ahaha! Oh, ha ha!

Well, treat me like disease
Like the rats and the fleas
Ahahaaa! Haa!

I'll be beating my heart's record for speeding
I'll be beating the record for heart skipping

Oh, the doggone tails, well they fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea
..Well, we just turned around, marched into the sea

Take all that you need 
Let my saxophone free
Till it's gone, till it's gone

Well, this coffee you bleed 
Like the leaves of a tree
Ahaha! Ahaha!

Let's shake hands if you want
But you -- both hands are gone!
Oh, haha! Haha!

Well, treat me like the sea
I'm so salty and mean
Ahaha..
Oh, treat me like the sea
Oh-so salty and mean
Ahaha..

Well, treat me like the leaves
Like the rats and the fleas
Bang your head like a gong
'Cause you call it all wrong
Move your tune
Clang, clang
Clang, clang
Clang, clang
Clang, claaang!

Cut me down like the trees
Like the lumber or weeds
Drink me out of the sea
And then teach me to breathe
Give me forests so dead
I wish death on myself
Give me forests so dead
I wish death on myself
Ahaha! 
Aha!
Aha!
Aha!
Ahaaaaah!

Well, we all saw the rat 
Take a happy encore
For the phone speaks we all
And the running bulls
Ahaha!
March on! March on! March on! March Ooooooon!
Well, march on!
