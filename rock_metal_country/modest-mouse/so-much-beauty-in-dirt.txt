Out of breath and out of cash, find yourself watching M.A.S.H., every night
on the couch. Woman says let's take a drive down south, roll down the
windows and open our mouths taste where we are and play the music loud. Stop
the car, lay on the grass, the planets spin and we watch space pass.Walk a
direction, see where we get. I never knew nothin' so there's nothin' to
forget. Get real drunk and ride our bikes. There's so much beauty it could
make you cry. The rich get money but never what they want. Find ourselves a
new place to haunt. Climb up the fire escape do it 'til the ground looks far
away. Go night swimming, leave our clothes on the ground, when we get busted
we just stand there proud. It's the truth we all been wrong make it up and
let's move on. Playing cards we all get to act sly there's so much beauty it
could make you cry.
