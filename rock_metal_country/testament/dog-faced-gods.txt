[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Peterson, Billy, James]

Of dog faced gods
Through the Nile sands whisper
Of ancient times, mayfly names
Flickered and gone
The blood and honey
Dripping from their jaws
Through the Nile sands whisper
Ancient times, fade into the dawn

Of dog faced gods
Manifest in the night
The sacred rights
Handed down through tiems of old
Dark words of power
Blood upon their tombs
Through incantations
Locusts fly, signaling doom

Confirm who I am
Confort all I can
Conceive sorcery
Corrodes disbelief

[Solo: James]

Of dog faced gods
Dead civilzation
Through priests of power
Invoking life of the ancient one

The blood and honey
Dripping from their jaws
Through the Nile sands whisper
Travel through time to the land unkown

Confirm who I am
Confort all I can
Conceive sorcery
Corrodes disbelief
