[Music: Skolnick, Peterson]
[Lyrics: Souza, Peterson]

I've been a prisoner
Trapped in by fear
Ordered for the rest of my life
Condemned in a jail cell
Ain't seen life in years
Escape is the only way out

[CHORUS :]
Restart my life
Or self destruction
To climb this wall
Of dark construction
Holding the quest for freedom
That beckons me

My sanity is all but gone
My patience is growing very weak
I need to get a hold of myself
I stare at the wall
For the right time has come
Escape must occur on this night

[CHORUS :]
Stand in my way
And I'll run you straight through
There's no one to stop me now
For I'm on the loose
And I'm ready to start
Torture and hell an this town

OVER THE WALL !!!!!!!!

The search will not stop
And hounds will not rest
Till I am back in my cell
For if I am caught,I'll try it again
Over the wall I will go,I will go

[CHORUS :]
