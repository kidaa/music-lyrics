[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Billy, James]

Domestically violent
With razor blade smiles
Infested with anger
A well hidden crime
Teaching those lessons so cruel

Ah, the torment spreads
War inside my head
Please just set me free
You call this... a family

Battered, abusive
There's no wrong or right
When you're enslaved in your room
Hiding from demons
In urban daylight
Knowing that they'll be here soon

Confusion and bruises
And scars left for life
When physical evidence fades
Silently screaming
Just to be loved
Their innocence taken away

Ah, the torment spreads
War inside my head
Please just set me free
You call this... a family

[Solos: Eric, James]

Virtues are shattered
By parents they trust
When all love they give is misued
The next generation
The damaged will learn
To keep spinning wheels of abuse

Ah, the torment spreads
War inside my head
Please just set me free
You call this... a family
