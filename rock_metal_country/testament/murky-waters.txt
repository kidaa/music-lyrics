HOLD YOUR BREATH AFRAID
GRASP THE ROPE IN FEAR
GRIP JUST SLIPS AWAY
YOU YELL BUT NO ONE HEARS...

YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL DROWN

YOUR FRIENDS SHOWED YOU THE WAY
THEY LEFT YOU TO RUN WILD
THEY JUST TURNED AWAY
YOUR ANGERED WITH A SMILE

YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL DROWN
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL BE FOUND OR NOT

DROWING IN THE DARKNESS
LIFE'S...ENDING...SORROW
BODY FEELING LIFELESS
LIFE'S...ENDING...SORROW
THE MINDS AT PEACE AN CONCIOUS
LIFE'S...ENDING...SORROW

WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS NOW
HAVE THEY LET YOU DOWN
THEY CAN'T BRING YOU BACK
THEY JUST LET YOU DROWNED

YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL DROWN
