[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Billy, James]

Suit up for destruction
Death looks behind many faces
Hatred plants its deepest seed
In the most obvious places
Symbols of allegiance
Chaos spells devotion
The master plan is set in motion
Oh,Yeah!!
What the hell are you proud of
Heads held low
Self respect must be carved
Evil poisons taste just like wine
Swallow the lies until you are blind
You're going blind
Now let it flow...
Waiting to deliver
Imposing martial laws of pain
KKK or CIA
They are one and all the same
[Chorus]
Evil poisons taste just like wine
Swallow the lies until you are blind
You're going blind
Can't get to me
Or abuse me
Your racist tears will amuse me
And then you'll bleed...
Now let it flow...
Charismatic leaders
Preach their sermons of ignorance
please take heed soon my friends
promises won't cleanse the sins
[Chorus]
