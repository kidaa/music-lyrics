[Music: Ramirez, Peterson]
[Lyrics: Ramirez, Peterson]

Witches grow restless
The priests are impatient
My legions scream
The gates must be open
Our master repels
A massage of hope
On through the gates we march
The sentinels await
With their sabers in grasp
A vast group locust attack [2]

Attacking with force
As we show no remorse
Obstructing our victims fate
The blood in the chalice
Saluting the fight
All virgins must die this night
Psychotic reaction from a serpents kiss
Is taking the life from our soul
And leading a train of destruction from hell
Finding our way through hells hole !

CURSE OF THE LEGIONS OF DEATH [3]
CURSE OF THE LEGIONS OF DEATH!
PROVOKE THE DEAD! [2]
CURSE OF THE LEGIONS OF DEATH
