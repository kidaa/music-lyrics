BACK IN TIME THE PUNISHMENT
WAS BORN ALL YOU WITCHES BURN
SOME MOTHERS BURNED, BURNED ALIVE
HEAR THE CHILDREN CRY...

CHILDREN CRYING...MOTHERS DYING...

SOME WOULD DIE THE INNOCENT
SOME WOULD DIE A WHORE
SOME SO SCARED THE CHILDREN FLED
CONFUSED BY THIS WORLD

WHY...THEY DON'T WANT TO
BURN...ALIVE...

CAUGHT IN THE BURNING TIMES
WHEN ALL THE WITCHES DIED
STILL HEAR THE CHILDREN CRYING
THE BURNING TIMES...

SOME SAY WHEN YOU FLOAT A WITCH
YOU SET FREE THEIR SOUL
I'VE ALWAYS SAID...BURN THE BITCH
MY SPOKEN WORDS OF OLD

WHY...THEY DON'T WANT TO
BURN...ALIVE...

CAUGHT IN THE BURNING TIMES
WHEN ALL THE WITCHES DIED
STILL HEAR THE CHILDREN CRYING
THE BURNING TIMES...

BACK IN TIME THE PUNISHMENT
WAS BORN ALL YOU WITCHES BURN
SOME PAID THE PRICE, OF THIER CRIMES
CAUGHT IN THE BURNING TIMES

WHY...THEY DON'T WANT TO
BURN...ALIVE...
