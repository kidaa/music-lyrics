[Music: Peterson, Murphy]
[Lyrics: Billy, James]

I am alive
I feel dirt in my eyes
There's no escape when redemption is lost
I'm not a saint
There's no use to looking
No sins to deny
Just my will to go on

Armas of darkness
Embrace me in madness
In my life it's mandatory
Hard to resist you
I still can't forgive you
For sins that I cannot wash away

Hail Mary full of grace
Throw some light upon this race
Intertwining final breath
Now... in the hour of death

[Solo: James]

Bound by the lies
Of constant denial
Pay for my sins that I bear for a child
I'm not a saint
There's no use denying
Falling from grace
Is my reason to go on

Hail Mary full of grace
Put me down, and kick me in my face
Intertwining final breath
Now... in the hour of death
