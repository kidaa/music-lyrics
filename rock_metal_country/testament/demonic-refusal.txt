YOU TAKE MY HAND AND SYMPATHIZE
YOU FELT THE FLESH, YOU REALIZED
YOU TOOK MY WILL, NOW I'M DEPRIVED
SAVE MYSELF, JUST SAVE MYSELF

I...CAN NOT BE TAKEN UNTO
ALL THAT I HAVE CAN NOT BE TAKEN

SHE HAS WAYS MISCHIEVOUS
TAKES YOUR SOUL IN PACT
DEMONIC CHANTS OF MANATU
SAVE YOUR SOUL, JUST SAVE YOUR SOUL

I...CAN NOT BE TAKEN UNTO
ALL THAT I HAVE CAN NOT BE TAKEN

A STRONG WILL IS MY DEFENCE
FOR THE FUTURE AND PAST

I...FEEL WHAT I FEEL
I...SEEN WHAT I'VE SEEN
I...HAVE WHAT I HAVE
ALL I HAVE IS FROM ME...YEAH!!!!

YEAH HE FEEDS ON INNOCENCE
DREAMS THE TASTE OF WAR
SMELLS THE FEAR THAT HE HAS DREAMT
WAKE YOURSELF, JUST WAKE YOURSELF

I...CAN NOT BE TAKEN UNTO

ALL THAT I HAVE CAN NOT BE TAKEN

THE TAROT CARDS ON THE TABLE
SHOWED THE FUTURE AND PAST

[CHORUS]
I...FEEL WHAT I FEEL
I...SEEN WHAT I'VE SEEN
I...HAVE WHAT I HAVE
ALL I HAVE IS FROM ME...

I...AM A PRISONER OF FATE
I'M REFUSING ALL HATE
I...WILL CAST IT AWAY
I...WILL NOT BE A SLAVE

IN THROUGH OUT DEATH I SHALL BE
