[Lyrics: Billy, James, Peterson]

Troubled dreams
Of a wandering nomad
Damned to be all by myself I travelled far
Following bright stars
Through the endless desert sands
Starring off into the sky
Down on Myself
Loneliness brings my demise
Oh,what a nightmare
Here we go
Leave me be
Why must I please them
When I can't even please myself
Deep in thoughts
But I still feel so
Lost in endless despair
Starring off into the sky
Down on myself
Loneliness brings my demise
Oh,what a nightmare
Here we go
As you soon realize
The nights so black I feel blind
Should I keep wandering on
On and on and on
There's just one thing you should know
No I can't take it no more
Two wrongs don't make it right
Right or wrong I can't take it
And in the end you will find
Find me a peace of mind
Forever lost
Severing my thoughts
From the dream I must seek
Time to end
This aggravation
The nomad spirit lives in me
[Chorus]
