[Testament/Peterson]

In regards to the nature used with pacts of magic
Spirits from te vastly deep
Pespond the calls from their broken silence.
Make sure you reach does not exceed your grasp
All that is to be done before you act
In a pact of invoking spirits from the past

Have you lost your mind
The dark souls of time
Ending life!
Ending life!

They see you calling out their names and getting ready
Cat in darkness shouding near
Trough your virtued youth they'll strike a deal
What's to obtain if no pain no gain
But to sell your soul you must be insane
Wrote your name in blood and then they came

You're as good as dead
Te lost souls of time
Envy life!
Envy life!
Life !!!

Have you lost your mind
The dark souls of time
Ending life!
You're as good as dead
Te lost souls of time
Envy life!
Come on down to the house of pain
You ear tem calling
Shouting out their names in vain. Envy life!

In regards to the nature used with pacts of magic
Spirits from te vastly deep
Pespond the calls from their broken silence.
Make sure you reach does not exceed your grasp
All that is to be done before you act
In a pact of invoking spirits from the past

You're as good as dead
Te lost souls of time
Envy life!
Envy life!
Envy life!
Envy life!
