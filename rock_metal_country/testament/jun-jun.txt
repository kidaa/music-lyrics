CAST BEFORE MY EYES DECEIVE ME
A VISION OF MY LIFE
CANNOT SEEM TO HELP MYSELF
THE HELPLESS WON'T SURVIVE
FREE US FROM THE BEDS OF HELL
HEAVENS OVERTHROWN
THE RULER OF THE REAALM IS SEEN
IN EVIL AND OF SORROW

BLESSED IS THE STRENGTH OF MAN
INBEDED LIFE ENTOMBED
FEEDING OFF THE SICKENED
OF MAN AND HIS ABUSE

HELP YOU, HELP ME
SAVE US, AND EVERYBODY!

I FIRST STARTED THINKING I WAS INSANE
TRYED TO TALK BUT COULD NOT REALLY SAY
I TURNED MY PLEASURE INTO THE PAIN
LET REALITY SLIP AWAY!

I HAVE TO FACE MY PUNISHMENT
MY SINS I WILL REPENT!

AS I LOOK TO THE HEAVENS ABOVE
REACH FOR THE SKY TO BE TOUCHED BY THE LOVE!
