PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING A SITUATION
DREAMS...OF NEW..LIES CONFUSED
LIES TO YOU WILL TRUTH SHINE THROUGH
WHAT THE RAIN WON'T WASH AWAY
THE SUN IS BLACK WITH SHADES OF GRAY
REFLECTIONS OF THESE STRANGER DAYS
SEEN THROUGH NEW EYES
DIE THROUGH OLD...

NEW EYES...EYES...LIES
CONFLICTING WORLDS UPON YOUR BACK
THE WEIGHT WILL FATE UNDO
SEEN THROUGH EYES OF NEW...
CRUCIFY ME SANCTIFY ME...NOW
LIVE THROUGH NEW EYES
DIE THROUGH OLD

NEW...NEW EYES OF OLD
LIVE...DREAM..DIE

DESTINED TO REPEAT
DOOMED TO FORGET [2X]

OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW
NIEVE AND BLIND A CURSE FOR OUR TIME
WE LIVE OUR LIVES DAY BY DAY
OUR HEARTS BLEED WITH FEAR...LIES
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE A CHANGE
WE WON'T SURVIVE THESE STRANGE DAYS

CRUCIFY ME SANCTIFY ME...NOW
SEEN THROUGH NEW EYES DIE THROUGH OLD

NEW...NEW EYES OF OLD...[2X]
DESTINED TO REPEAT...DOOMED TO FORGET...[X2]
NEW EYES OF OLD [2X]
