[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Billy]

[Solo: Eric]

See the sun as the day is done
Life is of the broken ones
Some will stray as time will come
Al their lives, the live it well
Red man proud and giving hell
Some stand and shining tall

Can you hear them call

See the sun as it's setting still
Tears fall from a warrior
Damn those who I feel

Set a trail to the promised land
Mother and child holding hand in hand
Through the snow or through the sands

All across the land...

Full moon's rising from the sky, a warrior's riding
Ride with the wind
So far away, the spirits will guide you
No more sorrow
Don't look back, your freedom will follow
Flying so free
Can't you see... on the trail of tears

[Solos 1 3: James]
[Solo 2: Eric]

Full moon's rising from the sky, a warrior's riding
Ride with the wind
So far away, the spirits will guide you
No more sorrow
Don't look back, your freedom will follow
Flying so free
Can't you see... on the trail of tears
