Eyes of wrath
The beast is on your back
Razorblade slice your neck
Slowly tear you down
Takes another life
To feed his bloody lust
Random crime spree attack
There's no random at all

Dead city nights
Another daughter's done
Another victim of circumstance
Took the wrong way home
Can you hear the screams
The music of the dead
A ritual of broken flesh
Annoints the silver blade

No one lives forever
There is no forever
And I'll tell you why
Rage, Rage soothes the pain
Pain, Pain soothes the rage
Lash out in anger
that never will chance
I can never escape
Rage, Rage Soothes the pain
Pain, Pain Soothes the rage
Rage, Pain
