Say hello again, my friends
I've got to go
The ritual calls to me
Silent insanity
You really thought you'd never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why they can't see 
Revelations breaking through
The truth distorts
Untimely accident
Your precious mind is lost
Try to regain again my friend
Your sanity
The ritual calls to me
Melodic agony
You really never thought you would never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why they can't see 
Free away your mind
Walk behind the blind
Kill yourself killing time
Oooh, what'cha gonna say
When you are on your way
On your darkest day
Hey Darkest day
say goodbye again, my friends
I'm coming home
The ritual calls to me
Distant reality
Unless images expose
What I can't see
The ritual call to me
Won't ever set me free
You really thought you'd never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why they can't see 
Fry away your mind
Walk behind the blind
Kill yourself killing time
