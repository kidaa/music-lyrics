[Music: Christian, Peterson]
[Lyrics: Christian]

Damn the machine the system's corrupted
Abusive power is everywhere
Our elected officals, pass laws to help
But who's paying them off
And in the end, we the people pay
Such a heavy price, just for being alive

And if this country was really free
We'd make paper from hemp and let the forest live
But corporate America, and billion dollar industries
Have so much power
Yet they stand to lose
Too much fucking money
There's nothing we can do... but...

Take back all that we've lost
At any price that it costs
Our freedom was worth fighting for
Resistance now or nevermore

[Solo: James]

And what about the CIA
What the fuck is their real job anyway
Starting civil wars in Third World countries
Importing heroin from the far east
Talk about cocaine, neither kept away
From the youths of today... now
There's nothing we can do... but...

Take back all that we've lost
At any price that it costs
Our freedom was worth fighting for
Resistance now or nevermore
