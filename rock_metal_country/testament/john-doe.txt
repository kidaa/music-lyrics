HE DIED ON THORAZINE
LOST LIFE AND ANY HOPES
LAID HIM DOWN ON A BED OF STEEL
DOWNTOWN AT THE CITY MORGUE

[CHORUS:]
JOHN DOE...A MAN HAUNTED BY HIS PAST
JOHN DOE...HIS SOUL WILL NEVER REST

HE WAS RAISED AS AN ORPHAN
ABUSE VICTIM AS A CHILD
DREAMING HAUNTING MEMORIES
MADE JOHN DOE TAKE HIS OWN LIFE
JOHN DOE...A MAN HAUNTED BY HIS PAST
JOHN DOE...REALIZE THAT YOUR DEAD

HE WHO IS VICTIMIZED CAN NEVER GRASP
NEVER EVER KNOWING WHAT IS LOVE
HE WAS A BITTER MAN AN ONLY SON
NEVER EVER KNOWING WHAT IS...LOVE...NO LOVE

TAKE HEED TO MY WARNING
EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT BE WRONG
FULFILL LIFE FULL OF LOVE
OR YOU'LL END UP JUST LIKE JOHN
JOHN DOE...A MAN HAUNTED BY HIS PAST
JOHN DOE...REALIZE THAT YOUR DEAD
