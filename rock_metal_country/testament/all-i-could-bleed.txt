[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Billy]

I like to dominate
I create your fate
Many years gone by
I rule society
You cannot be me
I am the master

Can't you hear me, breathing for you
Do not ignore
Reach out to me, put your knife through me
Watch me bleed for you... yeah... right

Try to retaliate
I release your hate
Why don't you bleed for me
What do you need to prove
I can see through you
You're not the master

Can't you see me, dying for you
Do not ignore
Reach out to me, put your knife through me
Watch me bleed for you... dying... dying...
All I could bleed

Can't you understand
Grab life by the hand
Where's democracy
I gave all I could bleed

[Solos: 1   3: Eric]
[Solos: 2   4: James]

Fuck government
Land is of the free
Don't take away
Your two bit society
Dying for your greed
Now watch them bleed...
Yeah... all I could bleed
