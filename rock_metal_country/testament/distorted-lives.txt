I'M SO DISTORTED, THAT I'M FADING AWAY
HUMAN DESTRUCTION HAS NOW SEALED OUR FATE

THE TRUTH IS WAR
THERES SUFFERING
I AM A STRONGER MAN
MAN WHO I AM...I'M DISTORTED LIVES...

I'VE SEEN THE WORLD SUFFER HUMAN DISTINCTION
I'VE SEEN THROUGH EYES OF RAGE
IT'S TIME TO STAND AND RISE

AND FACE THE WAR
AND SUFFERING
THE WORLD WE SCORN IS OUR
WORLD UNCAPTURED...

DARK MACHINES THAT SHADE THE LIGHT
WON'T LET YOU UNDERSTAND
I SIDE WITH INNOCENCE
AND HAIL FOR RESISTANCE...RESISTANCE [2X]

DARK DISEASE THAT TAKES THE LIFE
OF ALL OUR FELLOW MAN
NO TIME FOR IGNORANCE
SALVATION HERE IT COMES AGAIN...

I'VE WATCHED THE EARTH, SLOWLY WITHER AWAY
HUMAN DESTRUCTION HAS NOW SEALED OUR FATE

THE TRUTH IS WAR
AND SUFFERING
I AM A STRONGER MAN
MAN WHO I AM, I AM MAN
DISTORTED LIVES, YOU SINNERS SIGH
SOCIETY NEEDS...DISTORTED LIVES
