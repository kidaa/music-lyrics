[Music: Peterson]
[Lyrics: Billy, James]

Burial of a human being
A man before a boy
Born to fight in another man's world
Not a world where there's a war

Born relihiously
Truth is what they see
Death won't come form peace
Who fuels this war

[Solo: Eric]

Sacred ground of life
Burnt remains of the dead
Bodies lay to rest
Spirits of the earth

Rancid man, burned alive
Too blind to see what's wrong from right
Locked inside this cage
So many times blood has poured
Walk with shadows
Hear the shades of war... forever more

Brought into this world of bitter pain
Are we safe... or just insane

[Solo: James]

Rancid man, burned alive
Too blind to see what's wrong from right
Darkness veils their way
So many times blood has poured
Walk with shadows
Hear the shades of war... forever more
