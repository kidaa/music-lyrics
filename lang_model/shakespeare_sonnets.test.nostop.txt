which fortified her visage from sun
often reading what contents bears
her hair nor loose nor tied formal plat
upon whose weeping margent she was set
enswathed seald curious secrecy
court city had let go by
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
youthful suit was gain grace
each eye saw him did enchant mind
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
came additions yet their purposed trim
young old sexes both enchanted
lands mansions theirs thought assignd
'yet did not as some equals did
put by past perils her way
though reason weep cry 'it thy last'
have suffering youth some feeling pity
so much less shame remains
paled pearls rubies red as blood
annexions fair gems enrich'd
''lo all these trophies affections hot
hallow'd sighs burning lungs did raise
spend her living eternal love
upon moment did her force subdue
must victory us all congest
stale example when thou wilt inflame
leave battery make 'gainst mine
flame through water which their hue encloses
there white stole chastity daff'd
blush at speeches rank weep at woes
naked concealed fiend he cover'd
o all borrow'd motion seeming owed
whiles both his youth virtue did intend
even hearts memories men
one superlative above rest
not he was above spleenful sense
what they do special work
which harvest did yield again crop
not fruitlessly prodigal expense
shuns glad sleights ensnaring vice
if his fate heaven had decreed
affecting fashions nor addicted wholly
seemed rather answers which wise embrace
so his mind body made an inn
clean tempered moderation steady trust
as much glory good
justice by wrong sifted embane
by fair demeanor he had won repute
how such man was sadly overthrown
th' unsteady change his fantastic forms
here shall reckoned up constant faith
when all shall turn dust from whence came
pities not thy sad sudden wrong
confess love was too remiss
t' enlarge thoughts was hindered at first
but here trust have discharged now
whereby if thou live posterity
measure thy course life false pretenses
presuming still sees even night
true 'tis this man whiles yet he was man
ready way commendation
he was not so but serious awe
his observation discreet discerning
wherein not any one thing comprehends
most true presage he discharged same
hence sprung deadly fuel revived
robbed virtue follower so true
whiles not doubting whereinto enters
according tenor saw
might manner reproved guilt
second brother who was next begot
washed white blood from earth hence have not gone
rebound gross arguments upon their heart
which being crossed gives matter bewailing
grave his ever empty womb
shall not abridge commendable thank
which underneath roof safe content
does think most safety doth remain above
birth blood ancestors are none ours
remembrance their worth may preserve
look hither then enjoy youth
his flourishing fair long lived deserts
leading by his example path
hath most share loss hers
such was separation here constrained
includes all excellence can displayed
undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now
now if have leveled mine account
who if were plenty still would want
but whether doth stream mischance
lordship's all duty
girdle embracing flames waist
unlock'd treasure his happy state
an expired date cancelld ere well begun
perchance his boast lucrece' sovereignty
neglected all swift intent he goes
virtue would stain o'er silver white
either's colour was other queen
those two armies would let him go
little suspecteth false worshipper
which having all all could not satisfy
he stories her ears her husband's fame
doth yet his fair welkin once appear
save thieves cares troubled minds wake
they scatter unloose from their bond
honour wealth oft wealth doth cost
pawning his honour obtain his lust
now serves season they may surprise
his falchion flint he softly smiteth
what following sorrow may this arise
spots stains love's modest snow white weed
some loathsome dash herald will contrive
or what fond beggar but touch crown
when thou shalt charge so black deed
as revenge or quittal such strife
thus graceless holds he disputation
where her beloved collatinus lies
self love had never drownd him flood
heart shall never countermand mine eye
so cross him their opposite persuasion
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
threshold grates door have him heard
being lighted by light he spies
he takes accidental things trial
merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
eye heaven out misty night
gazeth her yet unstained bed
whether she reflects so bright
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
pearly sweat resembling dew night
but life lived death death life
what he beheld he firmly doted
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
his eye commends leading his hand
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'd up eyes
wrapp'd confounded thousand fears
wounding itself death rise up fall
under what colour he commits this ill
where thou patience must will abide
only he hath an eye gaze beauty
which falcon towering skies
kill thine honour thy life's decay
'but if thou yield rest thy secret friend
blemish will never forgot
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
midst sentence so her accent breaks
such black payment as thou hast pretended
sighs whirlwinds labour hence heave thee
'in tarquins likeness did entertain thee
what darest thou not when once thou art king
where subjects' eyes do learn do read do look
draw not thy sword guard iniquity
o how are they wrapp'd infamies
turns not but swells higher by this let
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
'so let thy thoughts low vassals thy state'
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
her tears should drop them perpetually
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
living death pain perpetual
he thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she prays she never may behold day
upon cheeks what helpless shame feel'
black stage tragedies murders fell
his wonted height yet ere he go bed
silver shining queen he would distain
seasoning earth showers silver brine
'make not object tell tale day
will couple reproach tarquins shame
as ere this was pure collatine
honour lost drone bee
talk'd virtue o unlook'd evil
plagued cramps gouts painful fits
hold their cursed blessed fortune long
'o opportunity thy guilt great
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
being so bad such numbers seek thee
justice feasting while widow weeps
collatine would else have come
swift subtle post carrier grisly care
time's office fine hate foes
'to fill worm holes stately monuments
tame unicorn lion wild
could prevent this storm shun thy wrack
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
time see one by alms doth live
teach curse him thou taught'st this ill
greatest scandal waits greatest state
'out idle words servants shallow fools
vain spurn at confirm'd despite
kill both thyself her yielding so'
fear'd by tarquins falchion slain
poor helpless help treasure stoln away
nor laugh his companions at thy state
tongue shall utter all mine eyes sluices
revealing day through every cranny spies
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
sometime 'tis mad too much talk affords
see salve doth make wound ache more
relish nimble notes pleasing ears
keep thy sharp woes waking wretched
will find out there will unfold
'to kill myself' quoth she 'alack what were
when both were kept heaven collatine
through which may convey this troubled soul
'tis honour deprive dishonour'd life
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
how was overseen thou shalt see
fleet wing'd duty thought's feathers flies
but as earth doth weep sun being set
no cause but company her drops spilling
wherein stamp'd semblance devil
not devour'd but which doth devour
dying fear through all her body spread
'but tell girl when went' there she stay'd
repetition cannot make less
cause craves haste will soon writ'
health thy person next vouchsafe t' afford
lest he should hold her own gross abuse
then eye interprets ear
as lagging fowls before northern blast
when silly groom god wot was defect
blushing him wistly him gazed
pausing means mourn some newer way
many dry drop seem'd weeping tear
such sweet observance this work was had
face either cipher'd either's heart
wagg'd up down from his lips did fly
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
griped an armed hand himself behind
through their light joy seemed appear
find face where all distress stelld
her blue blood changed black every vein
'poor instrument' quoth she'without sound
this load wrath burning troy doth bear
plague private sin general
once set ringing his own weight goes
onward troy blunt swains he goes
he entertaind show so seeming just
rich built ilion skies were sorry
'it cannot be' quoth she'that so much guile'
came tarquin armed so beguiled
are balls quenchless fire burn thy city
she tears senseless sinon her nails
though woe heavy yet seldom sleeps
brings home his lord other company
he hath no power ask her how she fares
three times sighs she gives her sorrow fire
where no excuse can give fault amending
from alas thy lucrece not free
i'll murder straight then i'll slaughter thee
never forgot mighty rome
or at least this refuge let find
grief away stops his answer so
which speechless woe his poor she attendeth
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies' harms'
may pure mind foul act dispense
'no no' quoth she 'no dame hereafter living
harmful knife thence her soul unsheathed
from purple fountain brutus drew
about mourning congealed face
where shall live now lucrece unlived
no more can see what once was
then key cold lucrece' bleeding stream
weak words so thick come his poor heart's aid
yet neither may possess claim they lay
'my daughter' 'my wife' clamours filld
but now he throws shallow habit by
his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
kiss'd fatal knife end his vow
which being done speedy diligence
thy self thy foe thy sweet self too cruel
but thou none lov'st most evident
beauty still may live thine or thee
if time have any wrinkle graven there
'truth needs no colour his colour fixed
love not less though less show appear
sweets grown common lose their dear delight
dulling lines doing disgrace
have from forests shook three summers' pride
ere were born was beauty's summer dead
fair kind true varying other words
hand foot lip eye brow
wide world dreaming things come
while he insults o'er dull speechless tribes
even as when first hallowed thy fair name
as from soul which thy breast doth lie
save thou rose thou art all
harsh featureless rude barrenly perish
askance strangely but by all above
guilty goddess harmful deeds
nor double penance correct correction
moan th' expense many vanished sight
all those friends which thought buried
thou all they hast all all
'had friend's muse grown this growing age
ugly rack his celestial face
make travel forth without cloak
him bears strong offence's cross
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
without thy help by borne alone
as thou being mine mine thy good report
whilst this shadow doth such substance give
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
when thou art all better part
which time thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
so great sum sums yet canst not live
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
kill spites yet must not foes
chide thy beauty thy straying youth
thou dost love her because thou know'st love her
all day they view things unrespected
through heavy sleep sightless eyes doth stay
as soon as think place where he would
these present absent swift motion slide
send them back again straight grow sad
quest thoughts all tenants heart
painted banquet bids heart
each trifle under truest bars thrust
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come part
shall reasons find settled gravity
unfair which fairly doth excel
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
when swift extremity can seem but slow
can bring him his sweet up locked treasure
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
grecian tires are painted new
sweet odour which doth live
when shall fade verse distills truth
shall pace forth praise shall still find room
thy hungry eyes even till they wink fulness
upon hours times desire
save where are how happy make those
without accusing injury
second burthen former child
subjects worse have given admiring praise
if ten thine ten times refigured thee
crawls maturity wherewith being crowned
heavy eyelids weary night
play watchman ever thy sake
doth half glory sober west
but slave slavery sweet'st friend must
perforce am thine all
thou usurer put'st forth all use
not once vouchsafe hide will thine
swear thy blind soul was thy 'will
nothing something sweet thee
whereto judgment heart tied
unlearned world's false subtleties
our faults by lies flattered
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
pointing each his thunder rain wind
tongue tied patience too much disdain
mad slanderers by mad ears believed
any sensual feast thee alone
thou shalt find merits not reproving
by self example mayst thou denied
whilst thy babe chase thee afar behind
tempteth better angel from side
breathed forth sound said 'i hate'
from heaven hell flown away
eat up thy charge this thy body's end
th' uncertain sickly appetite please
who art as black as hell as dark as night
so vexed watching tears
all those beauties whereof now he's king
rich proud cost outworn buried age
time will come take love away
nor gates steel so strong but time decays
purest faith unhappily forsworn
save die leave love alone
beggared blood blush through lively veins
right sepulchres were shorn away
want nothing thought hearts can mend
thy fair flower add rank smell weeds
attending his golden pilgrimage
crow flies heavens sweetest air
then thou alone kingdoms hearts shouldst owe
when perhaps compounded am clay
do more than mine own desert
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
consumed which was nourished by
spirit thine better part
as 'twixt miser his wealth found
or gluttoning all or all away
love are still argument
mouthed graves will give thee memory
found such fair assistance verse
arts thy sweet graces graced
he robs thee pays thee again
or else receiv'st pleasure thine annoy
sings this thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
whilst he upon soundless deep doth ride
know shames praises from tongue
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
thy black fairest judgment's place
revenge upon self present moan
thou dost beguile world unbless some mother
die single thine image dies thee
beated chopt tanned antiquity
though once gone all world must die
therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
true plain words by thy true telling friend
speaking worth what worth doth grow
which should example where equal grew
being fond praise which makes praises worse
most praise add something more
above mortal pitch struck dead
enough thou know'st thy estimate
comes home again better judgement making
thou losing shalt win much glory
against thy reasons making no defence
must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
shifts but his place still world enjoys
come rearward conquered woe
some their wealth some their body's force
having thee all mens pride boast
than which thy humour doth depend
thy looks thy heart other place
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
though self only live die
making lascivious comments thy sport
some say thy grace youth gentle sport
if thou wouldst use strength all thy state
widowed wombs after their lords' decease
heavy saturn laughed leaped him
as shadow these did play
third nor red nor white had stoln both
right honorable henry wriothesly
sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him
if thou wilt deign this favour thy meed
this she seizeth his sweating palm
she red hot as coals glowing fire
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
wishing her cheeks were gardens full flowers
still he sullen still he lours frets
upon this promise did he raise his chin
'o pity' 'gan she cry 'flint hearted boy
sake hath learnd sport dance
'touch but lips those fair lips thine
these blue veind violets whereon lean
o'erworn despised rheumatic cold
'bid discourse will enchant thine ear
love so light sweet boy may
herbs their smell sappy plants bear
by this love sick queen began sweat
souring his cheeks cries 'fie no more love
heat have from thence doth little harm
'what am thou shouldst contemn this
thou art no man though mans complexion
sometimes her arms infold him band
within this limit relief enough
foreknowing well if there he came lie
time spent her object will away
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
his eye which scornfully glisters fire
what cares he now curb or pricking spur
round hoof'd short jointed fetlocks shag long
through his mane tail high wind sings
cool shadow his melting buttock lent
all swoln chafing down adonis sits
but when heart's attorney once mute
note fighting conflict her hue
o what war looks was then between them
this beauteous combat wilful unwilling
o give lest thy hard heart do steel
thus she replies 'thy palfrey as he should
throwing base thong from his bending crest
take advantage presented joy
'who wears garment shapeless unfinish'd
dismiss vows feigned tears flattery
or were deaf thy outward parts would move
empty
wreck seaman tempest field
looks kill love love by looks reviveth
till his breath breatheth life her again
he cheers morn all earth relieveth
or ocean drench'd or fire
but thy piteous lips no more had seen
so thou wilt buy pay use good dealing
measure strangeness unripe years
do summon us part bid good night
whereon they surfeit yet complain drouth
blindfold fury she begins forage
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what though rose have prickles yet 'tis pluck'd
sick heart commands mine eyes watch
he her belly falls she her back
as those poor birds helpless berries saw
but thou told'st thou wouldst hunt boar
whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
whose full perfection all world amazes
saw'st thou not signs fear lurk mine eye
as air water do abate fire
an image thyself all staind gore
uncouple at timorous flying hare
many musets through which he goes
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
'then shalt thou see dew bedabbled wretch
applying this so so
all but rob thee kiss
'and therefore hath she bribed destinies
surfeits imposthumes grief damnd despair
earth would breed scarcity
'so thyself thyself art made away
by this black faced night desire's foul nurse
then little heart were quite undone
'call not love love heaven fled
love surfeits not lust glutton dies
homeward through dark laund runs apace
whereat amazed as one unaware
'ay me' she cries twenty times 'woe woe'
if pleased themselves others they think delight
lo here gentle lark weary rest
there lives son suck'd an earthly mother
some twine about her thigh make her stay
now she knows no gentle chase
soldiers when their captain once doth yield
second fear through all her sinews spread
here kennelld brake she finds hound
clapping their proud tails ground below
'grim grinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
now nature cares not thy mortal vigour
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
wash foul face sluttish ground
was not she calld him all naught
''tis not fault boar provoked tongue
tells him trophies statues tombs stories
trifles unwitnessed eye or ear
or as snail whose tender horns being hit
who king perplexed his throne
his soft flank whose wonted lily white
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes' red fire
having no fair lose need not fear
'to see his face lion walk'd along
would bring him mulberries ripe red cherries
who did not whet his teeth at him again
she looks upon his lips they are pale
'wonder time' quoth she 'this spite
bottom poison top o'erstraw'd
'it shall suspect where no cause fear
sith his prime death doth love destroy
says within her bosom shall dwell
'here was thy father's bed here breast
holding their course paphos where their queen
then conceit this inconstant stay
whence hast thou this becoming things ill
love too young know what conscience
he contented thy poor drudge
all vows are oaths but misuse thee
his love kindling fire did quickly steep
but found no cure bath help lies
this brand she quenched cool well by
now stand top happy hours
who will believe verse time come
true rights termed poet's rage
every fair from fair sometime declines
pluck keen teeth from fierce tiger's jaws
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
an eye more bright than theirs less false rolling
so not as muse
as any mother's child though not so bright
which thy breast doth live as thine
or some fierce thing replete too much rage
o learn read what silent love hath writ
now see what good turns eyes eyes have done
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
lord love whom vassalage
puts apparel tattered loving
keep drooping eyelids open wide
when day's oppression not eased by night
but day doth daily draw sorrows longer
yet these thoughts self almost despising
no form delivers heart
or whether doth mind being crowned
mine eye well knows what his gust 'greeing
tan sacred beauty blunt sharp'st intents
which alters when alteration finds
if this error upon proved
book both wilfulness errors down
even so being full ne'er cloying sweetness
what potions have drunk siren tears
ruined love when built anew
summer's green all girded up sheaves
needs must under transgression bow
but trespass now becomes fee
no am am they level
or at least so long as brain heart
no time thou shalt not boast do change
thy records what see doth lie
under blow thralled discontent
or laid great bases eternity
hence thou suborned informer true soul
yet fear her o thou minion her pleasure
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
since saucy jacks so happy are this
mad pursuit possession so
so should beauty which hold lease
mistress' eyes are nothing sun
grant never saw goddess go
