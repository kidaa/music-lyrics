they blazed a trail i dared to run
a pretty maze emptiness i've said the hell
i'm not suposed to be scared of anything but i dont know where i am
i'm feeling weak and weary walking through this world alone
i'm running shaking
but i'm going through changes changes
we'll always be ready because we will always be there
we'll always be ready because we will always be there
citizen soldiers holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
what will we do what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
now we're crying
now you're here
welcome to my world
four or five
you werent there for me i was there for you
it's all a bad dream
tell me why
wont turn away
already here
i'm not built that way
is nothing there to fear
come on wait a minute
maybe i see another way
i've been on my knees for a long time
you think i've been in this
one more wrong will make it right
cause i dont care this time
dont tell me how life is
i'm falling into this again yeah
i'm going down in flames
and i dont think i can look at this the same
the miles just keep rolling

but your still with me in my dreams
you always listen to me

and what do i see the only thing that gets me through this is i feel and i feel you
theres a fear in me its not showing
my friends is laughing and its not what we have
oh but i wont go
theres a will in me and now its gonna show
how do you know where you're going
if you're afraid to fight
memories have left you broken
then i guess you never will
to get you to say that i'll try
like it's the only one you've got
to ease my troubled mind
i really dont mind what happens now and then
but still your secrets i will keep
will you be there holding my hand
with my superhuman might
lately i'm so tired of waiting for you
living in this cell
and let me be myself
let me be myself
let me be myself
feel no sorrow feel no pain
everybody's got to cross that line
live and let me learn
and i'll live on to another damn day
this will fall away
this is getting old
off of life's little edge
you know i'll be dead
now slave to the grind
same old song world moves
but i dont have the time
if you dont understand man
is not enough of me
maybe it's not worth what he gives away
they bind him to the life he's left behind
now only consumes me
'cause i was thinkin about leavin today
hoppin on a train and we'll burn up the tracks
maybe maybe we'll just see
forever is never too long
it gets me closer to the line

trifling the slack no head gating
i thought about my scene today
in the summer of love
we got a thing that cant be sold
oh i declare by the power vested in me
you know i'm singing out things you mumble from a lack of resound
in times of change or the same old thangs
wild and lost speed mad
unfolds to my inner devils sheer delight
electricity we store it up
hey you cant run andhide when the 'psybin trip is on
we trip the 'shrooms fantastic
boom boom you got the spinning of the room
we trip the 'shrooms fantastic
all the congs that i've sung for you
this is what i ask for
held over from a future would i've come to you so listen
just get him out of here he's making me sick
that makes me feel
nippin on a cat
and you were stuck with beavis
on the one you never heard before
and when we're gone bailin on the bus
being up on the mindspin
when all of a sudden
is your life in the physical
being up on the mindspin
from the pain
a paper trail
is the truth so bad
you should take a tip from the one frank
party's in the crates i scan step into the realm
it's just begunlike stolen bikes on the blacktop
your rhymes have been outmoded
kickthe fuckin heroin i speak from experience
i want your fish right by me
our morning glory every time that we wake
cant say it any better
it's copesetic if you let it so set it up and keep the down stream down and up stream up
forever together and then i kiss
sways away the haze
follow me now
jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why you're here
then again bring a friend
how can you say that you're blue
the pleadies will smash out of taurus
strengthen my grasp
is am i really deserving
you're cut off and lonely
right now we corrupt
with dope buddha's come to the stage we are attackin
with the one that i call brine shrimp
with dexterity and goes on and on and on
when we're on the road p nut rolls it up
i didnt let him break me he's just another human
never could see my homey comin till he passed
he didnt believe the day would come when he would get his top
high jump the slump open up fot eh revy horton heat
respect the space of your sister and your brother
how about some knocks on wood some so far it's so good any day
i'm gonna let you know that i said
and we go on like it aint no thing
all are endowed but few are gifted
how to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
complete props to my crew this is what we do
i've come this far to bring in the goods
and i said just let him smell you hold out your hand
600 freebie and i gots my job
i am a simpleton by choice
you'll never reach your reward
everything you do it comes back to you whatever it may be
from the beginning radiant energy's
empty
in the worldwide revolution
the beginning of the end
in the suns kingdom
thinking of a plan a way to stay on top of it
nothin to say but that's ok
but the blame lies not with those suits for trying
my economy seems to be in words not action actually ya see yes
my pretty oh oh prisoner
a laser lights pinpoints the top of my dome
i believe that you know more
is there any love out here let me know
that punk is a coward let that be told i hear voices in the night thatare electric
you're causing me a mental glitch
how can i loveyou after dying
because i'm above it youhurt someone i love
dont stay home this time now dont stay home
because i sat alone onthis past christmas i deserved to be alone
dont stay home this time no dont say no
explosive eruption beyond compare and
let me tell you 'bout my baby
chalk it up as another dialectic
grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you
hear it from the dover's mouth
because it's like that so dont talk back
i raise my glass and say she's the one

but to you it's a stupid dumb stigma
we've changed a lot and then some some
and if i ever dont thank you you
we've changed a lot and then some some
and if i ever dontthank you you
the soul that you have is electricity
the same force that flows through every circuit
what do you think we've been saying
now that i'm back to a pushing pen
the ones who aggravate you most
feels like standing still
for eons and eons
comin on fast it's getting' digital
but can we handle it
people want pt they want au
move forth the species
i feel trapped i gotta adapt
evolution has exponential timing
and just be para paranoid
it could be used for good and would
come on now come on now
and i'm what you might call a heretic
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
we stand alone with the group that's new
i am sly in the mix i am the mix master
p to the n to the u to the t
super dumb lyrics make you think i'm a clown
it's a question of whether live positive well i give
to the sharp ass rocks slippin on us but we rock
empty

and down your throat
i'll be bustin out rhymes in a triplet form
fire water call it liquid rapture
i got the shakes and jitters
of broken liquored people get the picture
the voices and the music and the noise is getting loud

the more that i try
the more it will spin
i lost where i was going
the vice the curse the date the gate relate
take out the earth the bass is gone
my day wasnt promised me each death it brings reminding me we
screen rising scenes from the lost world shapes hard to tell
one in the hand
absence of agony
serendipitous my travels throughout time
sweetness is your bein zen human walkin
changing form again
i grab a moment like a thief and then i make it mine
one in the hand
delusions plaguing everybody
i rock the mic with a sweet lean
gifted in the heart lies our technology

times are weird all this static
fuckin wish they had
son you're a liberator
smoke your booty weed
listen to the drummer just listen to the strings
sparks flying your laughter is a symphony
on the scales of desire your absence weighs
more than someone else's presence
it's all to cheese and regret dont fret just push it away
remember i said it one day you'll regret it
but that's nothin home team i aint got to my ace in the whole yet
it runs in our family
with the words staying me slow

confusing use of time
on and on it's anybody's guess cuz no one's at the wheel at the front of
so now i visit the world
jump up and down cus that's the 311 style
empty
now dont scream dont fight
feeling helpless repeating the same
social engineering keeps us separated

looking down down down at the ground
by the other's selfish rage
a hot girl hot night

then you come on back tomorrow you can do it again
and shine a bright light on a sore subject
it's fading too fast
but we cannot blame it on the alcohol
i wanna believe but i'm having trouble
so dont talk about a feeling you will never understand
accidents happen in slow motion
i need some chemicals
oh god aaaahhhhh

so you wanna go to bed with me
to make you say the things you do
why dont you climb in my head with me
threw you the obvious
just to see if there's more behind the
do you see what occurs behind the
you dont
to draw out the timid wild one
what am i to do with all this silence
life's no ordeal if you come to terms
power power the law of the land
best to keep things in the shallow end
ignore the smoke
just ignore the smoke and smile
my reflection
so vulnerable
but it's alright
count the bodies like sheep
counting bodies like sheep
counting bodies like sheep
counting bodies like sheep
isolate and save you from yourself
and when i ask you why
can i help you find the peace and the star
oh my friend
we have all come
who followed along
seems to be the rule of thumb
who followed along
it's what you've got
sitting here like a loaded gun
not the kind that cant be solved
gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie
i am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun
it's easy if you try
living life in peace
imagine all the people
fck your god
praise the one who left you
even though he's the one who did this to you
so many of us
it already started in the city
it already started in the city
it already started in the city
to witness such an earthly goddess
i bear witness
one taste of you my black madonna
one shape
give me
gotta cut away clear away
been over this
leaning over you here cold and catatonic
maybe you're better off this way
i know that you can hear this
and different people
you should hate me
hate another man
i cant understand
pay no mind to the rabble
go back to sleep
i'll be the one to protect you from
the boogeymen are coming
dont disturb
thrown about
play dead
empty
play this
drag the demons from you
help you face the nightmare
poisoned and hopeless
fill me up again
cause it's time to bring the fire down
so glad to see you have overcome them
recall the deeds as if
to the dead
you cant see it but you know its there so dont neglect it
she's got everything i need some pills in a little cup
you're lying to yourself again
lying through your teeth again
lying to my face again
clever got me this far
time to feed the monster
i dont need another friend
lie and smile to get what's mine
lie to smile and get what's mine
unable to lose this image
spent and sighing with a look on your face like
spent and sighing with a look in your eye
praying for visions
illuminate me
empty
like a thought brushing up against a sigh
floating away repeated
i'm so weak and powerless over you
desperate and ravenous
we dont need to escalate
yeah what's going on
so you can see
thinking about my baby and my happy home
oh crying wont help you praying wont do no good
it's a mean old levee cause me to weep and moan
yes if i had it to do over i'd do it over you
aaron tippin p heeney
she didnt come in here to hang her head and cry
so if you fit the bill brother dont sit still
on some boy that dont treat her right
do you see what i'm trying to say
the dog's at the vet the hearing is set
i finally found where i should've always been
right by you bayou baby
i wanna be loved by you bayou baby
talkin'bout right by you bayou baby
knobs and switches and four wheel drive
i just scoot over and i lt my baby drive she likes
you man is a little upset
or my favorite fishing pole
oh you just dont fool with a country boy's tool
it was handed down from my daddy's dad
and i dont wish on falling stars
or find the courage to say i do
when i cant find the will
every breath i breathe
i know there aint a doubt
and for all that it's worth
aaron tippin brock
and swinging from the chandeliers
the never should have bet me that it couldnt be done
hey look up there on the neon sign
i aint told nobody 'bout the trouble i've got on me
oh how's the radio know
and i'd die to tell her so
well you'll see that there aint that much on it
and i might seem like some kind of low life
i never had to hang my head in shame
i used to think man i was bad
there was a girl i do recall
i've settled down now
'cause this aint what i meant
i swear your love is stronger
and i guess that mansion on the hill
you've always bet on this old gambler
i know what you're goin through
i was born with a broken heart
that's why i sing the way i do
and i struck out across texas gonna walk it line to line
then he ran out of liquor and i've run out of time
aaron tippin curry
i could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
aaron tippin brock
i dont even make a shadow when i'm walking in the sun
yeah that woman made a memory out of me
oh she's got a way of makin me forget
she said when she found me i was barely hanging on
i cant say that i'm not tempted
fall right into your arms
yes she's standinon the promises
ten pound hammer
just the hearts and the flowers
yeah that's all she wrote
that's as close as i'll get to loving you
i can dream i can hope i can see but still i know
the first time we went all the way
and it's still growing every day
now all this time i thought
oh the best love we ever made
she hears the call of the wild every once in a while
now dont you worry about baby stepping out of line
love making state of mind
but looking in the mirror today i finally came to see
that man that came between us was me
the sky's got the blues today
as far as i'm concerned the sky's got the blues today
so when i take a look at all i've took
yeah i know i'm the reason you're leavin
i'd rather you pick up a rock a stick full of thorns
she's ridin me around on four bald tires
out of date tags and no tail lights
lord there aint a country station that i cant tune in
these sweet dreams are killin me
i'm losing my mind one night as a time
but there's only one reason why it beats so true
this heart really dont belong to me
rebel in my soul
when they put you in your grave
they've got no piece of mind
or do something that you'd rather not
till you wont know yourself
but now my luck is changing i've run into a dream come true
there have been tight situations but baby this is close
of how things ought to be
that's what this country needs
is a little more steel guitar
in washington dc
and that's what this country needs
now a million songs have come and gone
and they're screaming for more
the best music ever known
i said i was there the day
dont hang up the phone 'cause everything's not gone
dont hang up the phone 'cause everything's not gone
to ever feel the way i feel
i'd know enough to be strong
you build the things that really make the world go around
you get yourself a working mans phd
a few more people should be pullin their weight
wondering if i'd ever find you girl
right her and now i give this vow
he'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
she said we need to talk
one you havent talked to in a while
tryin to catch my breath
she said you're not even close
a walkin talkin lovinfantasy
what's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
well i tried my best but i still cant forget
her first impression left a lasting thought
aaron tippin tippin douglas
oh but i never will forget when she stood up and said
she had him back against the wall
she saidshe said
and there's only one thing left for you to do
let's talk about the way i love your walk
let's talk about you
let's talk about you
i put down my razor
when i believe that i'm right
and i can look straight ahead
now this old world throws some punches
but i played a straight game
she's lovin me into an early grave
she's lovin me into an early grave
she's lovin me into an early grave
one by one they remind me she's not coming back again
but it's been many many many beers ago
he got a furnished room and a job at the market
they said we want you and the songs you've been singing
but if anybody tries to change you
where the night is neon blue
if you see my blue angel
looking for my blue angel
and i think about settling down
this is my kind of town
and if i could find me one of them
if this old highway ever gives me up
help me help me i'm about to die
oh but only a man can understand
three plays for a quarter and we still want more
there's second hand smoke everywhere i exhale
rusty old pickup trucks
hillbilly people like us
that reminds me of mistakes that i've made
like roads on a map they cross a battered stretch of skin
you gotta take it easy
and there'll be no past
'cause you're ahead
get up and roll on
ahead of the pack
hard and heavy
filled with love and pain
dreaming in my sleep
aiming high aiming high
aiming high aiming high
empty
what a time what a place
a single tear in the river of life
they write about my coming end
tainted and fainted and lonely i picture my life
living on the edge
bad habits bad habits die hard
i know i got a lot of bad habits
just when you thought that youd
everybodys got bad habits
im searching for identity
i tried to break the circle to
like a bad religion
im gonna pull myself together
bad religion im beggin for
watch the damned god bless ya
you may mortify their flesh
you'll get your balls to the wall man
empty
empty
what a deal
is it true
if you were king he'd take your crown
icicle brains
bicycle chains
tyrannosaurus rex
he's a breaker
silly things i do
if i'd only seen you goin
he called it this he called it that
smokey nights gloomy lights
on a cloud of ecstasy
that he could reach the sky
know and it's right
right on rockin man
burning burning burning just like fire
burning burning burning just like fire
burning burning burning just like fire
love you tore my world apart
all you give is pain a curse upon your name
cant you see it isnt right
love why do i take you and why do you take me
to divert my attention
yeah another boning day
feel my desire or break this down
just another one night stand
sweet china lady
when you heed the demons call
ooh when it is all over
he's hell on earth and he's alive
run if you can deadly and evil
i run through the night
i am living in this empty room
and offered me a line
to treat a man like a pig
for you it's so easy
which i give now when i die
what a lie to sell me your fame
shanghai'd killed in action
please save us
he tears you from the ground and takes you higher and higher
it hurts just the first time
stay there for a long time
screaming for a love bite
and the city is far far away
in the night the seawinds are calling
mankind's favourite game
shake your heads cry out as loud as you can
it's a brand new feel
empty
you may end up six feet under
sick dirty and mean
a pair of concrete slippers there're all vultures all over your back
sick dirty and mean
sick dirty and mean
unchain the beast and let it loose
on the battleground of screaming guitars
slaves to metal we'll rock you to the ground
time will come we'll have to pray
the useless crying seems to be the end
tanks are coming
stand for what you are
you cant change who you are
stop trying to escape from the real world
you're on your own
messing up me life
and a assume the position we all stand together
so devoted and humbled to you
we all stand together
walkin down the foggy streets of london town
cant you see it's true
they terrorize and
theyre deaf dumb and blind
if youre gonna throw the torch at us
they desecrate mans dignity
stone evil inherited sin
with a man who doesnt make sence for you
take him in my heart
you think you are the greatest and is your own
with their
being a star but you are no more
being a star but you are no more
cant you hear it always trembling in my voice
i need those feelings for you again
but i'm a man without any choice
shoot the sisters
radar guided laser speed
guns r us get a free magazine

piercing son of a bitch at

devastation guaranteed
with your m 16

guns r us we accept your cash

and hell is down on earth oh yeah

a sign your ties are severed
i have no patience for the masses
gathering strength you await your command
rise from your knees avenger
empty
rise from your knees rise from your knees
lord of the slaughter who's sworn to you
you and i are not alone
fathered us
an accident
knowledge gained is now a curse
felling there is no doubt
feeling there is no doubt
feeling up and proud
sun sets the slaves all die
watching on their human race
sacrifice to their godz
from towers awaiting their signs
this coldness that you serve
we had our chance
chanting awaiting the gods of the sun
for the seed was misplaced
a hole in the sky
we carried the gifts that our priests had restrained
until it's too late
bound by your chains of your claims
you're not who decides this
chosen to stay
you say you've a creative side
from dead eyes
at the core
no light shines
hold close the human in you
recognize those who'll destroy
revealing all their darkest crimes
a world where you choose what to be
armed enforcers ready to make war
on the last train to nowhere
on the last train to nowhere
caused by their ignorance
suffer for our chosen children
you're chained to your fear
solo jg
all seeing eye
the revenge that you seek will all come back to you
search for the answer it's inside of you
this world that we walk in is full os mistreaters
will someday come back to me
we're born cowards and we cant fight back
our sacrifice renders our flesh useless
now the air is full
devastating crimes

is knowing worth the price it costs to stare inside pandora's box
forse se smetto di respirare se ne va via da su

an appetite for profanity
the you you knew is now the slave you are dancing
create the killer from inside
above theocracy we reign
in god's name all the heretics must die
who is the great dictator
satan gave himself a name
on your back shouldered greatness
empty
you pave their streets with dreams
as the new city sinks with despise
the crew is gone the ship left behind
the channel is open they're coming through
abduction begins memory lost
our time keeps us measured
eyes shut yet we still march forward
skies filled with our fathers watching
embrace them and call them father
do we trust them or are we their tools
the dream is death the dream is death
i'll fight
and the godz are sworn to treason
his world is made of steel
in symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
the failures scratch and carve the lines
alone he accepts all the blame
what we all are
empty
wait inside us
together we stand
barbaric approach
as destiny stands
you'll never retreat
never to wake from these dreams of destiny
all are silent
empty
deceived by betrayers
nothing left
burned bridges too late
nothing left
nothing left
signals of warning message from space
he's coming to town he is the rager
denying conformists alive in the lights
a spark through the haze
i gave my life you took all the chances
changing nightmares into dreams
create the hate cause the cancer
only enough to sate them to keep the herd alive
ten fists of hate ten tongues of lies
in complete consolidation

empty
but the driver was missin and the search had been abandoned
roll on momma like i asked you to do
roll on highway roll on along
and roll on eighteen wheeler roll on roll on
but my world stopped turnin 'round the stars turned upside down
when you would be mine all my life
a reborn love of yesterday
see the embers feel the flame
she was the rattle snake that bit him
the first time that she looked at me my heart went ka boom
oh i may never hold her in my mind i always will
i remember walking on silver sand with a mid summer moon shining above
of some other place some other time some other love
i will be yours and yours alone
i've never known a feeling
empty
you and me baby we'll set the flame inside free
take me down take me down tonight
empty
as i look around me what a picture it paints i'm muchmore than lucky i
but as i lay m down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep
the blessings oh the blessings
like the day christ was born in bethlehem the christmas spirit has been
empty
we didnt take no pictures but i still remember one very special
oh what a night oh what a night night before christmas i had with you
love aint something that flies away
friends say i've been a fool too long much too long
she said i spent eight years in california
and somehow we both shared the feelin that we'd just made a very special
i know we shared a very special friendship the night we made a very special
empty
it hurts me so
it's just around the corner and i cant wait
i think i hear some reindeer i better cover up my head
when we make love
it couldnt be any better than this
its more to me than just an affair
why lady why cant i get over you
i got her in my heart and i got her in my head
i'm wonderin when and i'm hopin it's soon
this house aint big enough for both of us it's comin soon
let love come like the cavalry ride in and save the day
it's always so perfect with you every time
said you felt as much
'cause i've thought about
'cause each night in your arms
the things you're doin baby make me want what you got
words and music by cary lynn rutledge
empty
and i'll bet before the night is through we'll play your favorite song
till i see you again
that one word hurts so bad
let me remember the things i've done walk on the log where the catfish bite
for a ray of sun and a little piece of beach
and i cant wait to feel the sand beneath my toes
on the gulf of mexico
i'm foldin my wings up for you
happy birthday jesus it's that time of year

now babe i'm not beggin for mercy
i dont mind the cold and rain where i'm waiting

tonight you're back out on the street
you can smell that hickory burnin
where the ceilin is so blue
a midnight hoot owl
yeah we're havin us a party everybody holler
spend the day bein lazy just bein nature's friend
oh play me mountain music
well i guess you'd say what can make me feel this way
talkin 'bout talkin 'bout my girl
to some other guitar picker in some other late night place
could it be the satisfaction of bein understood
you big day is over the cake is all gone
empty
new year's eve 1999
new year's eve 1999 new year's eve 1999
hung where you can see
and everyone you meet
but i'm a little bluer than that
whatever i do
now wherever i go and
well i've been wonderin what i've been missin
a truck needs a highway a train needs a track
two young people dancin in the daylight
lovin and trustin blindly she'll follow
i have known
and i know
taken for granted
thank god for it
love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
i sip a little coffee and i drink a little booze
aint no way i'm ever gonna change
i'm my daddy's spittin image and my mama's pride and joy
the world is callin you and you must answer
they'll be there for you if you get down
my wife died early i've got children
i'll be waiting for you
when i'm sober i'm almost a saint
that's another good reason not to drink
he said 'are you drunk or blind'
if i keep going on like this
are you washed in the blood
and tempt the soul of any man
again i know it's him
outside her reach is my concern
i see her there
born of his spirit washed in his blood
empty
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
you can make what went wrong today
and turn out the lights
and bring on the night
and bring on the night
on waters that will take you back in time
i'll just fond somethin else to promise you
and i stop lovin you
there's nothing better once you've had the best
i'll always love you so
you came home a quarter past eleven
i dont want my momma cry
merry christmas
i'd like for you'd to listen to a joke i heard today
but then you see her leaving me it's not what i prefer
so i can clear my mind
on the wrong side of the bed
on this rainy day in june
and time stood still and love was all we knew
remember when old ones died and new were born
remember when
for all the life we've had
cause i'm a revenooer man
i noticed on the side of the hill
and a gun on my hip
it's revenooer man
and a wedding band
when it's right in the palm of your hand
feet on the floor holding my head
chasing the rainbow and looking for love
the sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
i'm forever on a roll that's how she's got me feeling
when she says i wouldnt last ten minutes without her
cause we live way down south
cause the weatherman had some problems
and there's gonna be a merry christmas
she aint looking for romance she danced that dance before
i got my first motorcycle when i turned sixteen
daddy didnt like it and he made no bones
when they tried to change the startion to some rock n roll
she likes it too
empty
empty
he'll love some woman 'til he go insane
empty
calling o sinner come home
and i took her by the arm and said dont leave me
'cause sometimes someday just never comes
she said i cant wait
it's a three minute positive
not too county up tempo love song
it's a three minute positive
not too county up tempo love song
'tis so sweet to trust in jesus
precious jesus savior friend
for the price of a dream my years have been spent
been told countless times boy you aint goin nowhere
cause they're so many people who would give anything
so i swallowed all my pride
after all these years of holdin her
as warm as sunshine
and we've got a good thing going on
and too much of a good thing
i booked my room for a week
blow me away
blow me away
through death into life everlasting
you told me you dont love me when you walked out the door
but the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
up to my ears in tears
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa today
the story of heart breaking pain
and lookin back on his mistakes
or you'll end up like me
son please dont follow the footsteps
there's a lady living right above me
a little of my heart is down here dyin
that woman is walkin the floor over me
to forgive imperfection
to forgive imperfection
i'm glad we've kept all of these souvenirs
and here's one of us on the ferris wheel
and love for the moment
everything to god in prayer
i've let true love fall to the ground
when love comes around
with my heart in my hand
those ol clouds that rain so blue
play solitaire and stare at the phone
at bein on our own
sing his mercy and his grace
soon the pearly gates will open
i said where i come from
well i paid the tab and the lady asked me
i was chasin sun on 101
where i come from tryin to make a livin
i just dropped a load of salsa
where i come from
out in the yard with your wife and children
did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
the difference in iraq and iran
did you call up your mother and tell her you love her
did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger
faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
the greatest is love
can leave one in the dark
and sometimes not worth a damn
a stark naked light bulb hangs over my head
cause i'm lord and master
who dont even care anymore
who dont even care anymore
who dont even care anymore
you get tired and disgusted with me
i read that book you gave me about mars and venus
instrumental break
i still love you and i try real hard
holds a shiny gold watch
but he's got to wonder what now
with just him and mama
no statute carved out of stone
you made your mind up you're gone tonight
through your keyboard and wires
at wwwmemory
at wwwmemory
i'll be waitin for you patiently
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
but you cant give up on love
oh you cant give up on love
you dont have to say things at all
i can see what's in your eyes
and on the land his daddy gave him a foundation under way
lord there'll never be another place
to let him look underneath the hood
that i'll call home
but i'll bi over you by new year's eve
yeah i'll be over you by
then sings my soul
and take me home
then sings my soul
i end up on the sad side of the fun
and i always end up watchin love walk away
but now for me
so i flagged you down for coffee
but i finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
and i said 'where the heel am i and just who the hell are you'
she makes me moan all night long
no i cant walk no chalk line i aint a talking or a thinking straight
i wear a blue ribbon grin every now and then
it satisfies my longings
to hear it like the rest
i dont need nothing else
i'll find that mistletoe
a steep hill underneath a foot of snow
whoops i slipped and feel in love
whoops i slipped and fell in love
and i'm afraid i never will
you wrote to me dont ever change
i want to stroll over heaven with you some glad day
then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
will i need a miss of my life
if french fries were fat free
cause grease and love both cause heartache
i'd wear a smile endlessly
i'd walk that straight line
if i had you
if i had you
well she's burnin the honky tonks down
she's burnin the honky tonks down
a nail that held a picture of
i've got this hammer in my hand
but i'm not sane and after all
i guess it's just not my day
i rented that movie you hate
but i never knew that i needed you so
i'm always on the road
let's start makin plans
all those little things we used to do
i know the way it should feel
dont let it slip away
a once in a lifetime love
there's a song for the life i have found
it keeps my feet on the ground
we're following the star
there's a new kid in town
and he's lying in a manger down the road
heaven knows
standing standing
but there's one place i cant hide from you at all
repeat chorus
everytime i call my baby to try to get a date
i'm gonna take two weeks gonna have a vacation
yeah sometimes i wonder what i'm gonna do
i'll buy you tall tall trees
empty
on all the waters and the seas
on the wrong end of the highway
playin all the songs
thank god for the radio
that'd be alright
we'd be livin us a pretty good life
yeah that'd be alright
had a lighter load to bear
and that'd be alright
wipe the hurt away like dust
tell me is there any hope
not being sure of what it meanbut
came tears of love
he's just a singer
he was born in the spot light not to much left inside
they said he was needing if he was to keep on pleasing all of his fans
if you hadnt stuck it out with this blues man
till my trophies at last i lay down
i can hear the things i did wrong
i could not see
but i just wouldnt listen didnt want to all those years
but the noise is killing me
the thrill is back like it used to be
and tell him i wont need that prozac after all
so i just dream keep on being the way i am
empty
and you sneak up from
well i think you're playin with me darlin
i wanted to play
there you go
cause life's a dance dont know
like the wings of the butterfly
and i was a drowning man
would you go around
with everyone you know
if love was a fast train
if we make it through december
and my little girl dont understand
if my wish dont come knockin
if you dont wanna see santa claus cry
i'll fly away i'll fly away
empty
and be it the wind or the rain
and when i see your delicate body
we've both felt love
so i'm not scared
just another man
i come to the garden alone
'tho the night around me is falling
oh what a pain i've got
something is wrong or right
you must be the dream i been dreaming of
it's alright to be a redneck
oh you know it
by the light of the moon
an so am i
it's five o'clock somewhere
make it a hurricane before i go insane
it's only half past twelve but i dont care
yeah i heard that
i'm ready crank it up
cause you taught me a lot about leavin
tonight i'm walkin out that door
and i just disappear
shower up and do just what we came to do
and i thank the lord again
count the money and the miles back home to you
laying low
but there aint no use
nowhere i want to go
you've got to kiss angel good mornin
you got to kiss an angel good mornin
what a blessedness what a peace is mine
leaning on the everlasting arms
chasin the neon rainbow
heading down to houston for a show on saturday night
just trying to be somebody
i'm chasin the neon rainbow
way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
dallas packed her suitcase
then she'd be here with me
oh how i wish dallas was in tennessee
but i saw you and thought that you looked harmless
i think we found it
i think i'm gonna need you to get back home
i need a friend to see me through
we need to get to where we cant think of her
you left me and the river here all alone
empty
i dont feel like rocking
before you punch that number
i aint got nothing
cause my heart aint ready
secondhand from a dealer in atlanta
and i would turn her sharp
he let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
and he'd say a little slower son you're doing just fine
rusty old floorboard hot on my feet
daddy let me drive
everything i love gonna have to give up
'cause everything i love is killing me
i know you'll be glad when i'm gone
i was fifteen she was eighteen
she left me cryin in '79
years went by teardrops dried
built in 1955 snowshoe white overdrive
staring across a crowded floor
but i can look at you
and if i cant hold you near me
but she only ages
she's gone country here she comes
they're not as backwards as they used to be'
schooled in voice and composition
he's gone country a new kind of talk
it's hard to learn what you dont think you need
tryin to leave the pain behind
cowboys dont cry and heroes dont die
but the one thing i've learned from you
repeat chorus
back to dreamin of
honey let's get back to me and you
a little bitty house and a little bitty yard
well it's alright to be little bitty
a little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
they ware the little man
that the people go round but they seldom think
forget about that little man
now the are lined up in a concrete strip
about the little man
it takes more than marble and tile
two old people without a thing
just like an old fashioned story book rhyme
i cant shake it it's gone too far
and said come on tell us what's wrong with you
sounds like love's got a hold on you
watchin the sun bake
i dont know the reason
now i think
searching for my lost shaker of salt
estee lauder ooh
and keep makin eyes at me
we shouldnt have these feelings
ol tv shows
it's just who i am
crazy bout a mercury
and cruise it up and down the road
she's crazy bout a mercury
and wrapped the wedding ring
then i sat down in my chair
then a drunken man in a cowboy suit took me by surprise
smell whiskey in the air
see the stars light up the purple sky
'cause i cant seem to talk to god without yelling anymore
you left my heart as empty
repeat chorus
they never found the fingerprints
they all say not guilty
since they committed murder
for the steel guitars no longer cry
there's been an awful murder
i must've had a ball last night
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
i must've drank away my blues
but all the signs are showing
there's two kinds of lovers two kinds of brothers
two kinds of babies to hold
risked abandonment and stood by that
i wouldve baby stepped into intimate
torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
and dont believe in capital punishment
i'm in no hurry i could wait forever
born of your bellies i yearn for the cord
and i have relented
to dispel our archaic reputation
i'm surprised i still love music just as much
after a year like this one
i'm surprised we're all not weeping drunks and
and you say how appropriate
and all i really want is deliverance
i am humbled by his humble nature
did you think about your bills your ex your deadlines
all i really want is some comfort
and soon i realized that your
i put my heart on a shelf forever
whoand when i think of the time i med you
it's something i could never have planned
are you still mad i gave you ultimatums
of course you are
only on your potential
in pursuit of your nirvana
completely absolve me
their own essence
completely absolve me
several hours and several ways i'll feast on scraps thrown from you
you cringe at the thought of living under the same roof as me god and everything
but i'm not screamin or cryin
empty
i keep on pushin and shovin
i lay awake alone in my bed
give me love i know that you can
every day you're always on my mind
because i cant not
because i cant not
because we cant not
i know there's a reason you're forcing a smile
'cause you've been crying for too long
but change is never a waste it's never a waste of time
look to the horizon
i am a citizen of the planet
i come alive and i get giddy i am taken and globally naturalized
now with post demise at hand
but i was sadly mistaken
i thought we'd have children together
thought we'd be adventurous togheter
but you and me are strangers to each other
you and me estranged from the mother
they're happy we're climbing over each other
sister blister we fight to please the brothers
you and me feel joined by only gender
such a pity to disavow each other with how far we've come
we may not be hugely anti men
deadlines meetings and contracts all breached
i want to be naked running through the streets
i want to be naked running through the streets
luminous more so than most anyone
let's discuss things in confidence
one forgotten birthday i'm all but cooked
your hand pulling away and i'm devastated
for helping you and myself not even considering
no one's been crueller than i've been to me
no one's been crueller than i've been to me
for ignoring you my highest voices
for treating me worse than i would anybody else
i'll cater to you and hang on your every word
i'll be opinion less and silent
i'll be the prettiest appendage to ever lose herself
i thought of you
crosses cross hung
i'm still falling
and the storm slipped away
minutes and hours
i think of this
i'm the nuclear bombs if they're to hit
and i love you still
empty
and i love you still
i see you gunning them down
i see you holding your grudges
i see you
how you filter as skewed interpret
and argue thats not what you did
a serious love like juliet's is real
you gotta be tough to make it today who
superman where are you superman
i cant wait 'til i can stop
billy's a football star
i know you're alone in your world
and she's got a lot to offer
it's a different position of living
can you hear me call
so you reached out entirely fearless
so you dove in and you're still breathing
and so you died and you're still standing
sucker punch i was afraid of you reducing me
you were my best friend
of your coersion i was afraid of your rejection
you were my keeper
diatribes of clouded sun
keeping my vibe down
how bout getting off these antibiotics
how bout me not blaming you for everything
the moment i let go of it was the moment
thank you disillusionment
that i would be great if i was no longer queen
that i would be good even if i got the thumbs down
that i would be good even if i was clingy
we thought a break would be good for four months we sat and vacillated
i'm sorry i lost myself i am
she never married anyone else you took it upon yourself to console her
how can you just throw words around like grieve and heal and mourn
she was only responsive with a drink he was only responsive by photo
you are wise you are warm you are courageous you are big
until i out his false story
until i out his false story
until i out his false story
but something i cant control that
in a world that does not recognize women are victimized
you'll have the time of your life
take cold showers every day and throw my life away
with my boyfriend
why do you say you are spiritual yet you treat people like shit
and not the other way around
eleven songs
you deserve a piece
i wanna be soft and resolved
but who's still aching now
i wanna forgive for the both of us
empty
i wanna be soft and resolved
stand up if you want the answers
never too young never too old
to what your heart could tell ya
empty
i miss your smell and your style
these are the days of raw despondence
these are the things that i miss
these are the things that i miss
so why spend all our time in dressing our bandages
how i've spun my wheels with carts before my horse
like any hot blooded woman
you're uninvited
i need a moment to deliberate
unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last
disenchanted daughter and this plane cannot fly fast enough
if i had stayed much longer i'd have surely imploded
unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last
dear terry i love you muchly you've been nothing but open hearted and emotionally available
dear terrance you were an adventure besides being a few decades older than i was
that we had different tastes in moderations and we couldnt hang out forever and while it lasted
were plenty self destructive for my taste at the time i used to say
dear marcus you rocked my world you had a charismatic way
in our lives i will always have your back and be curious about you
schoolbound you are
headstrong you are
big time you are
utopia this is my utopia
release and disarm and stand up and feel safe
these versions of violence
and the ones that go unnoticed
still leave their mark once disappeared
there's an abvious attraction
with his head in his hands
get up get up get up off of it
you never think twice before you break all the rules
why there's a frown on my face he orders a
you never think twice before you break all the rules
we'll have it all it's not too late to try
maybe you and i could work it out
if i am cultured my words will somehow garner respect
it would not come
when they strike a nerve
it would not come
it feels so good swimming in your stomach
i recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
you scream you learn
you grieve you learn
is she perverted like me
but you're still alive
it was a slap in the face how quickly i was replaced
it's not fair to deny me
it's not fair to deny me
and there are no strings attached
or love someone else and i'll support it
even if it means i'll lose you and i'll hear it
i would've sung so loudly
at the top of my voice
it was your approval i wanted
would you forgive me love
i went down to the den
if i stay all afternoon
so forgive me love
there's a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop
there's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
i guess i always thought you could end this reign
comes to nooks and crannies as balm for all scars
stomach and intuition as your guide
my friends my man
and i'm ready to be limbo no more
nowhere's been home
my teacher's in heart
cuz i'm ready to be limbo no more
and sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors
and how i do love london
we slept and were cold on the train out of france
and though i'd love to blame you for all i'd miss these moments of opportune
what's the matter mary jane you had a hard day
what's the point of trying to dream anymore
please dont censor your tears
tell me
i've never let my grasp soften fingers like this
empty
i declare a full time out from all things commitment
and any talk of healthiness
dear popular boy i know you're used to getting everything so easily
you go back to your friends who will lick your ass
and any talk of both feet in
i know there's a reason you're forcing a smile
'cause you've been crying for too long
but change is never a waste it's never a waste of time
i reach in my heart to see
you've been blind not to realize
and you're like a 90's jesus
and they'll stumble around like hypocrites
is it just me or are you fed up
i told her i didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath
it's not all my fault
find the strength to stand up to you
it's not all me
i'm barely making sense for now
with not much making sense just yet
i'm barely making sense just yet
i dont want to be your babysitter
and i dont want to be your other half i believe that 1 and 1 make 2
visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if i show up at 10 past 6
visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if i show up at 10 past 6
who am i to feel spent
and why
how dare i ignore an outstreched hand
shake your thing
oh yeah
rules your world
the drums are a smokin and so's the
i'm soft and appealing
cultured and funny
i could fall in love a million times before i die
and that's all you can do not to kick me in the ass
and the other one is giving a high five
and the other one is flicking a cigarette
i'm sick but i'm pretty baby
spoken words taken from an old recording the women of the family seem to feel that
for you we chew our nails if we had any but fake ones to do it
you're just confused
you are captured
why dont they just leave me alone
but i can make it all alone out here on my own
but i need to be on my own
can i have it all if there's no one to
they require me to kick into high gear
who would calm me down once i talked her through it
how bout that ever elusive kudo
how bout grieving it all one at a time
was the moment i touched down
thank you thank you silence
and no one knows except the both of us
and overlook this supposed crime
i wish i could tell the world cuz you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
ooh this could be messy
i know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
what part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept
and overlook this supposed crime
i need a fix cause i'm going down
happiness is a warm gun mama
dont be surprised if i love you for all that you are
it's all your fault
i am aware now
how revered were you honestly at the time
you were count on 'er 'til four am
womyn to womyn would where did you get that from
how revered were you honestly at the time
you were count on 'er 'til four am
womyn to womyn would where did you get that from
you start makin the moves they start makin
i've had enough distractions i need some tenderness
rock 'n roll tan you keep thinkin you're
directions i need some tenderness
tuesday morning is not tuesday morning 'till nick has his talk with his son
thursday morning is not thursday morning 'till someone says how's your life
hold off 'till the weekend
empty
what if we all had no thinking together
and you're not going to die any time soon
i too once thought i was owed something
i think what he did was wrong and i would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
this is in praise of the vulnerable man
you are the greatest man ive ever met
and i'll be friend to my friends who know how to be friends
and i'll be constantly one with her night dusk and day
and never done
he won the lottery and died the next day
he waited his whole damn life to take that flight
and life has a funny way of helping you out when
it's like rain on your wedding day
and i feel snuffed out
i'm told to see this as divine perfection
and all that remains is the case
jealous dont you know your girl is jealous
empty
they are panicked you and your chronic them and their drama
you were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful
we need to find like minded companions
the soul is expressed in the lyrics
why cant you relate
keep the radio on
i'm not jealous
i dont get clingy much
i'm not saddened
keep chin up stays in touch
how to defer to men in solveable predicaments
i'll show you how to in 8 easy steps
culminating just to be this well versed leader before you
who is as negative as i am sometimes
and you're still here
and you're still here
you dig everything you dig everything of which i'm ashamed of which i'm ashamed
why no one will help me
they've kept me safe
they've kept me locked in my own cell
the bar that is raised to the heights
they've kept me blocked
it wears her out
it wears him out
and it wears me out
while you left me
fate stay with me will you help me on my way
i dont want to be a queen no
i'll be so happy
sometimes i feel it's all just too big to be true
i could be full i could be thriving i could be shining
cant feel no pain when i'm thinking about you
comes to mind now
love i wanna feel your love
you cant be afraid to show it
deep down in your heart you cant feel at all
oh dear dont wait
honey you've gotta fight for his love for his love
how long before my dignity is reclaimed
how long can a girl be tortured by you
what are you my air you affect me like you are my air
shouldnt be here
went down to the den
if i laid in your bed
it wasnt my writing
we make up for so much time a little too late
i confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man
i will suffer the consequence of this inquisition
do you go to the dungeon to find out how to make peace with your days in the dungeon writing a letter
you started saying things like you belong to the world all of which could have been easily
popcorn i get to see you see you close up you never meant to be ungrateful nor held up to
you see you close up oh the things i've done for you many a sitch a friend a mans
and im giggling again for no reason
triumphant in delight
and im giggling again for no reason
well it's time you know the truth and that is
no one ever
your little sister just kick out of
you look gorgeous
you're looking gorgeous
on fire on tequila oh
weve known each other for the longest time
the predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her
bestest friends on tequila oh
mostest most on tequila oh
and now hes used to hanging with me and cracking up
i am the biggest hypocrite
one one one one one one one
and give up my hard earned status
though a start i am newly courted
you know best of what my special care allows
every time you raise your voice
the only way out is through
anytime we're still made of final bowing
we could just call it quits only to start all over again
the faster we're in the better
the only way out is through ultimately
who completely away from you
and i remember how it used to be
and you're givin me nothing but an attitude
sometimes is never quite enough
with everything i do for you
i'm doing this for your own damn good
you can play the game or you'll never start
but what can you do do do
you know that it's true
cant you see i'm right
between brutal and realistically well behaved
between fuck you to your face and it's alright
i'd like to kill you but i'd never kill you
she would give me a wink across the room
i would send my mother directly to bed yeah
you'll complete me right
and parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends
i've spent so much time living in survival mode
please be addicted to some substance
please be strangely enigmatic
start every week with a break neck urgent design
like you're the sole owner of wings
i must be two lips
keep it a question
let's keep it a question
i look through the broken glass i watch the storm go through my mind
and i never got to say good bye
but i still feel you standing next to me
a song in my head and it says step inside the real world
empty
wait a minute sir
you took a long hard look at my ass
hello mr man
i feel right through you
aah so dont ever go away
only if you laugh with me
who would keep me busy
only to look at me
you always were
only if you laugh with me
my pillows are drippin and the sheets are wet
empty
i fall thru a hole cuz i cant get a grip

standing on solid ground
that you're sellin me
i'm sick of tradin tricks and dicks

of crime

carolina iv took the river to the sky
still i cant forget the past
empty
of a senseless life
on a stormy night
carry on it's time to forget
the remains from the past
empty
renaissance is over and i wonder
feel like i've betrayed
you're heading for the unknown
you're much too fast
with no fore sight
one day the sun it will shine for us all
it's over
make your blood
unconsciously far from this world
over and over again
over the bay darkness breaks to a glow
and i miss you
here is my heart in my soul
i see the stars in your eyes
playing cool while cracking up inside
to start it again
we were born in a golden age
ooh and then
to bring an age
long disappeared
lasting child remains inside
that blink far beyond
inside slender frames
everynight i say a prayer
fill these withered careless hands
fill these withered careless hands
wrote down my own sentence
make believe
the whispers of your hope are left behind
bring to me
lost in the dark are they all too real
to be by your side
burnt your wings on the sun
empty
hold your arms to the sky
matos bittencourt
silver dropped wine
now where are you going now
we're like mad horses
would take forever
empty
nothing to say
nothing to say
living forevermore nothing to say
their life was a game
but the rules take new forms
while we stay here in hell
and the bewildered look up to the sky
even thought the animals of time have passed you by you still dont see
once again they're facing the day
rainny clouds
i dont blame the fate
moments of madness
from my deepest request
against the blue sky
the way back to be freed
that taught me how to live
try to catch them once
out time is over
a way out of the conscience
still i'm begging for comprehension
long for the day be back someday
destined by the fate
oh here they come again
dont let us die
running out of carelessness
tell me how
dont let it go
the things that you've done
to walk the streets of tomorrow
empty
warn up the soul
start to sing to turn and spin get rid of all your sins right now
while the body is freezin
light shine in my eyes
there's so much hidden behind
why dont you trust me
that will cast away
the time we cannot hold
dont forget what you've learned
empty
bringing the signs
show me the way to be
empty
they told me i was going to loose the fight
let me in a your window
i'm coming home to wuthering wuthering
oh let me have it
empty
empty
to give my thoughts some sense
in fantastic purity
but now it's time to make them sing
feeling the life as it is
i let my fancy wander free
i was in debt right up to my neck i wasnt having any fun
i've gotta win i gotta win or i might as well be dead
i'm hearing voices deep inside my head
join us i wont follow you
we are the voices deep inside you're head
alison hell your mind begins to fold
alison hell what are you looking for

creepy crawlers sidewalk maulers have you met our little alice
i feel the flesh tearing off me oh help me please
four three two one
you're in deep way over your head' i've turned my life around
it's hard to see yourself when the mirror's cracked
it's time to realise
anxiety attacks as confusion rips at the mind
empty
they're banging at my door what do they got to sell
the blackness getting bigger than the serpent's universe
brain dance
sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
he jumped out of the frying pan into the fire and he's back again
watch my brain dance
gratification do you want some more
excess perversion and we'll never let it end
there are so many people in my mind all trying to speak at once how can it be so quiet on the outside when there is such a confused noise in my head my brain is racing pounding i want to be free and happy but the voices are so angry they contradict my wish to be content voices voices will i never be alone
c'mon you've got nothin to lose it's time to bring you up a little faster
you'll fight but i'll win 'cause i'm second to none
you'll fight but i'll win 'cause i'm second to none
i'll give you what i think is best and what i know is right
that you must go down
we have to meet our maker
let's commit the crime
i dont wanna die
have you played this game before
woven webs of intricacy
motivation is a problem
sinking fast
new desire to progress
you gave me something to hope for you made me feel like new
you've got no fuckin class
why tell me why you're crying
you've been running around having fun with anyone
blasting and ripping it apart
sonic homicide beware the killing is for real
bring on the demons this match is made
dream away dont wait for the night
dream away everything's alright
i'm on a mission i'm gonna break the speed of sound
they say i'm crazy and i'm headed for disaster
give me more speed
qualities soon to exhaust as mans greed poisons the land
reaping unprotected riches human nature's self destruction flaw
you'll never know what hit you you're blown by dynamite
i'm every nightmare i'm every dream
it's just a box it's just a screen
they teach it on the street it's the only rule
what doesnt kill me makes me strong
confront the past in this psychic house of horrors
tonight you'll be tried i invoke the memories
panic your ultimate nightmare
panic your conscience lied
hey you i need a friend i hope you feel the same
i'll bring you down to your knees illusions and dis illusions
there's one thing you should never forget is that
gotta run
cause i'm getting sick of the outside
hatred in its personified form surely is the devil itself those who are weak are easily controlled by this emotion so destructive and overpowering the capacity to hate lies dormant in each one of us and when in full force it changes who we are as if by possession
what's the sin that lurks within the burning emotion of hatred
wicked mystic
there's something round the corner there's something in the air
cause i've found a way to soar above the clouds
i run on psychic gasoline my fuel shall burn you all
word salad
born into death will you take the risk
welcome to your death

anger shows on my face
the lion inside of me is no longer tame
it's been so many years
we're dangerous down to the last
leaving questions in my head

extra lyrics from the film mix
in search of you i feel my way though the slowest heaving night
wont you please talk to me
from nippled skin as smooth as silk the bugles blown as one
now your future's so defined
all the barriers blown away
i said please talk to me
memories stir
i have my fears
i cry until i laugh
so it doesnt own me
something in me dark and sticky
just drive the car
to find the places i got hurt
to find the places i got hurt
you're still looking for the resurrection
come up to me with your what did you say
no fight left or so it seems
though i saw it all around
dont give up
dont give up
moved on to another town
dont give up
get back we dont have time
to make it alive
the guys to get in place
i wont be easy prey trying to find a way to make it alive
i'm looking for lost angeles
i want to be alone
the streets are lined with camera crews
they wont see me or the gun
as i burn into your memory cells
i dont care what you do
all turned quiet i have been here before
looking down on empty streets all she can see
wait until darkness
dreaming of mercy
he can handle the shocks
in your daddy's arms
ooh the pain modern love can be a strain repeated
romance is out of fashion
the ground was cold
and more than this
on foundations built to last
i stand alone and so connected
beyond the stars
feeling so connected
some are jumping up in the air say we're drowning in a torrent of blood
no one will tell what all this is about
check if you can disconnect the effect and i'll go after the cause
fear she's the mother of violence
dont make any sense to watch the way she breed
oh my head sounds like that
the knife it scrapes across the burnt brown toast
what's left out and what's left in
i dont know how to stop
i will talk to anyone
i go shaky at the knees
i walk on through the rain
oh god let it not be you
i remember how you held the goldfish
i'm not quitting on you
you're not quitting on us
you may look like we do
when you learn to divide
you're not one of us
every morning i'm out at dawn with the dwarfs and tramps
no it's not easy making real friends
seduced by the noise and the bright things that glisten
yes i hear you calling me
i need perspective 'cos i'm facing the wall
treat you like dirt but i dont want to blame
i used to be an industrial giant
i am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
there is no blood around see no sign of pain
just let the red rain splash you
it's so hard to lay down in all of this
red rain is coming down
red rain
wings drink in cool
san jacinto i hold the line
we will drink from the stream
underwater unaware
down by the railway siding
breaking it up
you dont want to do what your mother has done
it's your day a womans day
we're gonna to break it down
suki plays with leo sacha plays with britt
they all have hills to fly them on except for lin tai yu
games without frontiers war without tears
growing up growing up
four dot is what will make a square a bed to build on it's all there
well on the floor there's a long wooden table
growing up growing up
my ghost likes to travel
such a struggle getting through these changes
there's no point in direction we cannot
lord here comes the flood
dont be afraid to cry at what you see
repeat chorus once
we've got to get out of here bill she said
down on the wheel on a double
things dont run the way i planned them
empty my mind i find it hard to cope
as i drove into the sun
you'll have to take me just the way that you find me
anything at all
i got no memory of anything at all
it was only one hour ago
still loving what's gone
they say life carries on
life carries on and on and on
i grieve
i'm wanting contact
wanting contact
to please
i come back to the place you are
i see the doorway to a thousand churches
so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
i am complete
the heat i see in your eyes
they'll give me a lift i've been running adrift so easy
better cover my yellow liver
feel like i'm going away this time i'm going away
i like the touch and the smell of all the pretty dresses you wear
then the beast
a ride
sweet little princess
he's gonna be just like your best friend
he's living with you he sleeps in your bed
you dont have to be afraid
jump in the water c'mon baby get wet get wet get wet
i'm living way beyond my ways and means living in the
it's only common sense
leading underground
lay your hands on me
if only i could touch you i guess you'd be alarmed
so you know how people are
i love to be loved x2
in this emptiness and fear
this time i believe
but i cannot face the cost
cover me when i run
i know about that
cover me when i sleep
shock watch the monkey get hurt monkey
and in this place can you reassure me
when all things beautiful and bright
you know that's it
lost my time lost my place in
reaching into the deepest shade of
sky blue
crying out from my heart
you could have a big dipper
open up your fruitcage
sledge sledge sledgehammer
you've been coming through
it's what we're doing doing
dont get me wrong i'll be strong
i get cold you get hot
darlin we've got to trust in something
standing stretching every nerve
open doors would soon be shut
back home
i'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
give me steam
you know your sinner from your saint
stand back
you know your ladder from your snake
room shake earthquake
this steam
aah coming alive x2
all we did and said
i want to be clear
i can get so scared
i cant help but listen
one girl at the bar
'til the red light says 'on air'
the more you know the show will scored
'my lover stole my girlfriend'
dysfunctional excess
no man is a sea
where people say the things that they really mean
curves are still upon the hinge
desires form in subtle whispers
who loves the day but lives another
all the doors are shut
high up on the red rock
the rhythm is inside me
we spit into out hands
smash the watch
excellent birds
i'm sitting by the window
i can see it now
i see pictures of people
i pray the snow goes be bad if it settles
i'm gonna have me some fun
walk through the fire
darkness heavy on my shoulder
while the building crashes
walk on down below walk on down below
hold on hold on
to the talking room it's not surprise
hold on you have gambled with your own life
and i will do what i can do
thought that i could get along
let your waters reach me like she reached me tonight
river oh river river running deep
we do what we're told
in god we trust
and she comes out like a white shadow
close your eyes and wish that it were
brett is in the bathtub
with his three coned cap
wendy's on the windowsill
he carries a martini
softly sing sweet songs
softly sing sweet songs
perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
they hang on emotions they bottle inside
you'd bring home the groceries
she's bitchin again
i'm sick and tired of your childish behavior
she's bitchin again
for when my hand was holding hers
i see them through a crystal haze
that time and once again i'm bouncing round the room cont
then this one is for you
there's no one that you care to meet
it performs my daily functions
before you slip into the night
a dust arose and clogged my nose
the septic maidens gargoyle tooth
and caused a mighty stir
i turned the blade back on the bitch
a cushion convector a pitcher of nectar
confuse what you can of the ending
all my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
to rush and never waste the day
now i'm convinced the whole day long
i'm checkin 'em out
a lot of ghosts and a lot of houses
i will find a city
i've got it figured out
find yourself a city to live in
and i realized i love you
you get a little bit
you will reap what you sow
digging for a dime
for a ufo
scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
she said come on over for some lemonade
grass has been greater
and the home of the free
i dont care about anyone except myself
i buy myself some presents
my glance is always darting when i stroll the avenue
till once again i bask in morning stillness i love so
you found your voice that brings me to my knees
ooh ooh cymbals are grand
saxophones and cymbals 2x
sky balls sax scraper
converse with ed a drive with jill
you laugh and laughing fall apart
with my face between my hands
and plunge below the water line
yanked on my tunic and dangled my stash
control for smilers cant be bought
in fact it is surrounding me
much ado is all i see
i cant talk my talk with you
nothing's ever soaking through
and i'm here but i dont want you to live with me
i'm out and i will stay here alone and without
that someone else made
empty
center of the field stands an enormous black rhombus they climb the
slander on wrap paper ties
tranquil and serene until he runs out of supplies
i look into the finance box
cause he runs so fast
i rowed upstream to find lenore
expanding exponentially like some recursive virus
so maybe i could be a fly
he's planning a family vacation
in a hot sand or in a my feet
remembering to check on the sausage
i'm bouncing like a newborn elf
thank you mr miner 5x
and you'll be left alone oh baby
tell me i'm your very own
take me to another place she said
can lift me up and spin me around
the source was quite invisible the ever present voice
my double wants to pull me down
and he headed down to new orleans
hey hey
jesus left chicago
what's that
i think that i know what i havent known yet
i came out on top by the luck of the draw
the dreams that i once had
and i dont have a crown
the emperor of emptiness
that my feet tread upon
fraying bits of twine
and when i'm near the end
but god never listens to what i say
always give me what i lack
up from hell the answer blew
trampled by lambs pecked by the dove
the muscles flex the mother's ring
with melting wax and feathers brown
ohbut how i'll never know
and it's the ocean flowing in our veins
i feed from the bottom you feed from the top
pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth
if i'm swimming by
we drank a little wine
we saw where we'd been in the pictures within
she spent all of her money
it was really just a lucky hunch
and move out of hollywood
the swiss miss girl was disgusted
tryin to show her his affection
and move out of hollywood
this story's getting boring
should've been canceled long ago
should've been canceled long ago
seize her with a tweezer
uncle ebenezer
you wont find moments in a box
but i'd see it through
wasting my time with you
to hear it
filter out the everglades
he walked on down the hall
then i wanna
and i'm sharing in the weekapaug groove
so much to do so why why weigh
why weigh
inasfar as fiefdom i think you bad crook
wilson duke of lizards i beg it all trune for you
and the wolfmans brother
so i might be on a side street
it's the wolfmans brother
wash your feet and drive me to firenze x4
dahlia i know i've done you wrong
that i once knew and talked to
i somehow feel forsaken
group of loyalists approaching from their lakeside encampment below
empty
leave it on press 2x
empty
didnt hear what you had said
all the times i raise my cup
it's like a person i've not known
you may as well keep your belly full
to spend a weekend with no cares
whenever i think of you it only makes me feel sad
but somehow my good intentions just got up and git
i try to find a way but there's nothing i can say to make it stop
empty
and his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb
and a giant smile grew on his face
and esther knew the time had come to flee
they'd flutter and glide
feeling quite outnumbered esther hid behind
the joggers were approaching
and the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears
that gather around
it's getting hard to tell who we love and hate
you've got nothing to lose
it isnt nearly fast enough for you
far away in another place
you're racing with the wind
a desperate craving in his bones
but you just got a bottle
so milly took that paper and did the deed
it cost me nothing it was free
for as i said it was for free
askin for some bills
man beheaded her
level headed boy ya better bend
into a deep
i suction there for one whole day
i'm bound to lose
in a minute i'll be free
i feel free
she lays bout the subway station
and if she looks you in the eye
lucy's in the subway with daffodils
crab in my crab in my crab in my shoemouth
to the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay
i need a resting place 'cause i
trapped in time and i dont know what to do
he reached to grab me and this is what he said
empty
for a broken old man and a world unkind
the bitter blue and frozen through
grasps the handle clips the cable
takes the object starts the game
you're my only true sweet one
oh if you're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating you
the sun came up and down
to see that life's a bit cockeyed
you wont steal that thing again
before they come knockin at your door
oh to be prince caspian
oh to be prince caspian
mutter to a farmer in a truck
bag it
threw in a pot of melted wax
would be the finest in the nation
dont get caught
the revolutions over baby now
as if she were the last one she thought i'd betray
and drawing quite close to the top of the shelf
but from that vantage point i frowned
they threw the locks onto the ground
as friends and neighbors turn away
i have always looked out from behind the eyes
nobody lives forever
it's only a lifetime
the seasons change
with my love by my side
i think
i think
daddy's gone across the ocean
teacher leave those kids alone
all in all you're just another brick in the wall
there's too many home fires burning
not now john
but it fits on here like thisss
or it could be reusable shows
and would'nt maggie be pleased
what do you do to make ends meet
dont accept that what's happening
we could find that we're all alone
no more turning away
god this place is bigger than our apartment
like the skin on a dying man
tight as a tourniquet
or contemplate a silent freeway
what do you do to make ends meet
no hint no word her honour to defend
that binds a life for life
that binds a life for life
make their stand
what a way to spend that evening
she would very much like to go out to a show
i open the door to an empty room
playing the game
she sees through anyway
button your lip and dont let the shield slip
behind petrified eyes
we would zig zag our way
to make me change my mind
the flames are all long gone
there's nothing you can say
and a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
and a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
and a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea
laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea
laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea
heavy hung the canopy of blue
memories come rushing up to meet me now
and touch the silk in your lapel
you never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
the gunner sleeps tonight
exposing every weakness
the band is just fantastic that is really what i think
if we all pull together as a team
dresden at angels one five
we danced and we sang in the street and
standing in the aisle
hey you
and the worms ate into his brain
dont tell me there's no hope at all
leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
at a higher altitude with flag unfurled
with friends surrounded
for a while light tears wept like a child
she is bound to drag me down
and it cant be much fun for them
stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
he stood in a field where barley grows
but now he's resigned to his fate
away my soul
the show must go on
dragging behind you the silent reproach
was caught red handed showing feelings
let him get away with murder
you should've talked to me more often than you did
worm your honour let me take him home
in all my years of judging i have never heard before
empty
and racing around to come up behind you again
it's good to warm my bones beside the fire
confirm suspicions
like the moment when your brakes lock
the feelings of the few
forward he cried from the rear
the poster bearer cried
the old man died
and i covered them up with the latest cut
i've been looking all over the place for a place for me
and my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
and all the lot is what i got
remember how she said
sitting in a bunker
waiting to weed out the weaklings
would you like to send our colored cousins
on the inside out
my nervous system all awry
just give it time then speak my name
welcome my son welcome to the machine
he always ate in the steak bar he loved to drive in his jaguar
what do you want from me
you can drift you can dream even walk on water
where waves of hunger roar
contract diseases
race rats
shall we buy a new guitar
send flowers by phone
store up leisure
the enemy tanks for a while
and i found it one day
they were all left behind
and the generals gave thanks
in the form of a scroll
and no one survived
blue skies from pain
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
to let me in from the cold
million mile from home you're on your own
now i'm the man on the inside looking out
a man who ran a child who cried
he's just the same as all the rest
i am just a new boy
ooo i need a dirty woman
do you remember me how we used to be
by the cold and religious we were taken in hand
daddy whatcha leave behind for me
action brings good fortune
a movement is accomplished in six stages
look mummy there's an airplane up in the sky
empty
i'm so afraid of mistakes that i made
please pick up your camera and use me again
and melted hearts now now now is the time time
never ever will they
i got electric light
i got nicotine stains on my fingers
and i got fading roots
blam blam your pointers point your pointers
blam blam your pointers point your pointers
he's chained forever to a world that's departed
flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
hell opened up and put on sale
has unleashed the dogs of war
they will take and you will give
whe i saw the lady smile
one day i will catch her eye she is calling from the deep
take me down take me down from the shelf above your head
if i were to sleep i could dream
if i were a train i'd be late again
if i were a good man i'd understand the spaces between friends
that space cadet glow
is there anybody out there
upside down
it would be so nice
but i would just like to say
it would be so nice
pass the butter please
to meet sometime
to a distant place
it would be so nice
and i never knew we could be so blue
and what exactly is a joke
and i dont care if nothing is mine
wind his branches round
am i really dying
find me where i'm hiding
there's a silence surrounding me
i sometimes wonder what are you thinking
what are you thinking
i'm young and able
can buzz all night long
to buzz all night long
well i buzz better baby
ice is forming on the tips of my wings
across the clouds i see my shadow fly
and i'll never pine
in the warm light of her eyes
and if you dont mind
i've got a cloak it's a bit of a joke
i'll give you anything ev'rything if you want things
it's got a basket a bell that rings and
i'll give you anything ev'rything if you want things
i'll give you anything ev'rything if you want things
the paper holds their folded faces to the floor
you lock the door
it's good to warm my bones beside the fire
and smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
you race toward an early grave
dig that hole forget the sun
bring the boys back home
cast aside the other way
oh my girl sitting in the sun
ice cream taste good if you eat it soon
like that
ice cream taste good in the afternoon
i like to see you run
it's you who i'm gonna love tonight
go buy candy and a currant bun
going and coming without error
sunset sunrise
the spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye
and i can see you smile
surf is high an the sea is awash
dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep
let's try it another way
see emily play
there is no other day
free games for may
marigolds are very much in love but he doesnt mind
a brother's way to leave
a brother's way to leave
another time another day
a brother's way to leave
set the controls for the heart of the sun
little by little the night turns around
the heart of the sun
only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
now things are really what they seem
through quiet reflection and great dedication
and do as you're told
you reached for the secret too soon you cried for the moon
pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
and we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
come on you target for faraway laughter come on you stranger
signs of life
time to be be be awarecarter's father saw him there and
oh oh did you ever know know
while you are wasting your time on your enemies
stuck in a world of isolation

playing the games that we know and in tears
i hope you're exceedingly thin
and all we've got to say to you is good bye
and hide with me baby
point me at the sky and tell it fly
a little refuge on my brain
why did we tell you then
i never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes
evening never came
why cant we blow the years away
without the morning's kiss
why cant we blow the years away
in your favorite disguise
down your door
trying to pick her locks
scratched by the sand that fell from our love
speeding away on a wind to a new day
if you're alone i'll come home
fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
all agreed with hand on heart
and still the dark stain spreads between
most of usvery hard to explain why you're mad even
i rise looking through my morning eyes
take off this uniform and leave the show
from your bed i came today and lost a bloody year
just to let me know how do you feel
we met just six hours ago
tomorrow brings another town another girl like you
empty
so i spy on her i lie to her i make promises i cannot keep
she can take it back she will take it back some day
pain is red
empty

terminal frost
your fantasies merge with harsh realities
all the proud men turned to dust
on a trip to cirrus minor saw a crater in the sun
a thousand miles of moonlight later
well i can ease your pain
when i was a child i had a fever
but you may feel a little sick
out of the corner of my eye
while you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
i took a heavenly ride through our silence
mrs clegg you must be proud of him
he won it in the war in 1944
no one is to blame
on a hill a little man with many shining things
screaming scheming movie man
laughter echoes in your eyes

the leaves are heavy around your feet you hear the thunder of the train
empty
please wake me butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side

you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
and as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone
that everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
who was breaking away from the pack

night after night
well when we grew up and went to school
within inches of their lives
that's the only time that i can really speak to you
of the gunners dying words on the intercom
close your aching eyes beyond your name
but you cant touch the restless sky
you hear the night birds calling you
weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
hear the roar get louder in your ears
throw your thoughts back many years
close your aching eyes beyond your name
close your aching eyes beyond your name
but you cant touch the restless sky
you hear the night birds calling you

to heart from mine
and i draw a line
man overboard
so sad our
there's nothing left here
i'm walking in the city at dark
i saw the trees crossing the moon
the sky lit up
and the colour was red and he drove me
inherited his father's hate that's what he'd say
and he'd wanted everything
even the son of god had to die my darling
i remember it all started when he bought that car
when he put me there in the back seat and he said
he'd turn to me and say
and he'd in there when he wanted everything
will send me to my grave
just let me ride on his grace for a while
just let me ride on your grace for a while
once held secret
that was my veil
no more secret
that was my time
was there a love there
give back my life
they say god forgives
so i gave him my time
and the stars shine less bright now
he came bathed in light and the splendour and glory
my love will stay till the riverbed run dry
is he near is he far
empty
it's war time
empty
they're kissing
empty
and he was walking in the night
'let me give you a little kiss'
and the wind it gathered round him
in my handwriting
wet the envelope
on my words
cheating lying since the day you were born
your lips taste of poison
you'll be in the corner crying
the city sun sets over me
this mess we're in
above skyscrapers
thrill is gone after all these years
thinking of
even though i'm getting on
i'm not trying to cause a fuss
till they came up close
and we walked through this land
and day
and i wont cry
and soon enough daddy
pale blue water
he'll fall upon
under the bridge
became blue eyed whore
i heard her moan
clean and sparkling he'll see me
lonely all this lonely
if you put it on
if you put it on
easy said it cannot be
he said no it cannot be
you're caught up in my hair
you leave me dry
you leave me dry
empty
empty
empty
singing i'm singing
she tears my heart out every time
a big bone shaker
petals green
on my hill i wait for wind
in chinatown
my bad fortune slipping away

every cloud is grey with dreams of yesterday
pussy willow that smiled on this leaf
on his hands hang tall
i was half the way down
empty
couldnt start to hide me
it always seemed enticing
join the masquerade
the big big blue
blood drowning
blood drowning
'cause there's nothing else to do
every me and every you x2
every me and every you x2
every me and every you
no other box i choose to use
prone to cling and waste these things
every mehe

when you're laughing all the time
my father told me that you're always lonely
inside out and outside in
conversation growing dull
he's got a thousand talents
empty
all the movies in my head
dont forget your
and slowly blow yourself away
to a healthy heart beat
haemoglobin is the key
the whole world wants my disappearance
got a headrush in her pocket
burning clouds around and in my solar plexus
hang on hang on
you look in the mirror
laughing at your airs
everybody goes
i know
i know
i know
mary always edges her bets she never knows what to think
if your luck is dying go and plant a tree
just like every lichen how you stick to me
weightless bare faithless scared
'scuse me i apologize
suck you in
and then she locked herself out
confused and racked with self doubt
my sci fi lullaby
you should take more time
please dont die
then you'll die you'll die dont die dont die
une presence inconnue
an ambiguous presence
an ambiguous presence
miss moneypenny
miss moneypenny
never thought i'd do you the same
never thought all this could back fire
you are the one
so before i end my day
you are the one
different partner every night
had some help from insect ways
and it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
and it all breaks down at the role reversal
got the muse in my head she's universal
you frame the photograph
or you'll end up a wreck
wake up
empty
can you find me space find me space
can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
it falls apart
so i had to cut the mother down
i'm in excess need of a stroke down
you god damn liar
pay check pay check
i have to climb your wall
that stole my broken soul
with every bet i lost
i'm faithless i'm scared
a friend who's dressed in leather
a friend in needs a friend indeed
and makes for stormy weather
and then she's boxing clever
empty
i gotta place it on the rack
her younger sister had a blister
i'm a man a liar
i'm a man a liar
it echoes in my brain
slackerbitch faghag whore
slackerbitch faghag whore
you hate me now i'm sure
run away from all your boredom
a race for rats to die
run away repeat
you come on just like special k
no escaping not for free
just like i swallowed half my stash
i fall down hit the ground
queens are left for dead
feeling demonic harmonic in a no go zone
aces take your pity
queen take your chances
you look well suited like you came to win
cue to your face so forsaken
you try to break the mould
like blood from a stone
you try and break the mould
stay with me
empty
kind of
empty
empty
empty
i cant remember where i put it
stay with me
change your style again
i'm killing time on valentine's
shine the headlight straight into my eyes
and still not satisfied
lay me down the lie will unfurl
and dont forget to breathe
i dont want to be forgotten
cut your eye far to me
one more time for me one more time for me
for pleasure and passion you play the price
swimming in the sea and i think i'll
for the son of man
packing all the time
i'll take it by your side
your slipping slowly from my reach
take the plan spin it sideways
if it's a bad case you're on the rampage
you're too complicated we should separate it
you dont care about us
but i still believe in love
empty
stay by my side
empty
and every poisoned word that
see the creatures of the street
i dont wanna hear you call
i'm totally left out on my own
allways ment to be yeah
wont you tell us what it's like
closer to the fire
in your eyes the wildfire rage
empty
you're feeling the flame that burns within you
when i take off from here
chasin the red light
it's my playground my scene
right till the end of the road
of the bitter end
to give you strength to carry on
when times get tough
i never wanted it to be this way
someone dies and as we close our eyes
pay attention
if we dont
there is no true escape
wear me out
back off
hit me from behind
hurt you bad
i want you to know
the sound of metal
back to back back to back
they'll never fall
saturday night
the battle begins
empty
and expire no more
but all in all it's just a battle of pride
there aint no other life no second chance
i just want my share of fun for sure
dont know where i'm going
there's nowhere to sleep
where is the future
are all gone so far
as the night turns everything black
no one will ever walk the streets again
but as a rescue city light
empty
i'm down on bended knees
found the kiss of life in the fire from your breath
instead there's a killer out in space
cold killer cold killer
stars shining bright and free
dont try to talk to your father
and so we are here
you know the final solution
from master to slave
rise up
dont have to hide away
in a silent revolution
dont put your trust in the flames of the flag
ever since we jumped this wild and wacko roundabout
push it to the limit
ready for take off
you want it we got it
for fortune and fame
you feel like loosing
empty
it aint no false illusion
finally see the light
where do you go when you know
somewhere in time
when every flame has died
i'm aware i'll be there when the morning comes
all of us
guess you're the hurting kind
in which i'm hiding
say the word i wanna hear you say
my piece of heaven
if you could give in to me
my sanity is spilt in two
i can smell you
now you're in my posession
dont take the candy from his hand
cant recall somehow
you're running scared
needle kills the pain
say about you
reflects your mental wounds
she knows how to treat her boy
with no regrets for the mistakes
figure it out
our fate is written in the sand
you are suffering and mistery
my wraith and my hostility
rising from hell
you are the incubus
turned me into what i am
washed your hands and sanctified yourself
right until you lie dead
empty
of you
within you there's some of me
my atrocity
i'm the blood on your hands
accusations flying
the unwritten pages
our lives are left in disarray
you see there aint no common ground
an answer to my prayers
she leaves me in a state of grace
she's so good to me
it's plain to see
love is a natual high
makes you dependent
the world has gone crazy
read into their tarots
there are needles in the dark
empty
dont know what's in sight
empty
you better pray for your life
you better watch out and dont let it out
hear the cries of a woman
nasty little neighbours
spaced out on dope
some one shot the breeze
i'm rolling thunder
set souls on fire
i'm devastated
so hard to face
but the reflections lie
save me from
someone kill the pain
blood on the floors
just waiting for attack
but you're wrong i'll tell you why
so many things can get you high
it's a fact and you know that it's true
sugar ray cia lost in hollywood
from the pils of dollar bills
lucy in the skies
but we both had our times
i know that we'll make it some day
cause i know that we'll make it one day
every night when i'm facing the truth
cant break away
where lovers meet
ready to strike
another walks in
empty
the way she looks at you
breaking the genetic rules
there's no limit to our venture
we hold the future
that instant high
kills your pride
someone clear my eyes
tell you how to run your life
and burn their body bags
going through the mud
mirror mirror on the wall
but at dawn she flies away
dont leave me in hell
empty
so many broken promises
time awaits for no one
i cant defect from
empty
just another sixties' breed
as he kicked in the door and said
you see but i dont complain
i cant take it
know what i'm doing
empty
now tell me what you want from me
beyond this tortured mind
it all becomes my world of fiction
i'm burning down the candle
i'm out of control
along the way
enter the devils womb
we're helpless
purity for the swine
until it dies
now insanity reigns
my only comfort is my death
violent in extreme
cause the violent tribe is for real
down in the gutter your second to none
children of aggression
empty
virtual brutality
evil never sleeps
what happened to the world we knew so well
we used to fly into the heavens
trying to get this puzzle together
dont hesitate
i got a feeling girl
empty
if you got no place to go
we came to rock
we are the faces
we're gonna hit the stars tonight
i'm gonna fall
is just the road to hell
we're the last generation
like a paper in flames
which are the last
and a heart of gold inside
got no foxy lady
who said money money
i say money comes around
we look the other way
we need new dreams tonight
the man behind the fence
with this heart
out in the cold
empty
there's only fractured dreams and you cant
and your past wont die
empty
the forever repercussions
behind the enemy lines
war is a never ending mission
and locked behind the walls
we've seen them dying in the fields
oh no no
daddy's girl she works the night away
high born rich mans girl
in the hands of a stranger
two different worlds are such a tough combination
another lonely heart
life in extreme
what you dont know
when money's tight
you cant get enough
you see fate has its price
dont hide your fascination
shoot at me
love will find a way
you have to fight to hold on
and shoot for the heart
hold tight
now wait a minute baby
you know love is blind
love games
playing until i've had enough
brought me down on my knees
oh he's building up inside
under surveillance
walking the street as soldier
a little rain must fall
this love
sail she seven seas
we'll fly up high and touch the sky
check this out
she's shooting like a rocket
down the sidewalk
she'll make your motor run
they shout in the streets of
cry for justice when you long for it
with evil tyrannic regimes
empty
i'll free you from reality
on the wings of a dream
for a little while
in a sea of light
do you still have confidence
now you walk in the shadows
your heart is your prison
see you drown is the darkness
when there's nothing to hold on to
you're alone with your lack of
played your tricks
we rode the storm
dream on
love in the first degree
once you chilled me to the bone
empty
more than meets the eye
all over again
dreams of a lifetime
venus arising
in the eye of the storm
empty
but i cant fight this feeling
you question me
come out and face me
than ride the trend
you build me up and tear me down
every word that you wrote just to hurt me
let me see
someone behind you
something compells you
dont ask me why 'cause i dont know
just a fantasy
i dont know what is going on now
take one last look and close your eyes
on through history we've come
in legends and heroes
shout at the sky and pray to
empty
here we are facing trouble again
the slices of the past and now we're worlds apart
in the name of romance
and rediscover what it's all about
we're dragged around
we wanna live
hurt by the truth
they're all crooks
but i cant explain
or just imaginations
tonight we're riding on
left the wastelands
we heard the fools
no demands
its time i start walking
you'll be a hard luck woman
dont cry
loosen up the child inside
empty
it's my decision
it's a true rebellion
empty
gonna break defences
but somehow the wind kind of pushed us this way
i shiver and i shake
magic charm
baby babe i like your dirty tricks
got to do it
when things could work out fine
stay by my side
now what're you trying to prove
i met this girl
but she glows there's something about her
i cant resist
my mean teen queen
into that poisened rain
you've been away too long
on the road to her regret
but there's some who gets nothing in return
here you whisper in the summer wind
the promises we once mad
empty
like a mother and child
just went out to get a couple
here we are and we're for real
little miss roundheels we want you so
as i head down the road
in the minds of the young
all i found was just you and i
'cause i dont wanna face the truth
the invisible chains that eternally binds you
and nobody ever did
empty
now you're a grown up a cool guy looking pretty
jump the gun
has taken off from the street
get out seek and find
in beirut the hate is burning
stop this madness that we're living in
seems out of reach
little darling little darling gonna love you to night
stayed out all night
i'll go the distance
fight for all it's worth
i'm gonna live it up
i'll stand up to the test
cause my motive is my lust
let go
in leather and lace
it's a long way to go
she's the one
she's so hot
but my agony is not in vain
but my agony is not in vain
and how long i could be dead
i can hear the final bell
so be prepared to die
and we must pay the price
battalions of hate gloryfied crime
i felt the wind in my face
you will sleep in a bed of lies
you will wake up in the middle of the night
out of this world in another dimension
he fights for the right
empty
just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
steel and fire
so many inocent have died
of our lord
oh lord my god consider all their words thy hands
a sweet illusion or a secret from hell
there's no one scared and nothing left
i can see the truth
i can see the truth
there are stories told nobody wants to believe it
as quick as they appeared they crushed away
there is hate and there is lust
no force will ever stop you
you fear no enemy
today you are stronger than you've ever been
money and business are counting our lives
suspicion tradicion releasing the rage
they collected parts of death
cant ignore my soul is burning
my hate is religion
saw a field of fire we're under the gun
the invaders from beyond
smoking wheels i'm getting faster take the lead
beat my beat i'll finish first and take the price
solo tom kai tom
they have prisioned me
you gonna pay for your crime
justice out of our hand
empty
you hit me with an iron fist in a velvet glove
you hit me with an iron fist in a velvet glove
speed on and on
treason treason the spectre looms again
down down down
i dont want to see me in tins nightmare
with a wall of energy
all the fans are going crazy
and sing this song
about progression without charity
surrender to the seer
hiding the truth everlasting youth
nine lives you'll never forget
i need more time to understand
will you forgive me
standing face to face in this secret place
we're searching for a way to live
and you hold me tight this moment can last forever
it will take us one step higher than we were
we are the soldiers of death
you think your life is boring
play to kill play to kill
a boundless hyper energy
in time of greed and jealousy
empty
i'll be your guiding light
empty
place called the promised
as i needed you most there was no call
the time ran out red rain will fall
cause they were running in the dust running
ause they were running in the dust running
an angels life has ended up by violence
it's always been a chalenge for me
what is behind eternal fears
ticking like a time bomb i knew the time was right
silver and gold your future is sold
for silver and gold we're searching for souls
for silver and gold we're searching for souls
and if you hurt me there's a way back to you
until i found you again
empty
empty
there's no holding back now
and drag their victims to the hill of fear
do they bring us to a place called
we'll have to leave our vale
give me hope to survive my future

their eyes knock you backwards with a glance
the nights out are hanging from your waist
but you fidget and your heart is growing cold
he prods and it cries in pain
one touch and it lives again

no one saw us but the trees
oh no no i might as well go tell it to the trees
suck and sate forces of fate
generations glimpse the high pitch play it for real four billion spectators look on
we're talking again smiling and laughing ignoring the past
as i lay down in the bedroom there came a sound from far away
standing empty forever and colder every day
only love will keep you together
oh this they saw as love
they suffocate at night
so sad to see

linen sheets and find that sweat they were only two hours before

a sensational buzz zzzzzz
you want some entertainment
we'd like to get you out of your mind
but no one else could see you see i could live sans danger
oh the way i've changed since yesterday
she swore that she'd love me never would she leave me
now some men like fishin and some men like a fowlin
little mesters coughing their lungs up globules the colour of tomato ketchup
i went there again for old time's sake
and all the time in the background the sound of that ridiculously heartbreaking child's ride outside
no chance never in a million years
the river flowed by day after day
her perfume strong it turned me on
i'm stranded here with no way home
we use your bed for goodness knows ow

and if i messed it up baby
oh and it could it could be tonight if i ever leave this room
i'm gonna leave this town

mother mother

let's do it now
oh all i do is just ok
so i go home and wonder why i bother going
i cant believe it
hey i feel this night will never end and i will never see the day
rolling empty cans down the stairway dont you love that sound
when the council investigated they discovered that the man in the flat
we just want your car radio and those reflux speakers
are you talking to me or are you chewing a brick
wont it be strange when we're all fully grown
i used to walk you home
thursday years ago
be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
i am the man who stays home and does the dishes
i'll read a story if it helps you sleep at night
you've got no cross to bear tonight ah
the places he never goes now it's getting late
jesus it must be great to be straight
oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere that i go
oh i want some more
there's not much time for talking all your friends are going to walk away
then again she might make you everything that you want her to
oh you'll stay oh you'll stay
and the sun will shine again and i will kiss your face
you just wanna wave and say goodbye go away now and leave us alone
nadadum dadadada dada da
now these cold nights have come oh i go down to the river
like what i meant to say i speak to you with a borrowed tongue
you choose what you believe in as far as i'm concerned
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
i said your head is your feet
in the childrens room three identical sisters sat
the man has come between us his cheeks rattle like a fence
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
the louder you scream the faster we go
the same events stuffed in a slightly different order each day
but this isnt chocolate boxes and roses
feeling ca double led love
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah ooh
you dont want to live till monday and have to do it all again
and who are you going to see
and i go to the window
frozen gardens grey in the moonlight fences down to the canal
she is balancing good god
do you think that we can
oh no she doesnt feel right
he falls to sleep again no cheese tonight she knows
and the stars and the moon
hey all alone you and i in our high tower
yeah yeah yeah yeah
she wants to see you at least that's what she said
oh you could stop her if you get out of bed
entertainment can sometimes be hard when the thing
just what exactly are you made of
and do you really know want to know just how come you turned out so dumb
i'll be around when he's not in town i'll show you how you're doing it wrong
so just lie against the wall and watch my conscience disappear
you want some bacon
pigs are filthy animals i dont eat filthy animals
empty
we' have to be talkin 'bout one charmin motherfuckin pig
he's got your heart he's got control
ma ma ma oooh so what should you do
if i saw but i'm out of the way
i'll give you your own room it's next door to my room
no you dont have to talk to me just leave the light on so i can see
no that's not right but but if we if we kissed with tongues
and i know that your sister missed her time again this month
no they arent working at all oh
and all those stupid little things they aint working
no they aint working oh they arent working at all
empty
and those are the hash bars
i know baby you'd dig it the most but you know what the funniest thing about europe is
and i dont mean in a paper cup either they give you a glass of beer
they call it royale with cheese
empty
she she used to live with his brother
the first time leaves its trace and then slides into second place
and the hours turn into days but still it feels like morning
at night they try to fly hold on tight and close their eyes
you can take them off if it makes you feel better
whilst looking at pictures of you
so roll the soundtrack and dim the lights 'cos i'm not going home tonight
breathe in breathe out
for the rest of my life
my god my god why did he go away
he must forget that face forever
now the moon is high in the sky
shalesmoor wombwell catcliffe brincliffe attercliffe ecclesall
i may have only been eleven
the city is a woman
the whole city getting stiff in the building heat
the world is going on outside the night is gaping open wide
why's it so hot peace garden
candida i'm here
the carpet's screaming for her soul the darkness wants to eat her whole
i didnt think we were gonna make it
that's all i wanna do
yeah jesus
cant you see i need too to
you wont need a jet plane or a luxury cruise
i feel so lonely now with you gone
the thought of our disintegration is killing me
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor
raindrops taste like tears
and it's another rainy night without you
another rainy night another rainy night without you
anytime that's allmy sweet addiction i pray will never end
michael wilton geoff tate
so we've let this happen all along
our system awaits test
all my life behind me
i dont want to be an island
i've seen the world through a bitter stare but my dream is still alive
back street hoop star you've got it good
time for some blue sky
beholding light on the spell you're under
but the night will reflect the hunger
time moves in and out of phase of everything that i face
they told me to run but just how far
i look for your face in the neon light
cant you hear me screaming
through the streets i'm screaming
time can change a thing or two
youre begging me for a brand new start trying
you say son lets forget the past
in my head i hear the song a million voices strong
mesmerized by the waves of your smile
save me success is our hunger we need to feed
peace wont last forever
treading the borders of sin
by the pain that you bring
that they must feel
she'll come and take you away
your soul slipped away
dreams of dying fill your head
you're fading away no no no
it's ok it's just a dream i had
today i felt something so strong it took my breath away
it's ok it's just a dream i had
down in new orleans river's boiling
burning coal
resistance through the din one voice we should hear
resistance listen to the call of the wild
it's just a power mad town
revolution calling
begging for my cash
gotta make a million doesnt matter who dies
but now i've seen the payoffs
hey are you okay better luck on another day this path some werent meant to follow
lyrics by geoff tate and chris degarmo
i'm awaiting this grand transition
and still i'm standing here
maybe one day oh i'll meet you and we'll
forming figures fast behind you
and you'll stand atop the gate
to late to save a dream that's growing cold
dont you see life's a game
we are one we are children of the light
we realize that fate must hide its face
so take hold of the flame
so take hold of the flame
i send waves of devotion over you you take it all in and give it back give it back again
now im falling falling inside
watching you watching
breaking inside out promising to stay
my eyes see only the programs you give me
hush now i'll give all you need to know and pre live your dreams for you
oh father no please dont keep me from dreaming
a sign of the times sign of the times
from those behind the scenes yeah they take the bribe it's on the side
so here it is another chance
i will be watching over you
master of illusion
so i can go find it now i cant live your way
if you cant see what i'm trying to say maybe you just
until you try you'll never see what i mean
the chains i wore were mine dragging me towards my fate
one step when i look down
looking down at what i used to be
i think i finally understand
i think therefore i am familiar to most
does language define us is reality words
roll out new scenery as per suggestion
we need to strip it all away
turn another turn
i'm bent on submission
to preach the new beginning
seven years of power
speak to me the pain you feel
empty
and johns a happy man
on the alter like a sacrifice
fighting fire with empty words
the way society
to saintly faces hallowed be their names she cant recall
my faith is growing growing tight against the seam
your precious cross is gone it made me wait so long
the hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight
we're being used and fed
the blood of christ cant heal my woundsso deep
it's their training solution
there's no turning back
distant signs of darkness on the way
throw down the chains of oppression that bind you
i remember there was a time when fears
empty
the lady wore black
of the quiet shadowed woman
her mystic power calls to me
but for her love i'll gladly pay
beside my window
till the sister comes to wash my sins away
waiting for days longer
i'll hide away in here the law will never find me
save this world we'll all stand proud
you'll never get away
wet and raving
dont ever trust the needle when it cries
skin tight leather provides my pleasure
forbidden sin relenting
with fear as my friend i walk the thin one more time for you
cold is the viper stalking the night for the heat
free under the night sun
we've had what others might call love
i'll take you home
we'll walk in the shadows
time to cry your tears now cry
he's leaning back against the wall
oh theyve taken all i have but i just need whats left of today and you can wash it all away
here comes the rain
i suck up and buck up and fuck up
the game of us and them we play
it goes on and on this insanity
i'm upside down inside out upside down inside out
what you do to me
watching the time tick tick away
jet city woman
eyes like the rain rain down on me
are you smiling or afraid
theyre only your illusions anyway
i aint no sacred idol or a saint pretending
never was a smart kid never knew a good thing
you're just a memory now like all the ones before but with your pain i've had to suffer
the worst is being alone
when the first met i must have seemed a million miles away
please leave me alone on this day
please leave me alone on this day
i'm in meditation high above
now who will come
and im gone
maybe well see
so i turn my gaze to another place
reach for a new horizon setting sights on a circuit scream
gathered from the winter air warms the childrens eyes
beware of night for we all know he's loose again
the nightrider sails away
oh god beware of the night
to turn around
into code wide eyes watch my
forgotten lost memory
oh cant you see the lies in front of you
you feel lost in time you've got no words to rhyme
one life is like one prayer one love to share
now bend your knees and bruise the earth and pray
this constant dream is on my mind chase the light i see ahead
the best man that i can
when you couldnt go to school
so take this number and welcome to
wait by the phone
working overtime
operation mindcrime
that sadly isnt there
hes not well
youve left them here for me
is this all
somehow slid to the ground
numb with the suffering
the same old sad song
i read about all of these crimes when will it end
we legislate and educate trying to find
what you hear and how you choose
the way you use your mind
a prophecy will make its stay
they say im to reach inside and find
will tomorrow find me hypnotized crying
to understand the chapters
back from beyond to rule again
and you are he and you must die to be
the gace that many once adored
big city bound
fill your tin can with life
about this loathsome
feeling so dis con nec ted
nikki anybody home mary
tell you right now they've got nothing to lose
eastside meets westside downtown
cant you feel it coming empire
the dying remains of a world gone insane
empty
we're alone
dr blair dr blair dr j hamilton dr j hamilton
and i raise my head and stare
there's got to be something left for me
all i want is the same as everyone
walking wall to wall to pass the time i picture what its like on the other side
day in day out on and on im missing you
this is my life
whatever happened is over now for you
i wait by your door till you're asleep
you think i'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic
feeling the fool could you tell it showed
hauntingly holding my fate with a gaze
a rhythm of hope and a vision of choice
i promise girl hand on heart
i think i'm drifting
corporation greed television need
never be the same till i die
pushing back the time that we wait in line
how could i know
how could i know
surround and reveal the ever present it
might easily be explained
the game is played
but do we ever ever really know
no time for love it doesnt matter
i dont believe in lovev i need to forget her face i see it still
i dont believe in love
how come i end up where i started
it comes to us all
wont take my eyes off the ball again
it's the devils way now
payin attention
payin attention
oh hail to the thief
but it's not
just like everybody
someone's gonna bring me 'round
you had to ruin it for all concerned
it's a drunken punch up at a wedding yeah
and if i sat down and crossed my arms
drag him out your window
takes all your credit cards
take it with the love is given
put me inside
if i squeal to the cops
dont know we're born little
steal all my children
i am born again
in an interstellar burst
i'm in the middle of your picture
i'm in the middle your picture
and glows in the dark
morning bell
empty
cut the kids in half
anyone can play guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
i'm teetering on a breaker
so you're backtracking
what the hell we've got nothing more to lose
oh she said no go
yeah yeah
whatever gets you off
the pyramid is power
i'm taking you down when i go down
and how much did it cost
sail us to the moon
a moving target in a firing range
walk into the jaws of hell sit down stand up
sit down the rain drops the rain drops
and the buildings say we spit on your face some more
i can feel their blue hands touching me
scream as they fight for life
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
all these things into position
and i cant change gears
i keep forgetting
of all these weird creatures
i'd tell all my friends
you bite through the big wall the big wall bites back
so i declare a holiday
i want to i want to be someone else or i'll explode
the words are coming out all weird
my baby's got the bends oh no
to blow me away to blow me sky high
i wanna be part of the human race race race race
genie let out of the bottle
shadows blue and red shadows blue and red
we're alarming
everyone is so near
like it's seen a ghost
idiot slow down slow down
trickster is weak
all things fall apart
police check carefully
just cos you feel it doesnt mean it's there
we are accidents waiting
but i'm playing with myself and what do you care
been thinking about you and there's no rest
to wash your swollen feet
your crazy kiss and smile
i wish i could be good
one minute snake charming
so long so long
oh you let the people down
i will not control myself
i will not control myself
when i'm at the pearly gates
you are my center when i spin away
are you sick
we suck young blood la x8
in the deepest ocean
turn me on to phantoms
weird fishes
empty
and i cant and i cant come down
there'll be no more lies x4
you are always there
and yes i am wary
and yes i am wary
come on if you think
i'm so sad
you are the sun and moon and stars are you
but i wont share myself with you
open up begin again
have ourselves a good time
even when the ship is wrecked i promise
empty
little babies eyes eyes eyes
i've seen too much
let me hear both sides
this is really happening happening
another message i cant read
i've lost my way
i supplicate myself into your hands
i hold my peace
quit smothering me
and you bother me you possess me
just as the drinks arrive
before the night owl
what's the point of instruments
jigsaws falling into place
jigsaws falling into place
just you and no one else
and that's what really hurts
you do it to yourself yourself yourself
this is what you get
and for a minute there i lost myself i lost myself
i slipped away
too hard on the brakes again
they wont ever take me alive
wrap me up in the back of the trunk
i want you to know
look into my eyes
so knives out
houses live and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief
too powerful
let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
i am going to grow wings
dont jump
save yourself the pain
you'll never get there
a low corporate
changed shape to fit in the end you just feel sick
no i swear i swear i swear
drunken confessions
my love
my love
i cant do this alone
we hope that you choke that you choke
let's go down the waterfall
it's nothing at all
and i'm wrecked up all inside
well if i stop that singing to you friend
a handshake of carbon monoxide
no alarms and no surprises let me out of here
empty
with no ripcord
empty all your pockets
'cause it's time to go home
my body is floating down the muddy river
well if i stop that singing to you friend
someone is standing there
a restless body cracks some more
we are standing on the edge
i cried out to break the spell
i'm sorry that i lost control
tell me one thing tell me one thing and let it go
well it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
dont forget that you are our son
was always tangled up in knots
but no one's looking anyway
we've been stitched up molasses
release me
run around around around around around
nobody wants to be a slave
it's not like the movies
i think you're crazy maybe x6
we're too young to fall asleep
the headshrinkers they want everything
the headshrinkers they want everything
the headshrinkers they want everything
but now
used in a photo in time magazine
i got myxomatosis
they protect me listen to me
if you think you belong enough
breathe keep breathing
now we are one in everlasting peace
and i cant put the needle in
too scared to know the reasons why
in the fake plastic earth
for girls in the eighties
it wears her out it wears her out
fingers in
for no real reason
dead from the neck up
a fit
a safer car baby smiling in back seat
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
concerned but powerless
tied to a stick
coming out to me
and i can see you now
empty
over my dead body
tip toeing tying down
that she bought from a rubber man
but gravity always wins
it wears her out it wears her out
you're turning into something you are not
you will be the one screaming out
no matter how it starts
throw your keys in the bowl
your ears are burning
and when i'm like this
when i'm like this
he wants to be loved and he wants to belong
and he steals and he bullies anyway that he can
let you out
i walk through walls
this isnt happening
and there's nothing in this world will keep it down
even though i might even thought i try i cant
she stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed
dont go you'll only want to come back again
on playing fields
blame it on the black star
i get on the train and i just stand about now that i dont think of you
and nailed into my heels
turns to stone
i do not
i am trapped in this body and cant get out
it is the 21st century
i've seen it coming
when you've got to feel it in your bones
wax me
and bullet proof
and either way you turn
put the eyes in the cupboard
easy living easy hold
you're just like an angel
i dont care if it hurts
what the hell am i doing here
but i'm a creep
in a beautiful world
i want a perfect soul
she runs runs runs
there are things to talk about
why wont you quiet down
your future's bleak you're so last week
the chink in your armor
all my past and futures
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
it's just business
yesterday i woke up sucking a lemon
what is that you tried to say
now that you've found it it's gone
the big fish eat the little ones
fodder for the animals
if you try the best you can
get off get off get off my case x2
i'm a reasonable man
get off my case x3
i'm too busy to see you
i'm too lazy i've been kidding myself for so long
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
why dont you remember my name
rain down rain down
how'd you get your teeth so pearly
sweet tooth it wont go away
is to carry on believing we dont exist
you can force it but it will stay stung
why cant you forget
how long should you be
so sad you seem tired
she used to be beautiful once aswell
and now you know it gets you nowhere
and his skin is peeling off
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
i work i bleed i beg and i pray
doors on the rudders of big ships
but they are trapdoors
sell me a house that stands
when the first bullet was shot
i never cared before before before before
all the things i used to see
all my past and futures
dare not speak his name
lyrics by p wagner
a pilgrim's path
restless heart
you're just a part of the statistics
all of this borrowed existences
we'll be gone and nothing will show
and with all that we've been through
it wasnt meant to be so real
as i walk the streets i feel no fear
alive but dead
to make me trust in what i am
now the night has gone better days to come
waiting for the outburst for an instigation i bet
to kill if you're not blamed no
a mass of hands press on the market window
while shackled to the line
this is god's land
in appalachia
just like the noose wound
this is the new sound
somehow immediately down with no reason at all
noone could explain
noone would believe it
empty
commin upon the stage i'll say ya somethin
the rhyme is allowed 'cuz you cant philabust this
yo i got to drop the logic
aint no fading
always in control
and death equals silence
mentally and spiritually correct
yo i got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic
music lyrics p wagner
'cause nothing thrills like scary deeds
we make your sheets alive and fill the space up
and when it's dreamtime i'll return
driven back in time
it's a beautiful world we live in
the way they comb their hair makes me want to say
it is the time of the changing season
and from the ashes we'll build it up again
lyrics by p wagner
dont try to get rid of me
between the lines
far beyond my belief
there's something waiting the deep
pistol grip pump on my lap riskin it
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times 3x
if your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times 3x
i guess some people never learn
and justice will be made
he who gave a false witness
music p wagner m schmidt p wagner
power and greedpeople shook their fear off
power and greed
yes they did but just a part of it
why cant you see that it's more than just a state of mind
they will never reach their size
check it out what you have learned
obey you do
dont fear your dreams
in fact there's such ha difference in all
then your soul lies free for everyone to seeand what i do
music by p wagner
but leave my refuge
play your dirty tricks my friend
their time has come to move
but in your mind you'll get scared
no matter how hard you try you cant stop us now
nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades
we are the force of another creation
destroy our nations
we're the renegades of funk
poppin sockin rockin puttin a side of hip hop
there was a time when our music
say dance sucker
he bought rings and he owns kin
hey revolver dont mothers make
the devils painted on the wall
the devils painted on the wall
say how far did we come
from the basement i'm dwellin in
roll right
come back rewind one time
we're all calm
sweating away in a first class hovel
round trip hip grip tourist's madness
the birds that leave me down here they all do the same
as i leave it all behind saddle the wind
say goodbye from time to time saddle the wind
stopping all the sleepers from awakening this night
but dress it not with tannin pure
it's gonna blow my head you fucker get away
when the house is falling in
needs a big kick in his map
no fear what do you mean security
a never ending memory
will be our death cellno miracle in sight
higher than the sky
here is something you cant understand
cause nothing is coming from it
i said yo it's on take cover son or you're assed out
here is something you cant understand
when you havent been where i've been understand where i'm coming from while you're up on the hill in your big home
how i could just kill a man
how i could just kill a man
look into our torture chambers your life isnt worth a dime
that's how how we teat each other
music p wagner c efthimiadis m schmidt p wagner
so what about a little here and now
out there i feel they're scared about me wanting me to die
i am every mother's son
i'm crucified i'm crucified
so i stepped back and started sprayin niggaz
'cause i'm housin
'cause i'm housin
mc's you know who you are
'cause i'm housin
relate to the matter as i drop the bomb
so sweet and defenceless
going down in fever
so just relax your spirit
it started back in time when something stole my mind
i wait for a sign from this old reality it calls me
there were these enchanted books pages that i've known too well
3 finding out
you tell me you like the taste
it's in my eyes
you're just fucking scared
it's in my eyes
music by p wagner
comes off him then
but when the night falls and she puts
in the darkest hour
if it was in vain i will wait for another time
i swear i wont go down again
running away from emptiness
i'm grieving believe in the change in me
those who try to subdue
and words and insight
choose to do doom to
in the narrows
to pay the
release the reason
in the narrows
yeah the name of the comprehender
in the darkness left alone
though unholy and sadistic

the price of war
before you scream for revenge
this world knows no right they wouldnt see what
the pain you've overcome somehow
the scaffold awaits
sooner than nature planned
lay down your head now you're gonna die
but on this battlefield no one wins
we get so close near enough to fight
probably why i forgot about it on tour you can
like my mind's not free
i dont want to be
risk their life for just a thrill
frame their gallows meet their death
when a life has passed
caught in time and place
you can join it for a little while
what's this jungle noise
in every home there's a sickening
who will know now what i know about you
whatever you may say
tomorrow's yesterday
for ourselves to learn
rising high i know we have to try dont give it up
how long you want to stay
action for reaction
to kick in the township rebellion
of the war
in johannesburg or south central
shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross
kids in the street feeling cool they killed the neighbour's cat
true face in everyone facing the lies
true face in everyone conscience cant lie
turn the page and face another day
take your time cause something's on the way
like a creature that is drawn into the flame
leaving my dreams far behind
now where's the difference between my life and the tv screen
deadly error
deadly error
in restless pain
he grabs you at your throat
the pain will be too mush to bear
fading hours of pleasure and pain
fading hours of plesure and pain

or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil

turn that shit up

is it still far to go invisible horizons

modern frankensteins
those who try to do
could be the first to go
screaming leaders tell you what to say
ha ha ha they stand face to face with a gun
oh no somebody said they're marching out
'cept for sing for a rock 'n roll band
'cause in this sleepy la town
i'll shout and scream i'll kill the king i'll rail at all his servants
a street fighting man
a street fighting man
i never thought of consequences bringing life to fall
i see my reflection in you
is telling me what i've become alive and that is why
it's just me myself to blame
oh no the thrill became a curse
yo i was a fiend before i became a teen
one after the another one then i make another one

whatever they squeezed out of him
hungry people dont stay hungry for long
tha life burns to the raw bone
violence in all hands embrace it if need be
a fire in the masters house is set
yes tha new order athletes
an era rising
embrace it if need be
with all the dues that you dont want to pay
i'm gonna be for you a painful lesson
dont worry i'll be coming over you
empty ya pockets son they got you thinkin that
cinema simulated life ill drama
tha poor adore keep fiendin for more
chained to the dream they got ya searchin for
an instrumental song on this somber theme
he had held his hand wide open
he had held his hand wide open
not forever one day he'll be free
making a change
we all had too much
we dropped out on the edge
why cant you see
you or me we go where the money goes
we ride the wings of death
our fingers clutching helpless in the void
leadres losers all will be the same
the night is scary
it is here it's waiting for your call
if you paint the devil on the wall
dont you paint the devil on the wall
spirit of cuahtemoc alive an untamed
empty
speaker on tha one maya mexica
so why fighting for a lie
only get together by touching with our leaves
like a story or a song
what's this thing there in my back
i cannot trust withinwhy is it that we're drowning in hate
when all life worked hand in hand
and then slowly but surely
guess we missed the lesson modesty
but if ya bowin down
yeahand mad mad boy grips the microphone
not a silent one
the silent sheep slippin riffin trippin
wit' a fistful of steel
a 44 full of bullets
then let me do the cuttin
really man it scared me to death
and sometimes i know you're seeing through my eyes
you're still here by my side
there is no mysterium for someone who dares to die
how does it feel to someone when the moment has come
you know it happens a thousand times every day
this chance might be the last for you
straight through the lies
the wall inside he built to defend himself
a fortress in you head
unreal behind your grin
inka inka bottle of ink
with poetry i paint the pictures that hit
doesnt that make it three in a row
brotha did ya forget ya name
for example
empty
empty
drown my anchor in the hearts
but when you cant there's nothing left
i'll miss it from the cradle to the grave
now i am gone and my body lies cold
you'll be a lonely rich man without hope
i must be waiting for the day
help me in eternal nightslowly i feel a growing fear
to uh fraternal order of police in philadelphia
fuck that shit cuz i aint tha one
beat tha police outta shape
fuck the police
fuck that shit cuz i aint tha one
beat tha police outta shape
yeah my brothas will swarm
right now
i'm watching every step you do
the soul lives on we're ghosts
i'm getting closer to you
who still believes he could rule the world
death and destruction will come from their hands
tell the world it's protection nothing can go
see all this dying
throw me in the dungeons
when i thought i had it made
what the hells there on earth that cold keep me alivechorus
my dear this will free you from all of your straits
household furniture like magic
supersonic hydromatic nothing works without it now
i'm stumbling through these fields of naked stones and sand
i cant explain it what has happened to my land
i cant stay in this wasteland
the last man on this planet left alone to die
people talked about this man
but what the fuck was he supposed to do
take my blood i'm not a god
they only tell you lies
you know the fuck
they want us to allege and pledge
it's the beats and the lyrics they fear
i put my fist in 'em
yea we need to check the interior
and like thisuggh
europe aint my rope to swing on
come on come on
a take it back joe come on
talk to grandpa
ask my grandpa if he's got a dime for me
that someone was talking through my mind
i'm talking to the dead
and got an answer and since then i know
im empty please fill me
my witness your coughing
now testify
on the smoke that fills my home
yeah testify
who controls the present now controls the past
my mother told me lies when she
we're bound to be society
and everyone's a dealer but your luck is not for free
chains of the world noone's free
that an early warning's meant to avoid the worst
soon in a time then you will not refuse
oh never you cant hear me
destroyed denied all tears undried
and all water was streaming in
and the highway is alive tonight
lookin for a pillow of solid rock
i'll be there

but there's always factor x that leads the tumbling dice
the inner search needs more than words
keep your own truth in yourself as the only light
keep your own truth in yourself as the only light
hot sweet and tight
you gotta have it baby
'cause it gets in your brain
some of those that were forces are the same that bore crosses
those who died are justified for wearing the badge they're the chosen whites
killing in the name of
fuck you i wont do what you tell me 8 times spoken becoming a shout by the 8th time
know your enemy
empty
and i'll drop the style clearly
so clear the lane
we'll break in
they're the teachers who taught me to fight me
'cause reality is lying to my mind so now
'cause i'm stumbling and it's time to say goodbye goodbye
i've got to leave it all behind
so i'll pack my things tonight and go
i dont want to end like everyone
lyrics by p wagner
come on and rest your mind in my arms
there's light into the darkness
there's light into the darkness
and entry we found in a stonewall
to bring knowledge truth and culture to this undeveloped place
before life crept out of water mother earth was occupied
before life crept out of water
now give us the time to share it
love after death this is forever i have no regrets
i know this is the only bigger truth
was not to see the past was to see youdont you dare
empty
obey or die
no matter what it is it wont be true
well i wake up in the morning
nah i aint gonna work for maggie's brother no more
well he puts his cigar
about man and god and law
but everybody wants you
got someone in his life that he hates i know
make my day
make my day
c'mon you sucker make my day
she clutches her cross
of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
tha needle and thread crucifixion
no moments to pray
i am nothing no one nobody no more
to tear away at the mask
to tear away at the mask huh
is the keeper of our neuroses
what his ancestors already knew
wake up your spirits and let them run free
in video games they do
go out hunting
repeat 1st verse
hey you it's just another bombtrackyeah
those who compete at a level that's obsolete
dispute the suits i ignite
burn burn yes ya gonna burn
my thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
burn burn yes ya gonna burn
empty
where burning batons beat the freezing who shake
and thought is locked in the womb
in the name of my in the name of my
trapped in a lampshade

fun and coma side by side
could you say who's at your side
a yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
so serene on the screen
they say jump you say how high
check a check a check it out
buyin all the products that they're sellin ya
ya standin in line
ya gotta bullet in ya fuckin head
a co opt
not need just feed tha war canibal animal
with pockets full of shells
why did you what you've done
you steal from us all what we need to survive
lies are a weapon that kills from inside
steel from a furnace
pick a point on tha globe
this aint subliminal
these vultures rob everyone
that be feelin like home
what can i do when the sadness comes through
just to make a step costs all my will
then i start to worry everyone around me
mind wont let me out
time time had slipped away
time time had slipped away
my pain you cant comprehend
i'll get you you know what that means
you stir me up
i am a beast
my body's hungry
i'm comin to the forefront
this is a crime that shut us up
down get downand clear the lane
empty
it goes on and on and on
fighting myself
strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone
bring that bass in
shit from the finished song
where do we go who want's to know
than their lives
empty
'aids is killing the entire african nation
their souls encaged
say i'm inferior when i find that i choke
a yes yes y'all
in the days of december
i reache out but you're not there
he was a well respected rich young man
so he lost the control of his car
death in the afternoon
hate is what you sow between all men
empty
what has happened to you life
you're in defense only appologize
i'll never be like you and you will end
deep in the blackest hole
when it breaks into the mind
when i'm begging you to stay tonightdeep in the night
deep in the night
i cannot see you no more
it is just it drives me to desperation
day come true 'bout the end of the world an
there is no more use in praying
on the destination day
sinking like a stone coming through different mental spheres
died without a sense
if they'd seen it all before they wouldnt suffer this way now
lyrics by p wagner
the clods of earth hide his whole life
autumn who's got the time knows nothing yet
dont you fear the winter come with me
when power is in wrong hand
why my life a mess no turning back
yeah deep in the night i'm lost in love
faces shine
locked wit out a wage ya standin in tha drop
project block
a hearse
empty
empty
forced to fight for law and order
when money talks they wont hear all the cries
years or more
there are echoes of evil
and then when this fatal moment came to be
now the future's out of sight
free me from this crying shame
enough is enough those who dont know
'cause if we stay weak we are much better to use
and if we want to have a tomorrow
believe me the first step has been made
please dont get me wrong
fall it's big money the all order and this is
a few make the race but we all must pay the fare
the time has passed them by we must all pay
you speak with a forked tongue
but you just wasted what we invested
saw the face behind the mask
over and over again
weird 'cause i dont want to see
look always right behind you
hatred passed on passed on and passed on
no one's here to catch me when i fall
to escape from the pain in an existence mundane
we settle for nothing later
and we'll settle for nothing later
something's slipped into my body while my mind has been absent
i have slipped in someone's shape while his mind has been absent
it will cost you your head dictator
you know inside that it's true so shame on youyou and your pack
slink away
in my hour of pain
why cant you take it back
lyrics by p wagner
hunt them till the end
she takes sweet revenge hunt them till the end
and the phone was silent no connection
as we harvest all the fruits that come our way
find the words when death is on it's way
something's there that's stronger than our pain
a silent victory it made me see
for more than a decade
madmen madmen
sister demon on my mind
sister demon on my mind
so raise your fists
sleep now in the fire
the agents of orange
there is no other pill to take
empty
oh greed oh yes
father's expectations soul soaked in spit and urine
and dont just think just wake and serve
since a while i thought 'bout leaving here
i have heard they're tellin tales 'bout me
i'm stepping out i'm gonna close the door
next time leave no opinions out
i never felt this way running blind my way
i'm waiting for your return
dont waste your time any longer just start
listen listen what you say
you dont know where we will go
you dont know where we will go
there was a vision that lightened up my life
there was a vision
it vanished in haze
leave my will to the flow
drown into my will like a sleeper
i can make you mine if i want to
ch turn on tha radio nah fuck it
let 'em hang
well i'm a truth addict ioh shit i got a head
tha program of vietnow
well i am a truth addict oh shit i got a head
the air was as bright as my mind
what am i leaving behind
i've got visions and i cant
calling in her sleep at nights
they were married lucky times
oh she's heard his infernal voice from the vault
covers her with his caress
cmon check it
boots and mad guns
he spit truth
cant ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze
but this little brothers watching you too
i'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
because the moonlight can release me from my misery
wake me when i'm dead
and when i grow cold you cotta put a spell on me
wake me when i'm dead
hoover he was a body remover
departments of police the judges the feds
whadda i got to whadda i got to do to wake ya up
who pulled schemes on the dream
empty
pinpoint potential trouble makers'
he builds his homes
its you its built on
war within a breath
worlds eye captured
everything can change on a new years day
war within a breath
war within a breath
remember how you've locked it up in lies
that have shattered all your trust
it's the daily truth we interfere with everything
is there any race as destructive as we are
looking for the final freedom
welcome to the other side
a keeper of the light
you've made it now you're there
he likes to keep what's transient
and they are unique on this earth
and then he's got them all together one by one
music by p wagner c efthimiadis lyrics by p wagner
we need revolution someone has to change the crusted rites
now they are trapped
ayala kin
them bury life wit imp shifts and
she once suffocated now through a barrel she
the truth
the south
tha mother of my child will lose her mind at my
a blood donor ta tha land owner holocaust
breathe wit wilsons hand around
lyrics by p wagner
mayday mayday
is the flying dutchman real
myths and legends wind 'round treasure there to find
mayday mayday
then they came down to me
will they come back and clear our doubts
woman tomorrow i might bite the dust
i can see your face so real
empty
it's dark now in dachau and i'm screamin from
so i'm goin out heavy sorta like mount tai
so now you're pullin the moves pullin
the indigenous farmers of southern mexico
so check it out
everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
all my life it seems just a crazy dream refrain
eyes that looked but not to see
i'm going back to my home
i'm here to stay
i cant go wrong
your mouth is open but i dont wanna hear you
i wanna be with you all night long
can i take you home
a silhouette lit by candle light
till you see your fate written there in her eyes
let the moonlight surround you
let the darkness surround you
the future's at the bottom of a tea cup
a beard full of lice
or pay the penalty
cause it's true what they say about familiarity
cause they wanted me dead or alive
by a spin of the wheel
i can see what i need you better believe
let the dream chaser take you away take you away
crossing all the borders just to take their share
looking for the future
we got everything we need for a peaceful time
day after day i keep waking up
but i dont want to say goodbye
what can i do
i want you by my side
your eyes cant see
so bless me come the down
and then she played me i was mesmerized
i've been blinded now i'm broken
till i kill the pain inside
your gonna make a dead stop
but you never learn
red lights in the mirror
death alley driver
empty
want you to know that i'm gonna break through
you been on talking
how long can i go on this way
i think i'm gonna explode
got my soul to sell
gonna raise some hell
and said i'm at your command yes i am
hungry and wild she was born to the night
oh even the deadly shades of night
she keeps burning me burning me burning me burning me down
you just turn around and walk away
something else to cry about
where is your star is it far is it far is it far
the world spins while we put his wing together
in that heat and rain with wips and chains
time is standing still
she will still be booking down at me
the lady's starstruck running after me refrain 2
and everybody laughs
refrain 1
and the rain comes falling down
version 2 yardbirds' versionsee the stars come joining down from the skies
still i'm sad
searching in the darkness
your words like ice fall on the ground
you leave me stone coldsearching in the darkness
cant break away from your spell
searching for someone they could be anywhere
tried to forget you the bet that i could
oh i feel like i'm stranded out here
i've seen your face before tonight
something's come over me
will we ever meet again my friend
the lines inside my hand say go 3 times
tells me to beware no no no
now you take all the love you gave to me
walk away
without you tearin out my heart
i'll get my mule that acre of groun
my gown will be a calico gown
'cause words has come from gabriels horn
as the summer breeze
he said give me my cane
at the tow'r of babel
they begat the daughters
tried the facts a hide
the folks who should stood in bed begat
heroes and nemesis begat
alternative last verse according to the movie
like a shot gun
i'm street walking
so come and try to bend me if you can
to feel the dog bite
one day in the year of the fox
searching seeking
when the strong young man of the rising sun
with just a wave of a strong right hand
the answer had been found
i dont have forever but i got tonight
i'm hungry for you baby i just cant get enough
ooh give it to me you got everything i need
we touched the sun and went on our way
and you take the needle right to the point
i fondle the hand at hand
as i'm more and more a mortal
when de idle poor
female ensemble
empty
empty
oh isnt it disport
but when a poor man chases after dames
become the idle rich
'cause when you're on park avenue
and out of the nuts
female ensemble ii
drawn like a wolf to the moon it calls to my soul
makin my way through the names on the map
each one calling my name
waiting for the night sign
bell eeeee the bell has tolled
i know just how you feel
running through the shadows
and you just cant see iti aint gonna try and tell ya
you know the story oh so well
so you're gonna get it while you can
calculate your future computerize your past
you give us all a number and nothing changes
i'm a freedom fighter yeah that's what i am
a chase with the wind
a city of heavenly sin
bonded and sold as a slade
a city of heavenly sin
is that little brook still leaping there
and each brook along the way
feel the nails tell tales trails across my spine
closer still lose your will see my world it's criminal
this is a feeling i never knew
i remember seems like a lifetime
cant you feel the love that i send you
i'm daft as a daisy
if this isnt love
you'd never know there was some music playin
then it's too late now
if you dont like rock 'n roll
if you dont like my rock 'n roll
i'm no pawn so be gone speed on and on
fly like the wind
tear him down
down down down down
empty
empty
it's got to be an l a connection
then e beam in the shade from a silvery blade
fibres of steel turned to clay
blinded and bruised by the strain
at the end of today
you could never quite be sure
what was happened with me
long live rock'nroll 3 times
look to the rainbow
who follows a dream
look to the rainbow
who follows a dream
you know it's magic that you'll find
cant you see it's magic that you'll find
cant you feel it's magic
to each lad that comes awistlin
you know you better think twice
get ready make your move
got my finger on the trigger and i'm gonna shoot
you could stand up and take this all night
you're the spotlight kidyour audience died faded away
empty
come and make me holy again
life my spirit higher
just look at me and listen
take good care it's a tightrope ride
electric love is gonna take its' tollcant see nowhere
i know you been runnin around
oh but baby they lied
you're not the only one whose got a bad deal

demonic dirty downtown groove
minds take cover souls take flightoh let me disappear
it's that old devil moon
to your razzle dazzle
old devil moon
yeah i'm gonna get my fill
oh so strong
i dont worry 'bout tomorrow i just live for today
empty
no broken harmonies
she lay golden in the sun

ooh youdrippin with desire
rock fever
lemme see ya roll
hits me straight between the eyes
lemme see ya rock
lemme see ya roll
there's an unholy light
the feelings passed again

the lines must start to crawl
empty
nothing is real
she's worth another look
let her think it's love
i can always tell
oh i might yeah
you say all you want is money
empty

we shall dance around the fire
with strings and flutes
to beware you dont care
living from a hole in the ground

electrish trains and basket ballish
we will go from wretch to riches
my heart feels so sugar candish
if my ishes could come true
relinquish resish
fathers talking shit
the way of what they fucking say

sleeping here for free
for maybe 3 days
the human spirit prevails
over and over again
how did she know the roof would cave in
armageddon is coming so you better start running
like a bomb
of a police state on my block
all i wanna do is make it through without dying
she wouldnt move until the coast was clear
another night
let california fall into the fucking ocean
let california fall into the fucking ocean
looking from the bottom i cant see the ceiling
he said yeah i had the same vision
as wicked as it may seem
i always end up back on the hill
no love in the city 'cause there's no connection
the inner cities burnin yea it's screamin black and blue
the force is unstoppable
ostracized if not otherwise
i said what i got you can have
and i say

i cried when i had no shoes
i'm a sinner and my soul should be cleansed
scars been stricken on their face
but to a long life of crime
black and white who are portrayed without bias
well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure
of a girl she kind of made you spill
and your best intentions splinter and frail
oh yeah
not encouraging reality or me

i asked'em if i could come in and the first thing they said was no hey
i'm a hyena fighting for lion share
permit me to do what i want and i will i'm a nomad to travel hey
no one want to be a burden on a loved one
if you hesitate they'll pursue it
good and evil erme from above
the enemy would not expect an attack at this hour
the devils got work for
she's got her life going she is still breathing
she could no longer live with the lying
behind the warm image is a cold cold bastard
i believed in you you deceiving liar

he's ridin on the river of babylon
the neighborhood will watch
and out come the wolves

in the fields of poison ivy through the famine and disease

in ti they're rocking all night long
well that's one you recognize
things that i'd done wrong
jimmy listens to ska
jimmy and johnny tell me what you're seeing
climb in
things i cant remember comes back to haunt me
it's all been a lesson
i want to break someone's neck
little sammy was a punk rocker
apoogies too like when you're up against the wall
i'd sit back and i'd watch you squirm
see i lost an image an image of chaos
just like the wolf before he bites me
it's just you
just as if it was to despite me
he's back in the hole where they got him living
his eye his mother cries she knows that he is strong enough

he dreams of a time and a lady that loved him
for not too much money but way to much ride
with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye
and he said something reckless
once you've heard the truth
oh you wont forget the sound
i sure do need to tell her that i've thought the whole thing through
postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
you have taken it and crushed it
holding on to someone who dont love the same way that you do
always hits right where it hurts
right before my very eyes
but i sure see a definite change
and he sure wasnt playin no harp
a little bitty crack in her heart
when cupid aims his arrow
love gets carried away
i was supposed to be the rock that you could stand on
the way i feel right now
but there's more to what i'm made of
empty
empty
big watermelon hangin on the vine
suns comin up the rooster's crowin
ants on a log
he plays a game
runnin around
life's full of heartache and havok
and we cant jump off like flees on a dog
our steerin wheels
anything to make you mine
day or night rain or shine
to get to you
we've been searching all this time
yeah i guess by now you know
all night long he makes a lonesome sound
before you kill us all
and i know i had it coming and its all my fault
where we pretend life's rosy and sweet
i need friends who dont pay their bills on home computers
but a better class of loser suits me fine
when the trade winds blow
'cause i love her so
and they made that the start of the blues
empty
and girl i guess

i could make it all add up
it may sound a little extreme i'll do what i have to do

there's a point when you cannot walk away
that's when you be come a point of light
one by one form the mountains to the sea points of light
i shoulda let you when i could
when one night was such a small price to paywell i guess we'd better go
throwing shadows of us
for a while i'll be the biggest man in town
if only she will stay
just token promises will someday break her heart
a dimly lit tavern a willing young woman
like all of my old friends i meet
'cause i never did the things they said i've done
just see they bury me out by mama's apple tree
when they ask if i have one request
and send my body back to my home town
we werent expectin him home until quarter past ten
he was fit to be tied and you were under the gun
somewhere in my broken heart
will keep my love unspoken
somewhere in my broken heart
and the pocket knife i gaveto him on fathers day
and the faded leather bible he got when he was baptised
seven years of school
salvation for the lost
with the family bible and the farmer's almanacwhen to plant
while others spoke of faith
now he wont let go of the shovel
but everyday i pray and hope
cause once your in the ground and cold
i'm dialin 'cross the radio for a song that i can sing
bringin back sweet memories of mama's farm
well i left my soul out in the rain
but if they ever say i'm cheatin
over phone lines and back fences

my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
i read some old love letters right up 'til the break of bone
i'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
chorus til end
take the snow off of the moutain
it only makes me shiver
the wave off of the sea
and it was so easy to love you
and it was so easy to love you

my heart rides the range with my heroes and friends
but what do you expect when some old trucker's heart gets broke
but them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind

through the blue smok y haze all through the haze
honk tonk moon keeps shin in on my ba by and me
that'll turn it all around
and talk that talk and boogie till you shake it off
heaven only knows she's not an angel
i'll swear i can almost hear her wings
and it's killing me to be so far away
and you will never break my heart in two again
and you've waited for the day that i returned
comin into sight
and i know that i
i wish it would rain
cant hold back the pain
when you see me walk on water
i wont need you anymore
now i'm stuck in the traffic all i'm doing is waiting
i called home just to tell her the news
politicians collections
as long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
but i'll be right here loving you
as long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
but then the sun comes up and the night moves on
but if i had the chance to give one more thing
now the man i am today knows
just the right rythm makes you feel complete
in a love like this
and the words all rhyme
there's a sympony in a single kiss
go on go on til you reach the end of the line
words are spoken with chords played
that my love was a true love
third boxcar midnight train
and every lock that aint locked
king of the road
it's nothing at all like i thought i'd find
it's nothing at all like i thought i'd find
till i looked in your eyes
on a blue christmas night
i lost all control
my house is filled with the things that i love
my house is filled with the things that i love
thinkin of this perfect love
as i was leaving
was my closet all cleaned out
for just a day or so
there's no place like home
more of this and more of that

it went out of control
to my right a high dollar man

out on the town
then all the walls around my heart
that's when i knew nothing had changed
the followed their hearts they followed that star
2000 years ago as everybody knows
peaceful valleys mountaintops
may every wish you've ever spoken
this is my prayer
i took your portrait off the living room wall
and see your face in everybody i meet
a little word that oughta mean something
til i said it to youyou made me tell you the truth
and we'll all join hands and remember this moment
and be thankful were here 'til this time next yearmay the new year be blessed with good tidings
gordon payne roger lavoie

that ghost of a chance
i looked in your eyes so bright and so blue
if loving him too much is why
oh i may go crazy missing him
between a woman and a man
like i have ever since you've been gone
everyday your heart beats a little stronger

he'll cover you with sweet talk
with honey dripping off his words
i'm a victim of his kiss
it's such a lonely sound
it's the gently falling rain
you're all i ever wanted in a man
you're all i ever wanted in a man
that's why i chose him over you
oh i love him so much and he loves me too
i took you back with open arms
just too many times to take you back

and all i'm asking in return honey
just a little bit when you get home
re re re respect just a little bit when you come home
empty
tell you that's the way my mama always said it should be
lord please forgive me even though i lied

when you walk into the room
oh i use to like to play around
from my head down to toes
i dont mind to give you a slow dance or two
there may come a time when i'll think of you more
i could stay here forever my heart could be free
it's something i've tried so hard to do
one day i'll come back here and i'll knock on your door
and it's driving me out of my mind
and maybe i'll start to believe
someday i swear i wont let you
confident and self assured he liked her attitude
his world revolved around her
a love deep inside
i dont know why you cause me such pain
received your invitation to the blues
and i remember when you first said that you love me
that i'm your fool
oh all the time
what she's living for
she's just wonderin
where life is fair and time is a friend
the moment the telephone rang
there's really nothing new about the rain
repeat chorus it always feels like this when billy goes away
but now i know and now i see
when the one that you're holding
well i dont know
our love for each other
or i wont let the fire start
you better mean just what you say
empty
in my life and in my heart
it's your call
she called here to talk to you
empty
no need talking
let your tears fall on my shoulder
will stay this way
and when he
it's a dangerous world we live in
and the national statistics
without a worldthey dont call it a crime of passion
do you know where your love is tonight
you're not the losing part
that it's over
he wanted everything
and never cause you're afraid to play
empty
to the love you gave to me
the nights were long
everything you wanted me to be
for the life of me i cant see how
do you hold her all night long
think of me
think of me
everytime you touch her
or believe me when i said that i was fooled
he'll know he's lost watching us leaving
my heart has the strength to tell him goodbye
fallin out of love and back into your life
and in the silence something begins to unravel
on the outskirts of new orleans
there stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood
and the baby's gonna starve to death
here's your one chance fancy dont let me down
and it wasnt very long 'til i knew exactly
here's your one chance fancy dont let me down
now in this world there's a lot of self righteous hippocrits

the first of many lonely mornings i've got to face
empty
nothing can change what is meant to be
wish them merry christmas when they open up their gifts
they'll be glad to see him i'll be barely hanging on
i hate to hear you tell me what you feel is really love
and if you really mean it
say the word
and she thinks his name was john
she lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
she was good to make love to
she was there on his bad days
sunny russ

but daddy cant control her
she's callin it love
and i knew what was going on
she's got nothing to lose

and at midnight the gentle carol silent night was born
holy infant so tender and mild
silent night

they say that love's a chance you take
100000 miles beneath your wings
waiting for a brand new owner
this one wont last too long
the man from dallas kept it up
repeat chorus
every breath you take
so so so long eh yeah
putting off what must be said
we keep hoping somehow we might need each other again
i do things i really hate
you know i'm only human
than to never know you're wrong
cause you're the only one i want my arms around
you can find me
it aint no good life
but it's my life
but it's my life
first of all it was because of her songwriting
well there's news flying 'round
as me not being true

that's the only way to make it
i'd be lying there beside him
but it once was so easy

on my own
called up the stairs for us to hurry
and on this day
the rest of the gang by noon
oh on this day we call christmas
and the miracle he'd become
and you and i will meet
well your friend left her lipstick in your car again
well is that what you tell all the other girls too
makin promises they never keep

winding up the way we planned
bet mine on you
i've got to stand behind the promise that i made
repeat chorus x2
is all it takes
aint nobody else can love you like i can
one thin dime is all you need
and how we love when we're alone
in each other's arms where we belong
he took my hand in his and said the words
how can i tell him
joe doyle rick peoples
but i know where he's at
should i ruin my life or my pride
and he'll laugh when he reads the part that says i'm leavin
oh he just didnt know
you try to think of something worse
well this time aint no different
i cant say i didnt know what i was doing
just as soon as you were free
cant stop now
it'll keep on going long after you're gone
i cant pretend things just got outta hand
i should have kept my distance
but i cant stop now
you know you've got to stand tall
i just think it's kinda sad
this could be the day i finally find my way out

if i had only known
and when you'd smile at me
for no reason just to send you roses
they're if only
we just might have held our hearts
that you're running away
turn around and go back home
i know it's hard to face that love aint perfect everyday
if you see her tell her i'm doing fine and if you want to say that i think
if you see her

if you see me getting mighty
can you hear my falling tears
it's so lonely when you dont even know yourself
at the sight of me
let's get off in my backyard
empty
some seem dirty
get on my throne
oh yeah it's rollercoaster time
all is fair 'n a big fair ground
we're the organic anti beat box band
life is grand in the land of lands
we represent the hollywood kids
the party's got boys and the boys got socks
organic anti beat box band
exploding egos
american equality
empty
of the ku klux klan

sitting on a curb
chirping and burping

someone who's been
in the first place
i'd take a fall and you know
right by my side
i will for you

time to make this clean decision
renegades with fancy gauges
throw away your television
you know when it was really hard core back in the old days
the sex pistols
a vintage year for pop i hear
brazilian children get their fill
i called you hippie you said fuck off
all we are is leaves that fall
hey gone to stay
the most special things you gave me were
in a loving stream

passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
some of us get a little
next stop big hop
days on end
lets dance all night and day now
out on the street
if we want to do our best
just a little to hit the spot
the city of angels
now that is a lie
the city she loves me
i could not get enough
delicate and wild
give it up and i got what i came for
pre chorus
hard to leave when it's picturesque
hard as hell just to comprehend

your uniform returns to air
a kiss goodbye forever you leave
on a walk i could find a wife
moving slow in my lowest gear
at homei've got to get along
use your legs to rock it wide
evebody knows true friends are few
a dude he cant lose when he lives on love
and everybody knows what bobby d was told
we've got another thing coming
that we believe in
make a deal with uncle weezer
deliver for me my darling
miles and miles of nether worlds i roam
give me your head and shoulders
you were there and i was fortunate
shot from the pages of
to be strong and free
to anywhere
empty
night craving
is open
into the night
we dont know
pushing dirt into a quaker
to see the bird
into a bigger bang
the pleasure
the broken
my sunny side has up and died
i'd like to say we did it for the better of
i'm motivated by the lack of doubt
i'd like to think we did it for the better of
get down you might be fucking with the song of life
yes we deliver the truth to our musical birth
greed jealousy gets boos and hisses
'cause when you cop dont you cop an attitude
can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
what it is what it is you can do no wrong
each and every person can be just as renowned
so why dont you love me like you used to do
how come you treat me like a piece of clay
of salamasond
he ruled was too small
and yertle the turtle king

feeling the need
white clouds i'm in
a rainy lithuanian
who fainted when she tucked you in

to the brotherland
slidin on back
empty
my love comes and when it does
a grain of sand
my love is the zulu groove
my love for the best set of buns
my love is my dick in my head
nobody weird like me

affecting almost everything
forgiving any behavior

standing in line

dream of silver screen quotations
to break the spell of aging
a teenage bride with a baby inside

to be part of
worth your weight the gold of meditation
wait a minute i'm passing out
cop top he says i'm gonna win big
burnin so bright i wonder what the wave meant
cant stop the spirits when they need you
give no love until you're wed
injected with the seed of emaculation

this martain ends her mission

rampages pitch color pages
it's a beehive barrel race
given to us by our parents we got together
of irretrievable vital life juice behind still
and spewing ugly shit around nothing
motherfuckers woke us up
wearing gear so out but in though
stealin anything that we could
we were young and we
and serenaded by the terror bird
i'm rolling black out of oblivion
coca cola doesnt do the justice she enjoys
my face my face
i'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat
all the memories of
two legs that you spread
more will be revealed my friend
teach you how to dance
you cut a perfect form and
this ride is right on corse
closer than most to you and
shao lin shouted a rose
easily let's get caught in a wave
calling calling
of his soul everything must go
throw me to the wolves
we could walk through leicester square
the look she used was green and sharp
it's all right
time to say hello to snow on the thames
a million years old
that i want to
meditating in the morning
in the same place
this is no showdown
put your knuckleheads together

with a kick ass clank
and love all your sisters

not only deadlier but smarter too smarter too
wrap your heel in bones of steel turn the leg a twist of color
seven thousand years to sleep away the pain

sinking fast the weight chained to my feet
i've got to follow another direction although fall down is much cooler
no time to question the choices i make
empty
i'm incomplete
i see your sequence
you make the action action
you call it hoppin
in a universe where you see the worst
and you close your eyes
and you want to shout
and the aftermath
and you see it all

diane is on the beach do you realize the life she's led
the consul a horse jefferson i think we're lost
choking on the bones you toss to them
all your sad and lost apostles hum my name and flare their nostrils
choking on the bones you toss to them
the distance in your eyes
i thought that i heard you laughing
consider this
i think i thought i saw you try
honey dipt flim flam
picked me up then i fell
save me from myself again
i ate the lotus
my mind's made up by the way that i feel
'cause on my love you can depend
all the ashtrays cities and the freeway drives
whatever meaning is long gone spent
moving in a still frame
down below
i can see your lines
you and me
low low low
you threw away the ballast and you rowed your boat ashore
if you offered me your hand again i'd have to walk away
and your words fall flat this time
and i dont know which way to go
mister fred blassie in a breakfast mess yeah yeah yeah yeah
mister charles darwin had the gall to ask yeah yeah yeah yeah
hey andy are you goofing on elvis hey baby are we losing touch
kick it out on the dance floor like you just dont care oh

look at what i've found
he's not to be reached he's to be reached
those who know what i dont know
the map that you painted didnt seem real
maps and legends is he to be reached he's not to be reached anymore
what it's doing to me
sideways down
baby says she's had it with me
monty this seems strange to me
a friend was there to hold your hand
that nonsense doesnt mean a thing
just let go
you heartbreaker
trying to shock but instead
it's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk
me my thoughts are flower strewn
bergamot and vetiver
fall into the ocean
pick up here and chase the ride
to throw thoreau and rearrange
your finest hour blow your horn
hang up your chairs to better sweep
throw the chairs into the fireplace
i'm guided by a signal in the heavens
how many nights i prayed for this to let my work begin
remember me i used to live for music
ich hab kein interesse mit euch bitches zu recorden
du kommst trotz geld equipment label studio kein schritt weiter
unsere raps sind der quellentext wen du nicht alle stellen checkst
ich mache report folge und fhre mit jedem wort das ich sage dich vom ort

reach peace with a e a c
iggy pop bowie rem's version was the b side to the get up single
fun baby baby we want in
and i am so much stronger than you
though all the feelings that broke through that door just didnt seem to be too real
i see your money on the floor i felt the pocket change
we fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didnt grow
i've seen you laying pined get up get up
ghost rider
empty
empty
empty
keep your hat on your head home is a long way away
what do you have to change
who will they choose here is the news
guilt by associate the rushes wilted a long time ago
i am not the type of dog
and the waves of conversation are enough
here i am here i am in your life
as it always will
this lonely deep sit hollow
and hold it along
i couldnt even hear
haul it along
i'm half a world away and go
find my harborcoat cant go outside without it
tainted obligation
hear the rush of water passing over the shoals
empty prayer empty mouths talk about the passion
combien combien combien du temps
catch me if i fall
40000 stars in the evening
away i go anchored in that beat
if you close the door
you know at first it really hurt
and offer what i could
there i go
unfettered by complex sweets
in the desert floored
i marked your chapter with a catamaran
figure eighting in quicksand
so hesitation pulled me back
you might as well say it
you chrysalis and flail
it's beautiful
you know what it's bringing on
my new friends are offering things i've never dreamed
there's something here i find hard to ignore
amanita is the name they cover over everything
i'm tossing up punchlines that were never there
i'm tossing up punchlines that were never there
look into the moon
i'm bending spoons
i'm keeping flowers in full bloom
you've said the air was singing
but you just stay
you've always mark these boundaries now you're free
of oceans and sunken cities
hush my darling dont cry my darling the lion sleeps tonight
you took me to the restaurant where we first met
the outsiders are gathering a new day is born
and i do remember you
the outsiders are gathering
let it go and run towards the sea
i am not afraid
call me when you try to wake her up call me when you try to wake her
call me when you try to wake her up call me when you try to wake her
always had a smile and a reason to pretend
i can always sleep standing up call me when you try to wake her
you always listen carefully
with every one whisper i love you
bad to swallow you whole
cant get there from here
i've been there i know the way
hypnotize suit and tied
i've been there i know the way
i've been there i know the way
before i learned to see
the crushing force of memory
because i cant see it
as your latest triumph draws the final straw
there's a voice in me that says you will not win
now love cannot be called into question
and i offer love with one condition
dangerous eyes in a small town girl
hey hey nadine
repeat second chorus
flat lands low lands on the track
is a messenger pigeon
the public's got opinions
stand in front of your piano
we've begun to bridge the schism
and we know what's going on
hello i'm sorry i lost myself
it feels in dreams
it's all in the submarine
how the light shines in your eyes
but that's the good news my darling
it's all in the submarine
tyrel and his mechanical owl
listen here my sister and my brother
oh oh but sweetness follows
let it ring a long long long long time
it's just a lot of stupid stupid signs
a candy bar a falling star or a reading of doctor seuss
i can always sleep standing up call me when you try to wake her
i stayed up late i stayed up late to hear your voice
hold him and keep him strong this light is here to keep you warm
hold him and keep him strong i've seen the world and so awake
while i'm away from here
while i'm away from here
on and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony
cover design
wont you decide real fast
dont go away now darling wait wait
wont you decide real fast
empty
but somewhere there i
say keep within the boundaries if you want
i'll trip fall pick myself up and
and if you see familiarity
empty
the tunnel of love might amuse you
beware of the bearded lady
i've got a hat the size of oklahoma
i thought i'd kicked the traces
i had to run the shower hot
i'm searching for a greatness

when i was watching tv back in '73

peewee gathered up his proof
oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse

and the chance of romance
to be left with a woman like you

poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
was that a dream or was it true
but aint love a bitch
by the underground
oh dont underestimate the strength of it
aint love a bitch
aint love a bitch aint love a bitch
i swear i'll alway's be strong

i dont wanna i dont wanna
if not for you my sky would fall rain would gather too

daddy said 'son you better see the world
was knocked down by a human stampede
looking like a tourist attraction
she claimed that it just aint natural
god i was glad i found her
kept me warm kept me warm
what its of what its of
is there someone you know
feat dave koz
there's such an air
from major to minor
please dont let me see you cry
make you proud like i said i would
dont you know i mean you so well
i think i'm always gonna miss ya
there's so much you have to know
how can i try to explain when i do he turns away again
find a girl settle down
some fellows look at the nose
some fellows like the style of their hair
if you aint got no money baby
womans got to have some fine greenbacks hah
that i'm offa your chest
pride wont let me stay
i can make a new start
i'm a fool for you baby
i must have been through about a million girls
ah but since i met you baby
can i introduce myself
her stupid friends get right up my nose
or perhaps i'll just whip her to death
the moment of truth has come
standing in the shadows of love
didnt i treat you right now baby didnt i
but it's for sure i aint got nothing but sorrow
i'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
didnt i do right by you didnt i
so dont you leave me
leaving me a song that will not die
and now my consolation
the memory of love's refrain
all i'm tryin to say in my awkward way is
but i would not change a thing
all i'm tryin to say in my awkward way is
a gambler's share the only risk that you would take
you still aim high
alway get caught in the rain
if the pres'dent tries to call me
if you're all right spend it in bed
down in the alley again
dont let me down
both of us believing
we should talk it over
we should talk it over
we both need a shoulder dont let it go
except to sing for a rock 'n roll band'cause you see bein london town
i tried to love her but it's all over now
the lady lied with every breath i accept
i better steal away steal away
her daddy doesnt have to scold her
sweet little rock 'n roller sweet little rock 'n roller
who taught her how to jerk and understand
ten thousand eyes were watchin them leave the floor
you say tonight i'm to be your lover
seems like summer when you're close at hand
sweet oh sweet surrender
you should care for me
's what i love to see
taking a chance on love
i see a rainbow blending now
in the groove again
taking a chance on love
instrumental verse
come on little mama let me see you strut your stuff
but that's not strictly true
does that condemn her soul
it rejects a heart of gold
and now that dream is here beside me
just one look and then i knew
how's your mama how's the wheather
ooh baby i dont sleep
i'm so happy
and i've found what i'm looking for
i'm coming home real soon
and i just love it
i'm gonna have to leave a little bit sooner
but it appears to be raining again
but i wanna little better than that
originally by nazareth
and i learned from you
love is just a lie
oh baby i dont know why
that you ever had
and maybe i'll light your life
they wont let you get away
you know it dont matter
wake up maggie i think i got something to say to you
you lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
i suppose i could collect my books and get on back to school

picture the same sweet love nest
yeah she sits alone
he says now judge suppose i fail
but mama you been on my mind
i'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
i am a man of constant sorrowi've seen trouble all my days
but you chose to stay stay and keep me warm
oh i never was good with romantic words
i felt ashamed i felt i'd let you down
and to other places aggra
it's lovely going through
in july
we'll go to coney
into an isle of joy
dont you know that the woman that love me she understands
they'll never be another one like mine for me
returned home a worried guilty man
trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine
close friends take sides while the waters are still
you give it all up
and i start to prayin
heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere
listen while i talk to you
makin your body loop de loop
but if you really roll
got to shake baby everybody
shake you're lookin good child
will time make men more wise
will time make men more sane
i dont know what's wrong with me
sythesised eyed wearing cellophane jeans
i wont dance with you
waiting for the band to play a faster tune
why wont you dance with me
no dont wanna dance with you
at a shot gun wedding here in this town
and there aint no place to run
but her mother tracked me down
i could of run away oh no i could be living high
even though it's breaking
for you
is still worth while
what's the use of crying
doesnt anybody stay in one place anymore
i'd rather spend it being close to you
but you're so far away
so much to say and so little time to say it in
and be so good while i'm away
seems like only yesterday
funny how soon we change
oh how soon we changed
i'd gladly give up everything
empty
says she loves you
you're just a dream and as real as it seems
i called you collect you didnt accept
you feel left out cause nobody showed
magazine dreams are easy stuff
somebody special is searching for you
who's waiting for you somewhere
to one who'll watch over me
to one who'll watch over me
and i choke on my reply
i want to hold you till i die
still trapped within my youth
and hold you endlessly
the honesty's too much
ev'rything i ever had
sonny she dont move me anymore
she needs like you
sonny i know that that we can laugh again
prays like you
come back to me
what i say unless you read between the lines
i will cry
in the middle of my room
stand back stand back
can i find a little sympathy
whenever you are in sight
i've been looking at you forever
can this be real
when you're looking back at me
cant believe how much i see
dignified and true

the skies are crying

where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
in the brightness of my day
'cause i work all week

and went on back to the wild side of life
empty

the way you hold your knife
lonely nights that come memories that go

with a winning personality

just a one more time
we cant play this game anymore
heartbreak's never easy to take
but can we still be friends

cant get a good night's sleep
i'm crazy about her crazy about her

but i know if she'd just get know me
and the heavens open every time she smiles

relax baby now we are alone
come on honey tell me so

i was feeling rejected
dancin alone dancin alone
looking out of my lonely gloom day after day
i give my love to you
chop you down one of these days
i'm gonna rock you till your pussy's sore
you say you cant stand monotony
the fm station plays another bad 45
i might even lose my trousers
dont play the blues down in old toulouse for me
empty
oh take me way down yonder
she proved me so wrong
she broke my heart
nothing but a fools game
as much as i depended on you
when you find he doesnt care for you
it's a heartache
but then i used to love her but it's all over now
because i used to love her but it's all over now
because i used to love her but it's all over now
it's not the spotlight it's not the cam'ra light
it aint the moonlight not even the sunlight
feat diana ross
how i won you i will never never know
for a cunning cottage we could share
the snow is snowing the wind is blowing
my heart's on fire the flame grows higher
out with the fire off with the sweater
i didnt want to hurt you
i didnt want to hurt you no i didnt care
where was you last night
secret phone calls when you think i'm not around
you bet your life i'm jealous babe
did he alway treat you kind
i'm so jealous it's ripping out my heart
ooh hoo
dont let the flash boys turn your head
and you know how i lie
all the while
somehow it's all passed me by
i was sure that i had it made
have fallen from her curls
with her fog her amphetamines and her pearls
is this pain in here
you fake just like a woman yes she does
i'd like to stay but you have not asked me
strange it dont seem that way to me
she said my passport picture was unique
nervously i said would you like to come to bed
the hotel chambermaid didnt seem to care
nowhere around
is when he doesnt hide
i dont dig it i cant see it at all
and the wind's inside my sails
killer legs in that short black dress
lethal dose of love
poor boy had to sit and stare
i hear the clicking
baby i might even shave
sweet comic valentine
not if you care for me
stay little valentine
much more than i deserve
i mean my girl bring her home to me
i'm only half alive
i mean my girl
my weakness is
i mean it's a living hell
could ever please me
no matter how i try to convince myself
or how much it hurts me
when the one you love's
i saw your eyes
that unfelt clasp of hands
until the thrill of that moment when
the shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
i give myself in sweet surrender
empty
although i'm not a guy that means to hurt
no force on earth could stop you run
but dont you ever give up on your dream
you dont need no restrictions yeah
no you never gave up on a dream
you you you
i think of you
i cant get her off of my mind
on romance i dont know a thing
aint it better to lose in love than to never love at all
and i said 'give it all you got no holding back
of a millionaire
and i had no place to go
lord have mercy
then there's a knock on the door
i believe i believe i'll hold on
when you're down and out
all my cherished memories are of you
oh god i wish i was home tonight
and save all the best parts for me
i must admit
there's a lump comes in my throat
tonight tonight
i didnt believe a single word was true
but sure didnt listen to what she said
oh no not my baby
not my baby not my baby
single file in the girls corridor
only a boy
eddie cochrane running through my brain
hand in the till
where are they now
plans of his own
i guess he'd been there for a whole night or more
and a fistful of money
too late for your future
i thought he was a bitter man
will steal your heart away
you're just twinkling with the stars
not for a year but ever and a day
oh my dear our love is here to stay
she said she'd call me when she'd finished work
she doesnt have to be a movie star
attractive female wanted
attractive female wanted
dear sir
the neighbors might think baby it's bad out there
the answer is no ooh baby it's cold outside
but dont you see how can you do this thing to me
make it worth your while baby
i know it's gonna last forever
i'll get through without you
go your own way dont think twice about me
when i fall in love next time
give me just one night
fracture my mind
any words you talk
be bad for me
i'll be bad for you
roll them dice and pour the wine
i might have been a hero
man keeps talking on the radio
i might have been prime minister
men are not a new sensation
i couldnt sleep
empty
bewitched bothered and bewildered am i
and now we're like sweet seventeen a lot
big bayou where did you go
into the gulf of mexico
big bayou carry me home
struck down by the time i was ten by an illness
i wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman
oh but but you know what i'm trying to sayreally what i'm trying to say is
i took a rose in texas
i got a limousine 'n bodyguard and chaperone
all the juicy little scandals
you saw me standing alone
and when i looked to the moon it turned to gold
now i'm no longer alone
then good luck came a knocking at my door
blue days all of them gone
the same old ritual the same old dance
anybody that'll listen
somebody's cherries need pickin body wishes
keep you warm like a summer breeze
what do i say
who'll be the one
calling way down the line
all i wanna do is sing
cause you're too late too late
janis and jimi cant you hear me
wrong side of my daddy
to change me now
i know i laughed when you left
until i'm buried buried in my grave
you you know darlin you send me
i know i know i know i know i know
but now i know that i only hurt myself
oh honey bring it to me bring your sweet loving
and i know that you you thrill me
well you thrill me
i wanna breathe when you breathe
ah can you see what i see
there he goes moving across the water
why am i so confused
running out of time
that i belonged to you
whenever you call me up
love stop making a clown out of me
their commitment to each other
they questioned jimmy through the night
i must hold on to
to the penitentiary
coming down the courthouse steps
oh god gave me something
but amanda with her long red hair
forget i will not
here to eternity
hot legs are you still in school
hot legs you scratch my back
hot legs in your satin shoes
hot legs you're still in school
but there aint any use in pretending
'cause i aint quite as dumb as i seem
how long has this been going on
i aint quite the fool you mean
all over my neighborhood
all over my neighborhood
and you know i aint gonna let it stop me now
the lyrics i write of you
dream dream day and night of you
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here wont you listen to my heart whoa heart
oh honey i'm losing you
i'm hurt downhearted and worried girl
oh lord i'm losing you
maybe millions of people go by
for you
waging war with society
what kind of fool was i
empty
pouring my heart out in a song
alright well i changed me shirt anyway no i havent changed me trousers
to the world outside my tears i refuse to explain
like that number
and more than wealth
i wish you love
we thought we could change the worldand we never never never never never
yes i think what you say is all so right but i find it hard to move my memories
if i could if i could live it all again yeah
and many's the time that we fasted
how lovely it was
and strictly entre nous darling how are you
once again i seemed to feel that old yearning
still in my heart
she aint no good for you
that's all
and a love time can never destroy
for now and evermore
but this time tomorrow you'll be screamin on the phone
you didnt know my name even when i came
you got poison lips you got amphetamine eyes
you always said living with me was impossible
then he'll turn you in
the crazy nights spilling into days
one can never never tell
the first cut is the deepest
baby i know the first cut is the deepest
when it come to being lucky she's cursed
that he needed love like all the rest
accepted by manhattans elite
of another broadway hype
georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone
he said 'never wait or hesitate
oh georgie stay dont go away
his mother's tears fell in vain
where he quickly settled down
he said he was in love i said i'm pleased
there ensued a fearful fight
but i ask who really cares
oh georgie stay dont go away
let's dont worry about the future or nothin else
echo to the alley down below
there's a whole world waiting out there
on the roof and listen to the miracles
echo to the alley down below
but if you'll only grant me the right
the very thought of you
you'll never know
how slow the moments go
i will feel a glow just thinking of you
yes you're lovely never ever change
keep that breathless charm
his feet dont touch the ground
his attitude has changed he's serene and contented
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a mans in love
when a mans in love
it's only a heart beat away
i just close my eyes and i'm with you
i never knew there was so much love
and i miss ya baby
i let you in
seemed good and right
excuse me baby
but the thought of you still lingers on
when i was your man
but i cant remember where or when
seem to be happening again
sidled up for a dance
and everybody just stared
all hell broke loose
the last thing i remember i left with a girl
still in my suit and she told me i snored
i'm tired and i wanna go to bed right now
give me a lift home
brings back memories of being with you
every little thing
and i get back fighting hey babe
and get away from here girl
ah yeah
hey babe
woww alright
you go to my head like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
though i'm certain that this heart of mine
though i'm certain that this heart of mine
after all you've said and done
did i never once cross your mind
for you i could no longer wait
you really dont want me
set me free why dont you baby
and there aint nothing i can do about it
i used to feel so uninspired
i didnt know i didnt know just what was wrong with me
'cause you made me feel you made me feel
honest you do honest you do
empty
whoa oh oh oh oh whenever you kiss me
i had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
there aint a lady in the land so fine
since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
i dont object if you call collect
they held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so exited
billy pierced his ears drove a pickup like a lunatic ooh
young hearts be free tonight time is on your side
tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight yeah
i took all those habits of yours
you'll be my breath should i grow old
empty
empty
that in the beginning were hard to accept

i dont wanna talk about it woman
1000 times blind see me fallin see me hit the floor
i open my eyes i cant see myself
be so hard and cause you so much pain
so mad so mean the pain remained unseen
and you get to go on so go on
you never were one of them they could have never been your friends
i'm digging a hole inside myself
never know these thoughts of mine
dont destroy me
but still i dont care
even if all else rejection
i see what sweats you
because to me it never meant that much
i'm going i'm gone
cant you find a better way to deal with this place
you send them all away
if i could make wishes true
it wont let you go
knives in your mind
i remain burned beyond recognition
i remain burned beyond recognition
but what do you do when you do what you want
why the hell do you act like 1
you gotta have a gun then you're just another pig to me
and now you're dying for it
i want nothing right now i want to pull it out
i think i'm gonna download my ind

why give a fuck about it man do it do it
well i realize i'm a bad case
the closer i get the farther away i feel
the closer i get the farther away you feel
away away away away away away away away away away away away away
crime likes burning like a heylow
and the city is in my blood like a curse
i'm caving in and i dont know why
where am i going
i'm being followed around again around and around again
self doubt put your hands on my shoulder
i'm being followed around again around and around again
a pack of lies and spend night after hammered night
and it hurts to keep learning the same lessons and pain
i am a fool i know because it's all i know i am a fool i know
the things that you think
you see how hard they'll shove you
so hard to deal with the ones who arent real
your self respect
empty
cant touch me cant touch me cant touch me cant touch me cant touch me
i'm not hard man well i am mine
the real thing is what i came for
they'll be too busy cheering to wonder where your talent went
now you need them see that fire burn
inhale power
i have all i need
exhale how i want to be seendont hold me down
i cant live without
but the solitary refinement of your
you want to know why
i'll come to you like an affliction
they're stronger than truth
i hate the world that i think hates me
there's nothin like finding someone when you're lonely
aww yeah
i want you
i want you
i want you
i hate you
i hate you but i want you
i hate you
unable to express the pain of your distress
all this bitterness wells up inside you
you find all your doors closed
you build up walls around you
i assure you
behind the mask i die over and over
tear the roof of when you leave yea
will you smile when the shades get soaked
without you waiting to be alive
between what i use and abuse
then it's us then it's you
so obscene
on my way to the cage
on my way to the cage
your soul is on a leash
and laughing at death
i couldnt ask for more
you'll always say you'll hate me
i've been out there
where i went
out there i'm out there i'm out there i'm out there
i've got an ear down to the ground
i dont need your lovin
someone i know is now someone i knew
what was it worth
i'm left to move on
so sad
so sick of saying good bye again
so sad
all the things i wanted to tell you
you smile at me i smile back
its shame shame
from top to bottom
i'm trying to change but its what i am
am i
and you could spend your entire life walking around
this time it's real y o u r t i m e i s n o w it's hero time
all you got is life time go 'coz it's hero time 'coz it's time to
it's time to shine yeah it's hero time yeah it's hero time yeah
desperation crept in from all the things i kept in
i know for sure
i'm hear but i know i am out of there
you will do anything
hey i must have been out of my mind
i go all night
and hear i am keen eyed my mind is low to the ground
at the back of mind i hear the engines whine
i make the blood burn
i starve starve
and the house of cards that you built on the cheap shot guilt
or you fall down
so we better stop it now because we're tearing eachother apart
when i see you i wanna tell you but then i lose the words
and it tears me apart
so we better stop it now
when i see you
to see if i'm ok
and you'll know its the end of something
and know there's nothing
the laughter's died away and now i see the joke was on me
of something
i've wasted so much time
i'm trying to keep it straight in my mind
i'm trying to get it straight
trying to find something
and i'm tired real tired
turned inside out for all to see
you're a criminal
entertain me entertain me entertain me entertain me
i'm a live but i dont know why my thoughts threat me
you're talking to the living dead
what can you do to me what can you say
or just plain bums me out
dont stop rollin when you're rolling on the real wheel
sometimes it's all you can do is go and put a gun to your brain
empty
you gotta keep movin in a positive forward direction
what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what do you do when you want to get over
what do you do
i've got a wantless need
what have i got i've got everything
i'm not feelin too nice today
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
the human wreckage the human wreckage
i heard the boys talk the talk to the boys
i wont try to patronize you
you push it out and your anger is blind and you see me as an enemy
take a good look wonderin what ya lookin at when ya lookin at me
you didnt need to do that to me
i didnt want it and i couldnt get away
i'm sorry i still feel this pain inside
i've got do something and i've got to do it now
lookin toward myself and all the people that i see
can you deal with it
from the short guy with a dog
well life's a gamble just
it's the roll of the dice
beyond the sundown life is more than just a game
i've seen a million places branded by the lord of flies
beyond the sundown i wouldnt be the one to blame
would you give the king back his crown
what once ruled the show
when you're lost in the darkness
escape in the night
and i'm asking my walls
our fading love we tried to save but in vain
tried harder day by day
forever now
did you scream for your mother but she never came
as i sit at your grave and remember the dead
did you scream for your mother but she never came
man of hatred man of gain
and the circle of pain
lightning strikes when
man must walk alone but tall
i've seen your smile
all the friends i've lost in vain
i've been a fool
all the friends i've lost in vain
afraid to touch the taken sun
behind success glam and glory
someday i'll find a way
tomorrow's just like you and
in the world outside to stay
someone to stand the weather
with a name to recall
another try you and i
rains to the ground rains to the world of tomorrow
open eyes for new aims to see
reached for the sky
i dont believe in any word you say
the broken promise finds a friend called wine
painted traces on the run
me a reason to be
dont move dont be
watching my thoughts disappear
nice day for an end
i smile back there's freedom in the air
nosferatu times have changed and always will
so now you're waiting for tomorrow
when silence is holy
over the mountains where no one seems to care
so i will be there after the war
thought a dream would last
no cards no aces no truth no liar
no hold the line in vain
no heart no heartache no fat no diet
those who dare to always rule the show
on the lonely road to mystery bay
on the loney road to mystery bay
and when the night is over
it's a deadly illusion to find a solution
there were fights and damnations
the roots of hate are small
some conscience is fallin
and every curtain fallin down
you'll be by my side wherever i may roam
and with every mile
whoever you are without it you're small
she only sold what's in her jeans
so she bought some silicone
ride on long gone heading for the fall
to the gods of the apemen we pray
be well citizen your future is now
i'm the first to come but the last to go
and a dream's gone down the drain
is just one line of a 40 verse song
and the aim is in your mind
stay gold when forever's lies come true so
stay gold
suicide smiled and took a shotgun in his mouth
some prefer the insane
to a world beyond the light
usus est magister optimus iusticia
experience is the best teacher in justice
so many times i've been searching even though i still dont know what i'm looking for
in this symphony of life
to keep the light from burning skies
it's over now it's over now it's over now
i make 'em laugh i make 'em cry
the world always needs a clown
below the mighty cliff
he always wore a long black coat
he turned to heavy drinkin
until someday he lost the race
he's tremblin in his rage
this is the end of love
come what may
and you made your decision
call me a drifter with a faith bound to die
some will leave and some will fall
just fate goodbye
i dont know why to leave and what i'm gonna see today
i dont know who's to blame and why we cheat and and always will
it's the below the kidneys territory
the truth you cannot fake
even though the road is gettin tough
are the very best cause to be
but you cant take our pride
while chances retreat in the light
and we dance to the beat of the night
pictures of destruction
like kings but without crowns
sometimes we act like clowns
this one's dedicated
to those who take your dreams away
raise your glass for those who wait
strangers lost in silence
so wake up just stop feeding dust
when all the water's banned
where the broekn candles burn
and the wheels of time will turn forever
every single day
say hello to your fade
the fire the flame
now fiction rules proud
we only can send our signs
their holy wars should be fought just to save
change your course you cant win the fight
why dont you live
where the red waters flow
who told you so
who force our freedom's fall
cant we make this world a better place
why do we praise the fight
i believe someone's soon is much too late
i believe it's time to go
someone's pleasure is another one's pain glissando
time is a liar
destination face to face
luther king the word race war has got a terrifying
freedom is the only treasure
you gotta be black you gotta be white
in flames of superstition
will you call my name
gloria gloria in destiny
and the silence of the night
and the colours of your smile
for you i can stand the light
and i'll never go back to silence
watching the night fall waiting for the start
h8 what you want
with your face on the ground
of the bounded and the chained
silent scream my only friend
all the fun we had insania
where the rising shaddows ride
down the drain
les chiens de la guerre
helmets filled with hate
you got an iron lion sighin when you're cryin
whenever a wish cuts like a knife
on and on tomorrow i'll be gone
the times have changed the world did turn
well i know exactly what youre talking about
empty
but there's one thing that cant be bought
lucifer i want you to pray
lucifer it's now or zen
then they all went their separate ways
'cause lucifer feels kinda blue kinda blue
dont be afraid besides
from hell below to the other side
the less they care about us
'cause we need them to exist
trust is fear until we lie
to soon too fast at all
took a screaming mother's life
to a man not worth her sin
another price of his cold heart breaks
there's a sign saying phones in rooms
there's a cry and i'm missing you
i hate your grace
your presence too
i hate your right
i hope your soul will burn in hell
all that remains is my last farewell
most of the time
and i will never loose again
hit the road it's over when i'm gone
had a pretty good life here just plugging into my machine for the day then
ii temples of syrinx
we work together common sons
let the banners be unfurled
beautiful
and joyously screams out its pain
voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall
there's something here as strong as life
i cant believe you're saying
just think about the average
i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure
an oracle confronts me there
to claim the home where they belong
the dream is still in my head
my lifeblood
when these days have passed long ago
beating down the multitude and
cities full of hatred fear and lies
the natives smile and pass along
wreathed in smoke in lebanon
we'll hit the stops along the way
i feel the way you would
i remember
reaching to the alien shore
for you and me race is not a definition
for you and me sex is not a definition
take this heart of stone
remind us who we are
let your children rise up before you
let your children rise up before you
empty
there is tic and toc in atomic
pride reduced to humble pie
miracles will have their claimers
the night turns thin
goddess in my garden
alter in my image
a secret face a touch of grace
complicate me
wonders of the world they wrought
we build our defenses a place of safety
a way to take us out of ourselves
a future of eternal light
or the will is too weak
between the sea and sky
cant bring the world to me
moving picture
promise offered in the east
i want to look at life
free the dungeons of the innocent
lessons taught but never learned
still dont believe we're fadin
maybe it's too late
i dont wanna see that
i said left out in the cold
and the far unlit unknown
in the shopping malls
cruising for the action
originally by eddie cochran
what i'm a gonna do
cause you didnt work a lick
and he said whoa
he really means it
empty
reality withdraws
watch her every move
i was standing on a reef
i was talking to myself
rising up from the surface
somewhere in my instincts
the clouds were suddenly parted
i thought of time and distance
take yourself a friend
yes you need some advice
i noticed emotion and that you had cried
the truth
they play the same territorial game
what international means
of the citizens along for the ride
baby i feel disrespected
i swear i'm gonna leave
my friends keep telling me i should leave you alone
cause when it comes to love i'm giving way more than you
test for echo
test for echo
test for echo
and wind up in the perp walk on tv
has him longing to depart
you call me
the boy pulls down his baseball cap
big money goes around the world
sometimes pushing all the buttons
big money make a million dreams
it's the fool on television
well i was only a kid didnt know enough to be afraid
looking for love
well i was only a kid gone without a backward glance
the way the big wheel spins
empty
empty
they chase through the streets of manhattan
in their limitless rise
green and grey washes
every city's streets
i'd be there if i could
you cant see what is true
is it could have been worse
and the most beautiful words i could ever say
well i do
it's hard to recognize the real thing
so much mind on the matter the spirit gets forgotten about
half the world hates
half the world thinks
half the world cries
half the world shares
i could disappear into the crowd
doesnt seem so much
i swear you dont listen to me
lay hand over hand over
tell her of my plea
just give her my message
well you say you can laugh but i can see that your eyes are glass
wont be long before i stop and play it over
people smiling through their tears
at the counter of a store
all around this great big world
who will pay
the water takes you home
when the water takes me home
the water takes me home
pussy get lost treat that nigga like a jump off
say that's it for me
repeat chorus
nothing lasts forever i agree
homes in many places but i'm brooklyns own
repeat chorus until fade
frozen in the moment
i feel the day is all uncertainty
i've lost a few more hairs
memory lane everywhere
take a piece of my mind
they say we're too young
verse 2
no love is a real love without you baby
olamide i wanna love you baby repeat 1x
it's got to be
but if i think like you think
hey baby it's a quarter to eight
empty
bruised and sullen stormclouds
there is no lovelier sound
empty
tame the trackless waste no virgin land left chaste
another ship arrives
empty
all the same we take our chances
have become reality
if we need too much attention
right where discovery starts
to scorn and ridicule
carry all those phantoms
shadows on the road ahead
just an escape artist
there's nothing to stop you now
aint gon leave with me cos you see me in the drop
back to the room checkout time aint til noon
i just talk like this and walk like this
use to be too thin to win but now i'm chubby
i heard a lot about you aint you curious
i'm like the nastiest nigga since larry flynt
something for my people
but livin my life with you here is givin me tears of joy
and i never thought i'd meet a man that made me wanna say i do
and if i should die before i wake upwake upwake up
and it hurts my head
and truth is often bitter
a pair of dancing shoes
and the rain that is burning
must be carefully trained
dont swallow your anger
dont swallow the truth
in artificial light
dont swallow your pride
and a surge of adrenaline
was it only trees in the wind
empty
i believe that what i'm feeling
i've got idols and icons unspoken holy vows
murray's packed with funk you need to know
you're not equal you damn creep you
yo we got the ghetto funk you need to know
yo here's what i'ma do for you
lod and ppp gets it on
keith kill beef like mad cow disease
i'm the local hero global player
a world so out of touch
handle with kid gloves
careless of the consequence
then you learn the weapons
5 monsters
the same old melody
midway lights
everyone would gather
reminding me
no you didnt listen again
and i know
beyond the gilded cage
must put aside the alienation
and we are merely players
with a primitive design
on the price of being free
it's just a matter of instinct
so we keep it under lock and key
with just the briefest pause
with passion and precision
than never to have known it
macy gray
hey young world
young little girls already have a child
you'll see your under and the trouble life brings
seen how the old spring turned out
like in de pen dence words case
chorus to fade
and as cold as winter skies
behind us you will only see our dust
and satisfy our wanderlust to roam
imagine a man where it all began
when the chain reaction was done
more than they bargained for
you can forget about the heat
more than just simple greed
that flashes and fades in the summer sky
empty
step inside the nightclub like i own the bitch
the same way i was in that bar scene in belly
y'all niggaz wanna get down fuck with me
talk about how this beat got you groovin
party and bullshit
method man
see the god run through your block like godzilla
y'all really want the street now fuck with me
meth yo tr what's that shit you on
tr i'm not even serious i'm doin this for fun cause i
empty
but he'd be climbing on that bus
to go and paint big cities
hold your fire
their fire has made alive
with a mission
to the ones without it
with a mission
each of us a world apart
leave room for you and i to grow
on a troubled sea
with her hands on her ears
no matter what they say
in the city where desperation
everyday people
we're the ones who draw the line
or is it a slide
face up turn it up
and turn it up
i've got my own moral compass to steer by
like the willows in the wind
to tell if my choice is leaning up or down
that only blooms at night
my life is yours use me for your fame your fame
let every breath proclaim glory to your name
you can almost feel the current flowing
whirlwind life of faith and betrayal
i can get back on
and the next it's falling in on me
i can get back on
and float with the fishes
and its never ever gonna stop
niggaz is worse than shiest for the merchandise
we got drug dealers and bug niggas who love killin
cuban link
killin every track i'm on link and joey crack the don
of course you dont have a chance i'm the boss in your emminence
dionne read my palm told me to get on and put my army on
to make it more dramatic i quote jehovah holding the scroll
cause we robbin niggas way before
ooh yeah ooh yeah
yeah oh yeah
look out i'm comin whoa yeah
i'm findin i'm findin my way back home
fly by night away from here
find what i'm after
my life begins today
for those who are broken those who mourn
there's something happening here
i think it's time we stop hey what's that sound
it starts when you're always afraid
tough times demand tough talk
attack the day like birds of prey
in the heat of the beat and the lights
we dance on the strings
i will choose freewill
each of us
and the night is still a threat
or caught like a creature in the headlights
or surrender to a reflex
or a tempest of blind fury
projects some of these womenll have you diggin in your
watch it niggaz be hatin they wanna run me for my
they was brollic brollic brollic uhh
make it brollic brollic brollic uhh
and i'm lettin y'all know this now
for so many different directions
or the guiding hand of fate
a tiny moment of truth
i dont believe in destiny
i am me
dont identify inside
in the prison of the night
to the fountain of lamneth
the coldness grips my skin
and sailed for distant lands
for the maelstrom is near
my gaze is caught and held and i
naked in our unity
v bacchus plateau
crimson misty memory
my soul grows ever weary
feel my heart is pounding
the key the end the answer
i am crying
some live behind iron gates
somethings can never be changed
such a lot of pain on the earth
as the birds announce the dawn
helpless invaders trapped in his lair
iii return of the prince
shadows through the sky
straining at invisible chains
turn around and walk the razor's edge
who lost the will to fight
the whispers in the morning
whenever you reach for me
and you are my man
the feeling that i cant go on
'bout the power of love
but i'm ready to learn
i wont get to get what i'm after
they want to shake my hand
and when it's bad i cry
a storm on a raging course
from two magnetic poles
my heart goes out to you
at the speed of love
and the magic music makes your morning mood
all this machinery making modern music
concert hall
but the oaks cant help their feelings
the oaks are just too greedy
truth is false and logic lost
look up to see a giant boy
now it's come to this
to them and them and others too
hollow speeches of mass deception
while shepherds bless and count their sheep
in the glory game on the power train
and those who push us down that they might climb
fill them up with precious cargo
and the long enduring kind
spontaneous emotion
like some pilgrim
experience slips away
i can wait until the tide comes around
the innocence slips away
today's tom sawyer
catch the mystery catch the drift
always hopeful yet discontent
exit the warrior
doin what we always do a stack
empty
make a choice so you start to think back
since '87 that's how the shit comes
tell the feds we aint runnin no coke factory
but a nigga get paid sellin hop and crack
instantly dope dealer stereotype
that's all you are
roll to the spot and try ta break a hoe
i go coast to coast smokin indo
we're up y'all in this motherfuckin holdin tank for hidin snitch ass
tell em tell em tell em
any girl in the world could have easily known me better
the more we think we know about
or the african sun
and we are entertained
empty
to reflect upon our own
a quantum leap forward
their world is fashioned
not as market campaigns
sensitive open and strong
each and ev'ry day
my knees are startin gettin weak
time is a spiral space is a curve
you just dont get it
hide in your shell let the world go to hell
it's just erotica hypnotica
to keep his nature pure
he's a radio receiver
he's not concerned with yesterday
he only introduced me to a wider reality
who plays a hero's role
when i heard that she was gone
everybody's buying
hero not the handsome actor
without memory or desire
the morning says the answer is yes
dream a walk in the wilderness
in a willingness to risk defeat
the greatest act can be
it went right by me
well i guess we all have these feelings
between these two directions
some of them burned on our ceilings
it's not a place
it's a gift for the giving
that rocks the cradle
come and rest let my love be your bed
empty
talk of a time without fear
while a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn
the wheel against the rules
here i hide in the heart of the city
i'm not one with a sense of proportion
if i could wave my magic wand
my temperature's rising
thrill to be alive
the point of the journey is not to arrive
the point of the needle moving back and forth
turn up light and sound
is not to arrive
jump to the ground
a brilliant red barchetta
adrenaline surge
shoots towards me two lanes wide
i leave the giants stranded at the riverside
get that dough figadoh
see yo' head cracked bang o see dough
fi ga doh money money figa da doh
in rhyme cuz crime pays yep
like a cherry o bury dough robert de ner io
you a nigga out here hate niggas wishin he was white
you and captain save ya baby mother fuck these hoes
blankers and boasters all the bluffers and posers
i just like to please i dont like to tease
i'll just give it a try wont let good times pass me by
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
the space between wonder and why
holding on to yesterdays
wheels can cut you down
a dizzying lifetime

if the dream is won
we will pay the price
though we might have precious little
though we might have precious little
i like that story makes a satisfying case
tobes of hades lit by flickering torchlight
by tor and the snow dog
cause you are the target and you are the atmosphere
you're so perfect i'm so broken here you come with arms wide open
to the top of the hill
you can drive those wheels
with some features of your own
empty
of true profanity
the vacant laugh
ceiling unlimited
energy is contagious
meteor rain stars across the night
but it can be so bright
this is the way it should sound

elemental empathy
oh but how
they called him insane
they cant understand
he held up his riches
to mold a new reality
to sow a new mentality
but dont push my limits too far
when we started on traditional roles
the pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
love can turn to a long cold burn
the star of this unearthly show
the cars full of spectators pass
the air is shattered by the awesome sound
standin at the crossroads tried to flag a ride
i went to the crossroad babe i looked east and west
cant stop moving
a driver on a busy freeway
i'm old enough not to care too much
a danger i'm prepared to face
nevermore to grace the night
or through the astral door
headlong into mystery
empty
sought alone to rule the fate of man
we can build a world of wonder
and converse among the wise
i bring love to give you solace
the cities were abandoned
bringing wolves and cold starvation
some fought themselves some fought each other
on her final flight
i have passed into olympus
the warriors felt my silent cry
they sat a while in silence
let the love of truth shine clear sensibility
too much contradiction and confusion
what happened to our innocence
we monitor his station
to a tropic isle of avalon
he's got a force field and a flexible plan
red alert
you sometimes drive me crazy
red alert
in a dog's life
in the dog days
dog years for every sad son of a bitch
as well make our own few circles 'round the block
so tight
anywhere but here
my angels and my demons at wa r
wilderness of mirrors
the case had been tried by the jury inside
on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
they travel on the road to redemption
time is a gypsy caravan
on the fly
on the run
driven to the edge of a deep dark hole
driven on by the road to somewhere i've never been
i'm godzilla
dru hill
dru hill
so your friends wont know see now
repeat 1
when i talk my teeth should rot
i'm the one that turned you out dog it out
when the angles are right
a jewel out of reach
stretching out your hand
form a dream to rise to
a heart that cannot feel
do i hope or do i fear
lovers pause to find an open store
river running like an open sore
for the weary land
to the endless winter night
it's doc way dont like it then move on
now let's get it gritty
you had nothin to say to me then
bother to pass my way no
all youuuu fake frontin motherfuckers
their clothes look soooooo good but they act stupid
all youuuu fake frontin motherfuckers
i can learn to get along
you can surrender
i can learn to co exist
eleven songs and endless nights
peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow
darkness gives way to light a new way
winners take that praise
why are we here
well who would hold a price
no zodiacs or almanacs
of a little abstraction
if the cards are cold
because we're here
all my nerves are naked wires
leaves behind its mark
and holds the winter light
as surely as mortal pain
a captain of industry
you know i'm the same
folks have got to make choices
i thought we might get closer
is the way in
and the darkness at high noon
a gentle hand a secret touch on the heart
if i dont start cryin it's because that i have got no eyes
here within my lonely frame
please dont destroy these lands
until later
i've heard it all before
watching from the fence
show me dont tell me
let's see exhibit a

empty
s s and slick rick make ya move your butt
countless ways
you wont get wise
and the beat of your own song
as the waves crash in
the wind blows hard from the east
words that fly against the wind and waves
that you're part of this scheme
like the rat in a maze who says
what are you trying to do
and just to claim your stake you gots ta gain some rate
why you think they sayin tray deee's so crazy

he's just too crazy
it's enough to learn to share our pleasures
checking out the state of the nation
every day we're standing in a time capsule
now here i am again
of forgiveness and grace
a hypocrite would be
who can undo what i've become
you are the only one who can undo
horizon to horizon
everything is lost

let me tell you something
by eric clapton and rick danko
all our past times should be erased
you know i dont count the loss
since i first met you baby i never knew what i was missing
you turn around and find another ticket
seems you've got to ride another horse
nothing in this world can make me stay
empty
anyday anyday i will see you smile
and the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
like hearts made of diamond love will prevail

well you dont treat me baby like you used to do
but i aint got nobody to bury me when i'm dead and gone

nobody treats you like a mother will when your mother is dead lord
nobody treats you like a mother will when your mother is dead
when will all my hopes arise
where do i find the words to say
through the distant clouds of tears
i looked into my father's eyes
she is lovely brighter than a morning star
i know that she's only flirting but i think that i've had enough
sit down and tell me about it
'cause i'm trying to give it all to you
just another reason for another lie
by jimmy cox

than to stay around here
well i would rather see you
by bonnie bramlett and eric clapton
someone like you
for getting me back on my feet again
but i cant stop it it keeps on growing
third verse
everything's a fightin about the spoonful
could fill spoons full of water
i am the man that rolls when icicles are hanging on the tree
she's some kind of demon messing in the glue
strange brew strange brew
to be where i'm going
i've been waiting so long
if i dont play around
but i feel so free today
you thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
the tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
i dont know what to do since we've been apart
why dont you reconsider do what i want you to
and carry on
here in heaven

let the candlelight die
things were cool and collected 'til she found him erected with another

the home that i used to live in
had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
that she'd come to rescue me
i'm not gonna blink cause i wanna see
sexy walk your eyes are closed your heart is open wide
cheap shot hocked straight to the ear drum is it

true love lost

if you believe in me i'll do anything you want me to do
there is nothing i'd rather do
as i watch you fade
and i'll break the chains that you have made

i dont want to hear about your swinging new place
you said it was the best sex that we both ever had

they dragged me from the bar
your life is large but your mind is lame
threw my keys inside the window and we never looked back

that's not easy to do
five miles outside of vegas five years down the line

what makes you think you are complete
do that romeo
i see you twist and turn you look so stupid
my go go romeo
stupid happy and numb
you say you like people with fire but you dont like it when you get burned
love is all you need to fix what's broken
all those happy endings that never happened they dont mean anything now
the time is going to come when you say that enough is enough
love is all you need to fix what's broken
but i know who i was
and i will tell you when i'm done
you wonder why i live like this man you just wont understand

go speedracer
i think i'm going to need a little time to myself
ask me if i wanted to drive
yes i guess i fucked up again
we could leave behind another wasted year
just a name on the map
we could be everything we want to be
we could leave them behind in the sparkle and fade
yes i know where you go
yes i see you and i see myself when i was a younger man
i know where you go when you want to fall
you were my reason to live
all i want to remember
it makes me think of summertime
you twist and turn in your own sweet hell
twist and turn with your bright eyes shining
it always seem to make me smile
laughing in the sunshine
you gotta own what you sell
i dont want to make you sad
it will come back to you
you get what you pay for
a little taste of hell
driving all the old men crazy
man we just fell about the place
it wont be long 'till summer comes
i hate my life
i wish that it was easier to be in love
he had to find the reason why these things always end this way
i am still in love with you
i like the way that it
there has never been a time
these days
but it's never the same
these days
that understands
and i know you love me too
we said i do then ate some food
but the fun that day
some people call me maurice
i'm a midnight toker
arms out to break my fall we fall down
like a burning car in the sun
it makes no sense to me
this eye for an eye thing
read all about you in my new york times
i really want to believe i can make things right
when i think about what happened
oh i want to believe in this world

sometimes all i think about is falling apart
laughin and a runnin hey hey hey

and these sandals on my feet
the sunshine's everywhere we go
i got no cable tv
down at the starlight bar
and marilyn stares down from the barroom wall
the secret of life is in marilyns eyes
the secret of life is try not to hurry
down at the starlight bar
the way that you laugh and breathe and smile
what you're missing over there
i melt and spin and fall again
there's nowhere else i'd rather be
the way you love me
i'd wish you could see the way you kiss

darlin for heavens sake
empty
in some dive across town
when the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
with nothing but thoughts of you in my head
when you feel that hole inside your soul
and nobody's there to take you through the night
i will dry your eyes
dont need no one else

and the fight will end
it took finding you to finally understand
a love that's real

the small victories
but it does

and i'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain
b e aggresive
reach down my throat
and i take it on my knees
outta here where the air is cold you're messing with my mind
hey you never really asked well i'm asking you right now
i confess in quicksand
empty
i'm heading straight down 101
empty
unhand me now as if you've always known my name
just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk
when the dawn breaks
empty
he's the one no doubt
sweat on the brow
in regards to
empty
being good gets you stuff
eat is just as deep as you can fuck it
take it from our drummer puff
now i'll say what i think
of generosity
i'll keep coming back
then small becomes all becomes all
empty
to my surprise she wasnt a girl at all
a slight misconception of leizure
star ad
a legend
close one eye just walk by
give yourself away
i wont let you forget
the pain the torment and torture profanity
i aint too strong
but i've hoped too long
and the plesure is yours and mine
empty
you take the elevator to the top
you take the elevator to the top
whats left is left and turns you inside out
and you are on your way back back to where you came
he wont think once he wont think twice
where love takes pride and your souls
hurts hurts hurts like a like a motherfucher
so learn
all you need is just one more excuse
i deserve a reward
all the same greats the same mistakes
dont say you're not because you are
and let the suit keep wearing you
you need something wet in your mouth
lots of scary noise
ha ha
but never blooms
and that me is me
memories flashin through my head
if i am dead how can i feel such love
when i closed my eyes was it my siesta
i know the feeling
you never wanna let go
this nourishment life is bent
you will never let it slip away
you drink up the sky
that made me feel this way
like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance in silence
say nothing without wasting a word
on on
looking down into the water
it's wonderful how the surface ripples
we care a lot about disasters fires floods and killer bees
empty
we care a lot about the little things the bigger things we
from a human head
i should've learned it before
what a day
it's not your right to tell me
but just fatigue
this time was mine to borrow
that's why i cling to you
all the former mysteries are no surprise
then wipe my butt and piss me
then i'll get mad for awhile
i'm flawless
isnt that what it's about
i just went and undid mine
empty
oh baby
you want to hear
and we'll find romance
we'll sing and dance
it's so cool it's so hip it's alright
it's in your face but you cant grab it
things worked out better than we have planned
and he spent himself
everyone knew the thing that was best
step beside the piece of the circumstance
back and forth i sway with the wind
no one listens
droplets of yes and no
my life is falling to pieces
leaving you no mind
leaving you no mind
you come from out of nowhere
sifting to the bottom every day for two
what if there's no more fun to have
and see you're just like everyone
there's just enough to go around get a piece
one i'll take and take again
all i 'm really doing is yelling oh well
cause it's much too small
slows to a crawl and then the poetry is lost
i count the hours and i count the days
i see that it's full of dimes
so hang up that phone
i started a joke
over my eyes
over my eyes
plenty to scorn well right on then you said in a song that life was
empty
so i dont have to see the light
to whom only gods are blessed
you're burning me
the swings on the playground dont even fit me anymore
film is flapping on the side of the projector
it is not a good day if you are not looking good
let me introduce you to someone before the party is done
from fasting to feasting
do others push you around
empty
and it rolls off the tongue
patton gould
take a deep breath and swallow
and get on your way
so raise it up and lets propose a toast
the way you're holding me
before you run away
the way you're holding me
cover my mouth
ruffle white
no you'll never ever reach that plateau
i didnt write the rules
not like mark bowen
i'm thirty something
it's a midlife crisis
holding blunt instrument
i give you cold water and you
a sharp one
can you say nothing
keeping me dumb and hot
together they had plans
and you're always on your way somewhere
and gods never made moral decisions
blood on your mind again
but i'm afraid
in every marriage bed
oh now i can really feel it how could you ever stand it
now and only now i know the difference when you tell me
all of that thick time without you
and who'll be laughing then
it's always funny until someone gets hurt
empty
it's so hard to be your friend sometimes
empty
kewpie dolls and urine stalls
and tomorrow janie's wearing a dress
you had been in an awful fight
the blood that you'll be letting
do you have any self respect
empty
and the river made of dollars
but it's better than it was
there aint nothing new about money woes
i complain very little because
everybody's had everybody's had everybody
it's a boomerang
fills out the papers just as fast as he can
empty
the ground moved under me
some days i get so low but you turn me around you turn me around
'cause i need your sweet sunshine
dont give up on me
dont give up on me
dont give up on me
lying in bed the pain in my head from running around all day
through a ditch and over the wall
a la la la la la
why do you get so emotional
why do you get so emotional
i dont know where i'm going to
i dont know my sky from ground
got a line on sweet act sheer heart attack
oh the word is getting around
funny how it fades away
we dress up in the evening with nothing to say
burning like forever then it fades away
tells a different tale
each drunken drugstore purchase
and so you ran away
they bought your name
when the world has passed you by
but i do anyway
i dont know if i am supposed to stay
my clothes are wet with gasoline
empty
money takes some time to make we spend it all too quick
to a large amount of money
no i did not forget
it doesnt kill you it's not a one way ticket to a lonely life
i havent felt so bad that i wanted to die
and i really do miss you but how would you know
you're not ever going to feel any better
written by tony scalzo
you need to feel the loss
empty
much less remove her from my mind
i can still recall a time you were not so far behind
never let 'em see you sweat
you can place a call to me
through the window dimly shines
i had a few more hours of night time before i'd rise
and as i sleep tonight i'll dream of you
you come along with a code that i cant crack
empty
they put alot of effort into making you feel like a clown
lyrics and music tony scalzo
it's a nowhere road
you take it to the highway
the wheel of possibility
it was hard to find
i cant afford to go very far
'cause it's raining all the time
yeah i'm all right
inside out upside down
when she goes walking by
slow drag you've been messing with my mind
you're nothing to me
sonner or later
i'm gonna take my time all right
sooner or later repeat
they love to tear you down
telephone calls
i've been thinking
havent had a break in twenty years
i've been thinking
and when the car broke down they started walking
you can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
knowing the way
mine tell me now is it so dont let me be the last
if not i'll just die
remember the way that it used to be
you're the only one who can see the real me
empty
why'd you have to go away
people ask me
time beats up on
she comes just like a daydream
and like the stars they shine so bright
turn on my tv
there are no lies
i picked up the paper
give me muddy muddy water
it's none of your business
i'm feeling good now
turned on the tv set
which way to the top
just like time doesnt mean anything
but i'll be wide awake
get it now while it's happening oh yeah
but you wind me up so wind me up again
gotta seperate the unreal from what is true
oui je comprends yes i understand
quand le vin est tire il faut le boire
c'est un cercle vicieux
empty
i believe i'd buy whatever you would sell to me
i believe i'd buy whatever you would sell to me
looked out to a distant horizon
to where your sleepless mind rests
was killing time
let nothing bleed into nothing
and the shifting sands
is this desire
so will i suffer
i the one to guide your mind
mislead delusions color real
anarchy divine
i can never walk out
i'm going sugarless
how do i get into bed to sleep with you
dead wall of stone i cry out
any kin or family
just to see a glimpse of light
the tunnels deep and twisting
just to see a glimpse of light
kaleeriorjat silm
the tangled maze is broken once again
dig up the earth and spit it in your eye
you've trapped us in your world of sin
and you listen with your ear to the door
if you want to know
as you contemplate the silence
keep your distance
if you want to know
when it comes down to the wire
i'll hold on to with every ounce of strength within me
desolate am i a tempest raging silently
turn to stone
now my dreams have surely passed
afraid to die
morning desert sun horizon rise above the
desert sun reflection on the water
traject the esoteric sisters they are mythical
empty
conquering fear
what was it you saw last night
each of us alone in silence
but we cant see
here i am looking out looking in
your arms are open your heart's closed tight
and we hide in our suspicions
facing the fear we're afraid to show
under world she'll have us all
of my
passion slave her life i gave
his eyes
kings queens pirate giants castle walls
past locked in winter filled with remorse
these walls are stained engraved with pain
empty
pace the hallway blindman for a million
unto my hand unto my heart
i am beyond silent black i will be back
we were born to brave cold weather
how much longer can i hold
in this cold
but circumstance conspired
and i know we're not children any more
devise divisions delay decisions
let nothing bleed into nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
do you think that i that i remember
this certain sadness
between you and me
i remember the nights
and listen to the rain
heart as you lie asleep
breathing fire
foul temptress oh she sings seduction
your perception lacks clarify
we cant accept our differences
parallel lives running parallel with you
my opinion is just a point of view
vultures scavenge the subsconsious of your
walls and yielding crops
his seed
yours nor yours mine
speak speak the words i need to hear
when i need somewhere to run to
when i need someone to turn to
if you'll shelter shelter me
questions flow too deep for words
while we all drown in tears
when the stars are right and you're alone
drawing near someone passes through me
flame is burning center of a fountain yearning waters
no reflection at all
girl if i didnt have a plan
tell me
girl if that was it
and wasnt qualified babe
if i had nothin if i had nothin
hook 1
would you be here if i had nothin
straight outta luck
if i was ugly
in a land where no one comes
run shivers up and down the spine
and laughs at you in spite
father o'reilly found in the moors
the bard and the banshee
there was a common goal
while we watch time slip through our hands
begging on something to work this time
we got a fantasy
burning up inside this space of mine
we are the stars
i cant take
believing all this time too far to cross the line
empty
journey through the witch trials learned
cast to their fate the moerea the sisters
she'll devour your children in a wink of
the more i run
in the corners of my mind
my thoughts before me
i'm swimming to the strand
empty
but if your tired of people being bothered baby
let's straighten it outusher i think it's time for you and me to straighten it out
let's straighten it outmonica let's straighten it out usher i want to straighten it out with you baby monica come on usher come on
to hell rusty shackles of time burden his mind
forever the clock lives so does he
writings so clear on the wall you
he cries a river of tears on the clock below
masque the false gods with mannequin smiles
perpetual ego's
you wings to fly away what have the
as i watched your shadow disappear
when it's too late
we only say goodbye
we only say goodbye
we only say goodbye
the lake the bottom was raked
run for your life he'll take it away
he dreams of a girl he cast from this world
he knows not that he's been defied
demon lords wont you ride with me
what's this you say who is he to us
wasnt in my dreams
deepest of sin invision a king
the tarot of death card she held in her hand
end of my last fall
i stood at the door to a new beginning
i stood at the door to a new beginning
close your eyes forget the fear
caving in
living life in still water
living life in still water
a man born of royal blood
the nights cold and darkened
dawn reflect from the blade
his blade will avenge you someday
his father reigned supreme
avenge everyone in your way
there's a written page there's a book
something to save something to see
is it fiction is it confession
compel and beware the spell of the jackyl
virgin of snow burnt by the torch
as my heart begins to pound
you've betrayed and cursed the light
i'm a vagabond with a maelstrom mind
i'm a misconception never had affection
lift your chains from me
i am stone now you know i gave my
tearing myself apart
tearing myself apart
feeling my way through this wilderness
dry land getting drier
i'm choking life with living lies
wondering have i said all i have to say
his mind never rests
replaying a thousand regrets
and there's a shadow on us
rain falling
grows this shade of gray
rains falling hours crawling
and taking us under
through nights that never end
writing letters in my head
stayed up late last night
deep cool
we jump into the fires of hopelessness forever
we've swallowed the pills and the pain
way back in may
but now she's not around
you really light me up
seven days in the sun
you really light me up
she looks just like a beauty queen
i'm crawling on my knees again
you make it better
you just take the pain away
muffled screaming
would kill me just the same
the taste of bitter glass
apologies have passed
it's pulling you deeper
the cat is out
tears roll down
and wave goodbye to love again
so dont you try and fake it
anymore anymore
anymore anymore
tell me something new instead
tell me something new instead
she said
yeah i wish i could be like you
i cant dance to disco
white suits and gigolos
i cant dance to disco
i cant live for disco
i cant i cant i cant stand losing
you can call it lack of confidence
but you'll be sorry when i'm dead
i cant i cant i cant stand losing
buying a magazine it's time to get myself some therapy
it's funny but i dream for yesterday i'm blistered by the burns that life has made i'm staring
she's got a new dress on
empty
the more we change it all seems worse
unchain myself
voices draw nearer
try and get a hold son
see it so near it seems so far
lettin it out lettin it out lettin it out
close your eyes and drift away to some place new
the cold has got a hold of you again
blue true blue true miss you
lift me up to where the clouds are snow
cause you're the only thrill i feed
cause you're the only pill i take
love's the antidote we really need
love's the antidote we need
dont fall back in
it doesnt matter when i dream away
what a big mistake
theres got to be hope
hear me cry
empty
i'm feeling it too just slipped away
cold as stone no contact known
you're feeling it too just slipped away
you could be anywhere
see yourself standing there
her mind racing she cries
she's my death
i'm lost inside a dream
it's funny but it seems
window pane
twenty eight
the rain burns in my eyes
with golden fields that will burn your eyes
telling the world how i let you down
cause i have seen this house under pale blue skies
i wanna dream with you
been letting you know
empty
i'm tender in your arms
i'm tender in your arms
life in tinsel town overthrown relinquished all
wishing for a summer without rain
then i can reach for the stars
but i will wait for her arms
we tumble and fall together we crawl
come back to me come back to me yeah yeah yeah x3
back home again
i find myself going through phases
i'm looking for a place inside your mind
it's easy to forget just what you've got
picking up the pieces of a page
feel the wall as it starts to shake
give it up when you start to bleed
hear me now desperation
goodbye all i feel free i'm in heaven tv me
i've got a hand inside my head
feel i've been hit by a bus
build a fire to thaw my brain
cause all my drowning sorrows became my friends
get up shut up
a chainsaw cutting through my bed
i will be there if you will come
i will be there if you will come
empty
the more i wait the more i bleed alive alive
we're waiting for changes
we're waiting for changes
we're waiting for changes
we're just a twist in a seam
a different color and shade
but i guess you knew
a place to shine now and we can do it anyway
as i recall i never lied to you it's true
taste a piece of life and suck it in for good
cause we're floating by
wishing for the sun
clutching at your straw
we could always fly into a coloured sky
so easy to forgive
we could be free
you've gotta live
if you're a little late
another day melts i feel the heat
too late drifting away
i will i i i
but i'm missing yesterday
i'll wait i'll wait for you tonight
tomorrow shines through
dont hesitate cause you can free yourself
we cant keep painting colours when it's grey
the drug that keeps feeding me
lets feel a new high kicking in
come together feel the heat
do they feel the same way
it takes us all away someday
i wanna be here
as i stare at the trees
i'm going out for a while
reaching up high into space
empty
and it's a long way up without a ladder
behind a face you see a child
takes me back to better days summer days the everglades in june
my brain my poor brain
drinking myself to sleep again insomnia i'm drinking myself to sleep again nightnurse pills to keep me sane
all by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again
how come it ended up like this
cause i dont want to drag you down hold you down
you're watching clouds come over you
ten feet below the ground
two different views
the bittersweet sugar of life
cut loose and crashing in
you gotta set me free
bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu
a taste of something better
bu bu bu bu lose the fear
cos i'm feeling that i cant go on
as emptiness invades
and you're the reason i wake up
nothing is real
dragging you down
cause this could be the only day
this could be the only way
empty
empty
my perfect day my perfect day my perfect day
cut me free again and watch me bleed
cut me free again and watch me bleed
dont you see we're in skin deep
empty
empty
empty
for life
empty
shame on pain
the touch of a hand
waiting for the lights to change now reaching for a cloud to come down
cant get you out
cant watch you drown
here she comes lifting me up to the moon
it's like breathing underwater but i just cant let you go
backs against the wall
growin old with you
drawing circles round the sun
empty
children playing at my feet
that's it's like a disease
you and me it's pulling me down
we're like flowers in this vase together
push holes in the plastic
turn over another day older
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
you know i still remember it
and there's no real solution
gotta pull myself back in
a different man
an empty heart with nowhere to turn
comfort in sound
she's my novacaine ride
taste my bitter tears
searching for a little hope a rainbow when it rains
get the hell out while you can we going under sinking in
we've got to keep ourselves afloat going under get me out
sittin back i only wish
empty
feel so fragile as i cry
felt so hard to breath i stared
alone alone alone
silent night
dove grey sands
facing life alone
lead by devotion
i cant hear you again
space we're getting better all the time
safe we're getting better all the time
space we're getting better all the time
see me wait
i cant end another
cause i'm drowning in sin
now the light comes shining in
you pure the air that i need
you cut away the disease
i can feel it again
lift yourself into a better place
losing direction you're losing faith
bury the ashes of someone
dont ever feel
am i just like you
television satellite
it just feels so damn good
they say that the bubble boy's ok
in this lonley frame
on the edge for you
the angels tears come flooding down again
today it all feels fine
we have made
deep in grave
chorus x2
maybe im high
the pain has taken over
the angel of my life
empty
change the frequency
cant you breathe it in
you're sending love back down
then watching his mother try to soothe
seeing the seagull spy for food
just wish i could break that shell
staring at paper clouds and hills
you would
empty
all that you face
moving around a town
pushing up
you said you could you should
a light
so dont you give in
dont think that i can help myself
dont think that i can help myself
polythene girl
make love your goal
when the chips are down
a force from above
i'm so in love with you
with tongues of fire
holding on to you
lift the world from off your shoulders now
you take away the grey
you take away the grey
pulling you under now
you're pushing the senses through
what are you going to do
empty
empty
let's talk about us
a china heart will always break
try to get high
it twists and turns you
empty
just see how it is
chorus x2
trying to get out cause it wont change money doesnt mean that much to him
they try to hide their guilt away with a smile that says that its okay
tune in you might hear him
keep my feet on the ground
further up as i float
believe in me believe in me
and constant rearrangement
set me free
set me free
falling through these clouds of silver
crashing onto cotton waterfalls
cause i'm your rubberband
you twist me around i feel like a rubberband
sending it all right back
i wanna lift myself up to the sky
they're hoping that it's better
i'll shine like the sun
wanna leave it all just for a while
i wanna lift myself above the clouds
climbing up to free myself
twist and turn
do you really know
i dont need this
you love to watch me crawl
i'm spinning out of my ferris wheel red
feels like home it feels like home
lying face down on the floor reaching out for something new
we burn to face the storm
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
empty
wash the stain right off your feet
live the system walk the plank
empty
and in between now and the last time we met
had i had known that it might have been me
i'm 22 for a moment
a kid on the way
15 there's never a wish better than this
and i'm just dreaming
i sing above my vision i sing above my face
every day a saturday a summer waking morn
a lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean
with lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep
but her back seat wont ever tell
or bringing home my first baby
my '65 mustang rides along
dont need to play no new cd's
she's my family tree
like dad did when the '65 was three
so what is your problem
i'm closer to you
you're all i'll ever need
the higher i go the harder i climb
i'm closer to you
and she didnt even mean a thing to me
i hit my head upon the chamber door
i'm alright alright i feel alright
here in the borders of america town
and know someone's looking out for me
i can still make my bet on the basketball game
we all spin around
you'll be my only friend
and in a sense you could say she snared my attention
so now i'm stuck in this pineapple parking lot
angels never come for free
though it's hard to hear him speak
though his arms cant squeeze you tight
he caught lou gehrig rounding third one day
bella's birthday cake was burning
ever yearning forest fire

will she come again
in a footnote of history
but spare me my pride
one day he came to me said

that you with me or against me
that the only way is the wrong way
empty
heres to you
empty
we got nothin left to say
we got nothin left to say
it feels like the whole thing's made up i cant really see their design dont want to burn forever so much for water to wine
first you lost your angels then you lost your crown give up your holy crusade what was lost has just been found
empty
aint nobody growin
the wake after my hate
an empty point of view
one thing i'm gonna do
swallow you cant miss
you take my money
you just gotta sit yourself down
and i'd kill your father
and see through this shit
the one that makes me feel tall like a tall tree
you're celebrating nothing
empty
wish i was separate in this
what's next
empty
wish i was separate in this
it makes me want to go away
the way you look and talk to me
you know i'm not the guilty one
where do we go from here
i guess you just cant see
white like that
i'm white like that
i like it when it's green
i like the world today
empty
i just want a life of my own
i cant see see straight i cant be straight
i'm gonna make a mistake
had fun so
for a wellmade mistake
make a mistake why cant i make a mistake
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
and the rivulets had you riveted to the places that i wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone
let's pretend we're eight years old playing hookey
when i was on
oooh after all the folderol
home is where my habits have a habitat
i've got a plan a demand and it just began
to hold no searchlight
to sing no love song
i've gone a
back into your arms
of a murdered prey
to save you honey
i've done wrong and
'cause i'm feelin
save me from
of all these lies till
like a criminal
the law and let me go
to be redeemed
to be redeemed
to help me laugh it off
oh give me anything and i'll turn it into a gift
protect what i found in you
butterflies in my brain
what'd i say to her
i just made a meal for us both to choke on
and that's why the devil just cant get around me
i still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb
if there was a better way to go then it would find me
while they chaperone
i cant help it the road just rolls out behind me
fast as you can
fast as you can
i let the beast in and then
fast as you can leave me let this thing
cuz i do know what's good for me
till it elevates to a place i cant breathe
sing sing sing again
but wait till i get him back
he put himself so low
yeah keep turning that chin
i might be dumb but i'm not blind
and baby that's why
so please dont bother to justify
if i'm butter if i'm butter
he makes my heart a cinemascope screen
if i'm butter if i'm butter i'm a hot knife i'm a hot knife
he makes my heart a cinemascope screen if i get a chance i'm gonna show him that
i'm a hot knife i'm a hot knife
if im butter then he's a hot knife i'm a hot knife he's a pat of butter
i'll know i'll know
so for the time being i'm being patient
for you to find you love me and tell me so
i dont wanna talk about
just tolerate my little fist
take me to coney island
i dont wanna talk about anything
and now i'm hard too hard to know
not 'til this guy what a guy oh god what a good guy
the ants weigh more than the elephants
you wanna make me sick
you'll beat me with your bitter lies
i never did anything to you man
under your brow
and in a little while we'll only have to wave
i'll just use your simple name
the judgements made on you
you'll say you understand
you'll never feel
but never is a promise
but as the scenery grows
you'll never understand
the early cars
to take information
and it doesnt make sense
in fact i cant stop falling out
but i'm not being fair
'cause i am not in love
everything good i deem too good to be true
saying there's nothing to it
o' sailor why'd you do it
and what a thing to know what could be instead
giving me eyes to view it
tries to teach you a lesson
who doesnt believe in the stuff
who doesnt believe in the stuff
variations to consider
like a dress that year
resounded from within
as i'm singing him to sleep
and he finds a home in me
falling down
and i believed for a moment that my chances
baby said he couldnt stay wouldnt put his lips to mine
hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love
i bet you could never tell
it ended bad but i love what we started
oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
always have a bite to bare
cause i dont appreciate
with a more even tempered air
besides you can take it up with his brethren
oh the periphery
they've been made up already
that will keep us steady
it's a mess but it's working
no more melodies
something similar
no more remedies
steady going nowhere
i dont understand about
and i still cant find the track
to the fitfully cryptically true
now all you gotta do's remind me that we met
member when i was so sick and you didnt believe me
leave me alone leave me alone
oh you creep up
when will you know
'cause i dont know
spell on me
reverence to my concern
i've been swinging
you cannot bear
and you're not at
i could swallow the seas
to sleep to dream
i got my own hell to raise
'cause it's a crying shame
you got your head
i got my own hell to raise
i'll let you run away
heavy with mood
slow like honey
like a bridge
gonna keep you reaching
i wander the halls
in the blue of my oblivion
and left an empty
it's calm under the waves
leaving the light on
honey help me
your absence tonight
from the roots of my soul
waiting for the black
consumed by you
adagio breezes fill
give me the first taste
it's race right through me
and i'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
able to move on
the shifting of gears
please forgive me for my distance
am i your gal or should i get out of town
i sent it via pantomime
i watched you live to have my fun
i root for you i love you you you you you
but you were such a super guy
one thing leads to another
but you were such a super guy
it was a filthy pane of glass
my eyes got fixed when my mind got soft
it just had to be
then forget what i had to say
better that i break the window
or miss what i should see
and i look to the stage it's the rock of rage as jon is on
go to lar go to lar go to largo
handle me like family and that'll be enough
two thousand reasons
lots of reasons
the reasons for them i'll never know
to trust me with all his might
i've got honor to earn
somebody stop me i'm losing control
and you know what love is for
oh you're a woman
after all the words were
it seems the circle of love
after all those talks together
you can take it all away but i'll never let you go
empty
when you propose
but there's no place to go now
there's nothing left to keep me hanging on
we only have one life to live
that how it goes homes
empty
i buck down a little sucker just to watch him bleed
picked the fruit
more than the trees
dropped off and blue
fruit flower myself inside out
and fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
oh and these northern nights are dreary
and i am tied to your strings and twisted
out of me there's a voice which keeps calling
tied to your strings and twisted look out boy
said 'race against time' thought it was clever
so warm the blood runs down your legs
hiding in the shadows
peak billboard position 24 in 1951
red sails in the sunset i'm trusting in you
and she goes sailing no more
and we made our plans
you were so relied upon everybody knows how hard you tried
how you gonna know for sure everything was so well organized
invading all those stills
i came upon your room it stuck into my head
girating through some lonesome devils row dark entries
you took delight in taking down
dark entries
and what was done
i need you by my side
can we compromise
ooh make it right for me babe
it's only love we're makin
make it right
enemies get you
motherfuckers gettin chopped up and they holla
where you from motherfucker where you from
if a bitch with him she better be smart or tough luck
empty
all day hustle beaucoup scuffle
oh henry oh
who'll trace the lines of her mouth
henry darger henry darger
one heart one soul just one solution
no blood no stain
a glimpse of hope and unity
there's only one direction
one flesh one bone
just gimme gimme gimme gimme
only by giving me your everything
you brought me out in the sun
only by giving me your energy
it really brought him down because he couldnt jam
he was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company b
he puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
ha ha hand the company jumps when he plays reveille
you gave me a gift lord and i'm gonna sing it for you
but the suns been quite quite kind while i wrote this song
i hope you i hope you got back and tell everybody
it's for people like you people like me
i'm i'm gonna sit upon a a rooftop and kick off my shoes
tell everybody that billy pauls got a song
no one around
was like i said x 456236783 i thought it was pause like i said but thats gay
he just wants sex
plays the game
a lone ranger on a silver horse
midnight in a rented room
lone ranger with a silver bullet
i'm standing by myself
time now for
been through it a thousand times before
feat dogg pound snoop doggy dogg
gots that type of game and i'm know just to pull 'em
i'm hittin hoes like i'm hittin licks
nate dogg
thought she was sent from the heavens above
from way back in the days
and each time seemed the same to me
holdin my door open before the wind
how can i help you
i guess i need to get what i give
i never hear you laugh
empty
and you wont let me know
what can i say girl i'm sensitive
now they are coming
but my trust is something that i put in few
but dont get me wrong all i want is you to stay with me baby
please open your mind
and stranger things have happened since you've been here
and stranger things have happened since you've been here
childhood friends have all grown up
if ever my darling in my life
fate's been waiting for the right time
if ever my darling in my life
cold nights dark days
for doing what we do
tonight i wanna lay by your feet
'cause girl i was made for you and girl you were made for me
empty
once again
dont turn away
every word out of your mouth is shit
i know that you blame me for everytime
till then life will be so lonely
that my love will not die no other live have i
that there's nothing more she'd rahter do do than
running my fingers through your hair
follow me follow me darling
and you tell me dont stop
late last christmas eve
she was cryin when she gave me the message
and i saw the light that christmas night
sometimes this time of year
running away slipping away right behind the plow
slipping away
well i'm going down that mississippi river yes i am yes i am
well i dont know i dont know
but you couldnt do right
you say out with your friends
and i'm much better
when i dont want you
i was the best that you had
and get out my house
cuz you're so sick
but why do you still want me
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
be the same
but why do you still want me
when i want to
you gotta get over me
from you
you can leave me there to die
postcard stowaway within
the horses just dont gossip anymore
an everlasting vision
he wore a torn and tattered cloth
and his hand came down emp ty
there suddenly appeared
to a deluxe apartment in the sky
as long as we live it's you and me baby
just slip'n slide
here i go
it's just too much to take tonight
turn back the tide
here i go
two by two
something's going to change these times
and we'll watch them fade away
i really need your love
ayakuasa death liane of the sorcerers
little by little the spiral takes its form
stereo and mono on the radio the radio
i am music
you might hear me at restaurants coz i am
and the things you hear are you scared
wake up subconscious death is real
can you see life fading away
a shotgun up against my eye
it's on me
sirens blazing
hey kids where you been
i'll fix it all with a gun
a bullet changes everything
menace in your muddy eyes a candy coated fear
stigmatised in my holy water 666
your will whole of the law
battering down the walls built inside of me
if you find the missing piece the answers of a lasting peace
the trick's been played life's slight of hand
filled your bags with what we dont talk about
lost in my own insides
anything corrosive magnet
if i turn on my lights out
stoppin tomorrow tonight
how many cells must die before you're legally
before i see the light
till i know where i am
brain dead this time
for the junk cultured junkies needs
will there be no place to hide when the storm comes down
this is the turning point these are the crossroads
life is a movie about you
now revive in a coma
no way to save yourself inside
leave this place time to erase
as i trip through the same daily non existing life i call hell
resume your identity but dont overload
safely assumed i'm not well
teach me how cradle me now
a demon with a mans face
swastika horrid miscreation in the camps of concentration
empty
and the pain selfish pleasures conceal
empty
longing like a new widow
let the flesh
i've lost me in a dream
for myself
to where i've never been
destructive signs
no explanations for my deviation
whom we're taught to fear from day number one
he creates before them illusions of broken truce
in a moment the world is ash
by the rumbling planed metalbeast soon to appear
to confront the master of sin
here comes the message from the antennae
had an accomplice who knew of nothing
dial double zero
dial double zero
words can boost words can break
more than the world inside my mind
now surrounded all by strangers
dreams empty into my life
dreaming of death in my sleep again
just very violently killing time
slamming faster just to hit the ground
tying on another big liquid noose
when it's hard to hold them down
when the water keeps on rising
if it's cheaper to kill
if i dont keep moving
if i dont keep moving
and i know you cant tell
ascends from beneath metalshock to reveal
empty
if it were oh just gone
not an apparition not the holy ghost
it walks right beside me
it lies then on the floor
as i move from door to door
it lies there on the floor
seeing is still not beleiving
i'll turn away from this mess i'm burning
i bet you never thought you'd see me dead no
a monster
the trouble with you is the trouble with me
natural enemies
your introduction into
envoys are delt their hands
bustling nations horde their rotting wheat
torture from the hooded nations
tell me something what you're trying to prove
thermo global fear
turning to the right feel it getting tight
instinct never worked anyway what i've seen i just cant say
the risk runs high but i've gotta try
pretentious asshole time to move aside
honorable brave bark armoured man donning hideous mask
honor even in death digrace is defied
no sign of pain on his face
repeat chorus
the balance in my hands the life blood seed
now i know just who you really are
hit myself hard in the head
i've been waiting around all day
can your mother sew have her stitch' this
promise to keep her digging deeper
promise keepers nothing cheaper
promise keepers nothing cheaper
i dont care what they say
what they all think of me now is
i'm sinking taking everyone down
and my old lady she dont care
saturday night's the night i like
repeat chorus
slipping through that secret maze
intensity the hum in your head
released thru sweat
laughter splits my mind nothing in the way
she has no remorse in her merciless bloodbath
repeat refrain
to benefit yourself
nothing close to what you've done
smoked out peeled back unearthed
pay off my emotions made
you take the rope i climb and tie at in a noose
hold me under thumb
stabbing by the pointed words
for what you feel is right and sane
instinct stifled dont be afraid
and there's lots of us around
shoulda woulda coulda sketches all our regrets
but i never could fill the word that i said
pictures down the well of my thoughts
now i'm free like a rat in a cage
as teeth and jaw
selling rock candy and suicide
the best mans daughter weds the wings of the dragonfly
delivered every day
your eyes are black like coals
cutting into line again
gone tomorrow here today
empty
empty
handing down that anger
forced to forget this anguish
tightness suffocates
everybody's watching none of them i've ever met
additional tack on late charge
slit wristed run over and hanged
what a way to go
make the weight to run and die again
every race a run right for their lives
numbers in your mind add up to
all your fans wont love you if you dont win
win lose or dead
when it's in your hands and you cant feel
when it's in your heart but you cant feel you fell
when it's in your hands and you cant feel
wears me down
my ears ring your favorite sound
that really dont exist
empty
now kill the power become partners of sin
alone in our decision to unlock the door
alone in our decision to unlock the door
why didnt i get a call
how soon they're gone away
and everything i see is now
when the whole world saw but me
everything i know is in the past
fade to black
i am falling feel the pain
falling faster no one here
everybody's watching me
watching over me
still i walk
again seemed right
this rhyme picked my mind
still i walk
standing on the edge of time
standing on the edge of time
same old song with a different beat
and the book of fear
cheated angels turned away
the little people spit down on you
and i'll recognize
instead you stay alive
you fucked up everyone's life
a blacker demise
you fucked up everyone's lives
high paid thief in office sharpened lies cut your throat
to get your own way you were my friend
equation stagnation
you say you've seen the horns and tail
hello how are you ready tonight
my turn to go you
my time to show you
our children need to know what's going on and that our world is a mess
there's never a way to stop the music
but i'm gonna have to turn it down
switch back
you knew i was sincere
i've already been to heaven
trains change
switch back
i know it seems
as long as the juice shows up there
so i wont be buying it
if i cant get high
dripping in humanity exactly what a friend should be
hypodermics gathered make your bed
shooting up shooting down
again the arena is mine i live you die
i live you die
the reaper is near
cry out in desperation iron tears take you apart
my love for you is lies you see iron tears
the game of love is made of lies dont you see
this time
close my eyes and hope that it's
all you gotta do is try
fake it all in stride
all night long i dream of the day
another reason to bleed
if i get any closer
nothing satisfies but i'm getting close
weight keeping me down x2
puzzles suck laughing in my face
not what it seems
ring in the witching hour
want to forget about
can you go another round
and you dream about yourself
and the stars will all come out
i'm your fool
but had no use
is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
the life the love
i'm getting tired of starting again
empty
if we can get around it
you make me dizzy running circles in my head
i break right through
we're face to face my friend
i may be crazy little frayed around the ends
i'm begging for ignition
breathe for me when i'm gone
waiting to collide
burn out beyond
never burn again x3
no way you'll silence me
dont say what i dont need
something borrowed something blue
i'm not a fool
you're the one bothers me
i'm all sick for you
i can hear them say
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
you didnt pass me by
give me one last wish give me one last wish
when i've had enough
hey let's call it even
dont you deny me dont you deny me
a sliver of hope no diamond rings
we fade away in time oh
bring some alcohol
never coming back
promise not to say another word
oh maybe maybe maybe i can share it with you
i can change i can change i can change
oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened i know
cant we meet somewhere
just keep stairing at the sun
you know i did
meet me in the summertime
meet me in the summertime
no sweat yeah wow right
faded you
colors start to run
our ending had begun
cause i gotta move
you got to talk the talk the talk the talk
something i've found
this is the last song this is the last song
we pretend it all away
and now i'm through
before the feeling fades
you're not the one
someone's always someone's one
but you're the only one
save it up for one more try
you're not the one
who could make me
keep you in the dark
done pleading ignorance
what if i say i'm not like the others
what if i say i'm not like the others
i'm the face that you have to face
keep you in the dark
what if i say i'm not like the others
you're the pretender
even all the ever wanting had a problem
call the magic marker
ritalin is easy
put them on and walked away
lie around and beat my head
then follows you back home
to hang the stars upon tonight
sick and uninspired by the diamonds in your fire
i wont go getting tired of you
another one returned that i'll never use
burning like a flame inside of you
i'm not getting tired of you
i wont go getting tired of you
is this just desire or the truth
i can be your liar
i'm not getting tired
and the voice forever in my heart
it's true the two of us
stay there soft and blue virginia moon i'll wait for you tonight
i will say goodnight
matter of fact
if you walk out on me
masked without a weapon
i wanna listen to the flowerhead
read a sponsor one shot no post show
big shit no duh
i want a song that's indelible
i hope you never see me wind up
split the moment seal the sheet
split the moment seal the sheet
empty
take it back for them to keep
never believe fraternity
swearing father
go on keep feeding
another disease fraternity
promises made and sentences read
you take me away take it from me hey
you take me away take it from me
you take me away take it from me
and he's there
he thinks he drinks too much
that he played
gas chamber cannot breathe
in my room all the time
lately i'm getting better
when there's nothing left to use
when there's no one left to use and everyone keeps going down
tired of wearing black and blue
dress me up in stitches it's now or never
blood on you
killing me like you do
cause everyone's just too weird
dying to get my blood on you
since i'm putting down all
always the blues and a delicate smile
and some gone back
god only knows
guess that i've been blessed but i'll be damned
disappear i'm tired of waiting
you're gonna go far
and did we tell you the name of the game boy
it could be made into a monster
when i'm empty
through everything you left your wings apart
she's spilling over me
in too deep
will you meet your mind where the night collides
as long as i can fight i'll survive
and show you everything
i'll be right there
everything fades in time it's true
your eyes still remind me of
i'd throw it away long before
living green and gray
blew it all away
i'm in hells gard hells gard will be true the world
it's your cold day in the sun
looks like your bleeding heart has already won
it's funny how
some time if time allows
everything fades in time it's true
your eyes still remind me of
gather round'
gather round'
i think it's time we all should come clean
never knowing who to believe
seems like only yesterday
all filled up with emptiness
disappeared the only thing
come alive x15
tie up the transmission this one is not a test
for you
i will comeback i will comeback for you
damn you damn everyone
do you remember
did you find some happiness with me
and that was all
sing along for yesterday
a little shattered
what's a boy to do
nevermind there's nothing i can do
a promise is a promise you kept in check
no ones getting out of here alive
doll me up in my bad luck
you can watch the humans trying to run
different face but the words never change
do it baby drive me wild
make a wish but not aloud
when we were brand new
i'm feeling out of luck
stop me so i can begin
but there never seems to be enough space
no please dont talk about it
empty
empty
it goes away
empty
we'll make these promises
empty
and out of the red
when i sing along with you
i'm not around that much
after the bliss has long ended
you'd steal the show
it heals the soul
he floats
on the ground
leads me away
all i want is to be home
people i've loved
these things i've done without you should have never been done
how i miss you
like i miss you
i thought i knew
let me be
it returns and when it lands
and learn from all that came from it
i'm alone again
now i might help any other
mine is yours and yours is mine
feel me breathing
he opened up his sky
the war has just begun
the millions knew that there was no lie
second european tour
he was constantly going to the coffee shop
and i'm reading you know maximum rock and
you know he came in and put his herb
he kinda pointed it at me
i'm looking to the sky to save me
run and tell all the angels that everything is alright
why'd you have to go and let it die
you're so considerate
do you ever think of me
why'd you have to go and let this die
we will all make out so well
turn your insides out to the outside
pleasure or pain
keep out of reach
one more time for the last time
one more time for the last time
one more time for the last time
here now dont make a sound
dear god i've sealed my fate
i know a field without a name
long road to ruin there in your eyes
running through hell heaven can wait
you make me weep and wanna die
you're tearin me apart
now it's your turn girl to cry
another like you ooh
me and you
as low as you go
taking you as low as you go
ooh ooh
low as you go
let's make a bet
i'm in loss and win or lose with you
we'll make a bargain and call this truce
nevermind the mannequins drunk in their hollow town
calling unanswered the center becomes blown out
cold and rescued
tonight i'm leaving going mia
please come to me
got no vision i've been blind
one more indecent accident
i never wanted any more than i could fit into my head
use that evidence race it around
leaving all the best
i want to detonate
the same in the stars
another early morning
i'll never tell you the secret i'm holding
into the sun we climb
lighting the way we glide by
when i come down
i'm fightin for you
i was dreamin
there is no way back from here
threw it up as it went down
another night alone
we're teathered once again
sat alone
i'm here
restless little one
are you there
pray it wont be long
are you there
do you read me
tonight before it turns to dust
turning like the wheels inside your head
you change again
this time i think it's sinking us
keep hanging
there's that song again
only if it's black or white see the challenges
find any answer help yourself
patience my dear
day after day
he doesnt know why
this is the reflection
yesterday's been laid to rest changing of the guard
one more tear that you wont hear
a little bit of resolve
i'm done resenting you
i will wash away your pain with all my tears
i will burn for you
you will believe in me
to be a part of you
the harder you hit
but you'd lose your mind without me
the different ways that you tried to harm me
dont even bother
thirteen times five
a stroke of luck or a gift from god
these are the rules i make
you come to me now
all around me falling
you've got to learn to love yourself
and hollowness
you're an alien sex fiend
nobody wants to be alone
boys in the parlor
what you need
like treasure they twinkle in the sun
empty
empty
i'll free your mind
empty
if flesh could crawl
take it's conscience with it
as far from god
choke on guilt that's far too good for you
as far from god
i wanna hear you call out my name
you wanna get what
i've got something special for my bad boyfriend
c'mon baby can you bleed like me
she sings
after two drinks he's a loser after three drinks he's a star
try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend
and in a world where good's not good enough
it's gets so funny that we get confused
let's get stupid just entertain us
i'm sick sick sick of saying nothing
magic happens
dont end up in the gutter
walk away cause you're breaking up the girl
you're breaking up the girl
you're a different kind 'cause you want their minds
you go from day to day by filling your head
he's just a face on your pillowcase
i've reached the end of the rope
oh babe i cant hide it
i've cut all my losses
i just dont care anymore
you fill my life with misery
i'm more in love with you
she didnt care to hang around
and in your hot pants and high heels
you hold a candle in your heart
go baby go baby
you hold a candle in your heart
in the hysterical realm
baby thinks he's dying
he thinks he's going crazy
you're so like a rose
check out the carnival for a while
self centred and vain
and you feel imasculinated
i'm living without you
i thought you were special
i used to amuse you
i'm tired of the violence
is what you get
can drive you mad can drive you mad
cant believe you fake it
you stupid girl
create a scene
you're going down down down
she lost her way here
you're going down down down
empty
you're going down down down
charisma and advertisements
supernatural maybe
you can always pull out
make a whole new religion
you're not the only one
i am a wolf but
i cant afford to waste
a new possession
when i'm not sure who i am
i say never trust anyone
the trick is to keep breathing x2
i know how to heal
together we can take the world apartmy love
empty
maybe friday i can
if it's so then let me know
playing those games cause we had nothing to do
i dreamt that i called out your name
i felt invincible with you in my arms
holy rock'nroll
i dreamt that i called out your name
empty
farewell i will love you till the day that i die
come on
this is not what i came for
this is not what i came for
b b baby baby i'm on fire
i'm a freak freak freak
empty
to bring you down
it must feel good to believe
you think you're untouchable you take a fall
no one's untouchable
i nearly died
you crucified me but i'm back in your bed
i came around to tear your little world apart
i came around to tear your little world apart
like a giant juggernaut
when i grow up
blood and blisters
i'll turn the tables
i've done ugly things and i have made mistakes
why do you love me it's driving me crazy
now i've held back a wealth of shit i think i'm gonna choke
why do you love me it's driving me crazy
i think you're sleeping with a friend of mine
do it again
why do you love me
bolt the door down keep it shut
bring the virgin home for luck
just like i told you
you're taking me over
knocked down
i'm like the desert tonight
over and over
variations on your violence
stripped bare i'm the same old savage
loud and clear but you still dont get it
i cant use you anymore
i cant use you anymore
i wish i had not woke up today
everyone i know has gone away
nothing you learn
nothing you learn will stick
nothing you learn
cant do wrong tonight
but they see me so large
car car car
car get in the car
car get in the car
stop analysing my behaviour
i bet you wish you could let it go
now that you know what you know
you'll never come sucking your thumb
you still dont know what i think of me
everything i had to give
cut me down or cut me dead
nowhere only down from here
kiss me blind somebody should fix me now somebody should fix me now
now i dont care for sycofants
empty
get bizzy with the fizzy baby 4x
then let's just keep good friends
but i am free tonight
let's make out in the back of your car
let them kick back off the ground
girl dont come
girl dont come
i'm stressed but you're freestyle
when did i get perverted
like an animal you're moving over me
when i walk in the room
a catch for the chasing
dont forget what i wrote you then
in my lovers arms i wait for morning
i never thought for one second i'd have nothing left but shame
manipulate it
if i should fail if i should fold
steal me deal me anyway you heal me
any way you need me
it's all over but the crying
everything you think you know baby
now i cant walk back
you said i ruined your life
i'm so sorry
lead me to the brunt
you were strangling me
the jam i was in when things werent working out
empty
do do do do do do do when your on your knees do do do do x6
i see your car parked on the road
i lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls
my friends all say they're worried
i learnt all i need from you
you're asleep when i get home
somebody get me out of here
head on my pillow
you didnt even seem to mind
you know it's hard to believe anything that you hear
the world is round
kiss my mother on her cheek and lay my burden down
i am lost
i can use my tears to
i am cool
i'm waiting
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
piece by piece send me an angel
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
i need to feel a little piece of heaven
to find something real to hold on to
but there's a hole inside my heart
and ended up with nothing
this is not my idea of a good time
this is not my idea
i'm only happy when it rains
i'm only happy when it rains
i'm only happy when it rains
get it right now
oh let's bomb the factory
the smile he always shoots at you
the baby in your arms
get it right now
there's no use in crying
oh let's pray for something
i was angry when i met you
my head explodes and my body aches
we'll stay up all night
chorus 3x
hey boy take a look at me
you choke behind a smile
the deadest of the dead
the queerest of the queer
the coldest of the cool
you can touch me
about time take them right between the eyes
to fly high into somebody else
then they'll stab you in the back like that
it comes back to haunt you
dont it astound you
so run my baby run my baby run
run my baby run my baby run
a revolution
is the solution
is the solution
they say you're a saint
with a man of your own
just shut your mouth
guess it doesnt matter people
we dont give a fucking damn
play it smart girl
you could go far
on their graves
if you can do it
if i am silent then i am not real
if no truths are spoken then no lies can hide
wont someone listen
i got you twisted round my finger
if we come together
the emptiness
if we sleep together
well you and i
there's times i think you just like to fight
and show to me it's okay to be
for the sake of conformation
there must be rebel blood
sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
but if you're gonna leave your mark
rubber squealin gears a jamming
grab a bite to eat
aint goin down 'til the sun comes up
aint givin in 'til they get enough
and there they go again
and the house he lived in grew up room by room
fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands
now he's goin home this time to stay
and asked her if she needed a ride
and i used to think the night
three days later we came up for air
and a goodbye note that read
if your paycheck depends on
but when your dollar goes to all of those
and they love to play it loud
for your frustration
well i wrote our names a thousand times
burns for one without a name
and the light in the manger
and the blind will see
through the stable door
seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
oh it's a b double e double r u n
come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
a song that we all knew
another's voice joined in
to see us find a better way
it's for us to find it here
empty
he sure cant spend it now
well now the
big money's where it's at
take a look at this bank account
why i always run away
on where we'd settle down
another bridge goes down
what i'm doin cant be undone
such a strange combination of a woman and a child
and a couple dollars change
operator wont you put me on through
on her lips i keep tasting
is like a woman sometimes
i wish i could hold her
'cause it was too damn cold
and we sang yippie ti yi yay and amazing grace
or put that gravel in his voice
the way it all would end the way it all would go
but i'd of had to miss the dance
we're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight
while your butt spins 'round and 'round
fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
jesus our brother kind and good
i gave him my wool for his blanket warm
i said the camel all yellow and black
for it's feathers were covered with sand
to lay by the manager that night
maria what brings you to me
whose beauty was fit for a king
but i matched him shout for shout
but i just would not let it go
the blood came from my mouth and nose
i crawled back in the house
and fell into the fire down below
and with trembling hands they wiped away the steam
and they told exactly how the woman died
lord the night will only know
just to bring his gifts to you
with his reindeer and his sleigh
with santa on their mind
yeah the old mans back in town
goes wild tonight
asit was one big party
hats off to the kc opry and ella guru's
swingin with our low friends
you can call it whatever you choose
thundering moments of tenderness rage
oh the red strokes
thundering moments of tenderness rage
steam on the window salt in a kiss
i will sail my vessel
'til what we put off 'til tomorrow
i'll never reach my destination
like a bird upon the wind
of broken glass and photographs
and the tears
a broken jewel box dancer
she's got to move on
the night to make it home
and the thunder rolls
and the thunder rolls
she's waitin by the window
the thunder rolls
to the bedroom door
for the holidays you cant beat home sweet home
she was born in kansas city
was a family the same
just standing around
and if blood is
how in god's name
blood is thicker than water
i've never been nobody's fool
i've never lost at love not counting you
the everlasting light
and peace to men on earth
to get through one night a day
i'm callin every friend i've had
just another way i know
when daddy'd hang up she was gone again
papa came home and it was just us kids
he never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears
the way that i feel
it actually grazed me
what they mean
it betrays me
because he'd rather be
maybe it's the bible or could it be the lack
maybe it's the sports fans agents fads
try to love one another right now
come on people now
we gotta love one another
for a change
with long black hair and
they both can keep
but the cowboy life
sharp end of a knife
she knows his love's in tulsa
it's boots and chaps
and it's so long girl i'll see you
it's boots and chaps
and a broken home and some broken bones
it's boots and chaps
raised behind the wheel
she said i wanna fell the earth move under me
lord it knocked me to my knees
empty
empty
oh i get the blues if the rhythm aint got no soul
same old story
in some other town
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa put his arms around mama
i never saw a red nosed reindeer
well i'm shamemeless when it comes to loving you
i'm shameless oh honey i dont have a prayer
i have never let anything have this much control over me
it's out of my hands
oh i'm down on my kneesshameless
she's makin love on rainy nights
she's on both sides of the fence
she seemed to sail right through
and she's over that hill
is she'd take him back
and he never will
heavenly host sing allehlujah
cause when it comes to heartaches i'd rather give than to receive
begging to be taken back and swearing i'll be true
no i've never lost at love not counting you
over the hills and everywhere
that jesus christ is born
she's never been much good at telling lies
'cause i can see her heart is heading 'cross a bridge i thought she'd burned
the greyhound stops somebody gets on
they cant drag main because it kicks up dust
nobody gets off
it's christmas time in the city
and above all the bustle you hear
help to make the season bright
merry christmas to you
and this aint tennessee
still i think sometimes she sees
and deep down in my heart
but where she's now i dont know
but no one knew her name
and i wonder if she knows
and there is no one there to dry your tears
to make you feel my love
hey i'm her wild card man
i'm her hard workin man no doubt
we really fit together
we'll find some country music on the radio
we live out in the country
workin on a full house
yea we're two of a kind
hey that's what it's all about
that heartaches are healed by the sea
and never leave dry land
the heartaches that love often brings
and never leave dry land
and each night i'd spend prayin that god would make her mine
we tried to talk about the old days
some of god's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered
but all this cloak and dagger is stoking her heart
welcome to the game
is she carrying a torch for love in vain
that'll surely light the flame
where a little child was born to bring the gift of love to you and me
and in the still and silent night we sing
he won it in a rodeo
and he's not just a face in a martini crowd
a woman loved him through it all
oh but it's a different saddle
and he won the ride but he broke his back
the mans back on his feet
she stayed by his side
well he's still the local hero
you're a victim of the game
it treats everyone the same
that you're a victim of the game
out in the starlight
cryin on his pillow
i stop to see a weeping willow
searchin for me
but she keeps changing her mind
repeat twice
but leave the handle stickin out
i let a dead dog lie
baby there aint no doubt
we should forget about
the way this world shall be
we shall be free
have a little faith
we shall be free
whom shepherds guard and angels sing
come peasant king to own him
to save us all from satans power
oh tidings of comfort and joy
they found him in the manger
from the hills to kaycee wyoming
as we all sang along
and them pickup men are at your side
he would not slow down
and just ledoux it
be more like chris
good ride cowboy good ride
i keep tellin you hard luck woman
and wipe the tears from your eyes
rags i really love ya
make the yuletide gay
once again as in olden days
that wind blew pyramids to egypt
what it's like when dreams become reality
without a risk of being burned
if you're down here doin
if you want to get the truth to admit it
how it feels to hold him
how you ever gonna know
so i sat alone
as they opened up the doors
i took your ring from my pocket
now i dont have to wonder anymore
but you might need this fool around in case you fall
so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
and she must face the world without me
and avoid that circumstance
if tomorrow never comes
in another's eyes
this picture perfect portrait
tryin desperately
this picture perfect portrait
they couldnt move west and they couldnt go home
so they got married and they had a child
she watched her boy grow into a man
as the shots rang out down the rio grande
she learned the language and she learned to fight
deep within the emerald isle
i can see your rolling fields of green
i tell them to make ready
as in silence we draw near
we were forty against hundreds
if you walk out that door
so without you
like it's just another night
i guess your prince charming
and the party's just begun
there's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
it's the most wonderful time of the year
and tales of the glories
i remember one time
it was your song that made me sing
this feeling feels brand new
it was your song that made me sing
come on it's lovely weather
let's take the road before us
without a single stop
we remember all through our lives
your independence day
and moving on moving on
for a chill is in the air
and some vows to take
i can hardly see the moonlight
my baby did but now she dont
and some vows to take
she was standin in the kitchen with nothin but her apron on
they spent the day wrapped up in a blanket
she needs to be held tight
working that overtime
whoever said
you've got to make a little time
honey trying to figure you out
tonight's the night
repeat bridge
but you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
they're so hell bent on giving walking a wire
i cant abide
i've been out on this highway of heartache
that heats my motor up
i've been runnin on empty way too long
and drive it home
and if your tie's to tight then adjust the noose
and to burn it down
'till the sun come back around
'till that sun come back around
we're gonna tear it up
hey daddy's hide your daughters
make a little midnight moonlight mo jo
just to tear it up
and to burn it down
and the windows rolled down
when i need a friend
we should paint the town
aint cowboys at all
she's the guy i call
god could it be it's been ten years
the marquee misspelled his name
that ol wind had once again found its way home
we were a thousand miles from nowhere
and on the air there was a hunger
burning both ends of the night
to chase the lightning from the sky
and i have rarely held another
written in her lover's eyes
details can somehow slip your mind
i remember it that way
when i held you there
the workers come on monday
died right there beside him in cheyenne
it told about the fight they had
and see her footprints in the sand
one hand
but it's not the world that i am changing
and i hear them saying you'll never change things
i do this so this world we know
well it might be kind of fun to take him home
and puttin on his boots and gettin gone
dont even start to think you're gonna change him
whatcha gonna do when he says honey
this is the man that nobody sees
i listen and i wonder
it's four in the morning
but it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
shining faithfully
in our own time and our own space
you're changing all that is and used to be
her friends have all left and she needs a ride home
who she's up against when she's holdin me close
and children listen
you set me up shoot me down
i'm sendin up a white flag
love is headed for a fall
and yet those words
why aint i gone
all those words
so now why do i feel lonely
johnny grew up
wild as the wind is love
takin him to heaven
he gets a stray look in his eye
wild as the wind is
in san antone and santa fe
to make her one more promise
wild horses keep draggin me away
gone away is the bluebird
to face unafraid the plans that we made
charlie barton and his family
and when we stumble in the snow
oh lord keep me from bein
that we're living in is crazy
i love you about as deep as any love can grow
but you move me
not knowin what they mean
how you move me
now i'm taking delight
'zat you santa claus
'zat you santa claus
'zat you santa claus
as he sat there and painted those west texas scenes
the captain went down and bill pulled up on his rains
so we set out for his place down old grist mill road
i've never know one better
know her best sides showin
is what's gonna keep me comin back
then she can haul it
'tween a woman and fine machine
she's my honkin tonkin
patience and wonder then he sent down
but he must be the reason she dont fly away
there always questions in the heart of millionaires
and he said do you love me baby do you want me to hold
and he said hey babe we can live on love cuz love is worth much more
where i met a southern belle
we hit all the hotspots
and the nights we spent together
he was always handy with a song
i'll be your tennessee lamb
if you're gonna walk down on the mean street
it's just no use
'cause they cant take the truth from you
out lying on her own
she feels like leaving and
all your life you were
repeat chorus
with all of my heart i know i could love you
and i'm so afraid
i dont know how to save this time
driftin away
at night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from heavens eyes
yes i do think about you every now and then
i love my life and i'd never trade
every now and then
and we were still dancin along
so i went back to see her again
there was a bad boy in the school yard
you were face to face
but he forever changed your life
until the fear that you are runnin from is finally embraced
and with folded hands you truly start to pray
shining through the trees
lying on our backs and counting the stars
just to take you along
down by the river in the full moonlight
just moving slow
for the savior on high
he holds in his hands
will be fit for a king
he'll be homeless no more
will be fit for a king
ten miles out at sea
my prayers had finally come true
as my feet hit the ground
and i swear on of them
the last one to show
where the whiskey drowns
i'll just say goodnight
and the beer chases my blues away
i'll just say goodnight
he had spent his whole life fussin
and go out hollerin whoa
no i didnt want to do it
yeah i was kickin and screamin
since i've felt so out of place
little cafe table for four
look into her eyes and pray that she dont see
god this learning to live again is killing me
how i hate going out in the storm
'cause there's a girl at home who loves me
hey jukebox dont start playin that song again
let go of my hand
my angel from above
that i should touch you
lost in your wonderful ways
baby i have found
cuz what aint goin down
never did the things i though i would
things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
everywhere that mary went
and so the teacher turned it out
why does the lamb love mary so
yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations
hung up on all my doubt
our guardian star lost all its glow
then prove it by goin out on the sly
but you dont call
but you dont call
rain on the roof and time on my hands
when they dont know what else to do
imagine my surprise when she spoke my name
there must be a million fish out in that ocean
i'm mr right or mr right now
to sleep would be best but i just cant afford to rest
the competitions getting younger
my litte mexicali tomatilla
i used to be her number one vaquero
please please tell her that i need her
love is brighter than ever before
morning will find me by your side
some things can be good forever
a new way to fly
by the end of the night
above the clouds and the rain
a new way to fly
boy you must have gone crazy out there
and he's loosin his share
he said now
eu possuo a penas o que deus me deu
le o maior que voc pode encontrar 'viu'
you're the one who said i love you too
i remember you
i miss you darling
now i think it's time
so i dont want to learn to
that look in your eyes
made me cry
let me go
who just isnt willing to try
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
empty
in all of these years
for you it's a breeze
i should go back to being lonely and confused
to get those big bad carkeys
my dreams are in your bed
but if you'd only told me baby
we dont touch do we baby
i cant help thinking it's a miracle you're here
with a minimum of fuss
i knew just what i would do when i heard your song
loves me better than you
makes me feel this way nobody
and what we seek is no surprise
maybe luck is a lady
i never thought that my saviour would come
and your mom was always acting crazy
so now i walk in the midday sun
i think it's amazing
too afraid to love to hope that you would stay
even the light seemed to have changed
but you stayed forever amore
i'll be loving you always
did you know that true love asks for nothing
until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
did you know that life has given love a guarantee
until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
could be there for you
take the initiative
for trouble or fuss
dont let me waste away
once i built a tower to the sun
it was al all the time
brother can you spare a dime
jay gorney
the baby's crying and i cant sleep
go to sleep and dream again
and all its sad goodbyes
time can never mend
we'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
so wrong that you had to leave me alone
i dont say hi to those guys no more
johnny please please stop pretending
knock on your door
just 18 at the time
mama dont you let him stay
everyone's the same
wouldnt you say
when your heart's in someone else's plans
i know you think that you're safe
that you would stay
but i just cant take new york
life can be so hard
and it's just not fair
yesterday's newspapers
watch them do the crazyman dance
says 'i aint got time'
soon your hopes will rise aand then
in the moonshine
let's go outside
there's nothing more nothing more
let's go outside
there's nothing more nothing more
'cause that was the day that my daddy died
empty
empty
spent most of his time chasin women and drinkin
never heard nothing but bad things about him
that papa never worked aday in his life
stealin in the name of the lord
to tell me the truth
you want my family for your libertyi cant do that
children in his arms he turns his back
and most of us are not sure
when there is no hope to speak of
say what's mine is mine and not yours
so maybe we should all be praying for time
leave you alone
could have imagined
there's just never enough
so take that picture stop acting so dumb
i'd sit and wait for the phone to ring
the money honey or your life
you may want to sacrifice
there was dancing in the afternoons those days
and i remember my first day at school
the specials and the jam to the beat

'til you listen to your heart

to think you'd love me too

i'm just a slave to your heart
i loved you once so i dont know how

she takes his hand
his father's son
and in her heart the time has come
he's a soldier now forevermore
waiting for that change of season

life's so short move on
my baby dont care for shows
i wonder what's wrong with baby
my mother had a brother
mum i cant imagine the joy and pain in equal measure
i live each day for him
but mama will you tell him from your boy
i'm bad to the bone i'm just a little torn
and i dont believe they care
well you're out of time
i thought i needed you
you're out of time
will never disappear
dont leave me waiting here lead me to you door
nobody told me
inside my head
there's a thief upon my bed
so much time
nobody told me
inside my head
give me something to believe in
i was back in the old days long ago
when i look and find i still love you
'cause these are the days of our lives
i still love you
with sorrows to impart
big men feeling small
people sinning just for fun
since my soul conceived
though they do pretend
away from saddened eyes
unclean minds mislead the pure
far away from me
from my destiny
but i've had my say
and everything must change
what kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage
i hear the sound of a memory
save me from myself
will just let me go
i just want to go to sleep
to chase the rainbow that you're after
empty
i gotta get inside of you
hey you're just too funky for me
tonight my goals in sight yeah
would you like me to seduce you is that what you're trying to tell me
everybody wants a lover everybody wants a lover like that
my memory serves me far too well
but something i just cant explain
oh my memory serves me far too well
how my poor heart could have
come on back to your baby
george michael jagger richards
so they're not so strong
but you once said
she's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me
searching for this woman i love
she aint going anywhere under one love
i was in despair you see me till she found me there i will live
when you're awake
oh the tricks your mind can play
and laughed before
seem to be happening again
and wild is the wind
with your kiss my life begins
wild is the wind
clings to the tree
she thinks of when the boy was young
it's a cruel world
but i was terrified
it's a cruel world
lover dont love too much
so it's better to turn the page
i cant stop dont you know that i want you
take you home
it's so easy to forget myself where
that sparkle in your eyes has gone
i cant realise you ever cared
you're not the anges i once knew
4 minus 3 equals zero
cause i'll be nothing without your love
never was my cup of tea
to spend the night
looking into her eyes i'm thinking about future plans
but if i'm ever gonna mend this broken heart
you look like a real good place to start
life is a gamble a game we all play
no matter what you do
adalida pretty little cajun queen
smilin and a winkin i know what they're thinkin
all my ex's live in texas
and dimples who now lives in temple's
long before daylight
somewhere between the lines
i cant count the ways
am i blue
yes i'm blue
empty
they took my saddle in houston
amarillo by morning
amarillo by morning
no other has that touch ooh those fingertips
i'm back to bein me
these eyes that used to cry myself to sleep
before i was the one who fell in love
or how far away you may be
and there i'll be
though ive already more than my share
buy little lord jesus no crying he makes
she'd go away when the grass turned green
holds my baby blue tonight
empty
right here in each other's arms
a little routine i liked
something's always missing
the best one yet
my nights are sweeter
and that old cadillac
it hurt so to see her go
my good ol days are just a memory
repeat chorus
once again she's chasing memories and i'm losing everything
once again she's chasing memories and i'm losing everything
since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground
fightin was against the rules and it didnt matter why
when i became a father in the spring of '81
and they said
empty
but i lost that race
and i'm the only one she's shown her secret to
and she slips off her satin gown
repeat chorus
hey lord i thought i would cry
lord i'm nobody's sugar daddy now
to keep her satisfied
i thought that i was passin through
a watch a chain a cross of gold
i only know the way i feel
and on this plane back to tennessee
we found our body's lost in paradise
in marina del rey
you're still dancing with me
the passion begins
oh but meanwhile back in the back of my memory
but i can only say
and gifts that make you grin
i can tell my milk cow
cause you're gonna need me
dont that sun look good going down
gonna leave you alone
though i'll admit she sure know how to fill a pair of jeans
i never could have made it with anyone but you
teach the young ones how to wrastle
layin underneath my seat
watered down ''til it tastes like tea
give me the real thing
goins rough unlike the straight and narrow
and it all might come together
me i want to live my life and one day leave my mark
he was still on the dance floor like he didnt care
he left her lonely and the pickings were right
repeat chorus
and he's lying in a manger down the road
empty
i had a love and it was all mine
i hit my knees and told god how much i hurt
but that'll be so hard to do
i need your help this memory's so strong
as she cried
and i wonder why trains make me lonesome
those ink spots look engine no 9
what i'm feelin is the definition of devotion
this feelin just keeps gettin stronger as the time goes by
sure as a mountain river windin
take us where we want to go
that wont let go of me
that's running wild to night
she kicked me outta the house and tonight i'm whiskey bound
'cause that woman i had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
but i know their wrong
we must be lovin right
only an isolated incident
wont even think about a farewell kiss
now a year has rolled around this christmas once again
my mind goes back to what i did last night
mr havent you heard
with your heart broke and running from the reason
heart broke who kept me from leaving
george jr
where they still know wrong from right
sing a song about my life
sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
her good bye hit me in the heart
her good bye hit me in the heart
i can sure be a hard way to go
she has just one weakness i see
i've always said i do too easy
and i owe everybody in town
i guess i should've checked my price tag
just need some renovation and a lot of tlc
to make our dreams come true
we'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home
it just needs a little home improvement
i'll just take my home in san antone
for our little home in san antone
tonight i'll be honky tonk crazy
cause she's already drove me insane
and darkness helps me hide my shameful tears
she's the barmaid in the honky tonk downstairs
i played the jukebox i played some merle haggard
i've traveled through lots of places
to california
you're the very best girl there aint no doubt
but baby it's a shame 'cause i always feel the same
i cant see texas from here
empty
better baby your baby she'll baby you
'cause it's a short walk
your persuasion
dont make me come over there and love you
well the beat goes on there's a hardwood floor
we knew it from the start
to make all your dreams come true
so let's make each tomorrow
and left the tears behind
empty
it's not right but lefty's gone it dont seem like he was around that long
and if it ended today i've been all the way
just plain me just plain fine
and i dont dare look back on yesterday
we'll stop now while there's still the strength to see
i'd only lead you on and let you down
i gave it all i had every night for all these years
the only thing i have left is you
my legs wont let me go
but i'm talking about the next day
we always said
dont forget where it started
remember the man who asked for your hand
i think about holdin my baby tonight
every town is just another beat
those highway signs lord they keep me on the move
right or wrong i'll always love you
though i prayed that you'd be true
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin on for dear life
i'm drowning in your love a little more each day
i dont let her memory
i no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
i hope you caught it
leave dallas in the dust
dont let that speed limit slow you down
baby run
he sees you when your sleepin
rutty toot toots and rummy tum tum
you better not put i'm tellin you why
she knows when you're on my mind again
and her eyes are green
it come from deep in her soul
take up the slack
she lays it all on the line
and it seems to me that your dancin much too close to her
is givin you away
repeat chorus
she loves me she dont love you
wish them well
she's put the wind in his sails
wished him well
well you cant help but wonder
why you cant help but love her
ah she's gonna love you
youd pick me up and you'd kiss my hurt away
there must've been times you felt her way
down in louisiana bayous by and by
gypsy rains dang hurricanes
they come from miles around
i've fallen for you and that's a fact
what do you say to that
my heart knows this is real at last
just tell me that you're happy
just tell me you dont need me anymore
tell me when did you stop loving me
tell me when did you stop loving me
empty
grandpa's been chasin grandma around
and here's wishin you all a merry christmas
some people leave
i'll wait for you
whistle still blowin
where the sidewalk ends
i'm not afraid to go
thinking back to better days
which side of the glass
and there it is the cold hard truth
looking for the reason
oh i guess it all depends on
with every christmas card i write
but baby i'm burnin up
we could start a love to stand the test of time
livin like we were meant to be
why not now
in the lane snow is glistnin
we'll say no man but you can do the job
where the closest u haul place is
without me around
she'll be better off in the long run
just a what she wanted me to do
with every woman in town but me
it's the only place in days you havent been
here's some final words from me
i'll sign it at the bottom of this page
you can find a chisel i can find a stone
she said i knew this was comin and i'm sorry
i've done everything that i know of
you can lead a heart to love
the laughter is gone
got it all straight in my head
said come and get it
of the things that i need to forget
must be somethin i missed
of the things that i need to forget
you know me better than that
now it's ballet and symphony hall
and oh how you shine
you look so good in love
why i couldnt see
i thought i was toughbut goodbye is too much
oh why'd you call it quitsit'll take some time
i'm finding i'm falling as the music plays on
you're dancing this dance all wrong
i died inside
now my beating heart keeps telling me
evry man has a dream and you made mine come true
darlinyou're stronger than me
and i still fall apart when you speak or we meet
if you see me light on my feet feeling good inside
empty
'cause i cant miss the bad luck that's fallin from the sky
and that's how i met a friend of yours today
and i love you though we've never met
we'll help each other start all over
so take me seriously
i wasnt playing around
i wasnt fooling around
so i'd just as soon go
but stayin just to see us through
and i'd just as soon stop
if i know you you're probably wondering what to do
and i'll come running back to you
empty
dont even look back
it's gonna hurt
if it's gonna rain i hope it pours
instead of walkin down lovers lane
and ya get help from the government
or your lifes lackin
if you can anything else
if you dont mind the rain
dont worry 'bout me i'm gonna be alright
if you can anything else
of a woman with someone else on her mind
no more late nights
empty
go on and do what your heart tells you to
this is the night we've been waiting for
show me the warmth of your soft caress
you dont dress up in satin
but you're as sweet as you can be
aint it a pain in your heart
empty
i cant step aside and let you
she'd leave so easily
wondering if she'll come back
she'd make her threats
i'm back to bein me
for the first time in a long time i like seeing what i see
the who i was before i was your used to be
a heartache drowns as the whiskey pours
i hear tell there's people out there who dont know
empty
but this time the feelin is strange and different
and i'll be the first to proudly shake his hand
and i fell in love again for my last time
i guess she caught her train and that's a crime
then out of the blue clear sky
aint love a funny thing
out of the blue clear sky
i know i've been away too long
but it's alright baby
she said dont bother comin home
with a cowboy like him it could be anything
baby i'm long gone
carried away
it's my strength for holding on
west virginia down to tennessee
i'm carrying your love with me
will blow like a cold winter squall
i've shivered all day and when i look in her eyes
empty
c'mon along and we'll go down
i'll take you honky tonkin in my old pick up truck
it's dance time in texas where the wine and music flows
i'll lose my pride i'd even step aside
do the right thing baby do the right thing
does fort worth ever cross your mind
does fort worth ever cross your mind
there's ashes on the ground
cuz tonight she's out somewhere to burn one down
another honky tonk down
is more than mere words can describe
i dont know just what it is
in these arms of mine i know you will find
is it worth the thrill you feel
and putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
repeat chorus
but my heart wont let me love no one but you
fix what went wrong
she cried when i left her now i try to forget her
how much i wish she was still around
empty
now if you'll buy that
oh me oh my sweet baby said goodbye
oh me oh my sweet baby said goodbye
let's take our love one night at a time
i've got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on
all night love all night practice makes perfect gonna get it right
if i didnt have one of you
one dream i'm dreaming of
she'll walk away one step at a time
she'd still be by my side
lady i know your out there somewhere
but there's a million to many good reasons
and i'll always come though
and the wild wild west
so i'll handle it with care
come snow rain sleet or hail
because i know what i've lost and all he's gained
but you keep saying you cant take another heartache
i got eyes i can see
you trembling body tells on you
well i'm down at the bar out of my mind
that jukebox cries the blues like it knows what i'm about
and think about you san francisco now and then
true love waits down louisiana way
empty
i think it's best we put it all behind
you aint never fell as far as when you fall in love
it aint easy losing love although it's turned out bad
every time my ship comes in
'cause that's more than this poor boy makes
i went to use the telephone at the grocery store
well every time it rains lord dont it pour
you wont break my heart and i dont love you
you wont break my heart and i dont love you
15 years of heaven
my tears tell her i'm sorry
from out on a mountain
the same old stool
here every night so it can fool him more
and then he turns her memory on
so for christ sake let everyone know
watching dallas on tv
and i'm no cheater
i've got that friday night fever
but the children know how he came to life one day
down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
mark nesler martin
you know how you said happiness cant be found lookin back
just go on
sure makes it hard to forget
like a stranger i aint never met
back down lonely street to a house that's steep with nothing but a line of
it aint suave or debonair
it took a while for them to sell me
it's too late now
to say you'd made a big mistake
about these tears in my eyes
i guess i should thank my unlucky stars
there wont be no more next time doing me wrong
empty
empty
i've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin my honey
lord i love that child love to see her smile
but these circumstances aint funny
we think weve got a secret but it always shows
one look at you
the truth was so plain to see
and just look at me
that's what they intended dancing for an i just wanna dance with you
i just wanna dance with you
and i bought her a home with a view
i thought i was king of the mountain
i dont even know if it's rainin
all i can say is i'm sorry
voices on the wind
its the last time the first time for me
ive been a fool for the last time
on the richter scale of a romance
she's out of sight
it's never over 'til it's really over
and the next hill is the hardest to climb
ringin your doorbell thinkin about love
that's me with a capital m
that's me ten times ten
just what i needed
that's the breaks
but one way or another i'll come through
the way the cookie crumbles
that's a lie and that's the truth
that's a lie and that's the truth
that's where i wanna take our live and settle down
'for they go off to town
i'm falling in love
but i've never felt this feeling
yeah it's usually packed here on friday nights
yeah i like this song too it reminds me of you and me
now i just found a game that i cant play
this is where the cowboy rides away
the love i cant unlearn
you'll always be a fire i cant put out
the dream you left behind
makin my rounds all over town
i'm the fireman that's my name
when they get too hot they just give me a call
and he has quite a few of them
he recalls how his heart got broken
and how it's still that way
dont always wear the white hat
you can hold onto
as often as they should
where i am and where i've been
on top of a mountain so tall
that i'm out here in the middle of nowhere
i'm glad he had the nerve
and i'm glad he had the nerve while staring into space
and i'm glad i had the nerve to talk to you that day
you may find me broke down by the highway
still in all i'd rather live forever
twenty nine you'd think i'd know better
through good and bad and straight through indifference
robin wilson
i couldnt see i was lost at the time
so i went looking for an exit sign
there's someone else she thinks about
repeating as if it matters
there's nothing that i could want
they say you cant miss something you've never had
why i could feel so bad
well she was tall hair dark as midnight
she had a way just like you do
fast asleep now i'm going blind
that no one else helps me grow
and i'm only getting worse
pretending all the while
i should've been a whole lot farther
i'm never going back to college
for just one good day job
from the other side of this room
i've nothing to show me now and it seems like so long
anywhere you go i'll follow you down
anywhere you go i'll follow you down
sad enough to make you cry
rumors follow everywhere you go
you know it's all i think about
everyone should know
i think i love that girl
my hands are tied
i'm cant seem to stop at all
you can see i'm in no shape for driving
and you can trust me not to think
the past is gone but something might be found
what i could never believe in
and then i got lost i got lost i got lost i got lost
when the doors swing open and all the drinks are passed around
or if you're at the tail end of the evening
and know that i'd just be staring at the ceiling going round
i cant live without it
i aint in no big hurry
but i've been filled with worries
and i wonder where the hell i am
while the world is coming crashing in
i lie awake half the night
all the bugs would crawl in my sleep
this car i'm driving cant drive me fast enough
monday morning takes me back to where i have to be
i bought her films yeah i bought all her magazines
the last horizons i can see are filled with bars and factories
with words we build and words we break
i seen the sun come up
you know that this small world
take cover scotty
her response is getting stronger
with my books and with my tapes
get in the car and drive through town
read my palm and tell me
it seems i do my best by accident
every turn i take is comforting
streetlights on the night air's cool
in a day then i'll be leaving
in the shade below the eaves
she sees all the cars around the parking lots of bars we've played and stayed
in a day then i'll be leaving
fools rush in
we're bankrupt here for now
missed pull out ramps
what the hell did you expect to find
when the music is that loud
only pieces of the night
every sou katie blew
so it's root root root for the home team
cagey casey knew what to do
oh that was how i met
with that slave dealer's daughter
she could be anywhere at all
i want to wake up next to her
i didnt ask
who gets what they say
still thinking about not living without it
i dont know all the answers
it's real to me but not like these fools
i dont know what to do anymore
slow down virginia
dont make me wait
bill leen robin wilson
c'mon sweet amnesia
these suspicions have been long drained dry
when it comes down
i know you think i'm like the others before
i tried my imagination but i was disturbed
i got it
867 5309 867 5309
a thousand words were spoken
want you to know i'm just like you
when the world gets in your way
nothing's changing anyway
empty
now i feel unknown
hey you never made it
someday you never made it
and i wont take long to burn
you drown in deeper oceans
but your eyes look away
started thinking 'bout the things we used to do when we were young
i'm already there and i'm ready there
cuz that's a sad excuse
empty
miracles gone wrong
that miracle's gone wrong
empty
another second time around i've been runnin from ya
and i know you're lyin cryin in your bed
i dont need to apologize
thinking 'bout all the things we found
walking over the same ole ground
beat me jenny
shanamama i aint beaten now
beat me jenny dont you know
but you cant be
yeah you have become
let me remind you
you're here with me
until we leave this behind
until we leave this behind
until we leave this behind
and i try to make this kind and clear
and something only you can give
and somehow stop this fight
now your world is way too fast
god it's good to be alive
what you fear is your desire
empty
little boy blue was a tootin his horn now
i hear you screaming but you cant be found
and if the accidents will well we'll both fade away
for sixteen years she's been hangin around
i feel a lotta water drippin on my head
i cant control my instincts when i hear her say
and wonder where you are
dont supposed i'll ever know
oh may
what you feel is what you are
yeah slide
empty
empty
every time i see you
and i feel it
those things that you cant grow
you're tearing it down yeah you're bringing it down
and i know
something i dont know
oh so long
oh so long
so long
you look outside there's snow
you look outside there's snow
one day aint forever
oh yes i know that somethin bad has gotta change
and it's not like me to feel so important
now i'm feelin all alone
i was drinkin all alone
cant understand it anyhow oh
if you run with me
but you turn me toward the light
i taste you sweet and warm
take my hand now
i'm just like you
i've given up on you
cuz it aint enough
fade out
i saw you cleanin up
strange love
i've got no politics no influential friend or two
string of lies it's always compromise with you
it's getting near dawn
the light shining through on you
be with me my love
stranger than your sympathy
everything's all wrong yeah
all i wanted
and i was in love with things i tried to make you believe i was
i fell on my face for you now i know what it means
i run from the darkness now i aint got no place to go
there you are
you take it so slowly
the guy you never knew is what you fear
oh you
oh yeah
only to discover you had gone astray
torn apart
yeah you're caught in the rules of the world
living in the silence that beats through the mind
can you teach me to believe in something
you know all i am
mama just called
making me remember when your pushes became shoves
i'll get along anyway at all
tucked away
you say you got no faith in things that you cant see
so i said something i cant touch i always want way too much
with you no more
sorry eyed we spent so much of your time
now i'm tryin to put your riddle to a rhyme
up yours
i got mine
that's too bad
the lights are too bright
wait for the night
the lights are too bright
that you wont find in the day
it's a beautiful sight i guess everybody's right
it's a beautiful life and i've got it in my sights
we live and we die
with no reason why
you know it choked away the sun
when you're gone
and we'll be heard again
all tastes sweet but it's not for long
and how does it feel when you're out on your own
and now you think you found something real
what a scene
innocence looks good on you
why does it always feel so wrong
when we're alone we'll find some peace
why do we need to turn it on
why does it always seem so wrong
without you here
i never had this planned
that we deceive
but since then i been back down to the end
you know what i mean
you know what i mean
you know what i mean
empty
formed my aching heart to break it
that aint easy
no one spoke but we both listened
but my nights seem longer still and my tv's off the air
down on the corner
willie and the poor boys are playin
you dont need a penny just to hang around
i dont care i dont care i dont care
nothin but a problem nothin but a problem
tragedy sets you free but
i should have known that it was
just another sequel
i wanna kick it all down
send me some more when it all got burned
never ever ever
eyes wide open what you mean
cuz all i ever wanted's so far gone
and if i had my chance i'd go along
can you catch me darling oh no
in midnight conversations
but you push me away
but you move through my soul like a hurricane wind
and if we feel the silence
how do we hold on
just look at all the washed out hippie dreams
a visionary coward says that anger can be power
show it all to me
guided by the blinding white
wednesday's bad but friday's aint much better
why cant the moon stay full forever
it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
i think i like it better now
and i dont even know what to say so i'm thinking out loud
and when you dream seventeen
she's the girl right next to me
so give a little bit
yea you gotta want to
cause i need to feel at home
you crushed my heart and i really lost my will
you broke my heart and i really lost my will
but you'll see it for the first time in your life
then wish that you were dead
oh you know it well
who knows where you been
what are we doin
you know i'm lost
nothin you dont know
hold on dreamaway
i'm feeling drunk yes i am juiced up 'n sloppy
it's a bitch
yeah when you lay me out
baby take my hand dont fear the reaper
come on baby dont fear the reaper
i'm not the one who broke you
somehow here is gone
and i want to get free
and i want to get free
i know it's out there

there's no way out
when you feel foreign to love

when you feel foreign to love
and i never got serious
he said you gotta die facing up in the world
on the lie
it's all been a stinkin lie
i'm on your side
oh no
with a smile and a sigh
we dont see eye to eye
on your side
must've been a victim of my peers
anti hero idol with a suicide excuse
because the past is a bully and the future's even worse
you're the same
loud rockin noise
you're out of mind
you're out of mind
i aint got the patience or the time to waste
if you'd lay me to die and try to learn what you dont know
on the road to salinas
by rolling stones jagger
it's it's so very lonely you're a hundred light years from home
energy here in every metal heart
what you get is what you need
backstreet suckers
empty
close your eyes and just
a smell of sulphur lays over me
i must leave this state of terror
you're gonna die like the other men
guitar solo

we keep until we are dead
the one we adore
writing tales of pain
but masters of the fight
highlanders' victory
my king won another crown for scotland's pride
you gain a crown we pay the price
die in pain and anger
but history is mercyless
a journey which will lead us to the legendary world of the knights of the cross
i see a dolphin cry
night is cold and black what is it that we are fighting for
storming the brain storming the brain

1000 hours
a kiss we'll share
the length i've gone are just long miles

i sit alone in my bedroom
cause she's 2000 light years away
she holds my malakite so tight so
dream about her
your screams and cries are never going to work
i sit in the state of a daydream
and why i could not seem to get along
could not seem
my mental stability reaches its bitter end
so i loose my head or i bang it up against the wall
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
but you turn your head and i end up talking to myself
there's no return from 86
there's no return from 86
all by myself
repeat several times
and i dont know where the heck it'll go
promises promises it was all set in stone cross my heart and hope to die
dont want a nation under the new mania
i'm not a part of a redneck agenda
one nation controlled by the media
i wonder if he knows i think he's crazy
when the old man was in school
six feet underground

are we we are are we we are the waiting
and screaming
never trusted anyone
on being a pessimist

grasping to control

cold turkey's getting stale tonight i'm eating crow
withe my conscienece beating
when you lost all hope and excuses
so i run to the edge
when you lost all hope and excuses
to a hymn called faith and misery hey
a gag a plastic bag on a monument
who criticize your government
this is our lives on holiday
there's no signs of hope
in the crowd of pain st jimmy comes without any shame
does anyone care if nobody cares
and she had enough
is there a possibility
'cause no one's here
where'd you go
i got a rock and roll house
off of my case
the world is spinning
we're coming home again
we're coming home again
we're coming home again
but i dont want you to go on needing me this way
from the beginning we both knew it wouldnt last
originally by bobby fuller
i fought the law and the law won
well she's the best girl that i ever had
i wanna be alone
that's all
i dont want you to understand
i wanna be alone
this conflict is my own
started out in 54
then the world will be all mine
but each one is a memory i
at times i feel overwhelmed
i want to make it last
but i dont let it get me down
all brawn and no brains
if you come around
i hope i wont be there in the end
i'm not the one that's going to die
but no one understands your verity
but no one understands your verity
it's leaving me behind to rank
hooray we're gonna die
evolution killed it all
and so i give
your watching me
i'm the son of rage and love
that dont believe in me
that dont believe in me
it's beating out of time
and so it seemed to confess
lost children with dirty faces today
hearts recycled but never saved
and i dont care
for lack of a better word and that's my best excuse
so i run
when there aint nowhere you can go
read me my rights and tell me i'm wrong
or earth with me tangled at your feet
he never ever learned to read or write so well
people passing by would stop and say
maybe someday his name would be in lights
eerie colors and all i see are sounds
a missing peice
eerie colors and all i see are sounds
every day and night
if you'll come back
i feel my mind is going insane
this time i've really lost my mind and i dont care
and all the shoot you put me through
and mow down any bullshit that comfronts you
king for a day in a leather thong
everything you know
push me around
everybody try to put me
shoplifter you're getting burned
shoplifter you'll never learn
shoplifter you're getting burned
and every night i'm thinking
'cause you are the one that i want
ready for a cheap escape
there's a plague inside of me

angelangel dancing away
it troubles my brain
and i'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
and all the things i've found
i think at times it even turns to greed
it's calling my name
we feel the same pain
we feel the same pain
and drips toxic blood
and drips toxic blood
no obligationjust
wasting your time
so why are you alone
now it seems i've forgotten my purpose in this life
leaving a lump down in my throat
but you're still the same
hear you are come around again
it's the same thing again and again
to smash the silence with the brick of self control
walking up this time
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
of destruction
is she the mother of all bombs
that i just cant define
of destruction
empty
dont have no time for love
dont wanna fall in love
keep dreaming of her
i'll need you forever more
the means of pain thats in my heart
oh i love her
the means of pain thats in my heart
what have you done with all your time
it wasnt long ago
and i wanna go home
ever tell you that you werent right
and she cant seem to get away
to anyone willing to buy
some days he feels like dying
he's casualty dressed to the teeth
but she looks like hell to me
you the crew
at the speed of light
it's your favorite son
it's your favorite son
to a millionaire
this time i'm on to you
stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
my belly's aching now to say
i'm taking pleasure in the doubts
i made my decision
and i'm picking scabs off my face
that's all that i've got
dont know what i want
and everything will be alright
give me a long kiss goodnight
so give me novacaine
i throw away my past mistakes
here we go again infatuation
thinking of your ways of effection
but i'll take whatever you can
you and i together hand and hand
i hope you had the time of your life
he's on your side
he's at it again
let the government decide what's left
i'll be back
i'll be back
a small cloud has fallen
laying in my bed
laying in my bed
how did you get your noose so tight
like chewing on tinfoil once again
ha ha ha
ha ha you're dead
a cheap hat and cigarettes and a peculiar name
it's so unfair
some say i'm disturbed
i walk a lonely road
i walk alone
on the border line
my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
where the city sleeps
no rest for crosstops in my mind
a crooked spine
mom and dad dont look so hot these days
and i'm going nowhere fast
and i know i darn well should
'cause i'm getting bored
to drive along these shoot town lights
heckwho needs them anyway
war that's my mind
castaway going at it alone
and i'm taking back what's mine
lost and found trouble bound
give me something to do to kill some time
slapped my brains up so high
that makes me feel complete
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesnt make much sense
making your mascara bleed
i'll ever hear from you
skeletons come to life in my closet
and the cat's caught in the dryer
deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay
you're living on a landmine
but at least you're not alone
your faith lies in the ditch that
but at least you're not alone
deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay
my head is like a sponge
bring me blood and pain
on the information highway
another fatal wreck
dont say my thoughts are not for real
i see her and she's with him
my whereabouts are now unknown
well now you're stuck with me
well now you're stuck with me
i want to be the one that takes the pain
cant wait to be punished for my sins
i know that things are getting tougher
boy better make up your mind
having fun
so strike the fucking match to light this fuse
there's nothing left to analyze
this city's burnin
nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese
swallow it on down or spit it in a cup
i'm sick of all the same old shoot
barred indoors from the summer street
smoking my inspiration
i'm going blind
stuffed in a coffin 10 more free
to tell the difference between
what's the consolation prize
the one i've never known
burning the flag at half mast
where did you go
i pledge allegiance to the underworld
down with the moral majority
for crying out loud she screamed unto me
it started when she run away
the fire burns from better days
gina hit the road to new york city
the catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
i said i dont know
i hope i die before i get old
talkin bout my generation
talkin bout my generation
pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me i'm insane
you kill your memory
cause no one knows
cause no one knows
i dont know
or you're gonna choke on it
or a bullet in my face
before your chance to stand up and fight
i got no pride
kick me in the ass
but tomorrow
juliet's trying to find out what she wants but she dont know
i know i am crazy and a bit lazy
cause' i'm losing what's left of my dignity
well i think you're disposeable
only know as much as i know
well its just its just one of my lies
i know that we're worlds apart
i know that we're only friends
until the clouds unroll and you come down
the saints are coming the saints are coming
the saints are coming the saints are coming
begging for another fix
on display to rot up on the hill
one more night
but having the time of his life
burning daylight
do what you like
what can i do
do what you like but please dont keep me waitin
the looks are always so deceiving
too late and now it sucks to be you too
too much too soon
ohoh oh oh oh
i woke up on the wrong side of the floor
uptight i'm a nag with a gun
on me like a diamond
ready or not at all
i'm destined for anything at all
the innocent can never last
but never forgets what i lost
drenched in my pain again
wake me up when september ends
sometimes i still feel i'm walking alone
my wallet's fat and so is my head
i'm a vicitm of a catch 22
my wallet's fat and so is my head
and i aint got no right
say warning live without warning
warning live without warning
sanitation expiration date question everything
time after time

i consider it a challenge before the whole human race
this sudden fear has left me trembling
it makes me wonder why i'm still here

taking off
and she determined
that punched her one too many times
i remember the face but i cant recall the name
remember whatever
go go go go

you wonder if it's right or wrong
why do you want him

i cant avoid the lightning
but now it's gone and i take the blame
tell me the words i might have said
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
a knocked down dragged out fight
your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head
when the story is stretched and so far fetched
with your complaints

and i'll never have again
in just one day

and you know it's my only
empty
no one i love is there
but anybody
people will like me there
empty
somewhere in time
restless spirits out on the run
breaking the seal
break the silence or take the fall
with our sisters and daughters
our sun is set our day is done i'm left here wondering
future full of hope nothing could stand in our way
but after darkness comes the light
my little one you are
to break these chains and fly
for you it's all the same
let's fly away through the rain
with gold in our hands
oh here they come riders of the sun
but they will fight
i'm so geard unto them i serve unto their souls
rigging to the cross as holy as a whore
inside the fire we are the
let our voices be there to guide you
follow the signs of the crimson thunder
a man on a mission was left at fates hand
but fight without honor and you're destined to fall
but fight without soul and you will loose it all
but fight without soul and you will loose it all
surrender this night or choose my way
you enter the gates and there's nothing left to fear
come with me i'll take you there to the land of make believe
senses dull
will surely melt and die
i was the brooding night
to fallen heroes angels sing they cry their winter tears
even though it's hard to understand
my eyes are closed i feel you're faraway so close
empty
spread your wings and you will fly away now fly away
you call out my name but your voice is fading
far beyond that shining star
deep in our hearts you will live again
but none of your deeds were in vain
nothing on earth stays forever
so i say farewell my friends i hope we'll meet again
colours fading turning into white again
every solemn moment i will treasure inside
you're gone to the home of the brave
spread your wings and you will fly away now fly away
show your strength let's hail the metal gods
all for one our burning hearts will live forever
tormented we still heard the call
burning burning with desire
the freedom call is drawing near
hearts on fire hearts on fire
the hammer will slowly arise
angels of mercy our journey must proceed
brothers unite let's stand up and fight
all our beliefs fading into ashes
there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide
my mission i set let it be done
i believe in everything i see every
shine on wont you shine for me
but everyone says different things
people tell me a and b
i want out leave me be
i want out to do things on my own
our courage will unite
in our hearts eternally we keep the flame
flame burning
on wings of glory we will carry on
in the toil of the battle
and there is nothing left to fear
you fear the dead of night
it's getting far to late my friend
do you remember how we used to say
turning diamonds into rust
your deepest fears begin to loom
you're running out of time the higher that you climb
to absence of season and time
immortal riders protectors of the earth
from the ruins of hell we shall rise
to absence of season and time
immortal riders protectors of the earth
from the ruins of hell we shall rise
fog's rising out in the fields
the autumn wind blowing
lost and never found
can you tell me why
maybe one day i'll return again
until the end of time
oh oh oh dont you step aside
oh oh oh dont you step aside
by the radiant moon he will strike
when the prowler sneaks up from behind
horse made of steel
this time the prowler will win
riders of the storm one with the wind defenders of creation
let us choose our own destiny
we had the red cross sown on
jerusalem was freed we thanked the lord for our glory
steel meets steel
the quest of the war forever sung
crimson thunder running through their veins
by divine intervention
brothers in arms are fighting tonight
a handful of brave men appeared
behind the defenders the king marches on
knowing were the power will lead
this magic of metal unites us it's making us strong
this magic of metal unites us it's making us strong
heavy metal troops on the rise
trying to live by your own goals
blaze for the ones who stands strong
all join forces with all the powers that you feel
condemned auto da f
behold the freedom cries
oh oh oh
shadows are falling again
he became the saviour that fought for her life
bringing us forward defeating the pain
when the dragon lies bleeding
i see there's a stranger among us
silently whispering my name
still holding on to the dreams torn apart
oh i thought you were there
in the twilight zone the shadows mourn
i'm falling into the breach
the time has come it must be done
out of the night came the shining
i'm a stranger in this land i'm falling
let the power be unchained
the metal age
standing strong the brave and the elder
by the force within let the war begin
all your wisdom made me seek the truth that lied
when you rolled the dice
our time has come get ready fight
walking the way of the warrior
this is the way we want it to be
surrender your soul to the gods of steel
walking the way of the warrior
the midst of the fiery rain
fierce almighty legions one by one
sending them back to their grave
the mark of the shadows still burns
nothing's stronger than
brothers in arms are fighting tonight
born in the fire they look to the sky
into the dungeons they must go
the enemies will renounce or die
there was a boy he was nine
would you feel all alone
when you stab us do we not die
you dont know what they would do
oooooh you've got to break it down
out of the corner of my eye she said why dont you come and give it a try

scenarios to add to your hypocrisy

a chapter of life which has missing pages
cause i believe it's more
an unholy man
a million to one you'll be falling
here i stand all alone
i really hate to pay this toll
with my heart with my soul
thank to you my dear old friend
trustin in my confidence
empty
you are here
or keep your future jeopardized
i keep wondering all these days
and make me feel so high
so whats accomplished crying for nothing
take the book of god you will find your relations
cold hearted earth
but you will be few getting
cold hearted earth
cold hearted earth
and so i'm standing here
turned into vultures bewildered eyes
and i have no words to say
rise and see rise and be for me
rise and see rise and be for me
and prays for forgiveness
carnal truth against out beliefs
who finds the road to redemption
once we may ask for forgiveness
deliver us
but we dont know the score
the seed is sown
'cause we will still be alive
build up things they call protective
follow the sign
in the sky a migthy eagle
black you stripped me
they dont understand my last testament
in vain i scream against the wind
what you have done to me
how could you hide
someone to believe
a little thing you sure will know
let's get it up
where we'll suspend another night
to push this right in the face everyday
tell me will we remember
when salvation comes our way
you may find paradise
too late to call for the priest
insanity commes from below
prepare to take us all
save us from the gods of death
brick by brick you really love that game
angel of my night
so many stories have been told
let's just try
but in the recent dead of nights
daddy told her not to speak
silent giants
no tear to shed
sing your feelings
now i'm crying
i shatted on the ground
down in no mans land
take me home
that is the fever where's my home
dont you depend on someone else
should live your life
time will come
one way ticket there is no returning
take a spin on the dark ride
jump out of this game
i force the engine of your deadly sins
today would be a good day to die
sun is going down
in a blink of an eye
if this is the end
for the lonely hearted
sun is going down
on the departed
i am the one who wants to show
when the world was young
there's the destiny you dont know
sightless the one who relys on promise
shout shoutthe madness of the crowds hail insane
i hear your silent cries
i know your secret lies
but i'm always there in the shadows
the shade in the shadows of you
an age is over fast
wash and dry his tears
time to face what we all believe in
now his brain is dazed
time to face what we all believe in
mans growing blind
all world is darkling wake up the mountain
though i cannot change the worlg we're living in
one more to count in wake up the mountain
higher much higher
on yearning mind
set me on fire
the hollow souls wait
out in the blackness
shield my soul in the fight
i never look higher
he would stay like before
you'd all turn your back
from where the rain grows
doineverything you deamed as highest crime
how could you fail
in these lonely days
when i hold the key to open my mind
there's just one way i see
but if you cant see the life around
you you cannot hide
feelings come and go i've never known
the mightiness of trees that you can feel
been and will be
here is a mankind
there's no tear for anything
all that makes you gain
anything but you
roaring thunder lift your hands and pray
time has come for them to rise invasion is their doom
i woke up in the midnight sun
spent more time in the midnight sun
my age you cannot me certain
i swim in my reflection
no my life is beautiful
to a ground
i dont wanna feel you around me
someone will break your neck
if you know all the people
no more manipulations
said the sign above the entrance
then just pick up your phone
to the housewives in spain
he's been banned in twenty countries
mr torture
one dressed to kill
we were so deceived yeah
mrs god cant you see
music is iike a rising sun
it's joyful like a trip in a time machine
makes you fall down again
satan has taken
there is a chance for everyone
my life for one more day
stone by stone
and so will save mankind
trust and believe
my life for one more day
'cos there are so many ways you can go
fate will always turn out well
and the tracks to your aims are laid
dont forget you're something else
you'll never find what you left behind
occasion avenue
will there be a future time beats in our hearts
for a tiny slight deception
by abusing mother nature
marriage imposture and order
or will there be the fire branding you this mark
follow the path that shines for you
you've lost someone for now and forever
drone pleasure drone
and wherever there's bad vibes
i'm gonna make you a perfect day
and when i had it in my hands
you are where we have been
we are divine
shut down and see how beautiful life can be
it't getting sticker frame by frame
is just a tale in a storybook
empty
power and prosperity
whatever we awaited
bemoan your hate
overcome creation
again for a revolution
a lot more sane
that their children wear lies
they made us their slaves
i secretly dream
the only thing is
and the boy will awake
we dont find what's hidden in
and the story now goes on and on and on
you think you're awake the night was long
remember the words and you'll be free
lost and blind for eternity
but watch out beware
someone's sitting in a field
in the streets on halloween
magic in the air on halloween
where am i now
i am the one doom 's in my hands
deliverance and peace of mind
ah it's halloweentonight
forever the faith will live on in our hearts
red hot
heavy metal cant be beaten by any dynasty
do you know what to choose
odd of even
life is striking as you taugth
time is running time is short
no matter if ypu're black or white
if any man is free on earth
how many hearts are torn apart
but before the world
make me feel your presence in the night
there'll be no reason to live without you giving me light
give me your hand until the end and i will waik into promised land
feed well your desire
i dont wanna get drowned
i dont wanna lose
i can i can i can
im your redeemer
you are the object of my rage
now you are rust inside my cage
we are pushed in little forms
i want out leave me be
shut your mouth and take it home
i want out to live my life alone
once more once more
in solitude i stand
if i could fly
if i could fly
could it be we found it again
together someday somehow
but if one day
you got so much power lnside
i'm alive i'm alive
thunder flash and lightening is working on my back
and all that's not new
so you will follow me
stars that shine on bright
tonight we are stars
tonight we are stars
anithing we have is those hungry nights
i cant get any closer to your heart
together we're still so far apart
i cant get any closer to your heart
a puppet on a string for a 1000 years
i know your secrets
brother believe me
i will show i will show
a power no one will withstand
no believers all deceivers no illusion executions
we are the king for a 1000 years
solo both sascha weiki
we shove or retard
we are king for a 1000 years
all you have said is still in my ears
before we're sanctified
i know hat preide's before the fall
like from a distant age
1000 times blind see me fallin see me lose my mind
i open my eyes i cant see myself
slammin that womans head against the fridgerator door
and they're all out there armed with their baseball bats and brooms
a little while later the cops come
wall beatin that woman to an inch of her life
you reached out
the anger inside
anything not to deal with them
looking back you can see all you've got is yourself
you never were
i'm sitting alone beside me
in my mind you're always there always smiling
to get through to you
you took their simple affection
i see them lined up like broken heroes
your cruelty
when you see the one that laughs at you it's me
you're so young but you look so old
look deep into the monkey's eyes as he comes to you smiling
are you ready to rock
are you ready to tear it down
are you ready to
and then you want to die
and say come on in
so i know i'm not alone
you're always shining
i like you but i dont like you
i like you but you dont like me
i remain burned beyond recognition
i want it all
win lose or draw
there's a fact you gotta face
i want it all
you're so civilized
then why the hell do you act like one
just me and you that's all
i can sweet talk you mamma make you want to cry
as i self serve my diffracted mind
pushed and pulled our minds will rip in two
how much i bleed
dont like to think too much it makes me think too much
empty
backed by the rumours and the figures and the stats
i wanna disconnect myself pull my brains damn out unplug myself
the hatred's real
oh they'd kill to have me

and i cant get away i cant get away
i'm dead as i look to your eyes
i cant get close i cant get close i cant i cant get it
i try not to let it get above me
passing trains below
and the people and the noise make it worse
unknown to myself
i feel like this pass me through me pass me through me
feeling like the only one talking on the telephone line
i'm being followed around again around and around again
i'm being followed around again around and around again
like a fool i'll believe it all

i'm that hard man
hard sense makes sense
seeing fear in their eyes
bars on the windows locks on the door
i just wanted to kick
my dreams they all die
i am the rough that corrodes my will
as the years go by i cant deny the flame that burns inside me
and you want to slow down but i just have to fly
hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
when they tell me that i better
same old talk is dragging round and round
brain like halo
i wanna go
because they always find some meaning in it anyway
paying the price of fame
i need you here
i am the product of your restraint
what the hell did you expect
in darkness
and in need of human contact

hot scream and repeat
empty
empty
so unreal
then it's us then it's you
so obscene
on my way to the cage

i've got your world inside my fist
on my way to the cage
bring in the dog
what's he saying
dog's a best friend's dog
go get a life and ease the pain
how can i be sure
and i cant operate on this failure
there is no why no need to try
we play little boys and girls
to walk on tiptoes everyday
never forgotten never let it disappear
advice for the young at heart
when there's something behind you that just doesnt fit
and i cant stop thinking
of the ancient plague
no no i just cant stop thinking
sordid details following
i'll stay clean tonight
i wanna come down right now
you'd better not mess with major tom
but as least the seeds of love will be sown
hope for a badman
in my head
when the stories are tall as the day is long
is bloodletting go
life mama says
pain will come and pain will go
sun dont shine and the grass dont grow
in the world of sound
so these are my schemes
they make no mention of the beauty of decay
play to the crowd
break it down again
take me to the jamboree deep down
call me guilty i swear i'm a man who can fly deep down
we are broken
oh is she wild
oh slip and slide
with all the groundswellers
when it's all too late
became a point of view
it's all too late
looking at ghosts of you
here we go boys and girls
yeah it's you
uhh hey
brother she was wrong
you can see the world like a buddha bread and buddha
will bite the hand that feeds when it dont meet your needs
stone cold
people came and broke the law
people came and broke the law
i must learn to protect myself
i must learn to protect myself
ride the waves and stem the flood
boy he was a lucky man
if you're seeking power here's power
we'll sacrifice the virgin white
they hide under tables like a child
thieves in the temple
oh so many reasons why
raoul raoul raoul and the kings of spain
to turn this loss into a gain
making it plain making it sane
schrodinger's cat is dead to the world
i always knew you were a scientist at heart
joking apart when you're drunk you're terrific
so until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
and we can keep it unfurled
you and i have a secret world
and pay no attention to the cradle or the grave
i wont keep secrets alive
i wont keep secrets alive
time and time again
empty
they really really ought to know
empty
is a dangerous game
but a hard act to follow
in spite of the darkness
we tore them apart
sketches of pain
are you that butterfly
to spite my face
to save you from worry
what's the matter with your life
cut off my nose
there's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
so without love and a promise land
open hearts feel about it
swallow your pride
man i never slept so hard
standing on the corner of the third world
the call for attention
and we love to laugh
sense of time wont be easily found
is this the start of the breakdown
just talk to him
so grave those first born cries
and its sad love's not enough to make things betterturn the tables we'll burn the fables
where tears roll down
the devil take me now
tonight in my dreams
on my own
you've been told you're wrong
then the hurting wont come back
here anger is me
the way you are
going far getting nowhere
out of time and out of season
these things
this day
it wraps me up in chains
have really helped to pave my way
i am full but feeling empty
i wont complain
with dreams of escaping
hope in conversation starts to flow
waxing like an old crack 45
who killed tangerine
and when you think it's all over
baby's gone and died again
who you are who you are today
and i feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel
and i feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
so free her
too late for the young gun
too late for the young gun
sink to your grave
i should have said
dont drink the water baby
i said welcome to the me world
it's elemental
patience be sure
and no action guaranteed
wake up you're holding on to nothing
a curse in every way
but you toe the line
your pen is running out of ink
you're rending members out of sync
turn your back on mother nature
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
all for freedom and for pleasure
some will swim
doing what i oughta
some are found
heaven knows the weight of this crime
melt in your arms
when the light from above
listening to the band that made us cry
and we will carry war no more
fish out of water
fish out of water
these are the days of a diffrent paradigm
like a lamb to the slaughter
the time has come
take the best of me and then the rest let go
blame the crowd they scream so loud so long
something happens and i'm head over heels
my mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean in air changes with those
but traditions i can trace against the child in your face
ah dont take my heart
oh i feel so
through the haze remember
nature a soul extreme
lost the war
won the war lost the battle
is it absurb or am i being real
that's why i believe it is too late for anyone to believe
some things come out of nothing
long way back clouds were forming
i choose you
there's egg on your face and mud on your shoe
they look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
what good is living when you live in disease
dont cry for me my baby
you're mother and childless yeah yeah
with elegant crimes against the state
and you might understand
angels of mercy and lifelong companions
twisted like candles that fade in the half light
your friends have gone
ladybird fly away our house is on fire
where tears roll down
laid so low for so long so low
with the best will in the world
we'll be lost in the tide
where nothing on earth lies like a truth
mother russia badly burned
one good reason keep my feet on the ground and i say
come and make it quick then hit it the ground and i say
in one life you're rich in the next you are poor
lord of karma
ghosts all gone
los reyes catolicos
all around me are familiar faces
no tomorrow
mad world
went to school and i was very nervous
that i'm not that kind
you're stuck between me and my
that are stuck between someone's ears
no one else seems to mind
memories fade but the scars still linger
look foward to a future in the past
no dont pretend you can justify the end
when the wind blows
you were paid not listen now your house is on fire
when everything starts to happen
through dark days of struggle
was it your fate
and these things i find
mr pessimister
wine on the carpet
my life my life in the suicide ranks
well you dont look for your health in the color of your skin
by the skin of your teeth
new star
new star
dreaming so clever in all kinds of weather
baby we better start
chorus what my heart needs now is rest
well this had been coming for a long long time
tom shapiro clark waters
just ask any woman who's been hurt by a man
her broken heart
'cause i know you and i know why we're talking
maybe when i dont have so much going
i dont need to waste my time crying over you
an unknown prescription
an unknown prescription
but i'm getting off where the crossroads meet
raw as the wind but clean as bone
i've been looking at you looking me
sometimes i laugh
and dancing slow
maybe it's been a little too long
when only flesh and bone remain
how can i doubt when everytime i'm near you
everytime i think you might have changed
but we've been down that road
everytime i think you might have changed
everytime i cry
ever since the day i heard you say goodbye
tomorrow that old cloud may come around
chorus you want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
you want to land the moment you're in the air
yeah that sounds like a pretty good excuse
who bend it break it stretch it some
yeah girls lie too
girls lie too
and her voice is what keeps me here
you could say i'm hard to hold
i've got money in my pocket
heart in hand
well you may be but i aint ready yet
hold your horses you're steppin outta line
hold your horses
thinking about me and you
i just want to be mad for awhile
i just want to be mad for awhile
everything i'd do
lay down the law
rock little babies to sleep at night
i wanna spend a day
down at mardi gras
without paying paul
but girl i've seen the way he looks at you
my whole life through
repeat chorus
i'm alright
this aint nothing that some time wont heal
and every now and then i think about you
tom shapiro clark waters
whose luck was running low
you'd still be the onethere's no way to know the future
you've got a deadline you must meet
only ashes would remain
to try and keep this love alivei am the keeper of the flame
mary chapin carpenter richey
last thing i wanted was you
sometimes what we want
in a town where no one locks their doors at night
'cause midnights gone but i'm not
but i cant pull the trigger on that changing world out there
it's been so long i cant recall his name
give me a quarter
he's just an old neon flame
empty
no fear
i used to run away from love
i woke up at 3 am
not wondering how to shake
and i dont feel the dagger
i'm just getting used to not getting over you
my friends tell me they know things
and that's not what i wanted to see
believe you're mine
but oh it's not what i wanted to hear
oh it's not what i wanted to hear
you hold me like a prayer you touch me everywhere
looking in your eyes
you see me the real me
i skinned my knuckle
you can dress me up
tell a dirty joke
and if my mood is right
the way i walk against the grain
but the train dont run through here no more
but he really worked me over good
repeat chorus
there's a whole lot of love
making me wanna move on
'cause every girl i talk to
is going through the same thing
and a waitress with an empty stare
you say there's so much good between us
from trying to pull my spirit
you say there's no good reason
there is no in between
every beat every part
with my heart
every beat every part
that's me not loving you
the only thing you're holding is the truth
you never would forget the love you could have kept
and if it ever broke down i'd patch it up
i wish it had wheels and i wish it had wings
keeps hangin on when it ought to give up
long as the road dont run out
there's a place i'm going to
there's a place i'm going to
fireflies on a screen door
i gotta feel a deep pang
it aint sophisticated
it's gotta bend a heart strang
you sit in silence in the shadows
while others long to steal the spotlight
now i sing this song of love for you
lighting up behind the barn and not knowing why
he's never gonna be the same
and he'll be living in a different world
take a leap of faith this time
is are you always gonna want me in your lifetell me what you're feelin deep in your heart
you do or you dont you do or you dont
not we go but this goes and not cause not anything
a wrath of misery
dont take it away
they live for him and what he believes
day by day a day of reckoning
what we feel inside
i'd deliver us from this hell
long live the dreams
of suffering
will they ever be saved
from agony agony agony
from agony agony agony
cant you hear me breathing for you
cant you see me dying for you
solos 2 4 james
hey are you ready
join together unified
everybody simbolize
leaving death and hatred to unmask
are called in from the north
sound and feel of ripping flesh
diviners from the far north arrive

came on my day of birth
burnfeel no shame or pity
chorus
music peterson skolnick
chorus
death will not forsake them
death rolls in like the seasons change
chorus
why must i fall victim of hereditary spite
conceptual intempt
the chosen wait impatiently
the revolution holds on strong
killing everything in sight
they will surprise
praise an angelic song
truth inconsistencies
hey we live in a fucked up world
we step into the unknown
hiding from the light fantastic
chasing fear
did you hear that final note
solos eric james
human mind unglued
lyrics ramirez peterson
a vast group locust attack 2
finding our way through hells hole
ya got to make it today
i cant talk to you
gripping you withfear
you feel like you never did before
straight down from the night
everytime you encounter the demon
straight up to the snake
caged and riding the snake
condemned in pain
from criminals ranking high
we never could sky yes or no
seven days of may
raised outside of the law
it eats what it needs to survive
look around you is anyone pure
above all to gain full control
hate always eager to find
i said is there still hope for us now
death wont come form peace
so many times blood has poured
walk with shadows
oh let them pray
use your mind and hope to find
the day of judgement is closing in
slave to the ways of the system
he who lies
and even if i offended you
who are you
they'll take away
their social tribes
to this idolization
they're bleeding so black
paralyzed depression
honor the code and defending the line
where my feelings are going when they wither away
i know we are free
just realise where you've gone
some so scared the children fled
i've always saidburn the bitch
some paid the price of thier crimes
the meeting for the haunting night
see their dreams come to life
bring back the terror in the night
the fortune and the fame
taken by reality
like was like a fantasy
the time is now
cities turn to battlefields
shadows cast loud and clear
for the past it's too late
nobody would listen to him
then what's in store
when the books were untold
cause the preacher tells visions he sees
silent insanity
your sanity
oooh what'cha gonna say
the ritual call to me
lyrics billy james
heads held low
empty
preach their sermons of ignorance
is the hope for humanity
the meaning of life ends in agony
rise as we wait annihilate
premonitions of tragedy
cops they dress in black they bid their lives
he's just the president
the wars that we must fight
over crowded cause we share the same veins
you will not be
always together as
from the father above
alwaystogether as one
red man proud and giving hell
full moons rising from the sky a warrior's riding
ride with the wind
the price you have to pay
a trial by fire
this is what the people say
a trial by fire
following bright stars
deep in thoughts
should i keep wandering on
from the dream i must seek
nothing can touch me now
nothing can stop me now
ash to ashes dust to dust
that i really want to go
laid him down on a bed of steel
john doerealize that your dead
john doerealize that your dead
inbeded life entombed
my sins i will repent
a well hidden crime
in urban daylight
please just set me free
war inside my head
i dwell in thoughts
with subliminal sin
to try to take control
take my life into my own hands
take a number can you wait right here
negligence is why
they'll let you in
reduce your life into disgrace
empty
you dont know if you will drown
they cant bring you back
seen through new eyes
empty
seen through new eyes die through old
no escape from the things you put me through
coming back to you
pitch your reverend path
what you will find
fate there's no compromise
back to those better days
condemned in a jail cell
my sanity is all but gone
for i'm on the loose
music christian peterson
but corporate america and billion dollar industries
and what about the cia
resistance now or nevermore
free on anger free of pain
say now what you will before they make it illegal
free of hatred that we obtain
you dont believe a word you say
it's gonna take its toll pay the burnt bridge toll
your feet arent on the ground
practice what you preach
the vessel tossed and turned
the water was as hot as satans
death from above
darkness prevails no one to save us
will we see
watch the pain as it disappears
no time for despair
and i'll show you the truth
i'll return to serenity
you take my hand and sympathize
ican not be taken unto
smells the fear that he has dreamt
all i have is from me
the worst and the best
into the pit
so in the sad silent watches of night
into the pit
jesus makes love to the spike
ride ride through you
fearless when he is stoned
worship and listen to me
disciples of the watch
killing friend or foe
in his evil place
or i'll burn you to that cross
and face the war
no time for ignorance
lies broken dreams
and i may not ever see
in my pain my suffering
god save me now
music skolnick peterson clemente
seems like yesterday
from up in the planes we're flying
try to stop me
of dog faced gods
the sacred rights
solo james
confort all i can
and disaranged
antagonize his thoughts
i feel that
that's the way it was
i cannot help my friend
inside me thoughts
all along he could never see
when all is lost
to live like this is worse than dying
condemned to repress
here we go
so alone
as i wander change of seasons
the preacher starts to pray
that i'll soon be there
are all you will find
that i'll soon be there
the dark souls of time
te lost souls of time
come on down to the house of pain
te lost souls of time
to feed his bloody lust
annoints the silver blade
pain pain soothes the rage
face in the sky
face in the sky
it's live or die
the core reveals the past
melted ice floods the earth
the core revealed the past
melted ice floods the earth
the sea will rise
sweet infant child's born
nothing but dismal eves
the odds in favor now
made to never last
music skolnick peterson
first strike is deadly
deadly strike bred to kill
there's no use to looking
throw some light upon this race
is my reason to go on
crossed fists
of the great warrior king and
through the air
when night falls
from hatreds rise
stiletto death so that het prince can watch
obsessed by the spirit of death
you you're not justified
realize what you're giving me
empty
the bells shall chime as the towers burn
hail those ravens that once died
the skies bath the horizon in fire
the oath is sworn the blood is given
that rains from the sky
in a neverending death dance
when brothers fall for brothers sword
are you happy
as i sing on bandaged knees
sing to me my little sister of mercy
you might not like what they say
grndete damals nicht mit vanessa warwick verheiratet gewesen wreselbige war
ablste1992 unterbrach die band kurzfristig ihre aufnahmen zu
life kam '96 zur welt und beinhaltete mit dem song all sussed out
back2001 psycho narco2000 the almighty1996 just add
i dont understand these things that we say
aint got no solution
i'm destroyed but i'm ok
come join the masquerade
present your flesh and bid your juice
pain voluptuary desire
stop taking stop taking
maybe this would be easier
you're living all over me
this isnt the answer to anything
but i'm just somebody i used to be
i have been losing sleep
dirt starts smelling sweet
who gives a damn about the things you do
i think it's time you let go
the underworld hordes
blasphemous chant
bound by chains foged by
reading the bible in a cheap hotel
taking hold of my beliefs
i was lying through my teeth
but soon the hammer shall strike
a massive lust like rage i feel
the dawn of the dying sun
beware the future misery
it is the dawn ofthe dying sun
the queen of the night have raised again
take my soul to where the falcons fly
as the northern light guides my way
this journey is forever
when the first light from
an innocent child
just an eternal lust for blood
and thou shalt serve
until you get the rest of my life
i've been hanging on for weeks
you cant beat the feeling
among satyrs and shadows of lust and desire
free my soul i long to reach divine fullfillment
uh la la la la
you got my mind
i love you baby
i love you baby
bring me your love
i love you baby
bring me your love
i love you baby
uh la la la la
you got my mind
empty
it's just a small town life sentence
into the darkest forrest they go
chanting invocation
relentless we get born and raised
relentless i'll buy you a coke and sing
relentless the voices in your head are calling
empty
empty
confront yourself
time to realise take it way beyond belief
find the time to re arrange
everything is crystal clear
i'll just walk
dollar signs are for the blind
would you put up a front
then i've got nothing to lose
power and glory
they're a little closer now but they're not mine yet
something that i learned i learned out of school
late at night when i'm lying in a haze
you wrenched it out of my hands
to rise to the occasion
alot more than you should
before you go too wild
can get you what you need
yeah i want it bad
'cause i'm already gone
you can do it anytime
honey turn it on
gives me a heart attack
sad eyes staring out the window
a little lost sometimes
what is this feeling rising over me
you love hate and kill my time
coz i know you know i know i'm right
you've got a sting like a scorpion
c'mon and take him
take him to detroit
take him to detroit
pain leads to pleasure love leads to lust
god only knows and the devil may care
cant bring me down when i'm alone
the beast of your spirit
rosepetals thrown before my feet by the angels
through the tangled web of the mysteries
how does it feel to be a problem
if ignorance is bliss
warwick london
make me bleed
there's enough bitchin baby
just like a hurricane pumping in your veins
oh i want to turn you on and there aint no price to pay
a prophecy of man to die
the angel i deny your human kind
in the shape of a sexless angel
i wont ask you any questions
well you push me to edge of happiness
i know you got it all
goddess of the crossroads guiding light
moon of a thousand shifting forms
cause i got something to say
a blond bitch came to ease my mind
i lose my mind so i can talk to the mindless
hell to pay
hell to pay
teach me how to fuck
i cant hold back my kingdom
senseless stimulation
cos religion is business
going on everyday
but his love dont come cheap
when cash must be shown
kill your idols
i know i know
you're everything that you dont want to be
her virgin fires been kissed so many times
gettin high and feeling fine
you did it once but now you wont let it be
and i wanna love you
we'll go cruise in your cadillac
lay down the law
lay down the law
try and understand
something's gotta give
i'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
these things i do i dont regret
outta sight and outta mind
you can keep the milk i'll take the honey
i'm hooked into your love machine
just one look from you sweet child
i wont be coming back again
got a love religion
dont talk to me about religion
screwing the world without protection
you've gotta give it 'til it hurts
empty
i got to move
that runs in the family
the wild blood of a beast runs through the vains
lost ways of warriors pride
then she clouded my eyes and took my heart away
gonna turn up the fire turn up the heat
a new love sensation
i'm out of season
when feeding on frustration
seems like all your heroes
change what you feel inside
change change
life could be so easy
you lift me up take me to the ledge
i'm looking down
below my dick

temptation rising in my soul

someone i would call now
long gone before daylight
and a night full of no fears
eyes burning on the quicksand
yes i've found myself a strong horse
in grace
and on a night like this
nothing could be worse
love you're news to me
true love is cruel love
when love makes you wake up soar
sweet love tasty blood

and i was in it when your faith was dead
but will i be clean

bright lights from giantwheels
i would like to take you
you dont want no joy for a while
cause she will not bother at all
and her lovely celia inside
it feels like we've never
made it together since
the baker in town was murdered one day
the gruesome killing of the bakerman
la lalala lala lalalala
i'd paint the grey sky blue
but i want you to know
some of them got closer then others
i disconnect

i'm talking and talking
i shiver and i scrape at your door
no my blood dont flow anymore
your back's not straight like before
could we
there' no escape
that's what i call life
how we invented the fear
because the blowing is dry
someone to be in
what a bloody cross to bare
i will be here until i drown
you'll lose it all
never lose your grip
my dad the best dad that i've had
dont think he's a mad dad
plain parade
plain parade
with a sampled heartbeat and a stolen soul
please give me something i'm not doing so good

i want the sun to bleed down
words iommi butler ward osborne
when you ask the reasons why
words svensson
sure of what to think
words sveningsson
oh spare me if you pleasesick tired an sleepless
something here's so wrong
so i'm leavin everything behind
and i'm leaving everything behind
lifetimes of changes
you'll break that foot that
i think of you all the day
running in the circus
he's sitting by the mirror
they love his show
they were asking if you were around
well this chick got up and she slapped johnny's face
it wont be long till summer comes
tomorrow morning is a sugar kiss
she will lose gravity
come on it's war come on
i'm armed

it's such an easy way to choose
i saw your face
empty
come raise your flag upon me
i hear bullets singing
we wait for love to come
all will wait for us
oh no yeah all gunned down
all will wait for us
on his own
on his own to be known
but did you ever see us
and the bad times that we had
i go off over any old thing
so i need some fine wine and you you need to be nicer
empty
morning shone on my windows today
and time is all that passessomeone came by my bedroom today
if i keep stumbling up at one
i'm right on track but this state is frail
i wanna step in time
i'm dyin to get it right
we'll just pass him there
he just stares at the world
iron man lives again
and when you cant believe
as the whole town was sleeping
the night before in the dining room
now i ride the tight on a boat made of sand
yes i found a guide in the city of lust
to lead me into the night
i came home in the morning
it was all in vane
so i started a fight
i got i got it now
but if you live as you learn
they're fucked up and annoying
that'll be the day that you will hear
'cause i have always been a part
and it's keeping me up
and you trick me over and over again
so this the end now
music svensson
love me love me
say that you love me
as long as you dont go
so i cried and i begged for you to
love me love me
and what i've worked so hard to gain
no i don t need this
you waited on satans call
approaching a time that is drastic
it's not a matter of you versus me
i had a vision i could turn you right
i'm losing my favourite game
but all the things i feel
you couldnt tell me how
and take me higher
there's so much more than this before we go
cant get my dreams out
hello goodbye
hello goodbye
hello goodbye
from paris to lausanne
from luxembourg to rome
no not now
now that you left me
i'll be gone
i just dont think so
do you believe
while you get me wrong
to the wilderness
i'm gonna work
hey what did you hear me say
i've changed my mind
we'll pay them double
what's good you hurt it
with your talk of four leaf clovers
so heavy and stained
could be feathers and down
nearby a park bench in the sun
why wont you wrap your life around
keep holding me down
hey please baby come back
'till i said i love you
i heard about a great big swindle
i'm one of a few survivors
and we wait
it's quite a slow disaster
said my dress was very cute
people having fun
music svensson
it's high but such a bitter view
the filters that i use
i hang around
wordspersson sveningsson koyana
all because of youand now i've found a partner
the dinner we'll be eating
dont use that bat
vacant and free
listen baby
hey get out of my way
i shake loose of your laces
no way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
no way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
and i never wanted to be either of those x2
i fell asleep from day
have me to you
i always hit the tape with a rough road style
empty
if you could see what i can see
repeat chorus
behold we are coming back we are coming back
left over here i'm gonna dance with their own shockin feel and i'm a foreign
something or otheri'm blurr blrrr blrr rrr such a big fuckin deal
vocals keith murray
you are a bit early but dust anyway
cool cos i'm wired and i'm out of my mind
but i dont care 'bout you
come on your
where they patronise my misery
will never go away
how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter
let me in mate
break up home there's nothing bound and left
break up home there's nothing on the knife
kick that mother fucker
so we rollin with the chemicals and we got the new sound
you know me rollin with my click the one inch punch
unrehearsed let the bubbles burst
the rivers run and deep right through my thought
and raise the population of this town
all the time i should be there with you
out of control
out of control
like a setting sun
where do i begin
knew you'd be here tonight
spun me 180 degrees
dont wanna rush it
come on and dance with me
come on and dance with me
your soul dont burn
you got
swastika eyes
you got
is this sweet and pure and true
i'm dreaming this and i'm dreaming there
like i'm hearing you
empty
you know i almost lost my mind
lend me your hand
like i'm hearing you
empty
voodoo people
where do i start
a treasure to your heart
all of a sudden i start to remember
a fire burns
but the map leads her astray
dancing cool and blind
something outside you is always to blame
at least it's good to be out of the wind
and it stacks up badly that it never makes sense
empty
you walk around just like circus baby is it true
you know you shouldnt really bother baby i'm here too
now their warmth is forgotten and gone
i never dreamed we'd meet here once more
i start the car for ten mile beach
i start the car for violet town
how are you getting home she laughed
anaesthesia's numbing
so many things need fixing everywhere
i dont know how
on the ground in the air
stretching out to catch the slender message
the civilized gentleman is gonna be nice
she reaches for him in a jealous moment x3
i saw him looking down the
time meanders discord and music of the birds
on my verandah almost seven years
she she needs her time and space
wants another
you're just an antenna you're just a wire
she say that's the way that's the fate i am resigned to
dreams and thunder rattle the rust
she's forgotten your name and hopes you'll do the same
there's a fire in the eastern perimeter
like a fool i wept as the starbeams crept
and there's far too many
clock is stopped thermometer is bulging
a sudden flash
it's not making sense anymore
or maybe i'll try to fly
the secret doesnt matter if you keep it or leak it
who never got to meet you last time
an unwanted discoveryso now we're cruising down this shuddering highway
privilege on privilege
uncurling human tragedy there's definitely a remedy
you cant take me on as you are
i thought you were the cat's pyjamas
i'll keep on
empty
it's guaranteed to live and to bleed
if he sees right through my futile disguise
hope you can see what that's done to me
i take my payment i catch my flight
the guys with the brains are all bitter and vain stupidity
you're down to your socks and you're waving your wand
spoiling the rot that the indians eat
i wasnt looking for you and i dont want to find you yet
and i've been waiting for ages yes i've been here all the time
she calls down the crows then she pulls on her shoes
glad that went so smoothly well that never is the case
we'll walk and be like giants we'll all be honest men
na na na na na na na na na
you make me drift up and float and fall like a stone
and that's what it was
lie down my perfect child this is but a dream
i dip my hand into their pockets
i've got to say a prayer for my daily bread
i see you slither away with your skin and your tail
it wasnt long ago chorus
i just cant tell who i adore the least
once in a while when the wind has slowed down
watching how the white moon melts into the cloud
once i had a name forgotten now
crystal skulls and screaming gulls
in autumn he comes to this town
his skin looks like he slept in it
in winter he cracks in summer he warps
it isnt you or is he
gets himself off headlines
reality all pervading
and his hands under the table
and the story really unfurls
look through the eyes that you've grown used to
if only you had been there
weddings frozen melted grooms
the day they turned off the great machine
there goes the maven sowing his seed
he bought us dinner so what the fucking heck yeah
chorussurrender smiles epiphanies
alone in this room with the moon and the sea
the myths you made
here's all the things you didnt say
the myths you made
their teeth are bared their claws outstretched
washing away the statues of sharon stone
oh i want life
i knew you'd find me drinking
he had a room in the best part of town
you couldnt really say he seemed to care
i knew a happy man who made me feel sad
this is it
that the sun never comes
random choices will they ever learn
but they never can be caught
i hoped you'd realized
gotta get in deep
empty
carries you aloft and you're getting soft
i heard about maria she hated the rat race
under shifting dimensions horizon returns
following the nebula
here for now here for now
man carrying a brow
the echo of another time an age of beauty
imagine the feeling before that last jump
travel by thought
travel by thought
i was working in an orchard that grew the strangest fruit
a hotel suite in a rich mans town a hut in botany bay
what else did you give to me
right speaker
wrapped in the arms of the night
just beyond the door
trinkets sing on a desert wind behind here
they say it's static electricity but
but out of the twisted metal of discarded fortune's curse
i think about the loveless fascination
something that's shimmering and white
i dont want to know
borrowed grapes from stores of gold
and easy to burn
i hope it's a message from someone obscure
it's just a joke
and we both know why you're here
deep in a room which i've never seen
you with another so easily sleep
who's the one with the vulture's shoulder
who's the one with the modified cortex
howling growling they want your blood
the callous future with a nervousness soon
you got off light
but you're just too civilized to fight
i must have put the horse before the cart
you took the rest of the day
it's a shame it's not a game
you turned up backstage at the palace
at least it's artistic i guess
i'm gonna stitch you up when you come unsewn
as if it's never gonna end
the deeper you go the tighter the net looks to medo you enjoy the view
empty
i saw this film about some people who lived in a dome
destined to make that same old mistake
i saw this film about some people who lived in a dome
for your face
ooooh dont move
ooooh dont move
dont let them in to your heart
blown away and falling around me
songbird knows just when to die
i want to break to be beautiful
dropping names
the empty clouded sky
the weather is bare
from a year without rain
only one thing you ever really know
i turn to leave as if in a cameo
like songs our warmth fades away
i see the future just sliding away and false
ambition and war take the boys
i hope you know what i mean
i feel the orbit of the moons
how could i let it slip by
we are endless like the sky
tears and loss feed the overgrown grass
oh field of mars
it's like the history that
it's emptiness that scares
we all came back from the war
but it's not their spears that spill your breath
they were more than voracious they sucked our ambition
an enemy always an adorer
and beginning the end
drowned for the moment on an empty ocean bed
florian trout was a distant boy he lived in a very strange town
in the furtive gestures in the lighting's flash
seldom even looking out into the silver distance
the heights above an almost perfect view
shrug your shoulders and they disappear
as if you would tell me so
i've never ever been here
i guess you can count me in
one more day i may forget my reason
he had those rascals hooked on homemade soma
and i expect to find life there unpleasant
brother end your vigilance and your fasting
but you punctured my tires you crossed all my wires
and you can have all the money soonyou're so deluxe you're so divine
clowns in drag concealing vanity
we'll show you pastel shades of rhyme
visit sleep and smile and drown me
shall we start to speak of holly
oh what a ritual father father why you leaving me
water all my orchids save my dynasty
testing digressing falling to the earth
always spoiling the best things you done
who is this child who is this man
look at the things she allows
happening i saymust be thirsty drink drink sink forget
made this pretty cabinet and gave you the keys
and a lot that's in between
i'm still thinking about all the things she never saidi parked my car by some memories
'cause it's here it's where the air is clear
how long
nearly midnight in 1999's last party
all is revealed
you'll sprout wild wings and fly
to make me come back to you
take it back take it to the bone
take it back take it all night long
and three free are the days in may
and i hid from the people who were trying to find me
flattering chattering words to impress me
i could never get off the stuff that spellbound me
some for the little boys who live down the lane
protect me from the meteor rain
help me break these telekinetic chains
it's no reason to be sad
poppies sleep undamaged we drive into the east
that certain ideas
but you know i never wanted to
the oceans growing hungrier
waiting for those kings to come
and lush black swamps where mandrake grows
she hunts in a pack yet she ends up alone
they cannot die and also cannot be born
yeah they're laughing
twelve o'clock in the building of the mirrors
you can leave your lover just to love all alone
you can leave your clothes on
the day i need you they can feed me to the lions
overcomes too much
i dont owe you anything
could you look good back on the street
please dont touch anything
please dont touch anything ah ah
it's not really fair
gone for a song
follow her down to worship some god
i just hope they dont believe like you do
hotel room bedside manner
empty
look what a state i'm in
coming home finding other men in hiding
god i've got to get back soon
it was plain to see
on second street
i rang my client and i banged on her door
opportunity knocked you up i guess
he dont belong in this time with you and me
and pretty soon then we'll be drenched to the bone
it'd hard to know what's genuine
up through the suburbs graveyards and parks
and it's lust and sloth and pride
i'll see you in your sleep
with purchases intended
cruel pinch of weary irony misery monger or pleasureman leaves
magician among the spirits is drowning in a cave
see the comet's silver trail see the planets falter
fragile and delirious cannot understand it
with you every single night in february
farewell my daughters i'll see you soon
all the mercenaries are following him
some blackhearted actors interfered in your scene
instead of me
last year today a radio plays
back in metropolis circuses and elephants
when i'm standing with you
the rent just went on entertainment
echo in the hall
it used to be fine
oh but she has authority
on with the show
i had a feeling i had failed
she opens up her door
the sunburnt landlord glares for all the people
i'm priceless you're worthless but it's not a bad match
there's such a big demand for blood money
we should get going
i should be going
when we left the sun was up
and i cant picture any time
but i dont remember how
the wonderful mind of that woman
promise her anything only if
exquisite results in input mode
look at that business woman
empty
i didnt need any of this
watch the metal scene just peel away
poor tormented automan
dont replace and dont upset me
and we're considering remaining here
goodbye there's no reason there's no alibi
the king had something changed within him
i dont blame any of you and i dont blame myself
someone's words to reassure me
empty
you're gonna get it whatever you choose
wait 'til i let this soul out of it's cage
that's the rebound
and thirst caked all our words
thinking of all that i left behind
falling in
cut in two that's the kind of love i'm making
separation there's someone in here sharing it with me
falling in love again
you ever been on a holiday
and you know you're falling behind
'cause in the darkness the guests are all blind
emerging from the shell unscathed
i fall down in the sun
in the space between our houses some bones have been discovered
destination destination
like a womb night was all around
oh i know i could never get that near
ugliness you have to learn beauty you cant teach
the blue sheet of sky
surrounds you 'til you cant see it's there
then kick it out
baby left as she lost her breath
for a perfect fit
just one me one you
i accused of testing
said fifteen years i've been here
you gotta burn until you learn
and you freeze until you burn
empty
the hammer falls and it's going going gone
this ice will all melt down but we'll be washed away
fed the five thousand built cities of spires
disconnected they displayed all the discoveries they made
one of these days you're gonna understand
the way you talk
cos everything's just right
i wonder where you roam
so easy to be round
you're soft and you're strong
nothing can go wrong
you've got to grind grind it out
a moment marred by hesitation
i've got to grind grind it out
i wish i'm back in my hotel womb
she's got the face of the widow who keeps following me
that takes me to my plane
with a dark suspicious man
then you're gonna cry
out of reach their grasping arms
fishnet girlish the red ones spark
they're washed up by the foam waved sea
is this where you live
coffee stories the lying truth
the second descends through electric attraction distributing wings they've never been used
back at the beginning eden prevails back at the start back on the street
drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
so the fire is almost out and there's nothing left to burn
but the fire is almost out is almost out
i used to feed the fire
and the fire is almost out
come closer and see
into the trees
again and again and again and again
oh elise it doesnt matter what you do
there're worlds to part
wide eyed in front of you
and the make believe ran out
any more than this
if it's the last thing we ever do
for always and ever is always for you
and the smile and the shake of your head
just a falling bird
an atmosphere that rots with time
bites my hand
an echo
as he plays on his knees
sudden hush across the water
and the sky
can i cry like this
empty
empty
in the caves
tonight i'm going wild
and all i want is to be with you again
no this is not about running out on you
yeah i know i should care if you come with me
i want this to be the end i dont want to start again
it's already been and gone
i held you
one endless moment
i kissed you
i never let you go
i stare at the window
he waits to hear her say
he waits to hear her say
he waits for her to understand
how did we get this far apart
the hours go by
i sense the quiet despair
she doesnt see the signs
i want so much to need her i never turn away
i am trying to be the one for her
she will never be the one for me
in love
he doesnt want to know what's going wrong
everything just fades away
the one that stops him feeling at all
and that makes me cry
'cause i can see through your disguise
object object
i've got no objections
something small falls out of your mouth
waiting for the death blow
waiting for saturday
and painting a lifeless face
a sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
it feels like a hundred years
and hold me up so high
just one more time
i think that you'll like them
too close and too wide
falling into strangers
yeah i look at the floor
with the lights and the lies in my eyes
where this is
when my life's going numb
and all the shapes that i throw
taking hold
always wrong
caress the sound
i realize we only get to stay so long
we always have to say goodbye
i wonder
for another way
i ran to your heart to be near and we kissed as
white so delicate lost in the cold you were
looking so long at these pictures of you but i
cracks in the pale blue wall
i'm trapped in my face and i'm changing
another point another view to send
back to the body in my bed
world you said and it's so cold it's like the
plastic passion is the ladies lover
plastic passion is a transparent tart
tell me i'm wrong
to hold you in my arms
you know you're always crying
in the ashes of the fire
but it's too late
you shatter me your grip on me a hold on me
drearily and tired the hours all spent on killing
and older we grow
oh remember
so they close together
no no no
its the only way to be
if only my eyes would close
all i really want is you
i'm sure i asked you to stay
that's for sure
anyone but you
and stare at me
and so we walk away
i passed the howling woman
i said i love you i said you didnt say a word
swear i will always be yours and you'll always be mine
if you die you said so do i you said
i've never been sure
however unwise
how each of us dreams to understand anything at all
pretending to know to the end
no one's home
deep inside
i see the steps behind me
all the night time leaves me
pressing close behind me
when the stars would fill the sky
the stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
another night with you
hanging on your back
and screams and screams
but i'm almost there
and you just wait for me to fuck up again
oh i'm sick of it all
all you want to do is win
please remember me
than to remember me
that i can hold onto
i love you more than i can say
another time undone hopelessly fighting the
no dread of the unknown
no i dont need your us or them
how sick in your mind and soul
oh i dont want your us or them
my feet were bare and cut with stones
i want it all
but however hard i want
i want the world to make me wonder
any more time
i've been drifting around for hours and i'm lost and i'm tired
she holds out her hands and i follow her down to my knees
and then it's gone
i'm watching me scream
you look like you could use a hand
like fabulous fabulous
you know that you could do with a friend she said
it doesnt touch me at all
please leave me alone
it's just us trying to feel that there's some sense in it
another world where the sun always shines
it's just us trying to feel that there's some sense in it
you always want so much more than this
another world
why cant i be you
everything you do is quite angelicate
why cant i be you
grip you in a luger lock
smash them with an iron rule
no one's a loser
silence and black
burn like fire in cairo
and start to burn
empty
empty
tuesday wednesday break my heart
monday you can hold your head
throwing out your frown
i'm in love
right here with you
and we'll never say goodbye
dont let this end
i wish i could just stop
we will always want
i know another moment will break my heart
love in vain
like the pig on the stairs
suck your insides insides out
and slip the needles in my side
oh you know how it is
yeah you know how it is
you have to get up get out and get gone
dont want to talk dont want to try
get up get out and get gone
no people
no people
no people
kiss me
the way you burst the clouds
it makes me bite my fingers through
i cant get that small
you used to take
cling to me so just one more just one more go
for a second that place was lost in space
i left it underwater
the third time i saw lightening strike
hey hey hey
and promised to each other
who held a child upon his back
the childs eyes uttered nothing
i hate these people staring
and how i understand
to me at all
i am so in deep with you
i am so in love with
empty
if only tonight we could sleep
and bury us deep
i change the time in your house
i felt like i could die
and i know i was wrong
dont walk away
inbetween without you
make you dead
exploit inspire encourage
and tell me about the games you play
just push it away
just fill up the sky
remember you can fill up the sky
you carry your love in a trinket
that it's not you
that i'm tired of hanging around
no it's not you
i almost cant believe that it's for real
do it again
really didnt think it could
do it all the time
but all you say is we're all spinning
your smile into striptease
so tell me what is going on
someone get me out of here
i can never stop
i can never stop
because they're drinking themselves senseless
and i'm writhing
to learn the new smile
that you've been craving for
jumping someone else's train
or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame
and round her the night turns
the one that makes me scream she said
to make her glow
dancing in the deepest oceans
and drowned her deep inside of me
but nobody opened their eyes
but nobody held out their hands
staring down the barrel
or i can fire the gun
i feel the steel butt jump
i'm the stranger
the trembling hand of the trembling man
it looks good
every voice belongs to you
say it's the same you
yeah tell me it's all the same
the blood is thick the head is burst
it's not the same you
a man walked
of how they loved our lady
but older than me now more constant more real
but christmas falls late now flatter and colder
and never as bright as when we used to fall and
all over the windows and the floors
and i wont say it
it's just the same
because it couldnt be rain
at all the gardens that looked
and kissed his feet she fell
and in her head
holding on given up
could he ever ask her why
and i'm not sure where i am
and i stare but
so happy and so young
i cant find myself
however far away i will always love you however
love you
quietly he laughs and shaking his head creeps
million shivering furry holes and i know that in
help yourself
but it's always back
just walk away stop it going on
if it cant be like it was i've got to let it rest
if i could just be sure
it looks so
there's a meathook in my heart
here you are
and fly away from me
and this mother's love inside me
as i speak
oh just put it outside
the time
the memories fade
receives her
i wish it was all true
as stiff as toys
to be fighting in the war
i dont show much
i always wait to hear you say there's a last kiss
we want us like everything else
it's far too hard to make you see in a moment
as the days become heavier and weighted
i think about tomorrow
run into the night
writhing with hatred
touch her eyes
side by side
empty
creatures kissing in the rain
in the heat of the night
in the hanging garden
into the walls
as one by one the people slip away
as all around the children play
the sacrifice of penance
out of my head
nothing i am
the last day of summer
yeah it used to be so easy
so comfortable so habitual
side by side in silence
we move like cagey tigers
we bite and scratch and scream all night
wonderfully pretty
and always the right way round
i think you come from another world
strange girl
make me forget
you promised me
i needed your words
you promised me
you promised me another time
less than we you breathe the strangest twist
twist upon your lips but i dont see and i dont
just say it now
is not enough
they're not tears for me
turn your face away
to say that i've aged
i will never forget
the happiest day
so scared and high under winter moon
this perfect night in another land
keeps me alive
oh i should feel
and never turn away
the sky goes red
this feeling never goes
these flowers will never die
this world always stops i said
it's hard to ever really know
never die
i try to laugh about it
but i know that
that i loved you
to get you back by my side
on those days when it felt like snow
and sometimes we would spend the night
that girl was always falling
i never thought that tonight could ever be
then i could make it safe and clean
i could make it safe and clean
i ride into your town on a big black trojan horse
and my mood is heavily pregnant
sensational dazzling perfectly sized
the way you're so carefully couldnt care less
empty
like ice into my heart
can no one save you
if only you'd never speak like that
i see face like stone
the way that you do
pull to me the way you once did
thickening streams of greed as bit by bit it
screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
glass of the roof through the roof of your mouth
songs about
to wake up with a smile without a doubt
to get up and go
but it's much too late you say
tear out the pages with all the bad news
it's a perfect day for getting old
for doing this now
pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
and die
throw myself in fury over the edge
the movement is sharp and clear and pure
finish your life
knowing i'll murder you again
dressing up to be all this
i cant just carry on this way
christened in blood
say the right words
but faith
like we know that it's over if you slip going
we've got to show how much we love them all
it's strange the way we cant say no
or maybe it's the promise of belief
and keep changing your shape
jump right into your mouth
all night
and the light begins to fade
a measure of life
make up in the new blood
i captured it so perfectly
the same sharp pain
and dreamed of death
shake dog shake
you're like a slug on the girl
and i shiver and shake
we writhed under a red light
and into the room
i walked away and grew old
we all die
the secrets i hide
six different ways inside my heart
it's that american voice again
save 1 pound 52 on recommended retail price
a turntable
your heart wouldnt ache
when i told you what i
so please send me icing and decorating sets
all look the same
empty
please try to understand i have to see you have to feel you
i laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase
can i use some of your lipstick
so alone into the cold new year without another word from her
you never know how anything will change
but she dare not turn around
i'll get it down for sure
yeah i'll break it out again
tonight i'm so alive
from square one start and bit a for it push
a buzz a buzz a buzzing like them killer bees
but it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
she's grinning singing spinning me round and round
waiting for the sun to shine
couldnt ask for more you said
and i love it
i can see
there's something warm
dont you walk away
to be by myself
i'm just your long time curse
under the april sun
suicide standing sucking in her cheeks
you cant get on
written by william
have we done something wrong
but sometimes it goes wrong
yeah i'm a mean motherfucker now but i once was cool
in my head
yeah it's christmas time again
and my mood is black
no one hear is on my side
nothing here belongs
and my mood is black
no one hear is on my side
i'm a stone dead tripper
and i left you behind
got the blues
and i know about the taste of pain
stoney cold and a twistin moon
hey it's ok i will never go away
with barbed wire kisses and her love
making love to the sound of a scream
to beat it with your pole
feels like something pumping through my veins
hipshake gunning kick start and i'm running
holding onto something doesnt make it mine
mcdonald's is shit
the 7 is cool
children are cool
i am a freak
cracking up
cracking up
why cant you see
after such a lonely time
with my chaotic soul
and i awake from dreams
and i feel that i'm dying
i wanna die just like jfk
sung by jim
oh save me
she comes complete
you can always hear her say
if pleasure is my prize
heavens open gate the devils silver eyes
empty
hotwired heat all the way home
sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking
ever since i heard the voice i thought i had no choice but then i kissed her
that shivers your bones and rises to your heat
i'm knee deep in myself
i love the way she's talking
of your stuff
i think you're something i cant have
are going to my head
cause i need you
these days are so much colder
i wont get on my knees
lucky son of a gun
sometimes you just cant get enough
and i should not be alone
i feel as sharp as a carving knife
i'm sowing seeds
velvet skies and the velvet underground
what became of the teenage jesus freak
couldnt tell a spike from a pin but i could run forever
i'm a real believer
i'm gonna fight surf city got to get it down
empty
empty
aint had no peace in the farmyard
talking like she's just had a taste
sure gets lonely living here on the moon
i guess the people cant find me
sure gets lonely living here on the moon
tell me something i dont know
you're all fucked up but it dont show
it aint easy yeah
i was born and i was dead
i gotta keep my
talking 'bout my girl my girl
i've got all the riches one man could take
empty
so dont you look for me
gonna stay inside
sun shines so high
cant understand it
written by william
well you wont need money
you never understand me
i tell you the truth but you dont believe me
i think i'm going back to school
in the days before rolling stones
sung by william
as far as i can tell
sends the shivers to my head
i'm one feet tall
but you cant swim far away
kick it back till it breaks my spine
i'm alive alive alive alive
but i always stood the chance
is on her dish
and on and on and on
and on and on and on
empty
that meet my eye
to focus my attention
of a world that keeps turning
just looking for a place to play
got the same old story the moment i'd appear
with a swinging little guitarman
guess who's leading that five piece band
i see the sun here
you take my hand x3
this feeling you cant deny
you stare behind
empty
that swings inside your mind
like californi a
it's the only way
surfin usa
she was a car smash
i got the stoned look in my eye
i was a coke hound
my head is dancing
it's high and it's steep
it's off then it's on
well i guess i never saw her in that way
dont ever change
sung by jim
i cant touch
what do you want if you dont want love
i've been looking for an ideal sound
what do you want if you dont want love
sung by william
and heaven knows where loving goes
too long i had fun with fire
you gotta run
i run around now oh
shoving up till i freeze
so it seems to me
i've got someone who knows me
and my friend ben thinks that beer is food
and oj's wife's crawling back from the dead
cant stand the pain
i dont wanna go
let me get your soul
sung by jim
come on you are my friend
one more hit turns to one more crash
i'm blind cant see the way
i've been waiting longtime
and tied to the tongue
homicide would break me
oh i wish that i could feel
come on and hold me
and shake to the rule
but something about you felt like pain
and if i tell you something
and the way i feel tonight
was all i ever took from you
you're late she says
hey hey hey
there's a man on your cross
i walk away
from your head
seen what i've seen and it's gone
tell me what you're saying
and she's crazy to want me to taunt me
it's her way of talking to jesus
she's got the hit that takes you into space
written by jim
something naked and clean
she loves beatle paul
i'm a boyfriend and a girlfriend in your eyes
i could close my eyes
and did i feel you deep inside
i was born again
i love the bbc
i hate rock 'n roll hates me
i'm not trying to make the world a better place
dont need money if you've got soul
gets me where i'm going
and i watch and i watch and i watch
i step crueller
there's something dead inside my hole
i take my time away
hey yeah
blows up and far away
so it seems
so it seems
be in black be in black be in be in black
is the hardest thing that
just like honey x 17
it means it's good
sung by jim
cindy's movin on
cindy kills me every day
i cant quite get a grip at last
just like the taste is pain
you got to see the box upstairs
little skinny girl she's doing it and it feels fine
i got it you got it she's got it
down the back of the sea
dont want you to want me
my mood is black when my jacket's on
i get so wild on my motorbike
and an empty road
to all the sadness and the gloom
before the morning sun arrives
just for the two of us
well my friends are gone my hair is grey
i was born with the gift of a golden voice
and there's a mighty judgement coming but i maybe wrong
i heard a ringing sound
but you cant see
feels like i'm going mad
you never was but you cant see
there's treasure in the pit of the hideous sin
you gotta walk before you run
i'm really gonna blow it away
nothing like a sure thing
he's alright yeah
why'd you care why'd you want me there
and we settled for a spark
if we had the time we'd take it
leave me in peaceful abject misery
that's been done before
when it's frozen
and you break me in two
i'd like to trip you up
i cant live without you
you make the comedown easy
i remember how the wind
let's get to the bottom
to all the scandals and the cover ups
but somewhere someone is suffering
i didnt see the point in staying
brand new a baby blue machine
which meant something
the explanations unexplainable
if you cant stand the heat in the kitchen
it's gripping i'm ripping
i'm always amazed by what can take place
drilled it killed my guts are being spilled
you dont need a church key
i've got a dollar that i want to save
i had a dream i had all the answers
i'm sure my numbers underestimate
a million more is just a star in the sky
and i start to kick it out
little bit ugly now 3x
let's let it in
right now right now
a little bit ugly cuz the time is right
and it just might be my fault i know
are my screams being ignored
i'm a man without a place to live
same corner neighborhood his friends the gang
they stayed still with each attack
both his eyes would twitch
no one spoke no one moved no one made a sound
but i got somethin you need oh yeah
my love is rotten to the core
i got no time to mess around
just like i told you before
almost anything goes
where they know what time of day it is
so i'll grab a taxi cab head somewhere i can crash
big city of dreams can be a nightmare
countin on a remedy
a million times or more
what you're callin the cause
i like noise that's why i'm livin where i am
people on the streets had little to say
given the choice i like noise morning noon and night
on a day that was so quiet ah
emotions so high they cant get any higher
fucked up stripes just dont feel right when i'm chillin with joe late at night
it means everyone is welcome to the mighty mighty shows
so fragile that it frightens me
you're not providing me
forced inside of me
trash is trash
but i was on to your charade
i hate the way
ahhhhtrash is trash

calmer hands are called for here
the temperature we need that to drop
a kind approach might do the trick
the temperature we need that to drop
last dead mouse dont be shy
last dead mouse that's why i yell
folks say i'm nuts they can say what they please
last dead mouse
what for we're unsure
couldnt be any wronger in this age and day
march to the beat of a different drum
so forget about seeing and get it into your mind
if you poke too far you'll reach the front of your brain
what about me
nevermind me well i'm all right
someone will fix my broken bones
unequipped with a skill
i'll go zero to sixty

when demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it
miracles she can perform
still she fights and still she tries
when you hit the bricks i hit the roof
pictures to prove it smudged with fingerprints and tears
i've got a pile of pictures
if you dont believe me believe them
police beat me police kick me police chase me police mace me police cuff me police rough me
and brazen was the walk
what's stranger fact or fiction
empty
the last hurrah nah i'd do it again
when you smoke or poke the poison
on the hot tin foil
royal oil big trouble brewing
a long time ago we used to be friends
where's the love where is the loyalty
simmer down what goes around
when i cant rememeber
one day one day who knows
before they close the curtain
get distorted
now where do we stand oh
you stood tough
i only know this is killing me

i've never been here before after a couple
we've really grown to like each other
i've really grown to like this place
'cause the cave it only gives
the cave's never coming down on me
which makes me wonder if i could
i've never had to knock on wood
i'd like to think that if i was
and i'm glad i havent yet
dont want to share but it seems clear that i'm gonna have to

colam's been spray painting the ceiling
i remember i remember i remember toxic toast
we made it through not all of us but most
the mood is tense the tensions thicker
we're not so bad i guess after all
i feel like my father at the horse track
but then
i'm really glad that you are here
and we are is because
stick that needle right through your arm do everything that does you harm
take your real life till you soon discovered where you are

please name the place and date
it's rockin the foundation
and i'm not fucking joking
he lets us practice in his place in his place
i'm not bragging and i'm not proud
maybe the drinking made me cry
sometimes i get housed
i've heard all the stories the failure and glories
'til now i couldnt see
dont know how but now i know i dont
really something no one was gonna touch
or passed out in a storm
but when i lose my mind
down down down
but i'm a happy very happy very happy guy
and i dont know what i'm talkin about

he wheeled and dealed and did what haji had to do
and he'll be around long after we're gone
phat fade and fresh tattoos
but wonder if you will
no other motherfucker can compete
on a mission and sworn to secrecy different than he used to be
i want your main line baby climb aboard the eden express

point your finger wag your tongue
if words and music tick you off
i mean man you're on the move
you're going down you're gonna burn
at least how much i've got
not too far from here
hope i never lose my wallet
if someone asked me for a quarter
you know i've left a lot behind
when i would think about my father

dicky barrett gittleman
the place is packed i needed that
the darkness was nice but it wasnt enough
i feel alive in this dive so i'll drink to that
the place is packed i needed that the bottles cracked
i still reach for you
why we hurt each other again and again
i'd like to leave
and though i somehow know i cant explain
it was there in the words unspoken
breathe down your neck
i'm not asking a lot
so back off your rules
i'll say it again
yeah if i make it i'd be amazed
your heart breaks
and you'll be left behind
it's quite an excursion
those least qualified
but when i'm in my car
well they say the road's a dangerous place
i feel like i'm god
bet he wont say that any more
take my baby's body to the city dump
off with her head
come back with sixteen or more
but ask yourself first
my own words choke me
i know i've played this game before
but only coffins and bones remain
blackball your evil ways
and throw a molotov cocktail at your car
i'll dance around the pretty flames
i see the way the salesmen stare into the sun
saving yourself
you dont want to change the world
and since you aint what you say
the gangs stake their own campus locale
hey they dont pay no mind
your never ending spree of death and violence and hate
hey man you talkin back to me
it's more than you can stand
right beside your bed
out on your own
no one hears you fall
come out swinging
all are gone and none agreed
cause then i dont have to try and make
it's cool to hate
yeah i hate everything
i hate the trendies
and i hate the geeks

our rendezvous never seem to end
she thinks she's the victim
i dont know why you're messed up
oh man she's got issues
i dont know why you're messed up
dont give a shit cause i'm not gonna budge
like an outcast you're out on your own
if you're awake look all around
dont be so alone
i believe in a changing of the guard
you will follow
hey now do you see me down the way
this special delivery is yours
cant break from my sins
and if i dont speak
i dont think that you relate
now dont get me wrong
all i know
dont let on if you cant find your way
this is no vietnam
if the man that's in your sights
where there casualty
when the pastor's music plays
i could never smile cause you
in that one day that changed our lives
chances thrown
jay committed suicide
i gotta go find my own way
open wide and swallow their meaning of life
there's no right and wrong way
but this lonely road has turned and you faded there
it's too late for me to change
goodbye my friend you've messed up again
slap on the wrist well not this time
that car looked so tempting so easy to drive
slap on the wrist well not this time
have a nice life
i want you
but with attitude i'm waiting so come on
dont get me wrong
i mean it
the same old way his drunken father did
what comes around well it goes around
and fat parents they have fat kids too
we are headed for obscurity
we better stop
or even use my hands
i try to explain but you just dont understand
i try to explain but you just dont understand
well my friend
i wont pay i wont pay ya no way
he wants more dinero just to stay at home
stop the man with the power
thinking they've got plenty of time
unify with that single line
like some frightened child
we might have a chance
you know i saw his woman
when cops are taking care of business i can understand
dont need a reason
they say they're keeping the peace
cant forgive this grudge is alive now
and i cant be friends
get on it out on it
me and my old lady
sit and sip on wine
when she's pawin and grabbin on me now
and when in that position
i dont think you can
each passing day every passing face
i need to be
i'll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
but losing out might feel okay all night
it could be methedrine
losing out might feel okay all night
aint gonna waste this life
you'll live like there's no tomorrow aint gonna waste this life
faster now you know i got no brakes
someone said it's all right
staring at the wall
i guess you lied they call it suicide
i should have known you went through it alone
i'm just living day by day
i'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
we carry on without even realizing why
we're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright
tonight i'm gonna rip it up
when we're hangin with the bro's
then you know
to destroy everything in my sight
cannot go by the letter
eighteen and life in chino
bust out on it original prankster
empty
well he'll see there comes a day
as you patrol this foreign land
will your buddies come and save your life
start a fight
to feel so different day to day
like i said before
kick him when he's down
'hey you're a riddle' i say as i move aside
watch the way the world goes
playing with our lives
bow down cause i see it before me
to be unchained
tension in this misty air
as we race to beat days dusky grin
you will follow
where blood is spilt
is your ecstasy in
if i could say
talking it out dont make it right
if you'd just stay
hitting me oh god
she said come over right away

he picked a candy bar up
no scrutiny
my friend was kinda hurtin
dont pick it up i say

like you were so much more
how does it feel
look at me while i look at you
i try to have an open mind
if we destroy each other
our star shines anyway
we're served up on a plate
but it's not
i swear i never will
same old stuff always drags me down
and it feels
and if i could trade
there's someone around me just a step behind
and it's more than i can take
your own preoccupation is where you'll go
well i know
like someone else was keeping score
some days my darkest friend is me again
who is gonna stay
cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay
cant you see like you saw anymore
doesnt matter who you've been
when i was a little boy
and i choose
they said they wouldnt make it
you just gotta do what you gotta do
as i'm looking back above me
once i saw a face that i believed in
show me a friend for life
who's at fault in this game of yours and mine
when i'll feel alive
all this time has whittled away
i've got a feeling it'll be a long time
while citizens bleed

when i'm ridin round the world and i'm doin this and i'm signin that
she made me cry she done me wrong
because i used to love her but it's all over now
it's not easy living on your own
to take his girl for granted if he can
and it's hard it's not easy
as she goes to sit on her own high chair

jumping jack flash
let's spend the night together now
let's spend the night together
let's spend the night together
love is strong and you're so sweet
i need some time
you make me hard you make me weak
we were sure we'd never see an end to it all
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
to dust i guess
belle of the fawning
i'm without anyone at all
this gun is loaded devoted
'cause i want you bad ah
but babe dont worry
the dead things
if it's the last thing we ever do
for always and ever is always for you
and the smile and the shake of your head
resigned to scraping paint
if you want love you must be love
cause for the moment we are free we seek to bind our release
it comes with mine
it all goes wrong
she digs the wives in our babies
to disappear in her
annie goes if you couldnt guess
what's the matter
the lame and the droll have needs
to let their feelings show
what if the stars would hesitate
what if what is isnt true
what if the clocks would hesitate
what are you gonna do
does that mean you've got to lose
does that mean you've got to lose
does that mean you've got to lose
and a child to my heart
we must never be apart
in you i feel so hungry
'cause you're the one that i adore
and i cant help but feel attached
we'll let the world spin on to another place
i'll be under the stairs forever
all of my senses ashamed
because you are
because you are
i let the travel begin
where the willows weep
become a mystery to gaze into
and whirlpools sleep you'll find me
in your head a thousand stars
and i could take you a million miles away
i want to believe in you and i heard you
may godspeed be with you
never meant to hurt anyone
that you had left behind
never meant to say anything
i wish i was blank
i wish i was blank
we should love like lovers do
lover when will you
since you ran away
tell me how
empty
empty
we are inside
and i need you
and i need you
and i want you
and all you are is brand new
love is drunk all the time
love is good all the time
coming down
and you come
and i hear you crawl
when you lie in your bed
long silent pause some applause
and i feel that way
and she was my lover so sweet
bang bang your dead hole in your head
i always wanted to be in a rock band but i guess maybe at the time that we started the band i was kind of afraid to play rock music because it wasnt very much in vogue
i dont give i unveil
i dont live i inhale
the slow dawn
away the slow dawn
ride on motherfer
right on motherfer
she loves me like a lover
as your things come undone
flower the pain will wash away away
what you wait for
close your eyes and sleep
i'll betray my tears
i'll betray myself
nothing left to say
wrapped my hurt in you
didnt want to lose you once again
until the bitter bitter end of the world yeah
splinters in the eye sentiments remain
now my gates are high my friends even higher
the will to live the urgency to move
cause when i speak of me it's me i ask of you
soot in my hair
with her and i fall
and i will grieve remember thee
i am one as you are three
try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
see you i am one
and all i ever wanted was everything
and that's nothin
empty
your city to burn
try to look for something
empty
i peer thru curtains on empty streets
empty
i read your letters
empty
cause i have survived
and his spiders from mars
while you're so far from home
while you're so far from home
i was alive
wasted sunsets
you'll never pull me in
in my body
and i'll always need her more than she could ever need me
there are some things i'll live without
the sun and the son
with the sun
empty
ooh jackie your not so down
of what you're doing and that you dont care
ooh jackie what fun you have had
down in the belly of the beast
and live for always
leave this world all wrong wrong wrong
tied her heart in ribbons
than she has given me
fade away i want to see her
take it all the way down
built my life around you
i took my love and took it down
let me give the world to you my love
flicker fades the nitrate down to
let me give the world to you my love
silly i know i'm silly
but an officer is knocking at my door
i swear i saw her raise her hand and wave goodbye
i got mine too over i got mine and i got you
this in blood
it has begun
my losses mounted as i climbed across the hole
i fly above you yes i do
i really love you and i mean you
of course i love you baby
yeah i'm always there for you
a certain sun keeps rising
yeah i'm always there for you
spy the fragile heart so cursed
i've always been afraid to die but i think i'm more afraid to live
wishing you were real to me
life is a sentimental way
black wings carry me so high
safely held beneath the waves
is it bright where you are
crashing down undone
the sky cannot ignore us
and in your darkest hour
and i'm in love
there's so much doubt in every heart
i cant stop i cant breathe i cant think
if you ever need me
and i felt it too
i cant stop i cant breathe i cant think
to cut open your heart
this love will stand as long as you
the heavens spit me out
have the people changed
and i am shattered no
oh oh oh oh oh
you can watch the world devoured in it's pain
forever waiting on the ways of your desire
stranglehold of god machines
we can never have enough
you know i'm not dead
punching thru your skin
it matters what you do
everywhere you are
phase unwound
even if you're low
it's all a part of you
and no one comes for free
this is the last song
let me rest
you're all a part of me now
give me peace
just in time to prove
and if i fall
tomorrow's just an excuse away
and for a moment i lose myself
you can make it last forever you
crashing down my freinds
crashing down again
to never linger
be enough
to this romance
as the curtain falls we bid you all goodnight
upon your stage
as freedoms die easy
so thus charmed
they're bleeding the orchid
a guarantee to spoil our rot
anesthetized i'm hollow
i wanna love
someone weeps and instantly i'm thrown
for god and country i'll fight
it's too late for everyone
for god and country we'll die
in this time of god and country
but i dont want them anymore
renew and rivive
life's a bummer
love is real
and it's a chance i'll have to take
i'll sing along
i'm in love with you
with everyone of you
inside your head
inside your head
imbued with distractions
and left a sad peter pan
and i wish you luck
but you knew all along
for taking you away
i saw you there
in nitrous overcast
your innocence is treasure your innocence is death
but belief is not to notice believe is just some faith
to appear to disappear
the night has come to hold us young
if you have to go i will get by
if you have to go i will get by
i lost my soul lost i'll stay
i feel free
it's so unfair
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
this message is for anyoine who dares to hear a fool
i dont need your love to disconnect
and you make it so real i dont need your love to disconnect
and shoul i fall from grace here with you
too late to turn to turn back now i'm running out of sound
cast into the world
kiss kiss all of this
shot full of diamonds
i cant believe them
and give it all away
and she taught me many many things
will you tell me why
to the center of the earth
all are scared
you in all
she can hear glass calling
not much left to cook
i'm glass
you put up the walls
empty
you put up the walls
shattering glass
scarecrows and disease haunt us all
gives us an awful sound
what a sound
did you hold onto
will i make it thru
heavy metal machine
let the world forgive the past
in their metal machines
to all the rust it brings
let me go
heavy metal machine
but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too
love to love to love what you adore
will you let me down
but not for long
will you let me down
and in your sad machines
burning up in speed
lost inside the dreams of teen machines
you had to wait your turn
seven is all you seek
you left a hole in the wall
sneaking out early to a secret place
kisses and noise
and sons who cry
i do
it's all down low
little fun
war sunshine and grace
but warm sunshine and graves
torn broken and frayed
and in my mind i'm everyone
with filth and disease
in my mind i'm everyone of you
wrap myself in you
wrap myself in you
wrap myself in you
on the telephone
'cause i'm waiting for you
i'm your pillar of stone
james we just flew in from chicago and boy are our arms tired
of the mess you've made
to anyone at all
i am sleeping
behind me
i've been sleeping
boys to the bone
of the mess you've made
be ashamed
the same old rain
between the raindrops
between the raindrops
and i'm just trying to talk to you
and i'm just trying to walk with you
my love
and if you think they'll watch you now
to get your love without
calling out a warm surrender
cause it's now or never
real love
is it time
real love will listen
demons' scorn surround relax
i would conceal your way
open your eyes
we're gonna rock on
rock on
which is the way that's clear
rock on
i said rock on
hey kids rock and roll
come on come on
with your hands above your heart
come on come on
i torch my soul to show
the moon is out the stars invite
i shall be free free
the world that i am pure
i think i'll leave tonight
free of those voices inside me
from the depths of my soul
and ruthless in my teach
suffer her heart
soul power
soul power
i'm on the case
love me tender
got to have it
got to have it
soul power soul power
taste my need
empty
before i'm dead and gone
empty
hot alive dead mucked fish eyes doe eys
it means cheap liar smartass piece of shit
try that once god is dead
like a cup of mercury phosphate
a million piece puzzle
my my my have we thrown
i'm just one man
and mountain wilds
but beauty knows your name
crashing hard through days of pain
the last rose of summer
into the stars
meant to be
who wouldnt be the one you love
travel the world
i'm telling you how much i need and bleed for
starla dear
i'm in here
fly like a bird
we are
but heaven is everywhere
the stars that shine stars that bleed
island of white noise
about me and all my dreams
i'll be your stubmleine
they cant get to you
all may say
taken down your only son and what he means to me
moving tears of pain
you'll be lost to me
i dont know just where you've been
where are we going
take my hand i lost where i began
and you're all i see
and she calls to him
disaster and love vengeance and dust
and she calls to him
inside the future of a shattered past
why do the same old things keep on happening
i dont want to fight
if real ever was
cant stand the blazing sun
to sing for
dont break this oath
cant stand the morning rain
and if you love her
blew blew
that i love her so
what i'd hoped to find
i had no cause just 17 days of rain
and dont say i hadnt told you so
in watching it all fall apart
write down the words as written
lick clean the dirty fingers
cover me with your soul
so true when you lie
stay with me for a while
casualties of their own flesh
the secret sights hide in you
shot down i stood
empty
a son of god you know you must arrive
go grab a glimpse of any star
bring the light
you cant deny
empty
secret destroyers hold you up to the flames
and what do you want i want to change
jesus was an only son
she dont smother me
once you see her
i'll make you feel happy
as lovely as a wish granted true
i hope you make it june
i hope you make it june
'cause everybody's business is everybodys' business
everyone's gonna be in charge
everyone's gonna be in charge
everybody's business is everybodys' business
i need a strength that i cannot betray
'cause we know where they fear to tread
could you rest inside the sleep
who wants honey
who wants honey
tell me all of your secrets
freak out
who wants that honey
who wants that honey
who wants honey
it's beautiful and secretly the gifts still hide
there'll be toys for everyone
i'm a clone i know i'm fine
no more problems on the way
six is having problems
i'm all alone so are we all
i'm all alone so are we all
to live by circumstance once again
to deserve your love and sympathy
you were never meant to belong to me
just rest your weary head
to grab her attention swift and quick
and in the land of star crossed lovers
now we were steady to the pictures
now i stay out 'till sunday i have to say i stayed with friends
who kids you to oblivion
past sidewalk ashes
the pretty boys dive
you love him more than this
hearing love slip away
my daydream dream
motherfucking crazy
you ask yourself
destination unknown
life is so strange
inside of me and such a part of you
and leave you like they left me here
my love
cut that little child
disarm you with a smile
the killer in me is the killer in you
is everyone ashamed
these lonely days when will they ever stop
i was meant to beg from my knees
well then they cant win
this doomsday clock ticking in my heart
reel to reel is living rarity
i sit by and watch the river flow
get out get out
you say i'm lucky
bring it down
arising alt lyrics
does anyone anyone wanna be you
some will let you eat their razorblade
cried out to be true
i can still hear you when you dream
nothing left for me to do
i meant i think of me
i hate i'm not
it's not enough just a touch
goodnight always to all that's in your heart
to destroy for no one
is your innocence all that you can give
pick your pockets full of sorrow
i'm rumored to the straight and narrow
shut my mouth and strike the demons
and old enough to always feel this
you're an easy chair
and if you say you will
medellia of my eyes
in a goldfish laugh
apart somehow
chasing down the alleyways
empty
cause from the mouths of babes comes nothing
well you can never tell
as all things must surely have to end
can a taste of love be so wrong
and i knew the distance to the sun
and i knew the silence of the world
i hum it to my blue heaven
and baby makes three
i'll break into
my dahlia dear
my dahlia
i could destroy you
your saliva screws
come back to me my mistake
i hope he never lets me down again
he promised me i'm safe in his houses
never want to put my feet back down on the ground
let's fill these hours and kill desire
i'm never lost
i lost my place
not worth saying seems i'm free
i'm on my own i'm on my own
you've got to know somehow
i've gotta go so far away so far away
left for dead as you sweep out the cold
what you said i dont want
once in a while for you
you'll make it so alone
come surrender my son
to make you so proud in my eyes
i go crawlin crawlin over me
all the world must know that i loved you so
that lovers make amends
so far i still know who you are
lovers while we meet
and if you spin your love around
and with this ring i wed thee now
no one will come to save you
bastard son of a bastard son of
and i remember my birthdays
before i even learned to speak
on aching autobahn
because it's time to arrive
highway warm sing silent poetry
but now it's just a matter of grace
you make me real
you make me
and take you home into the night
before i get out
before i get out
today is
today is the greatest
today is the greatest
my angel wings
i want to turn you
believe believe in me believe
believe believe in me believe
and the embers never fade in my city by the lake
the impossible is possible tonite
it's just more of the same old same
and she's sick of the same old s
my heart embraced
hang on to your life
what you believe
for your fears i am ringing
try to hold on
as desires burn my ghost trains
try to hold on
and know we'll go free
closed for days
empty
what will they do to me
empty
i got to ask you why
i wanna fight a revolution
let me embrace every single living thing
not everyone can feel honored
while you sleep
feel me
i will flaunt it
suddenly i'm
to be in love
i hold it true
feel love all around
to be in love
to be in love
vanity stands naked at my door
vanity cries why
he's on that dirt road
vanity wants everything and more
to strike me down
and dinners draw the passengers
yes i am waiting
and once again i'll pretend to know the way
we only come out at night
just maybe we could lose ourselves this time
for june angels so far from home
all your prayers
she says she wants a baby
what must i do
will you crawl
to try to stay away
to let them jab it in
white spider
will drain you off
the end is near
shadows streak
around my heart
and if i fall
we're giving it up to the earth
i was the first one
we're giving it up to the sun
transformed new wire
taking over
look ma the sun is shining on me
and every light i've found
and every light i've found
and setting sun
our age of the hours
and soon there's notions of blood on his hands
the jealous ingrates
run i will run
knows that she could never hide
i am made of shamrocks i am made of stern stuff
and into the eyes of the jackyl i say ka boom
so save your prayers
bullshit fakers enchanted kingdoms
everybody seems to know when he's around
i think my journey's just begun
do you think he'll mind
that scarred and bruised and left me blind
who am i running from
nobody comes nobody calls
if you're looking for me
i'm alive with something inside of me
and i dont think i'm coming down
and if he sees it i know i'll know repeat
i have no control
acting as your slave i drink for barricades
i dont need them i'm there
if my skin looks tired and old from living
they press down on me
i hear the driving of the nail
sits there examining her thighs
repeat chorus
when i was a boy funny things
and she placed a hand between our lips
as far as you're concerned
no no i didnt i could i'm sure i would if i knew that
you know the one that takes you to the places
well i never pray
from one day to the next
where all the things meet yeah
no no no no no
ever been down
we could steal a car
we were just heading for the sun
there you were on the floor cut up
oh blue show me something new
blue dont forget the word i warned you
i have come to set the record straight
so close to force him begging please
knowing i'd regret this very day
empty
empty
empty
you get your kicks from seeing me on the floor
empty
in that dream of mine
in that dream of mine
in that dream of mine
you see through me
and waving we rode that parade for awhile
and ride the wave along the mitigated mile
so take your time
dont you feel alive
i need it because it takes me where i cant find
'cause it takes me to where i cant find
'cause i dont need no cause
so it goes
i'm just a poor little wifeless fella
yes there's love if you want it
dont sound like no sonnet my lord
i stop to say hello
oh by now
oh can you comfort me
that if we really care
oh no no
oh lord
keep on pushing 'cause i know it's there
spoonful of sugar to wash it down
and god save the queen oh and pardon the king
it's me throwing stones from the stars
how my life seemed to change in a matter of days
they tie me down through with you
once seemed loud he's not so anymore
there aint no way any super girls gonna change my world
she's got a lovely shitcom family adopted one of every single race
this time i'm comin down
'cause i passed down my old street
like a cat in a bag waiting to drown
they just make you worse
repeat and fade out
and battle with whoever hides assault disguised as dancing
i cant be held responsible
now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor
and i listened to her song
that's when the river ran dry
but would walk on the other side
but it's too much just to be
that's when the river was all but a spill
i was dealing soul and other white
with my baby's crime in my veins
dont even know which way i'm going to
dont ask why
open up your eyes let me get inside
open up your eyes let me get inside
how's the world gonna from take me
think the words without the song
he'll never save you too and you know
lookin back on my life
are things i could of changed
i am growing
gonna rise straight into the light
there is time
you left
i couldnt change
a bottle meant for two a glass that's full of legs but free of any fingerprints
be very very careful not to
another velvet morning for me yeah
and more dead than alive
and life is a game
and my tongue is twisted
you've tried
rows and rows of animals their shiver skin is painted different shades
victoria she loves her name
a social climb by offering love
empty
subscription card falls to the floor
another villain on the cover
who needs virtual world
have you ever seen the book
does anyone need me
do you gotta be straight on the line
do i gotta be straight
well i gotta be straight
there'll be no better time
believe me friend
i hope you see what i see
pills under my pillow
an apocalypse of pity
i'm ugly getting over you
one beat about half an hour
i feel no pain
where the geese go to
is to stay home drinking the thought of it is bringing me down
it's ten years later you're still a fornicator
you're a slap on the wrist you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
in march i met my wonderlove
i only need you for this weekday evening
in between
to save your time and give yourself
concert hall promoters kneeling
lacking substance story telling
kiss me idle
one time lazy another time dear despite all your fears of outlasting my love
i'll thank her 'till the day that i die
so here we go
love in the
i'm shakin
i took her to a room and i showed her myself
no love in the jar baby please be my star
oh but it seems that i pushed you in my life
misunderstood and left unanswered
one last time before i leave you
imagine the future
slippery slimy road down
tonight i took a snapshot guess i got a tender spot
park near the backstage pass a lot of underage
yeah it's good to be guaranteed
oh my my
with fire in my hands
i know just who i am
something in my liberty
gotta love that'll never die
oh my my
hey my friend you better leave now
with the whole world staring at you
you were to share these dreams
my voice got softer
i hear you cryin for me
disease as you proclaim
i've got to medicate myself again
and when the fight is over
stop driving me into the ground
stop driving me into the ground
miles away
ms marceau
accounts are empty and my friends deserted long ago but
say good bye to my new friends
in a neon wilderness
i'm getting to love the thought of
so remember one thing
i hope you understand that
if you're gonna make a break make a clean break
you help yourself because you're sensing
every inch of north and south
will you think of me
i'll be waiting here
you can make the darkest day worthwhile
i'll be here for you
keep the thought and i know you've been hotter
but it's all the same
she got my woe
empty
well they're reaching for the door
than most are in a lifetime
i'm visiting
the winter wont be keeping her around
will my last breath be a yawn
i was going to tell you who i wanted
i know it's there but i just cant see it
she's my mind lover
ever drive you mild
something light
in the endless life
endless life
i've written to this date
how similar the shopping but at different stores
that's gonna make this pain slip away
and i wanna feel
we can
with those who can relate 2 months a day a wakeup
listen up dear father your generation bothers me and i'll leave you to grieve
love is not stable
and if i keep my chin up
love leads to tears
has died a little
my life is a boat being blown by you
to me you're like a setting sun
sounds like the perfect way
i'm gonna get me somehow
whatever you want
we could go up one more
come on
with nothing ahead just the deepest blue
you rise then you're gone
to end my life
hearing stories that were never you would stay with me forever
the world is giving you the run around
that the smile on your face
you may be full of life's frustrations
and i wanna find it with you
but i'll get my kicks
then cigarettes burned afterwards that's when she said
having a headline
now that the thrill is mine for the moment
for your abuse but not intended for internal use
i've got to tell you my tale
so come with me in bed
that living is for other men
i want to tell you my tale
dont dream away your life 'cause it is mine
and though i'm asking please dont give specifics
but this chemistry just turns me
i'm not trying to be anything at all
keep your chin up keep your back straight
nobody said this was going to be easy
when there's nobody listening
i will go anywhere she goes
i should be half a mile from here
until it's over
and your friends on your own
when there's nothing left
empty
i've got to get rid of this hole inside
with no company
cant you hear this beauty in life
you know you've gotta
you see it all
you've got to move me up
it's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind
it's like pushing locked to get in that mind
you held me to a second chance
but i could never let another day go by
every word so intimidating
all the years that evaporated
supposing i'm a saviour
'cause springtime is for dancing
i'm laughing 'cause they dont know who i am
flames rise like butterflies
gardening malice for murderers
words frozen will thaw when i am wasted i am better shut up
but every minute i'm losing one by one
for the ugly ever after
with everyone and everything i guess it was the beauty of
but we are invalid
the reverend girl
now my lover smells like
hate the way it is now
hand jobless homeless man on the moon beam
bush campaign in the ask yourself absorbing junior
and we are laid out on the floor of this galaxy of yours
i hold my paintbrush tightly and fill in any empty nail holes
the watercloth had cleared the answer in my mind
she loves everybody she loves everyone
she hasnt heard a word that i have said
an epitaph defaced
i feel my baby's on the rise
and hanging out until we're hung
speak to me barely if at all
squeeze an instant out of me
i'll take you down the only road i've ever been down
no no no no no no nonononononofading away
and i'm a million different people
you know the one that takes you to the places
i cant change my mind
ever been down
i have come to set the record straight
so close to force him begging please
knowing i'd regret this very day
and then your attention was never enough
to keep yourself at a distance
it's easy in the early afternoon
it's harder when she's easy but it's easy
i know i can be gray
i know i can be gray
dig it
she's never letting me forget
and i'm barely juvenile
ever drive you mild
refused to date someone outside the guidelines
man it's so appreciated summer day intoxicated
drink it down dear brother
love is not strong
to unhappy endings
you gotta move on
if something inside you
save yourself leave me behind you would if you had half a mind
save yourself leave me behind you would if you had half a mind how vulnerable you are
wherever i find it
you're stuck waiting for your new beginning
i guess you've got your options open
people say a prayer every day
it burned like a cancer when the answer did occur to me
keep it moving people
cause it feels right
to leave you as tomorrow's dawning
will he be the one
every inch of north and south
will you think of me
i'll be waiting here
you can make the darkest day worthwhile
i'll be here for you
in march i met my wonderlove
i only need you for this weekday evening
in between
to save your time and give yourself
concert hall promoters kneeling
lacking substance story telling
kiss me idle
one time lazy another time dear despite all your fears of outlasting my love
scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles
if and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends
and it's good to be home tonight
there's nowhere to go after the show
since you made it well it isnt the same
you were to share these dreams
my voice got softer
i hear you cryin for me
disease as you proclaim
i've got to medicate myself again
and when the fight is over
stop driving me into the ground
stop driving me into the ground
miles away
ms marceau
accounts are empty and my friends deserted long ago but
dismiss the notion
and all the complications
when there's nobody listening
knee deep in the river flow
never a word of intention
i should be half a mile from here
i'm an ominous man
you held me to a second chance
but i could never let another day go by
every word so intimidating
all the years that evaporated
her mouth was full of dirty words
i wouldnt count on the good times
you slither in these sheets
goliath sits and watches
'cause springtime is for dancing
i'm laughing 'cause they dont know who i am
we know who we are
i'm in the photograph
pin cushion pierce my sides
and every lover i'm losing one by one
evening comes and the butterflies are
stained my hands on her antique
with a reverend girl
now my lover smells like rain
empty
and when i leave i close the door to this galaxy of yours
leads my gaze up to the ceiling
a glitter gown in orbit left to satellite a waning star
flashing lights the music's loud i'm questioning if this is destiny
you are the only one
my country 'tis of thee sweet land of irony
spoonful of sugar to wash it down
i'll crank it for you all
the fear of bargain basements are gone without a trace yeah
tune me in tune me out
i should have known that i cant change the world by staring at it
it's a boring phase so part the wave and drop the dead as driftwood surfer
i wont be held responsible
we've tried to wash our hands of all of this
we'd be lonely blue and lonely
that's when the river ran dry
that's when the river ran dry
to be lonely blue and lonely
every soul on the shore
there among debris find casual in casualty
it's not pretty underneath
the sky is lavender with ivory clouds that threaten drops of finger paints
stripping flowers at pedal pace
i grew up while she she grew out
victory doesnt taste the same
see how they twist and shout
and up my back a shooting pain
backing up your screaming guitar
do i gotta be straight on the line
but i gotta be straight on the line
i know she is safe and building her disguise
i know that you're more beautiful now
i will shun the radio
cause you call with little warning gotta work in the morning
and your trunk of returnables is weighing your convertible down
and all you can manage the home field advantage
i had my world strapped against my back
it's fifty years stood where he stands
just like me just moved on
she bites the hands of the lion
with a thorn in her eyes
and lay beside the scarecrow
she always gets it right
elvis need of repair
while angels a prayer
well i cant take a care
we took them hard we took them up against the wall
another one in the dark
you may still need me
right out of my tree
as she cut all the strings
ashes to ashes and six feet under face down in a box
givin you headaches and all those mental scores
you never gave yourself a chance
someone young in the winds of a revolution
asleep at the wheel
with a face full of mud even though you were only joking
like candle wax that sun melts into the ocean
come home where you belong
now outside faces cry
empty
empty
using your clothes as a blanket and a bed
hanging by the ankles in a skeleton ravine
your fingertips are broke and your knees dont bend
and you cant tie another another knot of hope
and are holding me
and bright lights
just for me
it aint my last try
and no one is impressed
empty
but i forget to be vain
how long an hour can take
and i dont hear a thing
there is dark
you know how hard i try
there's a darkness that's inside
there is no distance that i dont see
there is trouble in my life
the city's been leveled
there's something moving
now i'm treadin high water
we're already on it
i fear
admit it now
till then
i'm in a hurry
in the way down
i couldnt climb
or if i ever learn
i've got
so hard to identify you
she dont back down
now there's all this talk about dying
now there's all this talk about dying
can she see me behind that window
but she sure is pretty
once i get inside
gonna take a walk right through these walls
it's not that you've done something wrong
now we've all made good use of you
but you wont ever make us proud
this revolutions due
but you wont ever make us proud
when something you have never had
does that make you sad
or get a hold
empty
there aint no saying
just wouldnt ever come
than you would believe
we never thought
here in pleasantville
we can be us just for one day
we can be heroes
oh my god
with personal armies for everyone in between
right from wrong
oh my god
guess it was never understood
she stood tall in the fallen rain
who'll see
and walks through me
my honey bee
use your words
now open your arms
i cant see my hands
if you let someone help you
right into the light
and just let me in
on a world that you could never have
come up from deep holes
and the worst we could do
or the morning haze
baby if you never got sick
you'll se me dead
empty
lookin back at the crash site
but all of these horses
with all their illusions of choices
but there's pressures from inside
i've been waste deep
that follows in rows
they may ring before i'm through
i've been gone
you know i'd even learn
just screaming to be delivered
something this complex
i was once lost
i feel all right
and i know
your schoolgirl style
and cut myself on the wires
but you've got me covered up in hives
just dont look back 'cause i wont be there
i dont need an invitation
as you abandon me
get back in line
may take two to tango but boy it takes one to let go
last slowdance to this romance on my own
is possible
right in
that it's looking for
now maybe that's
i buried my horse
i just found out
i'm bringing down my suitcase now
i had right now
i always thought i knew enough
when you're packing up your things to leave
they're including everyone
this is murder 101
we'd only just begun
and keep it all inside
but i wont let you fall
well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
there's got to be something better than
somewhere here in front of me
it feels just like a beat up truck
empty
raspberry beret
i put her on the back of my bike
the kind u find in a second hand store
they say the first time aint the greatest
raspberry beret
raspberry beret
i just might stay down
i aint sorry baby
i've been down so long
but you're usually
and then i saw the lids of my eyes
if she's been havin the same old dreams
the river ends right as she goes
your whisper's a scream now
little girl in your white ice skates
could sell
but it aint ever far from the backyard
now i heard it from a junkie that my old lady
come on and give me just one kiss
sleepwalker dont be shy
just dont leave me at the window
the sleepwalker in me
when i'm dead asleep dreamin
you shouldnt blame me
oooooh as if it wasnt hard enough
an epidemic i cannot outlast
you want to make it so much harder
this bed just cant be made
now some flowers they never bloom
and we can buy that diamond ring
and just about any other thing
with somebody else's money
to swing through the skies openings
i know they're listening
we can buy anything
he's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links
it's so cold and blown all apart
and anyone with anything has already begun to think
he's killing me getting free
they shoot arrows up into the skies
now if there's a smile on my face
now there's some sad things known to man
decided to go
empty
his best friend come along
with his girl
you always said that you needed some
take a load off fanny
go down miss moses there's nothing you can say
he said ``i will fix your rat if you'll take jack my dog''
who sent me here with her regards for everyone
she hadnt even paid yet
she's gonna pick a star in the night
man i think i'm gonna buy myself a rolls
out here among us
out of every every box
there's three ways
that's left
then you can just burn up
loosen off that pretty french gown
spread your wings and let me come inside
it's gonna be alright
i will show you the light
some people dont care
just isnt enough
anymore than you're givin
like myself
and i worked with my brothers there
the vanity to believe
i'm so happy that you're my friend
when you cant move at the top of a ferris wheel
man i wish i could once be you
oooh ooh ooh oooh
oooh ooh ooh oooh
everything's goin bad
everything's goin bad
that nobody's slept in
but none of them matter
but nothing's ever as good
i need someone whose price hasnt been met
i heard a shot
i want to start again
you come around here
homicide is emotional
now you aint gotta stand up tall
and the morals that they worship will be gone
we wont get fooled again
pick up my guitar and play
empty
pick up my guitar and play
32 feathers in my brand new indian headdress
where's my baby i dont know
no 29
of the store where they let me play the organ
it's a thing named it
but i must have sold my car
it's a thing named it
the dotted line
you might be sailing 'cross the sea
with rubber lining the walls
i know monkey see but monkey's dead for you it would be wrong
i'm insane
and he calls when i'm stuck out in the rain
we could walk but we'd never get there
get outta my lane
get outta my way
it's just a full day's drive away
you know that that's a bitch
because alienations for the rich
and i'm feeling poorer every day
and her voice is a backwards record
or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
they dont need me here and i know you're there dont need me
ana ng and i are getting old
become a robot clang clang
empty
here's hoping you dont hoping you dont
and when i get there
beneath the planet
not to put too fine a point on it
like the longines symphonette it doesnt rest
but really i'm not actually your friend
blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
say i'm the only bee in your bonnet
make a little birdhouse in your soul birdhouse in your soul
say i'm the only bee in your bonnet
blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
all the empty places in the world
i dont feel three hundred
and the microscope reveals the scope
on the only nice part of me
daddy'll sing bass
is he a dot or is he a speck
usually kind to smaller man
does he feel totally worthless
see the constellation ride across the sky
just a guy made of dots and lines
can you hear what i see in the sky
the city lights think nothing's there
just thrill me through and through
and just make up your mind
'cause i'm getting sentimental over you
the dumbwaiter's a monkey
forget about it 'cause she's a
from the top of a tree
she's actual size but she seems much bigger to me
nationwide believe
hangs in portrait
words fail
as they step aside
in your mind you have her on a pedestal
all the money
she's actual size but she seems much bigger to me
when you're following an angel
the secretary says he's on another line
does it mean you have to throw your body off a building
calling you an angel calling you the nicest things
but they run out of gas
he wants a shoehorn the kind with teeth
i'd proclaim that i'm one too
we could be sleeping in the flowers
you'd proclaim that you're an island
we'll be sleeping in the flowers
now we're sleeping in the flowers
you proclaim that you're an island
then we float into the harbor
i want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
from the position at your feet where i stand
thank you

empty
we love you spideri promise not to kill you
down down down you go
putting all reason aside you exchange
or serious injury
in the spiral ahead and consumed in the shape
but everyone wants to see that groovy thing
the spiralling shape will make you go insane
i see you from my spy plane baby

to meet the criminal government agent who oppresses me
if by random whim one occurs to me
i'd burn all the uniforms

i'm listening to the radio

your embrace and my collapse

i've got a match
his oratory filled his foes with fear
made sure the tarriffs fell

and i'm hitting them again but i dont know where i put my notes
and when i lean my head against the frosted shower stall
take your close'nplay

and then the ghost of my dance instructor
we were waving our arms out the window
turn around found turn around round
she set your goldfish free
slowly twisting twisting
that she'll take back
in the wind twisting
how come you never look me in the eye
i'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
to wind a piece of string around
let the people crawl inside
and wear it on my real head
prosthetic foreheads on their heads
to wind a piece of string around
every woman has a second half
striking out the batter she became

empty
and if i were at home they'd find me there
when it rains it snows i wonder why
but there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
and does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
and you sighed at the cracks in the ceiling all the time
in his mind he can find how you're feeling all the time
she looked at me i looked at something
and so i'm having a wonderful time
i'd like to change your mind
and that's be you
there's only one thing that i like
whistling in the dark
whistling whistling whistling whistling
whistling whistling whistling whistling

and we almost figured out how we'll get along
cat's cradle origami
you just forgot your one pet name for me
a womans voice on the radio can convince you you're in love

deep inside of you
i taste your scent in the wind
in the matrix of your garden
and you put me all through the worst
coming for you can we get this all together
are mine mine mine mine mine
coming for you can we get this all together
i think about it nightly how you opened up your life for me
like when you found me out for the fake i am
you said you are of the earth and i am of the sky
farther from you every day
winter blooms with the summer flowers
i should've watched my step
so sweet for you said please go with you
i keep on forgetting myself
dont want to be so complicated
and i keep on forgetting myself
there's another chip you havent spent
the god of wine comes crashing through
i cant keep it all together
and i said no no no
all alone on your face
everything is fine i'm lonely all the time
i grab at you i cant stop grabbing at you
so i dont know how so much pain still gets in
the stone returns again
blown open wide
i can wait for a long time
can i graduate can i graduate
echo fading we cant let go
wont die on the vine
can i get my punk ass off the street
and i feel just like jesus' son
heroin death of me
and i guess that i just dont know
i didnt even know why
in a horror show
we want wild sex
out on his darkened sea
i wonder what are we fighting for
when there's no one there to talk to
dont see lightning like last fall
how's it going to be
how's it going to be how's it going to be
oh you do you do
you make me want you
you want to know how deeply my soul goes
a candle burns to fight off the gloom
riding on the road with friends
do you think you are invisible
but she's got other ideas what is good for you
so have you
so do you
i keep on motoring i keep on motoring
you could cut ties with all the lies
i know something's wrong
and i do not think anyone knows
that ledge my friend
i know just how you spend your time
the world could end we wouldnt hear it
all your friends afflicted
i know just what's on your mind
all your friends afflicted
i dont want to go to london
your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
losing a whole year
the whole goddamned day in bed
and i dont wanna play no more
it crashes through the windows
visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
i would like to build something
the surface is everything but i could never do that
i go home to the coast
and i've never been so alone
but i i can feel this narcolepsy slide
into another nightmare
how'd you like to be alone and drowning
i never let you go
i never let you go
if there's a reason it's lost on me
that's a good idea break a promise to your mother
that girl is like a sunburn i would like to save
who can show me how to have a good time
i'm crying in my beer again
and in the darkness candle light across my face
this is a lonely tale
cuz it's gonna be one of those christmas days
merry christmas
it's been a long time been a long time
i'll make do with none
i'll take on anyone
to walk with the mighty
well the dragonflies float on
so i go out looking for the right one
is anyone sick of being nervous and annoyed
fooling anyone
she says love i wont feel sick
come on scooby doo
you're ready and you're willing
keep on smiling what we go through
i was taking sips of it through my nose
how do i get myself back to the place where you said
and when the plane came in she said she was crashing
i'm scared i'm not coming down
the sky was gold it was rose
the one in the summer where we used to smoke pot
but girl if you would let me
urban life decays
there's a knock to his fist as he swings
the joke's on you
so glad you let me stay around
jumping through the hoop of your ear
and it's not the way i want to go
you touch the tattoo of the sun
i've never caught you in a lie
and nothing left
and i felt all right
the clothes she wears mis fit
cause i know all the dirty things you like to do
i walk haight street to the store
i only know because i carry you around
and i'm hanging on your words
the words they use so lightly
i've seen car wreck kids walk away from it
i'll make it all my home
tell me something i dont understand
when we were close
you must explain why this must be
but you dont understand my point of view
no not at all
i have your face in a photo in high school
another lullaby go sing oh
it's who we are now who we are
living great days with the shade of the wind
forgive me
where does time go now on the wake for young souls now
and the bruises that you feel will heal
well i never claimed to understand what happens after dark
till you're walking down shaking that ass again
now you're wounded
you're screaming i dont care baby i dont care
ever since you've been gone
my friends said i should settle for any port in a storm
hey 'cause i know that the rainll keep pourin on the pane
girl it's been a long time since i've seen sunshine
i know there's got to be
i know there's got to be
leave all these rainy days behind
i'm a slave to the sun it aint cuttin me no slack
aint no glory in this livin
her daddy would holler and run to the door
we were rebels chasin time against the wind
we'd never be the same again
it always ends
punched a hole in the wall of his world
karen she had a long time dream
talkin about bein just friends
finally own a car that doesnt break down on the freeway
all i want is a life
i'm sick of the crumbs i want a piece of that pie
say exactly how you feel
embrace the gift of time
in every breath of who you are
we'll lock the world outside
timing his past teachings they fade
then i said sir you dont understand
we've felt the hand of the devil felt his breath our my skin
have we lost our wings
i dont know why you gotta be angry all the time
i never quite made it back to the one i was before
peanuts in a bottle
back when a hoe was a hoe
i miss back when
i'm readin street slang for dummies
and when you said i'm down with that
coke was a coke
i was fifteen when my daddy died mama worked two jobs just to get by
he might have been sober but i brought the whiskey
that's all between the river and me
there might have been blood but they never saw it
i'm just a blank sheet of paper
what he wants to say
he's almost asleep pen in hand
and i'm still a blank sheet of paper
somewhere and lock the door
repeat chorus
so she cant be really gone
what more proof do you need
the two of hearts to mark her page
empty
the doctor says 'man your numbers they dont lie'
on a lover's lee with a freeway view
and just follow the road
remind me of you
trying to make this old town new again
and i know what i gotta do
and in his eyes i heard him say
lord knows she should've seen right through me
about the time you turned from me
the pages start to turn
here's to the corners yet to turn
my tired excuses just dont fit
so here's to the clown down in the mouth
a new wind is gonna find your sail
out in this brave new world you seek
br late at night when you're not sleepin and light falls across your floor
it's just that kinda day
make me forget be my drug get me high on your touch
up there in your high society
yes sir yes ma'am
can be a real good man
yes i am
in the back of that red rag top
in the morning light
well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
i was back in that red rag top
livin on refried dreams
shootin tequila
my head is poundin in this border town fog
oh i'm messed up in mexico
'cause my heart beats to a different drum
i might follow the sun
i gotta go where i've never been
you've always been good at helping me forget
la la la la la la la la la la la
i dont want to do her wrong
and we go rolling down this highway
i thank god you're here with me
and set this circus down
dont it just fly by wild and free
we had the summer all to ourselves
dont it just fly by wild and free
every night and day they telephone her
i know it by the way they hang around
when they start talking she starts walking
and though the story had to end
so try and face the cold hard fact
back to walkin on your knees
back to drinkin in no time
empty
i dont know why he cant find the words
wishing i could just be your tear
i'd do anything
and yesterday i knew just what you wanted
just to see you smile
i'm gonna tie up these loose ends
i fought and lied i drank too much
that's the old me sittin there
i fought and lied i drank too much
i just walked in and you were gone
but it has to be is true
empty
my friends are always giving me
cause yo've given me the most beautiful set of wings
there's not much that i need
i'm so glad you're here today
it's hard when the devil wont get off your back
skeletons and ghosts are hiding in the shadows
and imagine you're with me
oh oh let me love you
you'd see yourself through my eyes
let me love you
oh oh let me love you
with a lot of life before me
i went rocky mountain climbin
and all the sudden goin fishing
what could you do with it what can
to live like you were dyin
the thought keeps runnin though my head
just a shadow of a doubt
so baby maybe
after all these years
i hate the way i loved you
i'm lookin up an old flame
i'm still walkin down memory lane
down memory lane
i could tell by the way she lowed
you're gonna need you're gonna need my help one of these days
oh here we go tommy jason sounds like me too
i've tried everything baby
have some faith tim have some faith
til you walked into my life
without you here with me
and i still tremble when we touch
without you here with me
i dont know where i'd be
you've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born
as i walk away i hear you say daddy love you more
i know he'll say that he's in love
lord have mercy on my next thirty years
oh my next thirty years i'm gonna watch my weight
the times we had hanging on my wall
but the running and the races
cause the love and the laughter
my daddy said 'buy it and you're crazy boy'
hometown homecoming sweetheart
i had to find out for myself the hard way
bartender i may sit here on this barstool all night long
before i come unwound
and tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
before i come unwound
it sends a shock right through me
it's your love it just does something to me it sends a shock right through me
it's your love
i knew i'd seen the light
says baby why are you
she's like rembrandt's light
she's my kind of rain
confetti falling down all night
that'll take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage
pourin out my soul 'til it was gone
empty
empty
and on my way i heard my song
and on my way i heard my song
all i want and all i need
turn around and dont look back
just another fantasy for sale
i'm just gonna go my own way
i'm still smiling gotta keep on smiling
just an old love song
girl i'm still in love with you
there's was a texaco waitin at the bottom of the hill
he stood there lost in her eyes
and wonders about her hollywood dreams
i bought a coke and some gasoline
she had a suntan line and red lipstick
and i said only every other memory
never fades away
or shakin or chokin like my ol truck
cause i'm just layin'round hopin
comin eye to eye
i get this feelin that i'm losing you
i just know what's on every mans mind
even though i know that you love me baby
aint nobody gonna take my girl from me
show me that there's something more
show me that there's something more
take me away from here
she thinks i'm so strong
if she could see me cry
on the tips from the rich kids there on daddy's dime
confessing all our secrets and laughing out loud
it ended just like a movie scene
in her eyes my world came so alive
the only way i know to be
and when a hard day is over how i love just going home
but that's just me
a place where we can lay low
a place where we can lay low
and you learn to live and love
she was reading a book that she'd already read
the songs that they once sang
before they drifted apart
all the love that they have lost
what dont kill us makes us strong
nobody ever said that life was gonna be fair
carry on
you put your whole life into somethin you love and you never get that one big break
i gave it all i had every night for all these years
let me look at you
carry me with your grace
walk me down old main streets
yearning to breathe
forever comfort me
say hello to sweet springtime
i've been through some stormy weather but you shine alight for me
i guess that's just the cowboy in me
i guess that's just the cowboy in me
i guess that's just the cowboy in you
is paying both our rents
yeah i think that's just about everything
i hope you both choke on a pickle
my pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat
mister you can take me into little rock
an angel wavin to me
and light brown hair
son i know you dont want her to go but someday you'll change your mind
stranger came and pulled a gun
there's going to be a little one and she says it's time to go
johnny's daddy
ed's been on the tractor aint seen becky all week
just country boys and girls gettin down on the farm
you can have a lot of fun in a new york minute
in my home town
we're all looking for love and meaning in our lives
sit and watch a perfect world go by
we follow the roads that lead us
they all smile right to his face and hide the jealousy
the one everybody loves cuttin down
the one everybody loves to hate
this would be your home and i was on my own
down in georgia pickin them peaches
got a man that's home every night
in dallas texas isnt that where we
girl i swear just the other day you were
and then one day she passes his way
the world had got the best of me
with just one look i've found my salvation
our feet in the water she pressed her lips to mine
always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
i'm gonna drive on out to the river tonight
i'm gonna miss your touch
empty
and they wore everything they own livin in a car
but i just placed a rose on his grave and i talk to the wind
when she lifts her head off her pillow and says
finger lickin chicken fried
to heaven any quicker 'cause
and when she nibbles on me ear
hard on the ticker
she's hard on the ticker
underneath that tree i planted
and i feel fine
that a small town cant seem to leave alone
and slowly turned to gold
it always makes me glad that i came
from time to time unwinds
driving hard for hours
how bad do you need it
sometimes that aint enough
are you eating sleeping dreaming
how bad do you need it
on my way to la
we caught up on old friends
trading stories
nights beside the fire and angels in the snow
as i walked away
when i'm fool enough to let you in
i do but i dont
and i've hurt way too long
me and my so called independence
where we'd talk about nothing
i would wake up and miss you this much
pain wind rain and sun it keeps out all but one
i dont know where my head was at
but baby i've still got my pride
for the best days of my life
and i dont need to tell you i've got mine
but you cant call me poor
like that knight in shining armor
i aint seen the braves play a game all year
now i'm holding umbrellas and openin up doors
got to wash my truck
but i like it i love it i want some more of it
like the father and the son needs the holy ghost
i need you
i'll just try til i win
oh it should be illegal
everybody comes in like they're looking for a fight
baby i'm workin
there'd be no home to come home to no reason to care
she's one of a kind
half cherokee and choctaw
said i wasnt her kind
late at night tryin to catch a peek at me
so proud to die
but she sure knows her way around out behind the barn
mama it doesnt get any countrier than this
and knew there was somethin strange about this ride
well i climbed out of that cadillac and i said mister many thanks
and i'll never feel the need to say those three little words
but i cant keep my hands off her
to figure out what they missed
he left tennessee
things change
empty
that i'm where i shouldnt be
but i shouldnt be thinking about it
if there was she wouldnt be coming in here
it's just a clock on the wall
turning back she just laughs
hold me closer tiny dancer
i used to be afraid but i know today's the day
it's getting late maybe tonight she wont show up and change my mind
i've got a cold lonestar
i've got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart
how i ever lived and breathed before you loved me i dont recall
i'm unbroken
you're here now my heart's unbroken
i'm unbroken
i'm unbroken
sometimes he'd still believe that lie
he always told his friends my daddy's sick today
your daddy's demons are callin your name
and walk on
and all i wanna do is let it be and be with you
they wont last
you and i
just twelve weeks along and she's got a life inside
we carry on
when our lives come undone
we carry on
you gave her everything you thought she wanted
at all your fellow fools of love
dont be thinkin you're the only one
welcome to the club
just a couple of days all by yourself
tell me what room was the holiday in
she took her own sweet time
it's gonna take a lot of doin to get over her goodbye
and i hope she'll understand i cant leave her like a man
and i dont know a right way i can do her wrong
and i dont know a right way i can do her wrong
i've got a pounding head and an achin back
a stop sign on a black top
point our rocking chairs towards the west
but you're forgiveness is something i cant buy
i drink 'cause i'm lonesome and i'm lonesome 'cause i drink
do what's politically correct
who are they
yeah you know what they say
i wonder if they like to fight
who are they
the color and the detail
are searching for the wind
you're sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life
without any strings
how cold the wind can blow
oh girl
you cant take it with you when you go
if i could find me anything to throw
you can take it with you when you go
i forgot that you dont love me anymore
for a place to heal our hearts
and right there for a minute
a case of mistaken identity
a case of mistaken identity
what can i do to make you understand
oh and i get the feelin we can make it baby
why just today i heard you read my mind
in no time at all i'd have it lookin like brand new
but honey you turn me on
then you
yeah ya crank my tractor
there's no doubt you're in deep
your heart beats at double time
might as well face it 3
oh you like to think that you're immune
i need you here beside me to chase the night away
empty
i stand and watch the lights go down
and today is just tommorrow's yesterday
maybe someday we can put the cast away
love can heal when it's sad
there's all kinds of people in this worldyeahhh
oh i'm waiting in the storm ask me how i feel
when you think that i'm uptight why dont you ask me how i feel oh
playing games with my heart
i know you won`t admit it but you`re broken hearted
you play with fire i guess you`ll never learn
who`s gonna help ya
back where you started
but dont give up
it doesnt have to be this way
be tender with me baby
hot whispers in the night
yes you better be good to me
that`s how it`s got to be now
be good to me
you`re every beautiful thing i`ve ever seen
and i`m not above cheating for you
i`d even be your fool
and you've done all you can
go on tell me that you love me
but i can stay secret from prying eyes
i'll keep it confidential
something's gone i cant explain
when you do what you do it dont mean a thing
it's the touch that you lose and the words you dont say
when you do what you do it dont mean a thing
it feels like forty days and forty nights i've been
i could meet you where you are
i will always think about you
and making love is all there is to eat
file it under foreign affair
like spirits living so far away
like pain like tears on the face
see him surface in every shadow
you'll never know the days the nights
goldeneye i'll show him forever
now i've got you in my sight
hey window pain
like the light in your eyes
let's sleep on it tonight
this crazy situation is the reason why
but we just grew apart
really honest emotion
she will play the waiting game
and i always wanna feel this way
and i always wanna feel this way
i`m a new pair of eyes
there is a new nation
an original mind
she had a love
i look down and i`m there in history
i`m a soul survivor
empty
ooo ha little bit higher
i wanna higher
yeah baby higher
empty
dont turn away
i cant be nice without being cruel
is your attention
soaked in welcome rain
i`ll be thunder
from needing you
we`ll collide
the night is hot outside your window
the world is slowly turning
did you ever get this feeling
never in your wildest dreams oh no
two can make the light shine through
two can make just any place
you know it takes two
since we`ve been together
happy or sad
i just came to see
baby look me in the heart
if you think that love is blind
saw you there so confused
let me show you i wanna hear you sing
get on board get on my love thing
let me take you there tonight
i hear your name in certain circles
there's a message in the wire
i aint missing you missing you
i aint missing you
everytime i think of you i always catch my breath
if that thing is missing in my life
and when you need something so tender
it's anything you want it to be
you go to the store on friday
nutbush oh nutbush
that's called a quiet little old
so much younger than today
i`m feeling down
and every now and then
were falling in the dust
i can see us in our dreams and we're dancing
you just go separate ways
silent wings
well i guess i`ve been a long time
tryin` to make a song fit
and she`ll never say yes
you know it never was mine
some place a millions miles from
the future is this moment
you dream about the highlife
'cos paradise is here
well the men come in these places
a dancer for money
and the men are all the same
workin for the man every night and day
'til i hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
now i love you just the way i loved that
when you were a young boy
if i lost you would i cry
and i love you baby river deep mountain
but i need you to make it work
we`ve got to show some respect
from the woman that you see inside
we're travellers here spirits passing through
now the darkness falls
something beautiful remains
time will ease the pain
making up for lost time
and i know it's just the wind
living`s easy when you make the rules
you find the lock is on the door
no election time
sometimes i think i`m going crazy
when you give up believing in the
like you know what it means
baby i would rather be dead
yeah i knew him all too well
before they knew what hit them i was out of sight
but this time i got caught
aahhhhh thief of hearts a burglar in the night
thief of hearts
it doesn`t mean that you can do as you please
you look to me
and with you i could till the right man comes along
save it for a rainy day
you gotta stand by me
i confess i`m a fool for a man
but your defence dont help my case
so put your books aside
he would rock me with an optical illusion
just too hot to handle
you're the book that i have opened
like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart
like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart
and no ocean can keep us apart
as long as you're there beside me
in my heart there's a fire that's burning
when the moment is right
we don`t need another hero
and i wonder when we are ever gonna change
or end in the dark
try to change the habit of a lifetime
when i don`t want your kind of love
so let me see your cards on the table
whatever you want me to do i will do it for you
because it's love that i feel whenever you're really near
and deep in my heart i know that it's real
whatever you want me to do baby baby baby
that it`s only that thrill
what`s love got to do with it
there`s a phrase for it
what`s love got to do with it
i dont deserve this kind of treatment
why are you so blind
when i give you love and it's not enough
you know who is doing you know what
you know who is doing you know what
they built cathedrals for the glory and the fame
golden hills and silver street made out of sweat and blood
when the sun is going down in a sea of misery
my veins are full of elecricity
i never cool down i never cool of
dont bug me
i would bang
visions that you see bring you close to me
i'm alive forever my words and my songs will live
i've touched your soul
all my life i've lived and i see
and i hope that they understand
there's no borderline
a new temptation for a generation
walk in the cyber space
feel the temptation
dont wanna live for ever i cannot stand that pain
send me an angel of death i will die
send me an angel of death deus deus angelus mortifer
and kiss me and feel my last breath deus deus angelus mortifer
all the bad dreams will go
you must know every time there's somebody at your side
your helping hand from heaven sent
a new day is born
words i said things i've done
i feel the wind embracin me
you are the one i never wanna let you go
i i feel the calm before the storm
i'm on the point of no return
started slipping away
i feel it back in my bones
let's fight against the final fate
justice for all is a lie
my inner thoughts are writen down
live and love and die life's a battlefield
what i'm crying out
life is just a broadway show
do you think we're blind
i wanna better
you're buredned by every new child's birth
like livin in the dark
we dont face the hard facts
like livin in the dark
imagine we could get a vision that never dies
imagine we could get a vision that never dies
make your heart dying
drive'em out let'em fall you can resist their call
dont break your soul you'll find a way out
and i'm praying when it's there
welcome brother welcome brother moonlight
just a little look back
all that remains
just a little look back
all that remains
when i feel weak you're got the power
we feel we need each other more than this war
fever is growing in their vains
living in a world of shame and glory
living in a world of shame and lies
out of the blue
out of the blue
lost in the darkness
dark and dangerous mystic atmosphere
everytime when i think that i get lost
i'm lost in the darkness
i've lost my way to you
in the circus of pain i'm the clown without a name
in the circus of pain i'm the clown without a name
the day is gone tears in your eyes
i want you you want me dreams come true
i want you you want me dreams come true
hey darling you're so far away
love is a weapon which could win
love is like an ocean
my little princess i would build a world for you
he'll never love you the way that i love you
he's never near you to comfort and cheer you
head over heels in love with you
i wanna resist but this love exists
we're nobody's fools when we hit the town
no advice you'd better wise up and realize
that we live our lives
where heavenly peace is covering me
drifted apart from the scheme of things
now i believe in what i already knew
now i know i belong to you
the sign of war in their eyes
the rhythm of a war is beating more and more
in a ring of fire higher praying
crying flying singing
let there be let there be some rain
different worlds different things
the same old prayers we all pray
everybodies life
the engine's stream
can i belive what i just read
empty
of your farewell
you set my soul in ecstasy
you words are burning like black rain
bringing you my gift tonight
slippin through the bedroom window
is cold again
i see my life like a ship in the rain
sea of hope in the ocean of life
through the thunder and rain
now it's time and the lights go out
ice on fire
see me and feel me and hear what i say
in my paradise i'm breaking the ice
look look the ice wind will blow
but i cant runaway
ice wind will blow forever
when you feel the loss
final resting place
so let them see the writing on the wall
looking for their own success
had the guy put the gun
for a little girls life
for a little girls life
is it love what i feel
but you dont want my dreams
flying through rain and storm
dreaming dreaming in the cold night
i've got the kingdom of the night
allright allright
they always win
we kill them all
hold the world in their hands
take the world with fear and fright
moonbeams dance they are my guide
let us sail with your ship up to the moon
queen in black your glory will shine
queen in black your glory will shine
feeling so excited
larger than life
supersonic aeroplanes
all your looks let me live and survive
life goes on without pity
is there a healing for a world almost dead
for women they love they can even start a war
i would cool you with ice if you cant stand the heat
this is what i want you have to pay the price
gimme your blood gimme your flesh
dont wanna see like you
a land where snow is pink
i`m gonna live like a sphinx spreading my wings
a single day just to saygoodbye
only god knows what he's done to me
only god knows what hes done to me
i understand god holds your hand
guide my life through the dark forever in my heart
empty
forever be mine mine mine
empty
a passion for life
when i'm on stage and looking down to you
i stand alone l the more i fight i'm on my own
a passion for life
didnt like that life
every day i play guitar
oh road to never neverland
my bloodpressure is rising
dancing in the heat
feeling a storm deep inside
hear the people pray
give them peace and hope
sarajevo sarajevo
but i known my time has come
you will live in a wasteland
far away from time and space
like a bird i spread my wings
gimme a sign and we're flying high above
i'm freezing and feel the fear
magic night
i feel it in a daze
can you read the stars look in the future
all the pictures in your mind
if i should know when i will die
living in a prision of a magic might
walking in your mind with second sigh
there's no borderline
will all dreams come true
our eyes are open wide
you bring me down i'm crying
i hear you laughing so nice and bland
all i want is you all i want is you all i want is you
all i want is you
love will prove what friend are for
what went wrong we long
cryin out our song
eyes try to meet each others gaze
why do we always have to fight
you know i wont draw back
when i fall for your touch
take my hand i will save you from the fall
a voice i hear words seemed to be prayed
hear bells toll and yell a ship a shore
i hear in fever what they say what they say
on my way on my way on my way
and i can hear the tales of glory island
hear hear fear fear the rumours around
and i will lead you through the storm
i never thought that you wanna be mine
under the roof of god all our prayers come true
dance in the starlight and light up my life
i'll never want to let you go
there is no door there is no way out
dance right now
to go l or stay l to stand or fall
let me dance with the dead drive out my fright
i'm gonna miss the rain
i'm gonna miss the rain
in the endless world wide web
deadly cocktails this is the point of no return
future victims talking
dont drag me down life is better than it seems
i must say goodbye take my hand dont cry
i'm not scared of dying
you must know that i'm still in love
i am in ecstasy
we flytill we die
the eyes of the darkness
watching the skies
can you hear the bells chime life has passed you by
eyes of the darkness sings out of twilight
but not those awful days
you see their eyes open wide
but in a war all the snow is red
fear of strangers in our path
yes i know
all the razor wire
yes i know
blowinin your ears
like a drop on a burninstone
hunger and war
their music is a mirror of a world full of ice
songs for the passing craze
you gonna make me feel
hold me back before i fly away
give me another point of view
my heartbeat is loud
the crazy crowd is screaming for more
now we're singing for a song
out of the blue
waitin for the sun
with what you call mankind
get down from the throne in the light
get down to stay right by my side
but you get no time for rest
gimme back gimme back what i want
gimme more from this drink
between the green trees
when we are on the run
deep in their song the cry of life
flashing lights eyes glow red
now i reap all the seeds i've sown
creatures crawl spread about
grabbing touching burning
the leading horse is white
the horseman had a balance
the third one is a black
full moon i'm watching you
tonight the moon has got a face
days after the collision
full moon shining down on earth
when the wolf prowls
all of your nightmares become reality
all of your nightmares become reality
new ways must be found
the dream of freedom
hands were held together
while the world is turning
i will fly in a time machine
younger face to face
i will fly in a time machine
but you can find no words
and all dreams come true
as they come fly'ing across the land
i'm the puppet in your hand
you stick a nail inside a puppet baby give me voodoo vibes
give me magic satisfaction
no more love
watch out
make me a real king
i am just a waterdrop
in a churning ocean
let the nature grow
i will survive
and the night will burn while we are sleeping
yes the sun goes down
when the sun goes down it's to late to realize
and the spirit of love will arrive
and the spirit of love will arrive
and you want me to play this game
i dont need glory and fame
will god remember me
will god remember me
the world kneels down to pray
just a moment in time
will god remember me
let the peace shine bright like the sun
god will be there for everyone
feel the wind who will bring us love
feel the wind and let us pray
a million visions let us believe in a better future world
singing ah spreading out their might
singing ah spreading out their might
but i cannot find the reason why you wanna go
forever you'll be mine
without you i would die
i dont wanna say goodbye
forever you'll be mine
i dont belive you will find a better world
get out get out and take my invitation
you gotta join in and pray
under the shining moon we come
just you
then he looks up to heaven
his feet are stepping with the rhytm
wrapping paper everywhere
and as another christmas ends
it looks better on you anyway
no way around it
be here before you know it
i get into getting out on my mower
this old world is full of simple pleasures
i can make you believe any lie
been making the bars lots of big money
and also for those
and helping white people dance
she got a scholarship to yale
but all i wanted was a car
now when i look outside sitting in the drive
so you say you wanna tie the knot
and a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations
and food for the reception you'll need someone to cater
away in a manger no crib for a bed
bless all the dear children in thy tender care
if you know what i mean
well dont get me wrong boys this is pretty good
but if a bus load of women really good lookin women
and little jenny pikins showed up with fried chicken
a little baby boy
born on christmas day
you have nothing to fear because you know
so hush up little baby
someday i'm gonna be famous do i have talent well no
i can throw a major fit
2nd chorus
and say it's just so tough
no matter what you do
she stares out the window fightin back tears
but it's gettin tough
empty
fall in love used all the old cliches
so come on over tonight
just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat
yeah come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing
i'll just throw away these feelings
well darlin i dont think you understand
but dont stand there and tell me
in the hot summer sun all day
yeah we're laughing all the way to the bank
and gary was a garbage man
i'm glad you stopped in it's sure been slow around here today
i know you played in somethin but i'm gonna need some help
and i threw the winning touchdown pass the night that we won state
'cause i'm one of the most famous people in the country
and on every street corner you'll hear
hear the snow crunch
sleepin on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
and now i'm
you may think i'm wrong for you
but baby one thing's clear
and i cant seem to stop
we'll get old enough to finally be embarrassed
to only make once
i can finish your thoughts or pick the right restaurants
there aint a woman in the world that wants to hear the word yes
you're starin at a burnt steak
repeat chorus
keep it up and you'll really go far
well i squandered my time trying to buy everything
i took out a policy against fire and theft
but to pay me for what i'd done
to pass the time i've got some ten cent cigars
and exchange it some day for a crown
a wondrous beauty i see
where his glory forever i'll share
o the land of the uncloudy day
well you're just another head of hair
you're just another tip
repeat chorus
you press that bottle to your lips
i'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
you know every guy in here tonight
i gotcha
just me and dad
and 'wash me' was written all over the car
but i sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were makin
and there's no way i trade a few more dollars or things crossed off my list
is it too far to the left
is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home
that's when i started sinking even lower
but the love in your eyes as you talked to him
then there's me
you'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
all that is will be or ever was
2nd chorus
all because two people fell in love
i told her i'd be there at eight
and then he nudged my arm like old men do
waitin on a woman
waitin on a woman
there we were lost in conversation
there was never any doubt
empty
the first thing that i'm gonna do
i have carried all these years
repeat chorus
there'll be only happy tears
clouds will overspread the sky
soon the pearly gates will open
and finally drank away her memory
she finally drank her pain away a little at a time
we laid her next to him beneath the willow
that it's all there on that film
and there wasnt much to do
oh just forgotten photographs
we're happy tonight
we'll say no man
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and this old heart
baby you dont have to
stop singing an old song
you want me to move on
but it always ends the same ole way
went to the bank took out a loan
when the lights go out
when the lights go out
get down on one knee and forget what to say
that you have that effect on me
so dont take this the wrong way
to me it's painfully clear
well you've gotta be kidding me
a man around here
or we'll never leave harlan alive
of pineville
and the sun goes down about three in the day
you will never leave harlan alive
and oh you got so much going for you going right
on second thought forget it that one turns out kinda cool
tonight's the bonfire rally
i guess i'll see you in the mirror
if i could write a letter to me
she lost all track of time and burnt the cake
when she's layin on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
yeah it's eighty five degrees outside and he's just gettin warmed up
empty
inside your heart for your whole life
you're back at the beginning
but one day the truth will set you free
we're all gonna fail so you might as well
so make a mistake with me
me neither
relationships need time to grow
me neither
go on shoot me with a radar gun
you know you want to i just flew by
catch me if you can
and i got all night
son please respect my authority
come on now what do you say
catfish on a trot line
and then with a little luck we might just get stuck
oh the many colors that you're made of
gone like the sunset
empty
yeah yeah yeah yeah
that you need to see
chat with two women at one time
to play tuba in the rose parade
yeah i'm cooler online
yeah i'm cooler online
aint no last call
who could not wait to get home
but the drummer's got a girlfriend
where the best ones get a second chance
lookin back we had so much to look forward to
and change the way the story ends
little girls and boys
how santa keeps tabs
yeah he sees everything you do
we cant do this anymore
my scfbi
it really started coming down
takes me to another place
to holding you again
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa put his arm around mama
so santa claus he must have been
she's i want a piece of chocolate
she's a fighter when she's mad
and a cuss word 'cause its monday
when i'm on my knees and praying
yeah she's the one
why it should be thus all the day long
and then do we wonder why others prosper
whatever you do watch what you say
silent night holy night
jesus lord at thy birth
empty
how long the needless violence lasts
and doing what i love to do makes it hard to be a wife
there's folks who think my life is lacking
and i've got all the friends i need on that back row
he took my mom out to a movie and for once i got to go
that he didnt have to be
that's standin next to me
you know he didnt have to be
well she sure likes to talk and i aint heard a single word she's said
i'd give anything
you're still in my arms
i know you need to go
and by then
than every thing you've ever dreamed of
with an oval v home perm and braces
at the ivy at lunchtime in beverly hills
imagine now the pilots voice on the intercom
now what in the world could go wrong
please have snow and mistletoe
if only in my dreams
and then i get amnesia and forget the things you said
to hear you balling
when cars can run on water gasoline and oil aint worth jack
and hell is all i catch
i'm sure it'll hit me
when i get home
and i see antlers up on the wall
and i'd like to give it a whirl
saying yeah girls he's come a long way
then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
yeah honey i'm still a guy
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
ships comin in and stars comin out
it did
he lifted that veil and i saw that smile
i havent seen anything yet
to myself
oh settle down i'm just a little jealous
is because i really care about you girl
i know i've gone overboard but i cant help myself
and now i'm makin more money than i can spend
and i realize sittin here as i write this letter
oh i've been better
so hold your fire dont light it yet
so hold your fire dont light it yet
so hold your fire dont light it yet
the men light cigars and their scent fills the air
if you lay low out of sight
i've tried to stick to my prescription
i was walking through the country
but we'd drive them outside town
some good behind all of this ugly
i try to tackle the page that lay before me
same hair a revolution
closer than you know love each other so androgynous
tomorrow jane is wearing a dress
empty
if i should die before i wake up
my mouth says things that arent so wise
mornings we have toast and tea
and i will put up with her parents
i'm moving fast and i've got the feeling
i am the name i am the walk
i will come and get you in the morning
come on and free up your hands
c'mon and give yourself a hand
i know you can
created blanket and laid back in the shade
who woke up with blue hair
so someone asked himi beg your pardon
he told us how he liked to feel it when it came out
then got some pliers held him wound up and yanked it out right there
but something's out of place here
some day they're going to stop this motion
gonna eat it too make no mistake
and i'll say pete a side of ice cream if you dont mind
all my organs doing their jobs no help from me
i got a bug stuck in my eye
empty
i like the way you like to squirm and kick
i like the syrup in my veins
i want to par tay p par tay
you can just pretend we're not in the same room
arent you going to miss me
when it comes to the city versus the country life
but at least he didnt tie his dogs up at night
how can they help but drag the species down
said it was a monster in the old loch ness
ha ha i'm outlived by that thing and stupid things like that
i think of all the insects that are sleeping
i said i dont like to chat
i'm just chillin i'm just hangin
you said we're cogs in a great big machine
who put the doggy in the doghouse
dont you try everything while i'm gone
keep your eye on things while i'm gone
keep your eye on things while i'm gone
he said that it was from when
mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm
but when i look down at their bodies
when we met it was in the hot green jungle
dawn would come and i would start to feel my own sunrise
the things to come may be somewhat unfamiliar
and then i'll squat down for a wash to end the day
our driver gestures out behind the palm trees
overachiever might be putting it mildly
fear struck and he threw up inside his helmet
all night long
i think i must have a double who's been frickin with me
all night long
and sometimes i despair the world will never see
sometimes when supe was stopping crimes
she'd stuff the bodies of dead little birds
swatting flies
i hope you'll understand
we could be happy in the country
we could be happy in the country
you'd shake their bony hands and so dispell the gloom
and demons come to plague me as i lie in bed
and then i hope you'll come over to the other side
she could not control them they kept her up nights
what does she think when she foretells a disease
we wont spend the rest of our lives together
people might think that we were on our honeymoon
if your toast gets stuck in the toaster
for example stop signs
between the toaster stop sign and my tonsils
he gets them drunk and gets their money
killing from his office desk
losing lots of blood
bail him out and buy him gin
they'd give them potions
they thought they were visions
i dont know which should be my favorite paintings
what if the artists ran the tv
but i hoped a trip into the country
and here were many years of winter drownings
that charlie sedarka was a playing the piano
you're nobody in this crowd
he said i appreciate beauty if i have one then
eyes were everywhere
the hour
and everyone's a prisoner of
and one of them is poisonous
what is your destiny the police woman said20 amnesia
dont let me lose heart
but it's only business
mister gorbachov came cap in hand 20 amnesia
empty
you're sitting in the garage contemplating suicide
well how can i corrupt you
big nothing
the smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough there was too
big nothing repeat until fade
he used to be your victim
your mind is made up but your mouth is undone
until you're well hung
other times they thought they heard laughter
crickets played on a tape recorder
you were sharp and ideal as a bobby pin
that you are not impressed
did he leave your pretty fingers lying
my aim is true
alison i know this world is killing you
cause i cant stand to see you this way
all grown up
empty
you wrote
baby cant you act your age
confession may delay
empty
those days are recalled on the gallery wall
so she finds that the mixture is hard to deny
and our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
now your eyes are red from crying
almost you
for money like that
being swallowed by a clown
just american between tears
oh she seemed to be crying for year after year
though you say i'm unkind
and you know what i'll do
once or twice nightly
so i threw away the rose and held onto the thorn
to just rub it in
you've already put big old tears in my eyes
must you throw dirt in my face
and it didnt hit back
the simplest things set me off again
ever since you left i have been trying to compose a baby would you please come home note meant for you
you're the same as
so we can watch it all
peering into the
empty
in each beguiling alley
empty
locations of
now the victory is sweet
empty
played america the
dont change a hair for me
but she knows that a man cant be a man
but he's only happy when i'm miserable
he'll scream and shout
filled up his purse dictating verse
my science fiction twin 4x
and my shoes keep walking back to you
and my shoes keep walking back to you
and has begun to break down
where you come back to me
a little larceny in everyone
why dont you show me
well i was down under the covers in the middle of the night
till i have the possession of everything she touches
somehow i found myself down at the dockside
even presidents have newspaper lovers
oh you know you have been captured
no more fast buck
now she seems contrite will she make the change
empty
you'll be in some sputnik baby
everybody's singing with their hand on their heart
everyone gets armbands and 3 d glasses
or if your name is even santa claus or joe
that's why i only operate at night time
that's why i only operate at night time
there's no action
knowing you with him is driving me crazy
i suppose you're going to have to play it by ear
was it really murder
which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose
he was known by several different names
as he enters madam x he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks
would they be angry if i thought of joining you
i wake and i find you asleep in the deep of my heart deep
that song is sung out
that song is sung out
i want him
wish you'd known me when i was alive i was a funny feller
and i'm going on to meet my reward
empty
it's the big white beard i suppose
lyin cold the way you left 'em but at least your lips caressed them while
as the door behind you closes
many blooms still linger there
i got my command
you'd better say goodbye
they pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
just another mummy's boy gone to rotten
you can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it
i never said i was a diplomat
i wont ask you to forgive me
all the time your breath is baited
dont you know i'm an animal
he selects the plainest face form a spiteful row of girls
the waiting lines are long
the hurt look in your eyes
now it's gone way past that
i hear only evil
starts as an a flirtation
the people all said sit down
the only thing different the only thing new
the only thing different the only thing new
her looks can make you
she's weak and wanton
a real gone love
i'm sorry to say that you dont know me
you dont know my hidden shame
boy we can see it in your eyes
we were like brothers we would run and hide
and i'm not saying if i did or if i didnt
holding hands in the corridors of power
even though the signals indistinct
here comes mr misery
home isnt where it used to be
saying you'd look cute in your birthday suit
you must have opened up your case
perhaps you'll never know this purgatory
i shall abstain
time to experiment
your love is best
so they call her the flirting kind
the flirting kind
lest we forget
the great unknown
the band played hearts of oak
isnt this the greatest thing
with a white frock and a ring
he's always fingering
i just dont know why you cant see
this is your big decision
living for thirty minutes at a time with a break in the middle for adverts
here i stand on the edge of disaster
new south wales
i can remember when we were children
i cant come home i might as well say life is short
what am i to do
when you come running home
did somebody say
did somebody say
all the bedroom lights go out
she thought too late and spoke too soon
maybe she should just pretend
you're not my particular poison
they stitched you up this time
now he's a hit in every city
and when we're alone we never quarrel
but you blew hot and cold
even an inferno can cool down to an ember
there's always something that's smoldering somewhere
one day you are up in the clouds
and it's so hard to pick the receiver up when i call
the sun struggles up another beautiful day
the automatic gates close up between the shanties and the palace
the pop princess is downtown shooting up
the casual killers
the other side of summer
with the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother
as the people's limousine
he saw romulus approaching and slipped off the safety catch
i know where you'll be found
all your old gang
who leaves as a couple
going home with the same jokes
the stamping ground
the stamping ground
empty
though he wasnt tall or handsome she laughed when he told her
when i open my mouth and i cant seem to talk
he tries to take it
or trade it in
i think i'm going insane
well how much longer
'cause he's not singin like he used to do
strange things seem to occur somewhere behind the nursery door
frightening small children is just about your only weakness
beneath the shadow of the distorted angel
stuck on the wall with a thousand faces
maureen and stan at the skating rink
roll up for the ghost train
while they make believe it's just another holiday
once this would have been coincidence
who killed me with kindness last night
it's tearing me up
this is where the home truth ends
i wanna be loved
i just wanna be loved
it's a moment she can keep
he stood all alone on an iron turntable
he'll be back another day
and there's a rat in someone's bedroom
like a picture of prince william in the arms of john the pope
and you knock the kids about a bit until they feel the same
there's never been a how d'you do
i never thought that i would give you away
life is so strange
once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks
she's caught it like some disease
there's gonna be no dancing when they get home
who cant find the strength now to punish the length
before i conclude this epistle
sure you havent got the wrong number
is that why you got in touch with me
even fools like me
somehow through the day
through the sleepless nights
sunday's best
standing in your socks and vest
continental interference
the songs of praise the readers' wives
two sapphires and couple of rows of pearls
let no one set asunder
in the blue corner that i painted myself into
the bell goes
i dropped my guard and that's how it ended
you knocked me out
then you better go to him
it let your memory come around
tonight the bottle let me down
there's nothing i love better than a free for all
oh no you didnt have to laugh that way
oh but i'm too far gone
i know i've loved you too much for too long
i'm never going to cry again
maybe you dont believe my heart is in the right place
she spills with compassion as that young child's
i'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down
try telling that to the desperate father who just squeezed the life from his only son
who takes all the glory and none of the shame
you're a big boy now with a face to stop clocks
turning the town red aah x4
expensive care is meaningless
and i only kiss but once or twice
wouldnt give that man my hand
but its only for show
i'll face the facts
down in the basement
dial me a valentine
i would have thought you would have had enough by now
you say you'll never know him
blood and chocolate
i want to buy you
but this is only the beginning
how can i tell them
how it felt when he came to my room
and soon there's going to be another unwanted number
when the moment arose
i guess i will wonder until
well i used to know a girl and i would have
empty
and as she closed her eyes upon the world and
saying you can call me anything you like but
they got to touching all the girls were to scared to call out
now he'd like to go to spain or somewhere like that
hiding from a scandal in the national press
why do we forget what's been said
dont say anything
get out before
so punch drunk they dont understand at all
i send you all my regards
she looks so good that he gets down and begs
close up of the sign that sayswe never close
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
it's just like watching the detectives
but he cant be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
you think you're alone until you realize you're in it
it's just like watching the detectives
is more than i care to surrender
i'm certain as a lost dog
oh my baby baby i want you so it scares me to death
i want you
i want you
i want you
i'm not ashamed to say i cried for you
oh no my darling not with that clown
i want you
empty
i'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls
you're upstairs with the boyfriend while i'm left here to listen
i've got this camera click click clickin in my head
he may hold you in his arms
you know i'm not that kind of guy
she'll be out again this evening when you come around to call
and your peepshow regulations they just dont seem to apply
i'll go out of my mind if i'm losing your touch
and still he looks so neat
we know who you're with and where you are
even though you didnt have to remind me
they dont sense the faintest glimmering
in the darkest place
saying try to find another lover
write my name in heaven
empty
inch by inch
you told me to start
can still burn your fingers
and though the sparks would fly
and all that powder's gone to waste
where i can tell by the colour of my skin
empty
butcher's hooks
your time is up
it's time it's time
but all i fear are the nights
one where i finally woke up
you held me tight
you're all that i adore
to be the love of one true heart
the jack of all parades
cause you know where the door is
for things you havent done yet
as you pretended not to notice
oh the jack of all parades
as we carried off like spoils the heads we'd smash right off
highly paid solicitors
but if it's you that she's thinking of
well i hope it dont break
they're boasting of loving the daylights right out of her in the small hours
down in the blue chair
pull out like young lovers do
the spirit is willing but i dont believe in miracles
but i'm not sure if i am laughing or crying
it lingered in the air
but it was just a boulevard of broken dreams
if i am frightened then i can hide it
but if you leave me then i am broken
the judge forgot to tell me how i'd live my life alone
and you tell me that you dont care
very busy
out playing with the traffic
and you find that a wave of her right hand
busy bodies
trying to make a living out of anything at all
i've got an angle
we make believe we're making do
just remember you'll only be the boss so long as you pay my wage
just remember you'll only be the boss so long as you pay my wage
threw you out of the academy of garbage
empty
she is just another mail order bride
oh my little one take that chewing gum out of your ears
he can only control what they look like
clean money clean money
blood money for doin no good
'cause the wages of sin
and in that black flamingo chair
but you dont have to play so hard
to love you like i want to do
behind all this paraphernalia
clowntime is over
a voice in the shadows
tears on your blackmail
says that his men know
you're going off limits
have you ever been had in clubland
empty
empty
they'll say it's quaint as the guilty ones faint and claim they aint underneath this paint
say the advertising agency swine
sad about girls who know perfectly well why he's so sad about this girl
get up and leave without even a warning
where cartoon bubbles burst in the air
and with his face pressed to the screen
oh no oh no
second place in the human race
between you and me
expensive care is meaningless
and the promises you made
you say you only kissed her once or twice
but i wont let you touch and poke
junior dissatisfaction
they took me in the office and they told me very carefully
one two three four five six seven
there could be but one inscription this was not his day
now i'm a shabby doll
she's just the shabby doll
the boy that i used to be
and being what you might call a whore
he was openly broken
with wrestling stories and elegant bones
for shadow and jimmy now the story is told
let me be the one that fortune favours
bless the poor 'cos like the rich
i wont lie in this poor shallow grave
what can i say
that i cant let go
i see those newly weds
we papered over all the cracks
it was nothing really to write home about
is it worth it
somebody said that someone got filled in
once again
she's walking over the floor
she's walking all over me
but to watch your love turn slowly from indifference to hate
lying skin to skin
leaves without feeling
your blue murder's killing you
sittin just thinkin 'bout you
we'd have made a lovely couple but we never had the chance
a girl woke up in a naked light and said oh no not again
and i forget to do
till i'm near to you
i see your face in every flower
empty
daddy went out the rubbish and he kept on walking
the family circle gather round from very far and near
she says sweet nothing at all it's much more of a mess
longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas
in a world of broken hearts
in a world of broken hearts
there wont be anymore there wont be anymore
when you're heart is breakin and you want some lovin from me
oh they'll never never take her love from me
these rooms play tricks upon you
to make you want to stay
so this house is empty now
who they will favour who they will lose
this house is empty now
but you get used to it after a spell
empty
the shirt you wore with courage
but it's by julie andrews
this is hell this is hell
guaranteed guaranteed to capture your breath
you have been selected from over five thousand
dont leave it too late or you'll be bound to suffer
this offer is unrepeatable
would i lie to you would i sell you a dud
this sad burlesque
keep faith in human nature
still you're hoping that she's well spoken
much more than she's lost
all this but no surprises for this year's girl
tiny steps almost real
make her walk or make her kneel
tiny steps almost real
they put the numb into number they put the cut into cutie
whenever i feel so amorous
but they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday
a barefoot girl from naples or was it a barcelona hi rise
for teresa is a waitress though she's now known as juanita
that they hardly mention us
we've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide
but do people living in toledo
so i walked outside in the bright
and does anybody in ohio
but we still have florence alabama
and so you turn your back on me
little triggers that you pull with your tongue
worryin about the common decency
they'll find that all the dogs outside
make a pretty killing
that never go further than floor to floor
and while i'm dreaming
in londons brilliant parade
dont let me awake
second chorus
the lions and the tigers in regents park
it's going round the town
if you thought i was a fool for you
each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam
as you lie there so lifelike below me
lost in a sea of imaginary women
headlights that startled
feel the anxious rhythm of a functional stranger
when the moon so long has been gazing down
who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise
follow me and climb the stairs
so beautiful and fortunate
it'll make you bankrupt
i've looked at it every way i can
you go to church quiet as a mouse
into brands hatch
my love walks where three's a crowd
lovers strut lovers stroll lovers leap
will you look what love has done
then you're the cat's clothes
you're worried by her body
and look for your name in last night's obituaries
when he ran from you
but will you still love
he's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
who's up late polishing the blade
for the pride and the pleasure
how can i apologize
you never asked me what i wanted you only asked me why
baby's gotta have the things she wants
just because you've never been denied
her eyes were black like first foot coal clutched as white as chalk dust
as confetti bled it's colours down the drain
and everyday she lives out another love song
the lane that she said went white as he could do then doubled over in pain
singing so babe i know this song
so just show a little mercy to me
oh i wish you were my queen
so babe i sing this song
sneaky feeling sneaky feelings
you cant let those kind of feeling show
what did i do to make her go
so like candy
here lie the records that she scratched
dont mind putting the time in it's shocking
as one you and i
without your sugar life is incomplete
to replace you with a living double
to break the hearts of a million listeners
so dont even think about it dont make a wish
yes horse's heads up hung in the trees after the bird had flown
falling out of the blood tub and rolling on my back
the saloon is like a casket stained wood and human dust
your new career would probably end like this
your tears of pleasure equal measure crocodile and brine
but you always cheated life just like the bold dare devil cheated death
or is it still too soon to know
for it was in the way that he came close to touching you
it's still too soon to know
well i admit you are strange
empty
strange you got five double chins
but there's no welcome in the window anyway
you still dont understand me when i say
strict time
strict time
cute assistants staying alive
i spend all my evenings all alone
on a hot city day
still i cant believe that this is happening
me and you and you and me
can you believe it's happening
will you look at this disgrace
now i'm only semi precious
and turned into a terror
it's all over
inside he died a thousand deaths
and learnt everything that she does
for goodness sake as you cry and shake
outside they're painting tar on somebody
who in the world has bitten her neck
before she let the family down
it's like money in the bank
who thought she looked easy he's not that astute
sulky girl
i could talk all night
he didnt crack a smile
with the boys from the mersey and the thames and the tyne
now i'm looking for a little girl i wonder where she's gone
she was sitting pretty on a velvet cushion
i'd like to be his funeral director
enemies just think out loud
there's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow wont change
well you try to love her but she's so contrary
and if he should wake up in some terrible dive
she's got spider leg fingers sharpened whenever he strays
didnt you notice the resemblance
they are lost to me now forever
funny now i can see
they'd settle for anything in disguise of love
ends up like a trance
we're so hard to find
being trapped between the doctor and the magistrate
if i could fool myself then maybe i'd fool you too
my pockets are heavy with loot
at every little girl that i meet
with the guitar turned up loud
i think i feel like dancing the night away
matter who you claim to be
the whole world in his hands
too tired to have resisted
when will you realise
from the truth society to neurotic erotica
they talked to the sister the father and the mother
children and animals two by two
some folk have all the luck
you had your own way one too many times and now
to turn you from a playboy into a man
empty
if i got on my knees and i pleaded with you
this time be different in some way
if i told you my life was a song
my luck is hanging upside down
buttoned down and laced
and half in ecstasy
is save pieces of you
somebody spikes the drink
i threw away your alibis
they're sober and they're polite
from the hole in your leopard skin tights i can tell you've been spying
all the way down pony street
where you lay your pretty head
baby can you understand me now
and then i know you're bound to see my other side
chorus x 3
changing words while the ink is still tacky
out of the kitchen she's gone with the wind
a bad enough situation
everybody's crying peace on earth
nobody knows the meaning of the word
everyday everyday everyday i write the book
all your compliments and your cutting remarks
dont be alarmed i am her friend
figure hanging on a leather band
now there's a tragic waste of brutal youth
when sunday morning dandruff turns out to be confetti
it wont mean a thing later
i dont know what i would do
i searched his wallet for clues and lies
no matter how well he lies
'til you're powder in the grave
oh he didnt know it could feel like that
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
like a finger running down a seam
oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying
and when they saw you they said they knew you were fine
i got two legs and i got two feet that always take me to your street
sometimes the phone would ring when she was half asleep
her mother would phone and always keep talking
his finger traced past georgie's name to someone who needed less persuading
all i can do is pack up and run
all i can do is pack up and run
too crowded for me
it's getting mighty crowded
it's getting mighty crowded
i'm leavin this town aint comin back no more
it's not a matter of life or death
must have been a wonder when it was brand new
it's time to stop pretending things are real
he cannot break your heart
while you were living like a saint
empty
between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require
whose ever bad intention has been purged
repeat after me
lip reading threats and false alarms
now you're part of someone else
although i've never said it like this before
left with just a house to hold
but when she's laying stretched out on the floor
hurry down doomsday the bugs are taking over
hurry down doomsday the bugs are taking over
look out there goes gordon
so you're the little bastard of that brother of mine
it pains me to mention
sadness is all my lonely heart can feel
i cant stand up for falling down
she gave a little flirt gave herself a little cuddle
everybody's got new orders
i dont want to check your pulse
i dont want to go to chelsea
he's got all the things you need and some that you will never
i knew then what i know now i never loved you anyhow
because i still have that other girl
in my head
it leaves a sinking feeling
i'm twenty three years old and if i do get home alive
and i treated her like a fool
love as only love
you will surely be hurting
you're like harry houdini or the invisible man
you're like harry houdini or the invisible man
and in every home there will be lots of time
and so a young blade becomes a has been
you're a fine one oh yes you are
spit and polish the potato parade
while for you it could just be a living
it's a well kept secret thought that i had better swallow it
that no one ever waives
it's not the way you kissed me baby that tears me apart
it's not open to discussion anymore
and heaven knows i've tried
she said it doesnt matter unless it's her matters
she's the girl that used to love it and the girl i still hate
bama lama bama loo
bama lama bama loo
empty
and he's living up there
on the first floor there are two old maids
and the typewriter's rattling all through the night
he'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls
you're looking for somebody new that you can knock around
and you're almost beaten to the punch
i'm just the oily slick
for all your jealousy
just like the canals of mars and the great barrier reef
once this seemed so appealing
out on you
i was caught in the suction
we can talk but she'll get to you
so you can cross her off your list
big sister will be watching over you
compassion went out of fashion that's all your concernment
she's got eyes like saucers oh you think she's a dish
it's in the stop press before it all starts
even if he hit you you'd still think it's just a graze
always fascinated by the weird edge of town
you wouldnt even like me if you'd never had a drink
i was looking at the black and white world
as you feel the finger's friction
up until i saw her last night in close detail
under your skin
empty
well you know your time has come and you're sorry for what you've done
i still see that cold graveyard
and your poor shattered mind cant take it all in
in those complicated shadows
i've got his name
who on earth is tapping at the window
you had better not go too far
leave your mother and your father
she said i catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me
you said now i only want you so i dont have to promise
now it's hard to say now if he's only stupid or smart
it's hard to discover now he's in love with her
soon your sugar daddies will all be gone
for every lie you tell you're gonna cry cry cry
what with wars and floods and beggars
turn from tallow into tar
the maddening smile of la giaconda
it's curious
here i am late again for the last time
but it took a little longer than i thought it would
i bless the light
i wish today could be tomorrow
you're with me every single day believe me
i wont forget a single day believe me
i know you'll probably say spare us the melodrama
life is dark
the sky was just a purple bruise the ground was iron
on a fiberglass tumbleweed
picture that you never paint
deep dead blue
and see what you've got to lose
put your rings on a diff'rent finger
it's a dirty rotten shame
but as his anger proves
and cauliflowers to flip
jump up hold on tight
tell me how else can a boy get to see those pretty pleats
cant trust the promise or a guarantee
are the moments that you treasure
losing you is just a memory
for all of the courage that we never had
i'm just about glad
and you said that my nurse was sweet
i'm just about i'm just about
say you wouldnt kid about it
say you wouldnt kid about it
so what if this is a mans world
there's a wager lost and an argument won
it's a kinder murder
it's a kinder murder
he was dreaming of the pigskin seats and the walnut dash
laughing up your sleeve
and still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get
he says 'will you please' and she says 'stop'
let me hang my hat
i might even tell you what comes next
as they find my name on that fatal mailing list
you know your daddy's bound to go
hush my dear while i whisper it in your ear
only they wont mention my name
you better leave my kitten all alone
well mister dog
on the top of your head
you better leave
even your mother wont detect it
empty
so the police took bentley and the very next thing
well what's that to the woman that sidney miles wed
not many people thought that bentley would hang
let him dangle
listening to the sad song that the radio plays
and you could do yourself a favour
getting in some sharp practice
dont make any sudden movements
but if you change your mind
it's you
select the control and then insert the token
between wisdom and murder she gave up her immaculate face
took the blossom of my youth and blew it all to smithereens
i betrayed those little atoms with a kiss
she called you her magic fingers
one day they'll probably make a movie out of all of this
is that all the strength you can muster
you push me when i'm falling
you stab me in the back
you bet that i like everything you do
on a drowning man
how can i know your wishes
on a drowing man
you're loosening all the screws that hold the hinges of my life
you dont know what you got
well well fancy that
i saw my ex again last night mama
as i might squeeze him too tight
you'd better let 'em lock me up
i didnt mean to break your cup
or turn it down flat
pump it up when you dont really need it
pump it up when you dont really need it
words macmanus music costello
just look at me i'm lost in a social whirl
they say it's harmless i know
that seems to belong in my blue room
with every one of those late night stations
'cause they think that it's treason
you either shut up or get cut out
my head is spinning and my legs are weak
though we are so far apart
hide your love hide your love
answer me i need you i'm waitnig patiently
tear it all apart and that would be a sin
and let me live my life
close the door
your love to me
each time we meet
riot act you can read me the riot act
i got your letter
walking down rocking horse road getting lost
crying on rocking horse road or somewhere quite like it
is anyone there i can talk to
when i'm out and about i'll be coming to see you
this is the song she dictated this evening
something no one must know
look what love has brought them to
missing out thirteen
they smile just so so you know
will ruin any man who moved too soon
because they're running out of angels
instead i'm having sweet dreams all about you
and finding it's hard enough
i wonder every night and day
was she your mother
all the suffering days and nights 'til i dare dream again
i dont know why my dearest darling
i tried in vain to drive myself insane
i look for the news somebody to abuse
you know how children can be
must i watch you
i never thought that it would be like this
one day i know he'll forget
must i watch you
and i know that accusing look
there can be no defence
darling your suspiciousness
he drinks in self defense
so for heavens sake
and now i try to be amused
oh i know that she's disgusted oh why's that
oh i used to be disgusted
speak up dont mumble if you're in the combo
there's only one thing wrong with you befriending me
see your friends getting under their feet
i dont go out much at all
just the beat
and i cast my shattered mind over selected memories
he wants to kiss you will you condescend
spare me lily white lillies
extinguish every sorrow
you mutter underneath your breath it echoes round the world
now i know somehow i dont feel so alone
the social circle have these cardiac complaints
they've seen the face of love they've seen a few
pernod vodka sambuca i love you so
empty
in america the law is a piece of ass
say you love me until you do so
you think you want to jump up on me
you put the tongue into my cheek
all of your family had to kill to survive
that you never even bother to look
you should be ashamed
what's her name today
isnt her smile reminiscent of someone else
string her like a pearl
is all hope lost
and who are the trusted
'cause each time i feel it slippin away just makes me wanna cry
you see right through him
maybe they werent loved when they were young
love on the never never dreams dont come cheap
sister said
quiver of literary darts
well i'm the red face gentleman
i kiss the air around the place that should be your face
must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams
why cant a man stand up
i'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
empty
before someone gets suspicious or someone gets discovered
i might pay this king's ransom
do you know how tall he was 'cos that is all that really matters
empty
i dont want just anybody
i expect you're entitled to know why i'm making contact
now they say that justice and love are the next things to blindness
it wont hurt you now to betray
you bowed down you bowed down you bowed down
she surrounds his name with hearts and flowers
they say no news is good news
imitation lashes flutter above
when they find how wicked we are
while balancing on daggers
let me take your hand
those cocktail cabinets put mud in your eye
you tripped at every step you tripped at every step
no matter how many foreign bodies you can take
you strike a profile on the low side of my imagination
your angel steps out of heaven each night
and you havent saved her yet
this is the story this is the story of someone who's wild
are they coming for me
god is smiling on you but he's frowning too

and i've got secrets
i use to dream of being rich
you'll realize you're really blessed
and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
is not enough for me now that depends
to all my homies working on the 9 to 5
appears to come in twos and threes
couldnt know which one was which
sometimes you gotta pay your dues
there aint no need in drowning in your sorrows
wa wa wa wa

the million dollar man just need currency

oh baby drive away to malibu
we're all watching you
love would tear you apart
the light just radiates
feeling mighty fine
feeling mighty fine at this time yes indeed
feeling mighty fine
no one is listening my friends
i make my bed i lie in it
you want her on the bed with her legs wide open and here eyes are spread
the skies a narcotic with us black jack bones
sorry me i'm sorry man i'm sorry man wow
just like a pro she takes off her dress
empty
and i wait staring at the northern star
can you see the trees charity and gratitude
feel their hearts they're cold and white
and i pray begging to the northern star
my empathy
she seems to me to know
we all know her rage is endless
chokers are back in again
old age
because i wasnt feeling well and i told them
but the exposure thing wasnt right
from down the hall near the stairs
gee that must be fun
which was so strange
and then i saw john cale
let's face it
and i dont understand about that velvet's first album
it would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
could have at least called
i was so scared today
'couse they ran out or veins
and nobody called
after you've had me you know that you've had the best
i'm just a gift to the women of this world
never really learned how to dance
guess it's true what all these people they say
you're a queen reborn
your voice perfectly turning
when what you really want's a muse
that could cause your cerebral cortex
differentiating scheming from my one true love
you redefine the locus of your time in space race
i anticipate some grieving
my adventuress
all through the night
and the novels written and the book is done
feel so sad i cried all through the night
give a little loving and some peace of mind
i want to have it all through the night
i would be a bat and come
if i could be any one of the things
and stones are all erupting out for you
now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose
miss riley had a dog
ooohhh wow bow wow
ooohhh meow me meow
they took the dude's sweat and shot it up between the two
i am just your average guy
i worry about money and taxes and such
average looks average taste
i'm just your average guy
and i said no no no no no
i said now no no no no no
man you dont split your stash with your blood
ooohhh baby face ohh
i'm banging on my drums
i'm banging on my drum
when i think of you baton rouge
well i once had a car lost it in a divorce
of malicious intent and you as poor poor me
that's what marriage came to mean
so helpless
so thanks for the card the announcement of child
so helpless
it's not good trying to immortalize yourself
as long as i dont have to try too much
i hope this baby thing dont go too far
and keep me company when i'm a wizened toothless clod
she says babe how you call your lover boy
se
you were five foot ten inches tall
oh you're right and i'm wrong
it was very nice
oh one sweet day
her mother was like steel
betrayed by her fragile vicious beauty
but she's looking right past me
big sky big sky holding up the moon
but it cant hold us down anymore
a big room it holds you and me
they cant hold us down anymore
big sky
are you and i
let's not answer the phone
she seemed very regal to me

white man listen to the songs we sing
mining companies pastoral companies
to my sawn off emotions
what's already been

but there's nothing left to feel
where are the words that can speak forgiveness
tin legs and tin mines anyone cries

empty
for a wasted life for nothing gained
and we just keep wondering what the hell went wrong
we got everything to live for
and we just keep wondering
and it makes me shake
what goes on
and we just keep wondering
taken in his stride
that the people are appeased
dealing with the consequences of a bad sound
you're condemned
white skin black heart
white skin black heart
seem to live this life long distance
looked into the clearest blue
but it's metal on metal
precious moments precious few

living quietly in a caravan
and sanctity
our continent is immense
oh i was a talking to the people next door

there's a time and a place
with the man intact
take a look at my face
empty
chatswood wasnt built in a day

still it aches like tetanus it reeks of politics
we've got to remember
there's heat in the air and peace reigns supreme

lots of intention but no understanding
if ned kelly was king
watching the walls spinning in doors
bring you this instant relief
and lawns were always victa neat
in the valley i walk who will take me there
mercy's arms all around me when i was down there
where's the saviour that the critics dream about now
table talk and wall to wall
from the red dust north of dalmore downs
for jimmy sharmans boxers
what is the reason for this
waiting for the stranger to go
mountain in the
the rhythm of the night the beating rain
bitter crimes
lord dont let me wait
and the pubs all close at ten
empty
dry white seasons years ago
marks the spirit of the age
bind up the brokenhearted
if you got money then it's a steal
you can rent a life today
there's a feeling i get when i look to the sun
we're all working on a shorter day
wanking on dreams and fashions and toilet paper flowers
empty
in the desert in the dry
i've seen the wild horses
on the dock with nightmare faces looking at me
short changed by the surfing priest again
just a hope that someday someway it'll be okay
in my shoes in my shoes
in this life that we live
dont know why it's so cold
tomorrow is better than yesterday
you can fall but can you rise
one last moment fading all the time
we'll leave the nights alone better keep me hoping
it could be your first line of defence
i know the truth is what you feel
i could never figure the calendars flow
there's no time to be absent a clown or a fool
the milky way is emasculated as exhaust fans
no wild acres you can see yearning to breathe
and i dont wanna be the one
no amount of make believe can help this heart of mine
the sun comes up and we all learn
here comes the nightmare man
if ever you do
seers and the prophets
it' 9am in town hall station
i hope that you understand
the devil was a dancing on the old foreshore
dirty washing on the line footsteps in the sand
they wont fade away
earth and sun and moon human tribe thin blue line
earth and sun and moon human tribe one thin blue line
new day new way all my friends can say
now throughout the ages we've been a' turning all those pages
hurricane lamps are burning teargas fills the route yeah
manhattanization is coming open your eyes if you dare
some say that's progress
can you tell me will our freedom remain
and if we think about it
they keep talking
and the cooking was done by his daughter
looking around for the moment that's right
the bosses want decisions the workers need ambitions
another little flare up storm brewed in a tea cup
emergency has gone apathy rolling on
it is vision free it's poor bugger me
between the cheque book and the dawn
all the souls are growing wild
hold onto dreams hold onto dreams tonight
we are laying the tracks for the company
trying to turn the world around
so we came and we conquered and found
i'm on the whiskey running and i'll run by night
i'm on a turning circle turn my face from the bite
all the lovers are in retreat
the snapshot is all tiles and red walls
come with me now let night move into day
i'll take it to the tip yard
i've finally decided i'm here to stay
dream freeze sprinklers in the sun
invite the looters back the price is right
'cos i just wanna swim with the fish in the sea
when you look right in
see them 1 full of shit
son she said
oh she walks slowly
of course there is
iii'm still alive
before you die
to just get by
we've got all night
all or none all or none
to the one i'll never please

all those yesterdays all those yesterdays all those yesterdays
out of bed and he dreams in the shower she's standing naked and apologizing
i can help myself dont talk to me
tries to forget but he cant he cant he cant he cant
but i am up riding high amongst the waves
the first time you saw blood
coming through the clouds in rays
coming through the clouds in rays
like an angel i live alone

said one two three four five against one
i'd rather be with
said one two three four five against one
folding in the darkness
her sons slanted
father is risking
i'm wishing you a well

to the ocean of my platitudes longitudes latitudes
i'll stop trying to make a difference no way
who's calling an angel
my friends call me ed they call me
this is not for you
it's nothing as it seems all that he needs it's home
it's nothing as it seems the little that you see it's home
empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
isnt it something nothingman
you dont have to stray
fills it up with his past gets carried away
how he makes his getaway
he's yet to come back but i see his picture
for he still smiles and he's still strong
i got a bomb in my tmeple
i got my hand in my pocket
it's not the same without you up here
you cant know what it's like to bleed from here
the fading melodies cant beat my need
home now
ans i dont want to know your past
heaven knows if there's a ceiling
further back and forth a wave will break on me today
and though her mood is fine today
the future's bright
easy left me a long time ago
obeys listens kisses loves
not unlike a friend that politely drags you down
how 'bout you
left the porch
hold my hand

you can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets ohh or you can come to terms and realize you're the only one who cannot forgive yourself oh ohh
i had a false belief
the ground
i've had enough said enough felt enough i'm fine still in it
and live a lie

nowhere to run when my dog's on the prow
aint nothin but the hill
when i hang with stone and i kick that funky slang
i couldnt breathe holding me down
saw things x4 clearer x2
i was not allowed to leave the room
hovering just above your bed x2
empty
i'll hold the pain
release me
all the stars and everyone
and there is no god with a plan
it's sad he could only love you
it's not all been said been said and done
who made who made up made up the myth that we were born to be covered in bliss
never shook satans hand look see for yourself

let's pick up your will it's grown fat and lazy
and fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
i've no fear but for falling down

to breathe and reach across the bed
with the ever after
oh its a fragile thing this life we lead
want you to know

i'm just drifting drifting along
is my own equation relevant somehow
i'm a seed wondering why it grows
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away x2
time to plant seeds of reconstruction
there was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear
oh head down faces that he sees dont look it aint that
kneelin looking through the paper though he doesnt know to
someday yet he'll begin his life again
the man upstairs is used to all of this noise
we never listen
did he arrive too late and too tethered away to put on his suit and his tie
i wake up and wait up
aaah dont even think about getting inside voices in my head ooh voices
contraband hiding deep inside her soul
in the dark before the dawn
eyes upon the horizon
empty
fuck me in the brain 2x
fuck me fuck me in my brain
lonely drifter on the hill why do i
bowmans pick and dogs that bite why do i
all my stolen missing parts ive no need for anymore
when the hurricanes and cyclones rage
you and me
i will walkwith my hands bound
i will walkwith my face blood
the moment between us the fire is made now hot to the touch
i wanted to get right
i cant fall from a tree
it only takes a breath to believe
faith in their hope and to buy themselves time
there's no need to hide
we're safe tonight
my lips are shakin my nails are bit off
an empty shells seem so easy to crack
oh i walked the line when you held me close that night
if he only knew now what he knew then
cannot find the comfort in this world
a truant finds home and i wish to hold on too but saw the trapdoor in the sun
i shut and lock the front door
i swallow my words to keep from lying

misunderstanding what original truth was
and those misguided there was a plan for them to be
there is a sickness a sickness coming over me
what do you say god what do you say
and you turn and run following the fast foolish lie
the fear to bring children into this world

face to face each classic case
coast to coast la to chicago western male
i've been hurt so many times before
so be careful and be kind
so naive

came good out of grief
you can turn the wind into a song
your light fills the darkest room
if i tell you now
and it never felt like this before
sometimes i think you're just too good for me
you give me the sweetest taboo
to turn my back on you
ooo i'm not playing
i'll never let you down no way
got a bullet to spare
who's calling the shots
the fire has got to cease
i've got a bullet to spare

i'm painting i'm painting again
and now i'm going to take me to you

blind blind blind blind blind
done she looks down at me

i will relax alone with my loved ones
i think of the ones i consider my favorites
i will relax along with my loved ones

machines of love
the monsters we create
i'm afraid that god has no master plan
and let our instincts guide us
and the girls want to be with the girls
and the girls want to be with the girls
when there's boys and girls
any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing
i have adopted this and made it my own
she is moving by remote control
she defines the possibilities
a world of lightshe's gonna open our eyes up
night must fall now darker darker
it move it
well the lady dont mind
i kinda like that style
she says love is not what she's after
what i'm sayin
too weak to even recognize
a view to remember
i feel numb burn with a weak heart
i love the passing of time
if someone asks this where i'll be where i'll be
cover up the blank spots
i'm absolutely free
nature boy nature man take me along
living in a boat that's underwater
for bob and martha

i've met the people that you read about in books
if you were really smart you'd know what to do when i say
togethernessecstasy is what i need
timelong time ago
i took my money i bet my life
warning sign of things to come take it over take it over
it's a natural thing and you have to relax

he's makin shapes with his hands
they have lost all their possessions
and on the first day we had everything we could stand
well they're roundin 'em up
and on the first day we had everything we could stand
what is it

who who who is it
fur pyjamas
about some wild wild life
spends time behind closed doors
i know that's the way you like it
getting wild wild life
i know it that's how we start
oh ho
and they set an example for us i see it
they hear the words such as you're really special
i was getting kinda tired of her endless chatter
i knew somewhere amid all this distraction
the look she shot me through the glass refraction
get on down to the main attraction
you were too good to be true
a little too tired of just hangin on
would take you back every time
im a little too gone
its a little too late
are traces of the man i used to be
what my heart needs is a womans touch
oh you're not so sure that you're in love anymore
aint it just like me to let you walk away
so i let you on in and i'm hopin
aint it just like you to make me feel this way
or give that child away
aint no right way
empty
trying to pass a law
you can justify
i always thought she would
but it only made it hurt
'cause i know it aint no thang
but you cant buy the biggest wish of mine
and send them to santa claus
that's the best that you can do
a heart so sweet and true
everything to everyone
and sometimes all night long
beside my brothers and my sisters i will proudly take a stand
meet my twin sister betty lou
but there was a time back in my prime
got in a tight spot hustlin a game of pool
but there was a time back in my prime
but my pride says oh yes you can
but i'm as good once as i ever was
she was lookin at my feet
make a pretty woman look down each time
on god's green earth'
they're the baddest boots on the boulevard
they didnt get too far
when the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
christmas eve in birmingham
mary's hurtin joe prays to god for a helping hand
so away in the stables lay mary the baby and joe
'cause tonight i might need it
yeah dont laugh it's been two months i still got it
all the man that she'll ever need
hey daddy
sayin the girls start shaking everything they got
if your girl starts acting like she is one of a kind ya grab the next one standin at the head of line
let's roll
i got off on some wine with a waitress
we did it our way lookin back on the good days
he said the years seem to roll on faster
we partied through college acquired some knowledge
cause there aint no right or wrong nothing's carved in stone
jokers laugh and losers grieve
empty
i better not
hmmm i'm gonna really make her proud she's mine
hmmmmmmm i'm gonna really make her proud she's mine
hmmmmmmmm gone
i like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
it started rainin harder and harder
i turned around and gave her one last smile
pick 'em up and lay 'em down
now i dont even bark when the kitty cats stroll through the back yard
i aint the same she knows how to pull my chain
yeah we broke a lot of hearts
it's hard to settle down with a roustabout
wishing like the devil
yeah pump jack pump before my good name's gone
at a table meant for two
i'm gonna rock you baby to sleep
you said this world is full of users and i know that i've had mine
left with our suitcases filled with desire
sometimes we just sleep in the truck
they're lookin for a good time
they were right on time
she cleaned her plate at dinner
such a busy city street
oh santa i'm right here
daddy says he knows you'll try
and sometimes even third
hey santa's gonna take it all back
he said he's gonna take it all back
yeah santa's gonna take it all back
but tonight i think i'm gonna burn the whole pack
i'm pickin up all my bad habits again
she aint hooked on me no more
especially every time i done her wrong
she took everything i had execpt some change that she left in the ashtray
my baby left me
until those magic little moments
and she aint weak
cowboy chaser
i looked up i looked down
that i could catch 'em both if i drove all night
she ran away with a rodeo clown
these are some of the little things
where did we go wrong val
and the roses are there
word sure gets around in a tattle tale town
well she's got her children to raise that's why she cant let it show
when he's there with her he's still gone
do you remember those friday nights
and me with that crazy grin under summer skies when dreams where too young to die
and all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
and i've tried it my friend
you can pour me some old whiskey river my friend
with a grin on my face and a great contact high
did he know the world was filled with pain
and for miles and miles around
but the question still remains
you dont want to hurt me so you play along
and who'll be the one to stay
where do you hide
who'll be the one
how could she know he was a ramblin man
he called up to tell her he missed her a lot
who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea
what you gonna do when you get there
a little tatoo somewhere in between
and she cant stand the thought of sippin champagne
hey i drive too fast but she dont care
the day the paved the parking lot
and wash your windows too
and that old sign still spins 'round 'n 'round
'cause there's plywood for glass
the day they shut it down
i know this boulevard much too well it hasnt changed since i been gone
there's the window to the room
i'd be hard to recognise in this pick up truck
not long after we moved in
who's that man runnin my life
you know i got it
you might've run on a little tough luck baby
you stayed out with all your freinds
i'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
i wish i didnt know now what i didnt know then
yeah i wish somehow i didnt know now what i didnt know then
you're not the woman behind the man
you've been standing in the shadows
you are the reason i'm who i am
some other place some other time
she said well adios amigo
she said well welcome back amigo man you sure took your sweet time
and if the good lord's willing and the sun breaks through
but i aint found one yet and i aint got you

girl you aint much fun since i quit drinkin
you made me a list and i'm bustin my wheel
'cause i dont need to see you cry
but you caught me at a bad time
oh it feels like i'm losin you
letting go is hard for me to do
two broken hearts one goodbye kiss
to love through the hard times instead of just saying goodbye
and i'm the one who feels you tremble inside
about all of our deepest little secrets that we've kept
ooh ooh ooh baby you leave me weak
you shouldnt kiss me like this
they think we're falling in love

joint custody and legal separation
something seemed to ease the pain

new orleans but that's another story

and woman i aint gonna go with out you
that's another town that's another life
she's gotta have it she's gonna get it
she's gotta have it she's gonna get it
that's what she wants that's what i'm gonna do
a whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
looking for work and any old job's okay
there's nothing left for her to do so she's packed up a thing or two
but here tonight with you it's quite a different story
my heart tells my head some things cant be said
i cant put i love you in other words
never held a woman longer
i dont dance out on the dark side
i dont answer to a soul
and hard headed as you get
mother earth has changed since i was a child
we'll open a cold one and shake these blues

sneakin out and smokin cigarettes under the porch

you might need a man to hold you 'til it dont
baby i cant mend your broken heart
yeah you just say the magic words and we'll be gone
in the towel enough is enough
oh lets not pull any punches while we're standin here toe to toe
i'd skip school and get in a fight
lookin back on my younger days
mom and dad backed me through it all
reservations for one tonight
i can see my way around this bar
oh but i can feel a bitter wind
and i hand down my dollars to the homeless
you may not like where i'm goin
and i believe that jesus
with her out of my way i'm not crowded anymore
and finally i've got all the space i need to walk the floor
lucky me
and sendin me on my way
pickin me up and dustin me off
how much i still depend on you
i knew that she'd be busy it's her favorite time of the year
mary it's christmas and i just had to stop by
someday we'll be together forever but till then
it's my way of sayin what i cant express
if i whisper somethin you dont understand
under an old brass paperweight is my list of things to do today
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
wade the shore and cast a line
catch up on all the things i've always missed
then the waitress came over and saw lisa cryin
we might be here for a while
it might appear to you she's broken
she'd of said yes in a new york minute
singing those campfire songs
i should've been a cowboy
stealing the young girls hearts
i cant get enough of my baby's huggin and kissin
they want to know why i let her keep me under
wrapped up in her love is i wanna be
this used to be our hangout now i guess it's only mine
one morning we woke up an we'd turned into lovers
a counrty boy like me dont ever get no uptown lovin
i strapped my courage on
i said 'sweet'
and dont she look delicious
but i'd catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness
i'd write your name in candy kisses from here to carolina

the smell of becky's coffee rolled me out of bed this morning
it's as sad as it's true
you stepped one doorstep over the line
you brought it all on yourself
you've gone
a full time job and part time wife
we can take it nice and slow
we've still got time
baby dont you want to go back
everybody knows how much he meant to you baby
and you never had your heart broke or so you say
it's gonna get sad maybe even sadder
i walked her home and when she opened up her door
blame it on the mistletoe
how could something simple as a kiss
you're probably half way to albuquerque
i guess you did what you had to do
a yellow ribbon from your hair
in my blue bedroom
high on the hog and wild on the range
and the wisemen saved for a rainy day
you can buy a house a dime on the dollar
age is just a number
i wanna do it right
i aint got enough money for a big diamond ring
under that cypress tree
her body heat
it happened fast
burnin moonlight
i got one on the way and i dont think i can pay the doctor bill
but that dont put in no jack
then in the end if my ship dont come in
its a drive threw window
cant buy you money
just something shinin on her hand
and i cant even afford the shine
hear the clerk say ho ho ho
had been one happy holiday for two
the love we share is for all time
i will spend christmas to christmas lovin you
she was a shooting star

my daddy was a roughneck too
and my baby jumps in and she fires it up
i run around with hillbilly girls
we'll always stand up and salute

if i forgot to remember your name and your face
i just saw the rest of my life honey you're in it
i'm rushing along but at least i gotta ask
aw dont walk away honey i'm just trying to
dont feel like home no more
then i broke your heart in our
the treasures of the world
come on back to our double wide paradise
with a short little note said i had a good time
and she never even bothered to ask
ooo there's a thin line between dreams and memories
bad love she took a good shot
inch by inch she gets a little closer to me every night
and when she's ready i'm here and i'm gonna hold her
girl whatcha talkin 'bout i aint believin this
does it matter girl who's really right or wrong

they walk right in and sit right down
driving from work in our ordinary cars
but we just punched out and its paycheck friday
and when the going gets tough well the tough get going to the little bar down the road

i know i should have gone home but i was doin that caribbean thing
well there was silence at the end of the line
hello if you give me just a minute
empty
but buddy what do you expect

chorus 2
see my baby doll
in 1985 i placed a bet and lied
we've realised there's no going back
only 16 years of age he said
cheeks sunken and despaired
i wanna be so skinny that i rot from view
but i can see my ribs and i feel fine
and not soil its purity
i long since moved to a higher plateau
i wish i had a bottle
i wish i had a bottle
we dont talk about love we only want to get drunk
but once within a long and broken night
but always the moment it just seems to stay
this is a song
pretend humility the ugly lie
it's the facts of life sunshine
to carry the sky away
always never
daylight bores the sunshine out of me
only exists in advert time
sunk deep in my tv
i wonder who you think you are
nail it to the house of lords
blanche and pickles amin milosovic
not punish less rise the pain
give them the respect they d e s e r v e
i want to fly and run till it hurts
sleep for a while and speak no words in australia
wear your love like it is made of hate
remember the best times are yet to come
clear your heads and get ready to run
remember the best times are yet to come

as if they never exist
the devils playground
you cover illness with flowers
to be morally good
it ruined me
know that i should never give advice

my eyes are shut tight
this black dog is out of control
my eyes are shut tight
a blind illness of my anxiety
a memory fades to a a pale landscape
for the outside
the small black flowers that grow in the sky
it's not that i cant find worth in anything
when you get high 'it's so unreal
pay for it
we promote all sickness and disease
when i'm this still you are my life
searchin for the dead sea scrolls
so why so sad
so why so why so sad
and demons too but not even then
solitude sometimes is
solitude sometimes is
making weak minds think this is what they want
soul contamination do you rise up
life reduced to suicidal pain
all broken up at seventeen
dont wanna see your face
but dont fall in love cos we hate you still
anxiety is freedom
'cos the air that i breathe tastes better down there
i'll be in suicide alley being who and what i want to be
how can you sleep at night sleep at night
that could really take the pain away

and yes we mean it too

clinging to the microwaves

death sanitised through credit
what's the point in always looking back
no not blood just liquid from you
never had the chance to take you home
and sit with me then you can hold me tight
cherry blossom tree but at least you are free
i am the raping sunglass gaze
slavery to the pleasure
slavery to the beat
all taste is nothing old pictures blowdried
slavery to the beat
but it's not good enough even though it's real
and then we can drink some ocean spray
empty
still clinging to the umbilical chord umbilical chord
my nerves are destroyed
so make sure you take your medicine boy
shed some skin for the fear within
freed from the century
then everything must go
leave this country
leave this country
leave this country
believe it
clean flesh and lines tainted uv protection
hate goodness
a morality obedient only to the cleansed repented
shadows arent clean false mirrors too many people awake
so damn easy to cave in man kills everything
but i found that soul
reflections look bad
but i found that soul
tiny massive hands emphatic lonely soul
the effects will fail to desert me
then pacifism killed us all
free to fuck from paris to beijing
the west is free oh the west is free
i write this alone on my bed
from despair to where
i try and walk in a straight line
the happier i am when i'm with you
the simpler the answer the harder it can get
further away
this is a culture of destruction
empty
why dont you just fuck off
if we can still fall in love
if we can still fall in love
rock n roll has a conscience
white liberal hates slavery
gold destroyed
dont speak the truth anymore
i've loved so much that i cant go on
no interpretation
breathing dead and i'm born to end born to end
images linger like repression born to end
underneath the blue skies beautiful empty dying dolls
in the cardiff afterlife
and evil that no one saw
in the cardiff afterlife
i think it's all the fucking same
no innocent exit when hope dies
masochistic love going nowhere
review with avant garde lips you're just a motherfucker
allow your leaders to control you
interrogate scriptures and not your stinking home
nail a crucifix onto your soul
i'm gonna give it to you
cant you hear me howl
for fear of zeroes
got no future
got no future
sovereign fingers scrape our lives until we are bought
mother of the free she said that we'd breathe
mother of the free but we just scream
i wanna die die in the summertime i wanna die
i wanna die die in the summertime i wanna die
door to the river
following our star
are just lies
realise how lonely this is
forgive them forsaken
so much fun to be had in my head
show me your scars you're so aware
got a feeling sweet like honey
drug drug druggy
limited face paint and dyed black quiff
it's so fucking funny it's absurd
a simple word called liberty
the relics the ghosts all down so many roads
leaves a taste so bitter and cold
god knows what makes the comparison
colossal endless like a marathon
the statue of liberty looks so solemn on the tv
i walk on the beach and for once i feel some ease
as long as the right words are used

never grown preserved gently
all removables passing always

what kind of a man could live this way
be myself with you

you play the part so well
so no one lives inside
if you cant speak you cant lie
can you make it on your own

you were wronged
lie down in the flowers

things that might not help you
promises i never kept i will leave you
i will hate to leave you
a different point of view in every speech i make

im the man of a thousand ages
i stole a fire but it burned up much too soon
speak like a leader with the voice of power and command
voice of command
stones in the parthenon
face in the stars
leave me running in the wheel
i will leave you alone
all your byzantine excuses
afraid of sunlight
so how do we now come to be
so how do we now come to be
so how do we now come to be
scorch marks on the road ahead
there's a line on her jeans that a ballpoint made
so if you ever decide that you have to escape
see those people there
it used to bother them but now it's ok
see the little girl spirallin down
we could make a pillow of sand and sleep
for god's sake dont pretend to be concerned
i was taught from the much too young
i only wish you knew
cause happiness is not something
to never give myself away
i dont say all i can
no incantations of remorse my friend
listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision
a friend in need is a friend that bleeds
a non com observer
everybody knows that we live in a world where they give bad names to beautiful things
we should live in a beautiful world
have you the faith to be
and we fall green to red to brown
i dreamed i rolled on the ocean floor
that dragged me down to the ocean bed
rolled in the sway of an iron bell

and from glowing tongues of candles i heard her whisper in my ear
i gave up watching tv in my favourite seat
give it all you've got to give
a million loose ends to tie up
and a lifetime of surprise
drugs in the food
i never got over it
the greed and the missiles
the face of starvation and the state of the nation
a lonely stretch of headlight diamonds trapped in black ice
i'm so far out and i'm too far in
washed with morning rain

but she's saving her money for a better life

as pain flows through me like champagne
was the time that it took for me to fall
the boasting and the noise
in everything that i love
the orchestra swoops and the drum samples roll
here come the flowers
things would be different
oh how years change the things for which we strive
life is strange

rain on me it started to rain
the stalagmites of culture shock
i was born with a heart of lothian
see no hear no speak no evil
you wake up one morning wondering who you are
hearing silent whispers
heaven loses you to this world
from a space just a few inches wide
but like a needle in a haystack
you're lookin up at a mountain
one day freedom
now who are you deceiving
well i can tell you somethin
she's got her hooks in you
for the future
my hands steady as a hangmans hands
i feel kind of limbie brain
spinning lines
the tell tale tocking of the last cigarette
the pilgrimage to happy hour
half the house is missing
and when she smiles i wanna die
god if you hear me
looking at it not seeing it
maybe you're just too upset inside too upset inside
you wont explain
well i dont understand
i think it's you
dont let anyone tell you
even if the good old days were good
savin up for mary savin up for jane
did you ever fall in love
we can see sense
and find you couldnt move
and you're going nowhere wake up wake up
did you give up
hard ball dream love now roll
if my heart were a ball it would roll uphill
i dont want launderette anonymity
but i dont want to be a tin can tied to the bumper of a wedding limousine

in which you will always be the star always be the star

massive friend cathedral wall

and pray
beneath the face of louise brooks
all the food that you refuse
another virtual page arrives
interior lulu
but it's happening again and you're waking up in pain
you've bored us all to death with this
if you can buy it it can be stolen
we rejoice at being connected
all this gold beneath my skin
we are siamese children related by the heart
scrambling distress signals on random frequencies
are we trigger happy
yesterday starts tomorrow tomorrow starts today starts today
but i could never lose the light
today i saw music in the sky
sweet as can be
you comin out to play
between you and me
prowl my dreams
problems problems problems problems
you've got venom in you stomach you've got poison in your head
pumping arteries ooze the problem through the gap that the razor tore
he knows you know he knows you know he knows you know
many's the time i've been thinking about changing my ways
just for the record i'm gonna put it down down
it's just for the record it's just a passing phase
are we living only for today

empty
no more judy
hang out and laugh at your jokes

to the ticking
i need patience
empty
one of these days you're just gonna stop
no doubt
talk about failure
no darkness
over again
a teenage extra from the satellite tv
too bad too bad
and you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again
too late to say i love you
in the playground of the broken hearts
the game is over
now sad in reflection did i gaze through perfection
remember the jester that showed you tears the script for tears
do you love me
that mourns in lonely exile here
we'll tell our childrens children why
you never miss it till it's gone
a loss regrets could never mend
you wouldnt want to know
separated out
so unstable inside and out
can you put my spine in plaster and take me home
empty
distinctly a casual affair
they know what they want they sing your name
fighting leaves behind
home truths tear in a home
now she wont believe me
now she wont believe me
this is the story so far
parading their anecdotes tired from old campaigns
take me away
waiting on the wistle to blow
but it's the cost of the high
and you know what it is
on the old and the young
and this splintering heart
i heard sinatra calling me through the floorboards
cos i know what i want know what i feel i know what i need
blame it on me blame it on me
and sympathy is what we need
no there's not enough love to go 'round
paranoia roams where the shadows reign
and if my owners let me
pretend you're off the hook with the telephone
we'll take the alternative way
warm wet circles
to patch up a dream
the day slipped by and i tried and tried
but we were always alone
there's a truth in the madness that i cant get beyond
but i cant get beyond you
i would sit down on the street
exhausted and insecure
if i was a child
not the regal creature of border caves
to wash away the memories of a friday night down at the club
two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
it's too late
on the ringroad to somewhere
last night you said i was cold untouchable
so now we're passing strangers at single tables
some of us go down in a blaze of obscurity
and i picked up the sleeping pills crushed on the floor
there's a presence
washing the memories from her husband's clothes
does anybody care i cant take any more
echoes silently around the cold grey places
and yet bound together and hopelessly in love
never loved before
she's inside you
dont you know he was born to do you down
'cause what will be will always be
thank god for built in bastard radar
i watched her as she walked across the coals
she was singing i was born in nineteen sixty weird
with a tyrranosaurus rex
if i fall in love now i'll be floating in seine
let sugar daddy melt in his home sweet home
stockpile experience before the blond hairs turn to grey
you'll never have the chance again and never again we'll meet
where is home is where the heart lies but where is home
stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams
perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles
one day they really love you you'll charm them with that smile
what a waste
and i saw a magpie in the rainbow the rain had gone i'm not alone
so i see it's me i can do anything
now you've arrived to be reborn in the shadow of the magpie
so it's me i see i can do anything
the light at the end of the bottle alcoholicalphabet
dreaming bartenders bourbon and saxophone
exposing bedside manners on a work extension
but was that love in your eye i saw or the reflection of mine
'makes england warmer in the summer
ferocious designs
the meaning of life
pain and heaven
they look like they're havin fun
the material gain that we deserve
the girls and the boys that we deserve
we get what we want if we're really honest
i never wanted to own you
wont you speak to me
you're an island
you're an island i cant sleep
on the southern side of the hill
the roll of the sea below
with the plough and the stars alight
viva brasil viva vida
chilling the afternoon in viva vida
ultramarine and ultra serene
telling you no not this way not this way not this way
watch the world simply carry on
when you live in their heart and mind
they just move to the other side
she lives with a broken man
if i just turn and run
boys baptised in war
forgotten sons
to eliminate those who would trespass against you
approach friend
on the news a nation mourns you unknown soldier count the cost
they're still forgotten they're still still forgotten
so i said all the best freaks are here
airport terminal patiently waiting on the last call
please stop staring at me all the best freaks are here
provoking the heartache to renew the licence
sheathed within the walkman wear the halo of distortion
the thief of baghdad hides in islingtown now
aerosol wands whisper where the searchlights trim the barbed wire hedges
pandora's box of holocausts gracefully cruising satellite infested heavens
where are the visionaries
rudely wakened from their slumbers
couples loiter in the cloisters
they say good god they say
mother smiles she did it too
beagling on the downs
nothing left for you to fight about
as she's begging you to please calm down
now the ring is just a band of gold
you never had no trouble sleepin through the night
and tear it up and never stop again
fish steve rothery mark kelly pete trewavas ian mosley
i'll try anything once and that's the way we should be
someone must have missed her by now
get used to it
tell me i'm mad
was it something i didnt say
fireworks and toys
iv the slide
when there's murder on the street
this world sharpens teeth
goodbye to all that
just when i thought i'd seen the last of you
heading for the rave
derek dick
wooden figures pagan gods stare blindly cross the sea
he knows that victory is secured his charm will testify
empty
hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell
heroes delusion with feet in the grave
i'm gonna take no blame
receive your punishment
i'm a stream of noughts and crosses in your ram
it makes you suffer and it makes you cry
it makes you suffer and it makes you cry
you can bash me with your book of words
i cannot sleep
where the sea meets the land
as the light fades and shortens
like a wild garden from another life
dance for me rose
heading for the automatic overload
you come here scratchin at my door
you're asking the wrong questions
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
hollow men can take you without even reaching out
stand us in our silly clothes
sniff the air for something we can use
i'm the king of sunset town
watch a big wheel turning round
and injured souls came to his bed
some go up and some go down
opening the doors for the dreams to come home
with our made up faces and pr smiles
out of your mind you're out of your depth you should have taken soundings
we're clutching at straws
and a hat full of wonder
that was where he found her
they're gonna go crazy when
what do you do when your roots have dissolved and broken down
it's a new day
all he wants is for me is to be strong
the end of the day
the end of the day
on top of a girl like a dream in a hotel
but everything inside you bites you
everybody in the whole whole of the whole of the whole of the world
but your invitation was clear
i'm your fifteen stone first footer
i'm the uninvited guest
i'm the rash upon your skin
i'm the uninvited guest
my gaze scans the walls of this apartment
celluloid leeches bleeding my mind
oh please do last
i only laughed away your tears but even jesters cry
now i leave you
empty
these chains are comfortable
a new day was rising
born free but scared to be
if you could only see what i've seen with your eyes
now where is the wisdom in that
chemicals for god
and it's all in the brain
astronomy instead
this is the 21st century
she shook her head
on the ships railings and some far away tide
strange misty visions of god
like everything they did to me
to find the fundamental truths
from the horizon
stung him in the face
oh mummy daddy will you sit a while with me
it stayed
this puzzle
and dies for you
and is to blame
this town has turned me into what i have become
the noise outside takes you in its arms like a lamb to a lion
the morning breaks and i watch you awake and this town takes you down away from me again
i dont need your chains
three boats down from the candy
business as usual
like elvis and the beatles
she dont know how it started
they spun him three times round the globe
to shock the world and hold his hand
he just cant do it anymore
it's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame
read some kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now
i took her hand and said let's go together
let's go together
you and me against the world
and on sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub
now you're touring stadiums you've let it go too far
with a tux on look at him now with a tux on
it used to rain
under the sun
most every day
after all this time
something learning to fly
i clutch them in my coat
on the edge of exploding
till they commit themselves to the muted journey home
a classrooms shabby butterflies
as the glancing headlights of the last bus
she'll let a lovers tongue move in a warm wet circle
when the taxis gather in mock solemnity
tie angels to the bar with sweet martini's and their charms
and if that girl is no solution
if living rough is no solution
leaves a child in the traffic
i'm going to ask her
dont do that
i want
a perfect mirror
i saw political intrigue political lies
all the children
we will swear we have no nations
i cant walk away i cant walk away
where do we go from here
my ideals my sanity they seem to be deserting me
trying to score but nobody's pushing
racing the clouds home racing the clouds home
but you couldnt say it and i couldnt say it
outside i could hear a mockingbird
it was almost goodbye
and my future was suddenly so clear
so many nights i could only dream ya
but thats way before she told me we were through
repeat chorus
so little time when she is mine i know
love that town but i just couldnt stay
i am who i am
but one night while she lay sleepin i slipped away
and say the job is taking longer than i planned i dont have the heart to tell her
guess she finally had to tell me shes not waiting anymore
since she left me by myself
and spend my time with my new next of kin
just like somebody kicked him
told him dont play dumb with us son
reckless discharge of a gun
through the teardrops in his eyes
so i guess i'll be confessin my love confessin my love
there aint gonna be no restin at all 'cause i want you too much
my will and send her home tonight
but i know my day has not come to an end
but i dont have anyone to blame but me
i'll be down in tennessee
i ended up on my butt with a puzzled look
coming down droppin fast
the higher you take me the deeper i go
the last one to show the last one to know
hey im not big on social graces
that youre livin in
from birmingham to ohio
they know whats in store tonight
i pulled out my black book and called up my old lovers
rosie who could blow my mind is sister rose on channel nine
empty
repeat chorus
but i know where to go on a cloudy day
you have been a friend of mine rainy day woman
a prisoner in this fine suburban homeso
and she enters her world of make believe
and that's been along long while
but i'm feeling more willing
stood a structure where something or someone called home
he said ive played that old guitar in a drifting country band
lucky me i grew up beneath that ole lone star
and lovin what i see
and it came as no surprise
heaven knows how much i need her
i dont know why she even hangs around
right then and there i watched you break down and cry
repeat chorus
there's no secret to my lack of success
to get me where i am today
mama sat there quietly between all of us kids
to both my precious girls i leave a million lullabies
we all swore that wed honor the things in daddys will
or the neighbor's barkin dog
down at the end of my bed
this heartache never sleeps
it wont let me be
now the silence is more deadly than the violence of the storm
me and ol jack daniels
i've made a home with hobos
this side of the door
if she could find one single feelin
on the north end of town
tonight i'll let my memory take me home
in my daddy's pickup truck
and for a little while i'll just hold her in my arms
lord i'll be glad when they're gone
and too cold at home
empty
and you'd rather not get into blame
hells' near and you know it
try watching dreams
i dressed my best and headed for
since baby walked away
robert arthur roger springer mark wright
i quit loving you in just one day
to work at home and sleep in late
yeah she drives all the boys on the dance floor wild
the paths my memories take
all i can say is what a way to live
but i've heard about you
it must have made you lose your mind
she dont like to wait
it would really help me
it would really help me
empty
and know that i love you wherever you are
empty
empty
someone true is waiting i should be with her
empty
but now im settlin down
its visible
oh i got to the job site at a quarter past nine
i had a ball friday saturday and sunday
and your mind wrecking love
repeat chorus
i can almost touch your face
the vision is so clear
mark wright larry kingston
but youve played such a part in my life and in my heart
empty
i thought she finlly realized not to worry id be home
please jolie
i left the only dream i'll ever need
this time i'm gonna treat you right
believe me i've seen the light jolie
storm clouds rising flash of lightning rattles that ole porch swing
from out of the blue he set the mood turned down the lights
relivin your old memories is tearin me apart
and how we never get enough lets talk about the good stuff
you've got to give a little take a little
you might earn a rich mans pay
busy making your weight in gold
so give a little take a little
lost in the feeling with you
lost in the feeling with you
she was new to me and fully of mystery but now i know
for love in the hot afternoon
and for giving me the life of a lucky man
empty
where the band is hot and the beer is hot
she had a million dollar smile
yeah she's on a roll which way do i go
it's easy now to figure out where i went wrong
yeah the next time i leave i'm taking her or the keys
and she'll come knocking on my door
we've cried and shared some laughs
my oldest brother tommy was a lineman rest his soul
every morning bright and early he'd climb up in the sky
it pays big money and boy i'm into that
i'll tell you sonny you ought to see my bank account
i used to hate the thought of her til her memory i forget
two paychecks are better than one
i cant believe what the judge had to tell us
the river of love a little too soon
and dont mean dallas
gotta find somethin to ease my mind
so startin now
i'm gonna get a life
i'm gonna get a life
mark chesnutt steve leslie roger springer
even cuss and swear
thank god those days are gone
they are one and the same
care of a lot of things
i know that time will take
we'd be lovers any way we could
this aint what she really wanted
but i'm almost halfway back to birmingham
never knew that old jukebox could ever sound so sweet
i hit yours tonight
ive watched the canyons on your face
you must have met somebody
theres new life in your blood
where every moment spent with you
lying close to you feeling your heart beating
'cause even when i dream of you
and just stay here in this moment
are you alone can you talk to an old friend
and cruise down old route 59
repeat chorus
got plans to forget about the way you made me feel
repeat chorus
i wont give up until i prove
i'll get you back you're gonna get
ill think of something
ill think of something
well there goes my span of attention
oh here she comes heart be steady play it cool i got the words ready
empty
youll just be like all the rest
ba da da da da da
i get so tired
to find in a kiss
because of this
to find in your kiss
because of this 4x's
look for me baby
well god knows i never hear mine close enough
in the wheels of a train that crawls
let the beggar walk in the winter
this wont die
boogie boogie boogie now
a neverlasting light come to shine all over me
it bites and it bleeds
a neverlasting light come to shine all over me
the fool that feeds on the notion
where in the world have you been
i'm crawlin all over the carnival
what in the world can it be
it's as strange as i've ever seen
are yours still the same
my violent heart
are yours still the same
please consider me
so you've got to have a man
the leaving trains
i'm looking for her light
empty
find you under orange skies
and there's only one way to go
it's going dead dead
see you when you're crawlin wasted
you will
no angels in the air
oh yeah
the more the gates are closed
and it wont be real
we can wander we could stray
it has remained
and the cold chill of time
thought i saw you in a dream
alone through every waking hour
oh no babe it's not right
make your house a home
just so far from home
brook benton
so you see i know
that you'll be true
an orange jubilee
never do me harm
before i go i'll hang in a cross on nails
cause i loved you somewhat
cause i loved you so long
i sense a dying spark
watch the river rolling by
in their loose mother hubbards and their stocking feet
i murdered little sadie in a first degree
forty one years just to wear them stripes
another fire out in front of me
far removed
shining precious light
it's a solitary star
i know he'll take me shake me
to live on
i'm going home
jesus christ been here and gone
not feelin any pain
yet all my strange and simple games
between the earth and skies above
i need a little more time
and let me breathe that air
cry i'm gonna cry now
around my heart
from morning 'till night
while the cold winter winds do blow
a shanty mans life
they wont be back 'till spring
children all come out to play
when they arrive at home
well the water fell away
livins not hard it's just not easy
believin aint hard it's just not easy
empty
with my hand
i see they're comin
hate is gone drippin lies from the tongue
i dont walk that tall
what one eye sees
and there's nothin else i can do
empty
all tied up in a winding sheet
night when the dogs from hell come out
please touch my hand
and nothing else matters
and nothing else matters
just prayers for drownin ships at sea
how can all this rain keep fallin
fear and paranoia run together in my dreams
and i'm as light as anything
in the winter time goin
mornin comes cold chills and shakes
empty
can never be no doubt
here i am still spinnin round
run around catchin 'em baby
tell me where did you sleep last night
in the pines in the pines
i have to watch you come back to earth
or written in stone
'cause my mind is an open door with nothing inside
or go where jesus fled
love's a gamble every heart will take
because lovin you is paying off more than i knew
oh now i've got you my ace of hearts
almost doesnt count
one foot outside the door
you came real close
if you're looking for more
almost doesnt count
but standing here i just got to thinkin
back when all we had was love and dreams
roll up our sleeves and keep this love alive
anywhere but memphis
and if telling me sooner was just too hard
she could've told me in baton rouge or dallas
three girl it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
one you're like a dream come true
you came and breathed new life
one you're like a dream come true
hey now look at me i'm hanging with the stars
back on earth
and i thanked them all for being kind to me
back on earth
back on earth
when i can touch you
do it 'cause i do it 'cause i do it 'cause i
because i love you
yours heart and soulfully
and i know how it feels
dont get your pleasure from my pain
i lost my wife and little boy when
someday we'll all have perfect wings
ted hewitt atkins t barnes
but whenever you reach out for me i'm gonna be there
emily sat right next to me
a farmer's son and a preacher's only daughter
i played it cool but i had it bad
it all seems just like yesterday
me and emily harper
so i'm gonna need something to go on
i want to be everything you ever want
so i'm gonna need something to go on
let me turn the light back oncause
and we'll dance inside the flame
but please close your eyes and trust your heart
i've been trying not to love you
if you care for me at all
but it dont know where to start
help me fall
feel like i'm still seventeen
now baby's got the kind of kiss you could start a fire with she dont need no gasoline
my baby's got me high low and in between
by the money he's got
yeah a little more money
but i've got more than enough
your touch is way beyond my wildest dreams
you and i will never be apart
every kiss every smile and even every tear
the hardest thing i ever did was let her go
she's been set free
i just want what's best for her
it's like she's walking on air
she's got that fire in her eyes
she's in love
when she brings his eggs and fills his cup
that you walk right by everyday
maybe she's the one
a moment they both missed until that day
that you walk right by everyday
i been workin up my never and i can hardly
anything you can hold
i wanna be your blues harp
but he sat on his front step
he's still waiting he's still waiting
she never knew her parents
the bottle and the poor
they're still waiting they're still waiting
'cause i'm here to tell you
it aint the fall that gets you
it's that sudden stop
and he did what he did
when it was gone as it could get
and no doubt he was right it's been locked
i turned and asked him
that i had to be so right
while she stared out of her window
that's the one that hurts
that'd i'd ever want
in this perfect conversation here in my imagination
one mile at a time
mark nesler martin
it feels too good comes so easy
i never quite felt sure inside
it's nothing like what i've been through
and on my way back from the past to the now
two stops in memphis and long live two kings
bet you didnt know
like a child
you're my universe
my kingdom come the breath i breathe
you're my universe
and love aint someone you always miss
love dont promise what it cant keep
max t barnes bruce
the nights we spent behind these doors
you're the purest form of heaven on earth
skip ewing anderson moore
wish you were here wish you could see this place
that just said heaven with a picture of the ocean and the beach
it's summertime all year and all the folks we know
i do cherish you
until that day i found you
if you're asking do i love you this much yes i do
'cause you take me places i've never been
i travel the world in your arms and back again
i hate chicago
i hate chicago
needed space to think things out
i wonder if he knows
i wonder if he knows
just where her heart has been
all your dreams are finally gettin buttoned down
i'll be around
in the nick of time let me make you mine
in the nick of time let me make you mine
for the rest of my life
if i have to sacrifice everything
all i think about
baby there's so much i wanna do
you dont even know your name
i will give you shelter
learning how to drive a car
i will give you shelter
folks do buisness like they oughta
no one's lonely no one's scared
no one's lonely no one's scared
there's never been an injury
me i'm no technician but a little knob twisting
steady and strong and certain
it's working
so far so good baby knock on wood
humming like a big well oiled machine
it's working
so late one night by the harvest moon
but nothin melts a heart like a grandchild will
and here you are that's all that matters
i cant tell the future
all of this is something i cant prove
it's almost like she's fadin out of sight
'cause the oldest son of a well to do banker
gonna float throgh the afternoon
if you want a good look at a love that's true
empty
i remember your lips pressed against mine
right now i can barely breathe
oh i was lost in a kiss
i wanna get lost in your kiss
hey we need a little fixing
dont you miss having the time for a
we pull the covers over
we pull the covers over
this night is young and this feeling is strong
love is alive and well tonight
out of control like a raging fire
empty
a passion that is ageless
and the clock just froze
now the majic of that moment
eight hours a day at that iron she'd stand
now i dont mean that like it sounds
robbie lee watchin his world come down around him
and i'm startin to think
i've got you under my skin
empty
empty
give a little then take it back
with a broken wing
she still sings
goin through the motions of my life
keep 'em guessin keep 'em laughin
though it aint my size
but when the sun goes down
or held me for so long
and you havent left a clue
somehow a woman knows
your mansion on a hill
it makes me proud
we've never been untrue
make a wish and baby
love can take you anywhere
wont you let me
i'll give you anything and everything
i'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
it's just another saturday night
anything's better than feelin the blues
empty
an in a moment they can choose to walk away
i saw your face when
no feelings have lasted
so dont be thinking
he's nothing but ashes
oh yeah and by the way i still love you
sometimes what you dont say
make a scene
go on and be that way
she was only ten when her daddy got fired
she smiles 'cause she knows in the end
then she sees her little girl
and these tears are gone and i'm beyond the blue
sometimes i sit on my front porch swing
to be here with the ones that love me
i have been blessed
when i feel you holding me
i have been blessed
i was born to give my love to you
as sure as newborn babies cry
seems i always end up driving by
feel so at ease
baby you're the best i've ever met
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
but it doesnt really matter 'cause there's nothin to be said
he calls the hospital her sister's house and the place that does her hair
she's just got to be around
and when it starts to tumble
these things you'll come to know
tell him i'm the woman
living water
so tired of livin solitaire
safe in the arms of love
safe in the arms of love
i've found another man
still i want you to set me free
somewhere he needs to be
she found in the pocket of his coat
oh but she aint seen nothin yet
nothing's ever gonna bring her down
give her the strength to fly
give her the strenght to fly
there was a bunch of kids laughin and jumpin in
tell myself to live a little freer and love a little better
what they dont know what they cant see
some say i'm running
let's learn to give let's talk things out
and there wont come a day
stronger than the both of us
even when my arms are empty darlin
even when my arms are empty darlin
and that is how it all began
now they're pretending
and now they are strangers
you must think my heart has swingin doors
you must think my heart has swingin doors
and i wont be leavin my heart open anymore
we loved a little and laughed a lot then you were gone honey thanks a lot
you cant love if you cant trust
i'm not the one
in my daughter's eyes i am a hero
strength when i am weak
it's giving more when you feel like giving up
in my daughter's eyes
they said he was a dangerous man
roll the stone away let the guilty pay it's independence day
let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning
the connects way too clear
starts talking to the bottle
life is precious every second
you've wasted mine and it's my time
i'm keeping my distance
you know that i need you too
i cant hold you against your will
i'm keeping my distance
now i'm standing on a mountain of rubble
you saw goodness inside
dont tell me no stories i dont wanna hear no lies
you're cattin around
the grass aint always greener on the other side
you're stealing love
gone a thousand miles
like little bits of lightning
'cause darlin i know you
shining through the rain
now your leaving me for someone else
when you try to restore what we had before
that losing you feels good
and what could i say but yes ma'am
and we walked away hand in hand to love land
for the longest time i blamed myself
is love land
the one they marked express
he was walkin by the other day and i said
love's the only house big enough for all the pain
love's the only house big enough for all the pain
i said hey i'll cover you honey 'cause the pains gotta go somewhere
tell me you love me and make me feel it
but you just put them on your shelf
so we can work it out
baby just make me believe
make the world go away
say the things we used to say
he loves me silly and he loves me sad
my baby loves me just the way that i am
empty
once a day all day long
and the darkness still echoes her warning
and the darkness still echoes her warning
i thought you walked so slow
i've been longing aching
i could run away run away
i could run away run away
i'm puny short and little but i'm loud
i'm puny short and little but i'm loud
you're a vessel your a temple
you think right now that you dont need me
that's me that's me
that's him i know that's him
that's him that's him
washed us here
baby there aint nothin we cant do
we built a fortress strong where
sometimes she wishes she was never born
when morning comes it'll be too late
a broken heart that the world forgot
yeah took it as long as she could take it
repeat chorus
i've never gone this far before
steel guitar on the radio
and cry on the shoulder of the road
kick back let go
yeah she was a little different
as soon as you started doing things your way
this aint the first time you've fallen in love
everybody says they'll never fall again
repeat chorus
and the sound of someone's heartbreak
some cry out and some whisper
and we hide behind unsure
for these times in which we live
so dont try to save me now
my step will be much lighter
from the ashes
he was dressed as a bag of leaves
empty
i knew god's will
his mother said they didnt think he'd live
i met god's will on a halloween night
and who's got time to hurt right now
life goes on even when it's not fair
and who's got time to hurt right now
and i remember where i was
wont see you anymore
some better way to say goodbye
i'm a happy girl
and my lighted fuse
cry when i feel like it
oh watch me go
cheat and tell me lies
but i believe you'll fall
yeah you got heart trouble comin on
troubles by the score
for yourknock on the door
help me make it through the night
i dont try to understand
provide the life i'm sure my family dreams about
it's not always easy but it's all i dream about
and the crickets always sing outside the windows
oh never come back
so i'm gonna walk away
how far do i have to go to make you understand
like standin up for what you believe
repeat chorus
boy my love can make you stronger
i aint goin nowhere
i aint goin nowhere
i cant sleep for dreaming about you
i cant sleep for dreaming about you
i cant sleep for dreaming about you
that we once knew
with that burnin inside
i've forgotten somehow
you keep saying love can wait
dont be tempted to come around
i dont want to see you
i've known you just a week or two
i love you
need you fanatically
actin so recklessly
baby i love you
well if sweet talking you could make it come true
but there's one thing i want you to know
at my door the leaves are falling
i miss those arms that held me
i wont knock on your door
there are two kinds of love
i dont wanna think
stuck tryin to break into my home
i'd cash all my chips in and get outta town
i never have seen a river that's too wide
so love me if you ever gonna love me
i said i'm fine baby go back to sleep
we said we wanted all of this
i'll still laugh at your jokes and argue over silly things
just a normal girl from small town nowhere
a warm breeze rocked my boat until
then through the dark i saw a rope
i kissed the sandy banks and swore
the time has come to let you go
the time has come to set you free
there you are in the quiet words i pray
there you are
when i'm lost and when i'm found
there you are
stand your ground when everyone's giving in
this one's for the girls
who've ever had a broken heart
this one's for the girls
there's a silence on the front lines
and neither one knows what they're fighting for
little sister's ragged dress
there's a silence on the front lines
now and then
from time to time
but til then
and then today i started loving you again
what makes you treat me the way that you do
i forgive once again it's just the same old story
throughout the days our true love ways
all i know is it cant go on forever
it's hard to admit it what we know inside
'cause my baby moved out and left me behind
but i've been sleepin in a warehouse in west la
no way to speak
i have been waiting for
even if romance ran out of rhyme
but your love put my feet back on the ground
and the things that i lived for
i wanna join our hearts
i wanna walk that line
it just isnt right
and it's nobody's business what she wears
what a crazy miracle this is
before i ask the question
i hear what you're sayin
in whatever you say
whatever you say
we all heard her hollerin
girls lock up your guns
it'll do 80
well call the preacher
i've stirred my last batch of gravy
i've got a mustang
and death no longer makes you weep
and i'll be here when you are old
empty
oh and never more alive
feels like a mile wide ditch
as a canyon way out west
there's not a stone to mark
feels like a mile wide ditch
sometimes i think you wish
or that i was someone else
no i dont wanna slow you down
if you were single and free
if you were single and free
must've been
somehow we wake up in each other's arms
wild angels wild angels
all my tears
we'd be fine
and it seemed to me the pain would last
now you say you're gonna take him oh but i dont think you can
now i dont know where that leave's you ah but i know where i stand
that you've been seen out runnin around
and someday say you win again
everywhere i go your hands are on the wheel
when everybody thinks they're mine
it takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman
every man in sight
any love
there is no certain crowd that you run with
any love
waiting for you
you can still stand tall
diamonds in the back sunroof top diggin the scene
empty
that's freedom without love
well get an electrician
hear me say
love you for god
empty
to the sound of silence surrounded by the mass
it's a beautiful day well it seems as such
mi chiamo 3d si sono inglese
and on a nine to five lemon looking for the lime
they got no one to stab it at
they leave the rainbows in the dark
i try to see more
to massive attack matt black appear wearing beads
empty
up against the wall behaving like de niro
a paper which you use my tongue to lick with
because my eight kay rig goes boom boom
if i was a rich man
empty
well i'm floating on air when i'm daydreaming
here comes the sun little darlin here comes the sun
the problem aint a different kind of skin tricks
so you're going for you tool again
really should be leaving but i stay
that i've done before
i've been here before
you see me i'm a drinker
it gets blue like neon
empty
i function better with the sun in my eyes
and when you're down i'm torn
empty
haunted by the medium
if you believe i'll deceive then common sense says shall you receive
empty
so goodbye
dress me up in stussy
window indigo when they go boom
you see a mans face
you will never see his heart
i seen ya diggin a hole in ya neighborhood
your a couple specially
you're crazy but you're lazy must be lazy
i must be crazy i know you're lazy
trendy wendys you know what i mean
'cause when i host my show a i avoid the girl called lola
bottom end's heavy you know we're never even
daddy g
tokyo city's one place that we toured
they cant lose
the massive attack explosione
root of all evil
empty
my ears know that my eyes are closed
ready to sing
flickering i roam
and magazines
flickering i roam
i hear the time of the starry sky
then i'm left all alone with only my tears
the big wheel keeps on turning
sometime again
down within the shadows where the factories drone
while satellites and cameras watch from the skies
empty
it's too bad it's just too sad
to share is precious pure and fair
want you to want me baby
cant endure then you cant inhale
moving up slowly
moving up slowly
moving up slowly
she comes moving up slowly
and the frames will freeze
i caught your radio waves
empty
i need to live and i need to
tricky 3d
we overcome in sixty seconds
digging a hole in your neighborhood
tricky 3d
something's on your mind that you cant share
lately baby where did we go wrong
try to set the night on fire
try now we can only lose
come on baby light my fire
always a fuss and fight
he gets in so late at night
and how serene your friends and fiends
and windows hum
you'd agree it's a typical high
we can unwind
all these have flaws
you i love and not another
if the basket should fall all your eggs'll be broken
i believe in one love oh girl
tracy thorn
if you left her just the way
and i dont have no fear
sometimes you look so small look so small
you're a girl and i'm a boy x4
i'll put my arms around you
and i can pull you into me
there's nothing i can save for this
comes back to me
no use to me no use to see
you light my ways through the club maze
why you want to take me to this party and breathe
they're invisible when the trip it flips
daddy g
toy like people make me boy like
all will feature on the freakshow
to see me lookin back at you
empty
empty
but if you hurt what's mine
voices that i've heard before
i feel like the world is my home at last
empty
when you check it them a use spying glass
when you check it them a use spying glass
shakes me makes me lighter
fearless on my breath
stumbling a little
i looked up and i was in your arms and i knew that i was captured
what's this whole world comin to
it's just so hard to be a child
yes i'm missing all the things i knew
and now i've got to know much more
empty
well i cant help but be scared of it all sometimes
she thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
everybody's trusting in the heart
everywhere someone's getting over
someone i can lean on
in the morning let me down
all day
turning cartwheels into headstands
i cant listen
to all your reasons
i dont feel it
and it's good that i'm not angry
i just need to get over
i'm not angry
with any mind would think that's all she gets
funny how i carry on and not be taken over
i guess something just got lost and it deeply saddens me
somebody else
to figure out just what i'm going to do
everyone here's to blame everyone here
but it's over now and i dont know how it's over now
dont think that i could take another talk about it
dont wanna be the one who turns the whole thing over
and there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
and there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
and when my smile gets old and faded
with you and me bent
get put back together
just touch me and then
get put back together
if we slide on over and accept fate
thinks that living here's just plain
it's gettin so damn creepy
can we talk about it
the fiction the romance
some things you cant see until it gets too late
she keeps a picture of me in her apartment in the city
but if the bright lights dont receive you
you'll find something that's enough to keep you
come on home
i'm wholly understated
and the people we've become well
empty
oh how i wish you could own me
tell me why you gotta be so cold
there will be no doubt
and tell me how we're gonna make it last
you're ready to fly
i'm ready to crash
and i was wondering
and i was wondering
and i was wondering
na na na na na na na na na na
god damn change of pace
and i would like to see it erased
move around the room in circles
all you needed was a crutch
this cold girl well
and i cant sit still
yeah there's nothing at all
i pulled out the reason card instead
well there's nothing at all
no one's ever turned you over
keep your distance from it
i cant breathe
but leave me be while my world is coming down on me
makes me feel uneasy baby
be be strong
oh some time
well i'm a wreck
and now you crossed that line
and now you crossed that line
you think this life would make me bolder
any love at all is better than nothing
chorus 2
to pull you up
someday they'll find your small town world on a big town avenue
so lay all your troubles down
you'll start to think you were born blind
you can stand up against me
you're just a one more hand me down
she packs her things and she goes
the trouble understand is she got reasons he dont
but if things dont work out like we think
yeah you know that you're the one
and you turned on me
'cause only you can make me weak
man i thought that you were joking
i believe the world is burning to the ground
started crying and i couldnt stop myself
oh well i guess we're gonna pretend
now it's over for me and it's over for you
let's see how far we've come
you know i
so it's easier for me to bear
if love were a whisper
just to pray for sweet sunshine
i tell all my friends
get me high
feels like your hand is on the door
if you're gone baby you need to come home
i cant relate and that's a problem i'm feeling
i know this is wrong it's a problem i'm dealing
are you tryin to get even with me
give you presents by the score
dont turn out wrong
whoa i'll believe you when
whoa when everything you say
there it is and there it was
i dont sleep that good anyway
in an over emotional way
a thousand lost forevers
you needed to still be friends
it's over now and i've gone without
it wont be the first heart that you break
beautiful girl
i just didnt think you'd ever get tired of me
it's aggravating
then we'll see who's sorry now
straight out from underneath
the one you're leaving now
i need to give when i'm with you
reach down your hand in your pocket
set in life man a pisser they're waiting
you dont know me now
i need you now
are you gonna help me out
so someone tell me why why why
you figured me out i'm a child and i'm hopeless
gonna give
i will
you dont know me i cant change
i'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on everyone
if i were someone else would this all fall apart
the only thing that seems to work at all is you
but i gotta find more
are you listening can you hear me
i was listening to the radio
and wondering what you're dreaming when
so i thought hell if it's over
shame shouldnt try you couldnt step by you
shame shouldnt try you couldnt step by you
but there's no one around who can tell us what we're here
we all know there's always something tearing you apart
empty
and it hits you so much harder then you thought
yes there's times i've been afraid
but you gotta give it up
but you gotta give it up
you gotta give it up
you'd better stop
singin but i couldnt remember all of the words
tryin to get a handle on a reason to shine
and i wonder how i never got the burn
she was crazy for you
stand watching from the steady shore
and what you want
empty
morning falls like rain into the city life
we're never meant to learn
move around your bedroom cursing the naked sky
when it's gone
these days are gone
but i'm not crazy i'm just a little unwell
and i know i know they've all been talking about me
i'm not crazy i'm just a little impaired
but stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
how i used to be
stop well i i dont want to thank you honey
for goodness sake have you ever been asleep
pick up the anchor and set it straight
you'd better stop well try
i know soon you will be
it's almost like being free
i know soon you will be
you think that i'm beneath you
i dont think you think you need me
make you feel so cold
if you could complicate me
make you cry cry baby
how when the sun starts sinking
so real so real
i want you on my side
ashamed of being broken in
here and now
ah love can save us now
hear my feet they're made of stone
think you're so smart that you're fooling us all
like the rest of us
you must of done something wrong
back to you
anywhere you look
'cause if this is a sign
for a long long time
was supposed to come back
i didnt mean to hurt you
i didnt mean to hurt you
starin into one another's green pools
before i knew it she picked my pocket
we're a couple o' blue fools
did you tell me how you feel about brotherhood
when i watch you go i hold my breath and dream
come in and i'll play any game you play
tell me how you feel about brotherhood
empty
she'll be all by herself
she is all by herself
she is all by herself
you have broken the chains forever
catch your breath
forget what he told you
i have found you
nobody's going to rush you
forever i'll be yours and you be my girl
forever you be mine and i'll be your man
exploring all our senses as one
forever children of time we sing and we shout
come to california come to california
come to california come to california
you try to feel
time will fly
if time will fly
i could feel it
you should know that anyway
my life is simply very bright
when you know what happens each time
that you're tired of faking it
well it's hard to take it
cursed by the past held under glass
you're getting old ready to fold
and i'm coming back with my dinosaur act
dont know if i'll find a place
divine intervention
i thought i knew you
that there was nothing you would take from me
did you need me
didnt you need me
and our love is in a time capsule
amplify your expectations
no i wouldnt trade places for what i know
empty
ultrasuede i'll give you anything you desire
ultrasuede finest grade
if i get my way
i'm leaving it up to you
me and my girl are going underground
seems useless for you to look for attack
hanging on to your pride
how long until you break
and love you after
dont let me go on
dont let me hang on long
steer me the right way
if you follow it down
there's a mountain in the side of me
my vision i swear it's true
you know that's vertigo
as time that's running slow
or pull you in the snow
tell me what you see
the reflection that you see
when you walk out
and when you leave it all behind
what will the past remember
that shines above onto the street
as slowly every thought will change
telling myself that it is not fair
if we wait for night to fall it will take too long
we lose another day
when i swear to you i never told you what to do
when i swear to you i never told you what to do
just look me in the eye when you say why
say you would rather die
do you want to tell me something
do you feel one little bit
i'll fake it dont want to make it
the moment leaves you without a vision
and no i dont want to kiss you
what matters
time hating to think it was mine
the people who for years have been holding you
stay and keep it coming
much further away than i appear
down below or from somewhere above
figuring out what i might say
all the seasons seem to congregate
wind and the sun got together
i tried to call you but the line was busy
it's true that i dont really know you
if you're big enough to take it
you've got to let me know
if it's worse to live than to let go
if mine doesnt do it for you
why dont you write your own song
or you might create the hit
and what a beautiful moment
then i guess it's okay i think it's okay
you cant believe that
you think that leaving
if i can close my eyes without a fear
as close as i get to love
speak to me with your sweet voice
an evil bigger than you could know
empty
as if there's a god who would understand
i worry about it some of the time
defending my holy land
defending my holy land
girl you shouldnt think that i've got nowhere to go
how warm in the morning when you asked me to stay
and how cool in the evening when you sent me away
stuck inside of me
but then you should never have to choose
that i was weaker than you thought
'cause i did it for you once and now you owe me
'cause i did it for you once and now you owe me
'cause i saw no real harm
but it took me a long time to see
i do what i want to to
what i couldnt say love
if time permits me to live
to right my wrong deed
i'm in too deep
walking in a dreamland
drowning in the fire
into your drug
everything fits but the size of my love
but i've been waiting waiting
but i've been waiting waiting
are you made like god
and the things you say
for yesterday
i dont like knowing people
and i dont like people knowing about me
no i wouldnt want a life without you
a fragment of the pain that the world has put me through
'til the damage was already done
dropped it like a tail
the earth she treat me kind
next time it will be all of me all of me
couldnt hold the love i trusted in
the love i trusted in
i've been living in the past
i will still be waiting
but you'll never find love
will you tell him who i was
you'll do it again
i will let you take me for a ride
i'll do it again
you know breaking up is half of the fun
anywhere you run
before i knew i had you you were gone
but not today
against my will
and i'll try harder than before
but oh baby
and not look back at the past
and the first song is out the door
not say things though they
i will remember too
does she talk
to open the door to her heart
empty
old true love aint too hard to see
old true love aint too hard to see
they keep telling me the past is gone
dont go
when really it was so
somehow we were so
she's in my dream
i want you
evangeline evangeline
you can tell your father
i think i love you
but all your prayers they brought no answer
in every love there is a promise
there's no reason
but change itself change itself
like a bird you'd sooner fly away
tear it up 'til there's nothing there
and there's so much room to move
should i put my faith in you
i lay down in the evening
should i put my faith in you
this is the day for which you have fought
as soon as you have said it's hers
no understanding no sound from above
no understanding no sound from above
and i'm only waiting for you
maybe that's someplace time wont take you
you've never had
you might be happy just to stay
get older
that you were happy for today
for somebody to love
in the arms of a good friend
'cause you
your depth of sadness was a gift
i'm tired of wasting my time away
any reason why you cant go on is fine with me
i dont want to see the whole thing wasted
as long as we dont sit in silence
there'd be nothing that
touching in our sleep
anybody else
we'll begin the race by living in ecstacy
are hardly worth it
lived half in one and half in the other
i'm in over my head
you'll never get the chance to recover
i want back
something they left here with me
something they left here with me
trying to grab your little piece of mind
no two days are quite the same
but i cant hold it
not when i need it
i waited for you here but you never showed
but i couldnt keep my grasp cause nothing lasts
you should never have to feel
'cause i'm exactly who i want to be
so i will quiet her
i will quiet her
and i wont be left at the battle front
you're reaching out
all my dreams are through
you're reaching out
i'd come undone
and i showed you what you had to do to make some sense
we cant solve problems
you dont know how you move me
it's hard to even want to try
something is beautiful and true
and i'm beginning to think baby you dont know
when it's high up in the sky it almost looks like
how does it feel when they have turned out the lights
when it's high up in the sky it almost looks like
'cause there's a hole in my heart getting bigger
and everything i'll ever be i've been
i've got a split personality
when it all goes wrong
i've got a split personality
it's time
super baby
lover you're the one
than my dream
i want you right where you are
my blood is still warm
my blood is still warm
before i take your blindfold off
i'm superdeformed now dig it
so wont you love me tender
that's right
we want you to act like nothing's wrong
yeah it kinda flies right into my face
empty
just because you feel hollow inside it's real
that makes you do things
of silly dreams
all of you worries
be my angel
just take me down
you are my spirit
is now
just waste my time
just hold me down by the water
look on if you believe
walkin through the city
i never really wanted your heart
i know you're cool
that sails by my window
outside my doorstep
cry cry for you
i drove my car into city lights
cry cry for you
i cant believe what i had to say
now i cant
fade into you
fade into you
and while i'm playing for you
and on my easel i drew
i just want to see you in your eyes
just one more thing of mine
still calls
i know the way it leads to home
that comes to me
ghost on the highway
you're a ghost on the highway
i know i'm the only one for you
you'll be upstairs
as if you've been sayin something bad
maybe just another light that shines
it's like i told you
i want you to hold on to things that you said
they hold me inside
i know it shines
inside today
i could feel myself growing colder
and i'm still coming round for you
i've been let down
everybody just wants to be free
there's a light in your eyes
i thought of myself beside you
to check my head in your pane
oh where
under deep
now i'm goin home
ride it on baby
but you're leaving like you said that you would
ride it on baby
i can wait a million days
funny how things change
watch her come down
empty
and my body's flyin
my baby's feelin bad today
she's my baby
let me hold you tight like rain and sunshine on a rainy day
let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance
the crash of light come down on me
that's just the way you are
fake everything
you're just waiting for her to come apart
or just a little while
from your demise
the red and orange and the sounds all around her
in her mama's bellyopens hersisters
empty
in our memories
another life that's left
after i bent myself to my knees
and brought myself back
sweet 'ol new orleans
it's rainin
now there's not a soul
i did no right you did no wrong
that this would be my last goodbye
dont make this hard on us
goodbye 1000 times goodbye
i want to be honest with you i met someone else
in my heart you know that
i still really want to be friends with you
was turned off
a man without any valor
if you follow your advice
if you follow your advice
the speed of light trapped under my hood
the speed of light trapped under my hood
i'll have one more yesterday
99 ways to die
in a black tie and straight jacket
there's a prison in my mind
welcome to my hide away my secret place
scary things that's right behind me
a hole in my heart a hole in my head
turn bad days into good
i lied just a little
when i said i loved you
i question your call by the tone of your voice
i want to destroy possibly
i use anarchy
destroy
your future dream is a shopping spree
i thought it was the usa or just another country
but when i seek out your voice
slight of hand and quick exchange
gravity's got my bones
irrational youths stop to stare
angry again angry again angry ow
great nations built from the bones of the dead
the other genocide
hit them in their sleep
destiny that crooked schemer says the dead shall rise again
it's ok to die
shun words of the bible we need implements of war
it turns to ashes in your mouth
where could you be found
because you wouldnt understand
in denim and leather
empty
a life that was born free
our ears started to ring
splashed into the sea
with demons remote
an act of worship
their minds are helpless
the sky is crumbling in
black curtains never ending fall
my legs are paralyzed
i have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath
i never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled
feel a might unsteady
never trouble till you're squeezed
now the second round begins
that couldnt drive a nail
oh no the game starts in
joining hands with wicked ones
monitoring all wages
new world order you shall be shown
i opened doors for little old ladies
my dog bit me on the leg today
no more mister nice guy
but all the answers disagreed
that drives me on till all is gone
and now as gabriel sounds my warning bell
of mice and men
all day long i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
what do you mean
i dont pay my bills
i'm just not your kind
peace sells but who's buying
and what do you mean i dont pay my bills
what do you mean i couldnt be president of the united states of america
peace sells
i should have known you'd crush me
sleepwalking to the gallows
taste the waters life's abundant
i bring poverty sickness and death
deadly more deadly than man
imprison your soul your hopes are my games
and i can see there's something wrong with you
you work for me you're working nine to five
the problem is you problem
oh what you gonna do with your problem
problem well you got a problem
unless somebody's born or dies
i will wait till then in heaven i promise you
but it's much to late when the fear is gone

i'm an outcast riding into town alone
a drum beats for me it's louder every day
i got a lust for wandering lost in no mans land
i've walked a minefield for you
time to release your pain
when prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard
when you take everything and you stay too long
we'd be going anywhere telling people
men rise on stepping stones of their

all my plans denied
i'll ever speak

my body's gone that's all

my body's gone that's all
and my memories left with you

yearning to be held by you alone so alone i'm lost

the old oak might trick your eyes
it's a nightmare found

turning the wheel of time
they played all night in the burning light
but they were alive

minutes and seconds are passing us by
we could use it on some other day
minutes and seconds are passing us by
a sight anna would never see again
in the torture chamber she couldnt feel much more
anna's crying screaming liars

in the dead of night flames are rising cant you see you're dying
music lyrics by king diamond

or will i be condemned

o thou of countless names
i was made a mercenary
i'd love to hear you cry

you are the ghost of change and now we meet again
you are the ghost of change and now we meet again
they say you know the secret secret of time
gypsy you're inside of me
they say it's full of demons that satan keeps them there
i dont want that holy water i guess i'll never learn
but keep in mind that if you do who is it you deceive
let's go to the house on the hill
let's go to where time stands still
i was one of the mentally illwho stayed in a cell of his own
645 am man that just cant be right
say say what you wanna say say it loudly
i believe that you're always here with me
you are there as sure as i am breathing
who's to say what you cant see cant be found
who's to say what you cant see cant be found
they wonder why we do the things we do
all creation hangs on your every word
you are my cornerstrone who's love endures
ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright
count it pure joy when the world come crashin hold your head up and keep on dancin
what never left
remember the day
repeat chorus
bless me indeed
may your greatness fall on me
people asking me how i
but instead i draw closer through these times
the dark clouds that may loom above
i will worship you
i will worship you
what can we say to describe just a glimpse of your glory
by the wonderful arms of glory
and now i know where i'm supposed to be
oh i want to be caught up in the middle of you
around his holy name
come you who are searching
we'll shine the light of gloria yeah 2x
but i am breaking free tonight
reaching for your hand
and even though the world may think
i trust you for everything
call me crazy
call me crazy
you're everything i cannot say
with everything i can and cannot know
you are everything impossible
you're the love you give to me
you are everything impossible
no matter where your hand may lead me
use me
empty
i wonder when we first bought into this so satisfied with status quo have we convinced
back to chorus
and though we may not understand why you'd give us another chance we praise you who lets us
leaving from his nine to five
who will rise up for the king
empty
because of your mercy
you are holy
caught up in the wonder of your touch
please do not let go
will this season ever pass
just understand that we are all the same
but the reason why i'm broken the reason why i cry
i close my eyes and i see your face
if home's where my heart is then i'm out of place
the house of god
music for the king
o how great is your love
let it reign
by your side
will i sing hallelujah will i be able to speak at all
i can only imagine
has found a way
sending up praises
i worship you
empty
'cause you promised me you'll always be there
until you know what you would die for
you put me here for a reason
time will fly but until then
i'll embrace every moment i'm given
in a blink of an eye that is when
the maker beckoning the made
those set apart by the grace of you
old mind can hold back to chorus
i gotta keep praising your name
i dont wanna leave
down on my knees again
already finished
why this happened i cannot explain why write the script with such heartache and pain could
when everything just feels so far away
stumble into doubting all the time
you're never alone cause i am with you
i wear it on my sleeve
let me introduce myself to you
the heart that's beating here inside of me
empty
chorus 2x
you are my one and only
so that i can lay low
i can finally set my heart free
empty
i believe to know god's heart
i believe we worship christ
you can shine on
believe it or not but life is not apparently
dont take this wrong but you are wrong for me farewell
cant you see
painting you with so few words
oh it will not do
oh and i worship you
oh and i praise you
and i have been redeemed
dont need it anymore
gonna raise my voice like thunder
and i have been made new
the love of god is greater far
were every stalk on earth a quill
the saints' and angels' song
with our savior and king
and we praise you forevermore
the reason we are free
back to chorus
nothing else matters here
your love is all i know
unaware of my shame
no apologies
now i am finally free
reaching out for me
hallelujah i'm undone
to the cross i run
when i next spoke your name
oh i swear the angels sang
oh i swear the angels sang
the one that occupies our dreams
everybody tries
why am i so afraid to move
i cant deny your very presence is my life
to live completely in your love
i'm finding myself at a loss for words
that you're in this place
and the funny thing is it's okay
by your wondrous glory
forever will your glory reign
that you think of me
you are to blame for this change that has taken me by storm
extended hand a friendly man who doesnt trust a soul
'cause all of them have guns and knives
empty
a peaceful world in jeopardy it doesnt really matter all that much to me
'cause i can blow the lid off any scandal that they want to be exposed
friendless he appears he hides behind his tears
take an extra moment when you find yourself at peace
can you adjust to a different life of living on the edge
you may think it thoughtless and his mind is on a string
god in heaven my only friend
will these lonely nights ever end
still i'm pushing onward alone i cant deny
and to my horror the bloody town square
they never see the troopers in the streets
hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to oblivion
in the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
what looks like it's harmless is rotten inside
lose faith in yourself off the wagon you will fall
inaudible line
well it's on the streets attack
all the masses are preparing rebelling
turn the young into old
take a chance climb aboard come enjoy the ride
all the lessons that the years have earned
curtains up climb aboard through the looking glass
losing all my marbles wasnt part of the game
you sit there in your cushy job and call me on the phone
i hope to make a living someday then i'll pay you what i owe you
this is the first step to my date with poverty
a kid whose mind's been blown away
these halls are paved with gold
as long as you do it like we say
you wont know the difference
take this and you'll be fine
research and development
before i will do anything
ruthlessly holding on
i took the easy way out
i hear the call of temptation
in his mind confusion nothing but delusion
that is leading me on nowhere
all cry to heaven all cry for truth
a lonely god you captured do you feel the pain
whoa yeah ahh
gods of wrath
gods of wrath
i'll get the job done
just dont pay me then you will see
you wont find me in my bed right off the bat
my cup runs over the crimson liquid that i need
you're hypnotized
i've seen the facts and the figures you hide
dont light a match near me
i'm in a no win situation with no timeouts left
no direction from your guardian the one who should protect
how does a child get himself out of harm's way
how does a child get himself out of harm's way
you'll look like you have been run through the mill
the enemy you're looking for is laughing all the while
you know the last words that they spoke were who loves me
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
nothin left to hide
get up off the floor
your lies are open now
from a blue sky falling
my family they have seen the battles
to bring destruction
the sea of dead and dying increases by the day
a few more years a few more tears
are we the losers in the game
we'll not be losers in the game
congregation rises starts to chant a hymn
no use in speaking out against anything we do
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells m dodson
they've got you in their sights
suddenly you think you're so bold
i would bide my time
you were a patriot's son
to try to end your life
a friend of mine is the first one out to check
what makes you hate the difference
hide behind your bedclothes meet in some secret place
all men created equal all have human rights
touched in such a wicked way
that will destroy me
it is the eye
forced to live with my fear
how can he stand to bear the pounding of his heart
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
you know they're just a pack of lies
keep chasing all your dreams
keep chasing all your dreams
what is real
you dont care what they say or what they do
you cant seem to get it right
someday you will die
the best money can buy
disaster along starboard side
women and children first
the orchestra played to the last moment
i just love to see my parents flee
like a ship that's built for destruction
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
'cause i'm shakin and i'm thinkin
then something black and very fast
of something evil lurking
by morning i'll be dead
he wrote down it on parchment but alas no one believes
so many teachers preach a lie to the sheep who need a guide
you wandered throught the wilderness
one bowl for the wicked
remember what i've told you
here's your ticket
what gives you the famous final word
demonstations in the land
the human factor has diminished in oh so many ways
everybody wants to be a star in modern days
i wrote the book two easy steps how to succeed
when the human factor shows
demoralized servant to my every need
life as you've known it you'll be much too old
hatred grows among the ones destined to be slaves
blood begins to flow
i'll hit you like a ton of bricks
i will dare so i will win
taking chances
ton of bricks ton of bricks
it's far away at least for today
you wait for tomorrow to call
stare in the looking glass and wonder who i'll find
and oh lord i'm coming home
come whatever may
with open arms meet catastrophe
i know the when but not the why
the joy of violent movements pulls you under
i cant hear ya talk ta 2x4
into no one into no one
it aint my bitch
draggin me down why you around
aint mine your kind
hold it dear hold it suffocate
crush all within my hands
let you run then i pull your leash
crush all within my hands
control is love love is control
all blistered and burnt cant hide my disgrace
i'll split you to the bone help set you free
like a double dozen before ya smells so sweet
sent to avenge my mother sweep myself
power wolves beset your door
i cant believe the price you pay
so true
the ultimate in vanity
justice is done
their money tips her scales again
justice is lost
seeking no truth
like lesser birds on the four winds
behind the clock back there you know
the queenly flux eternal light
would find themselves at four winds bar
and dont forget my dog
just let me kill you for a smile

you're in the pit
i know you're living in a fantasy
a betting fool a gambling man
lucky in love
oh i'm lucky in love
back in london try to win in back
yes i'm lucky yes i'm lucky
yes i'm lucky yes i'm lucky
what's that a royal flush
judge and jury help me please
i wanna take the witness stand
judge and jury help me please
the future with my finger nails
i saw the future just shatter in glass
it's all baby so unclear
you used to be my party doll
you used to be my number one
hear the heartbeat in my song
where the drinks are knee deep on the floor
life for the living in soul city
the boys are pretty
come down there with me
was it black and white
i said oh yeah
did you fight in the war
tell me right away
a place far in the future
now i see that you're doing alright
standing around in the rain with my hands froze
i bought you and all those tickets to the opera
throwing out a whole life's low life's possessions
running out of luck
running out of luck
chasing those green fields
and help me help me grind this mill of life
i need a lover surely as i need a friend
cast all your fears aside
say you will be mine
maybe it's true
you've been going downtown slave romancing
swear it on a thousand bibles
while you are the mistress of a mafia man
you've been bad you've been bad
so feminine you looked so lost
now dont be cruel say you dont mean it
from where i'm standing i'm just a bum
you want me to stay up late i'll stay up late
you want it right now baby
why do you always do me down down down
i guess i never read the sign sign sign
who are you to shoot off your mouth
find me in the movies
so keep on looking for me
shoot off your
you had me eating from your golden spoon
you turned the heat off and left me standing
really love my sweet thing wanna' lick it up
think about the bad things
think about the good things
think about the wrong things
think about the right things
let it down let it down
when life was so much calmer
is it too too far gone
i would spend my childhood days
too far too far gone
and it's too far gone
turn the girl loose i wont touch nobody
just turn that girl loose i wont hurt nobody i swear
when you turned your back i got the keys to her heart
they keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
i said brother if you only knew you'd wish you were in my shoes
you can keep on using me
tell me the names of the
that i dont know myself
of earthly delights
come on home
and i know i've lost the keys to your door
i'm a wandering spirit
i'm a wandering spirit
i'm a wandering spirit
and it dont make me war crazy
why dont we run this race together
as they bust through the breach
as we rush to the edge
we'll be slamming tequilas popping hydrogen
i'm as hard as a brick hope i never go limp
we hit the high life
we'll be wired all night
said jump for joy
thought i'd find a state of grace
as i drove down to the sea
oh joy
it's so insane right before you crack
i can see your monster makes you shake and tweeze
next time around
have i not bowed
just take my frozen hand
your black uncaring eyes
divinity burns in thunder
open me
leave the village lights step into the night
lay me down
and so now your time's come for me girl
the fields of blood i'd left
made me fight for you made me die for you
she is a walking tall saint
she's coming
and i will love him to my wicked death
i'm coming through
down to the bone now
young women fall and die at your feet
where were you on our wedding day
whoa oh give me back my ring whoa oh
'til death overtake me in the chase
i will witness your leaving
through purity and through light
we are hers when we are bleeding
they hunger for the life of me
everywhere i am heard
you were only playing with my heart
in your eyes i thought i saw my heaven
you take it for granted
breathe dont hold your breath
you feel high you feel low
breathe dont hold your breath you might be next
so brace yourself
my love is like a storybook story
my love is like a storybook story
my love is like a storybook story
depict the prince of fallen virtues
and lychfowel breed in chaotic frenzy
the holy voice torn away by the gale
are you rich oh lord of vanity
the fascination of her shape
is god your wish and all your dreams
but it never hurt like this dont leave me here
young the sun did burn my face i let its love
at the beautiful gate of the temple we must
with lust you're kicking mankind to death
i need to find her soul to save me
she gave to her lust and ecstacy
lust in me you'll dream of me life
breathless to my eyes
you didnt see my tears for you
you strayed too far from my path
who looks beyond the eyes in me
help me oh lord they're coming for me
child please come awake please my tiny son
waiting for the holy call for her blood
fear and love red and tears i see
empty
give back the sun
please leave
tearful i rest
bare your breasts to slow kisses
empty
is hell in itself
you're not here for the sunset
desire and wine go well
stay far from me i lie to myself it's not
these sickening angels look at your god
disease if i live you will be sorry i have a
he was a tall man pale skin and broken back
though he was genius
words are more effective when concealed
i could die now and die happy
lay me down again
until something better comes
you know what i'm sayin
empty
tell my girls i really like photography
what what what
you know i rock a soul train wit' a cam'rons shirt
and i get what niggas face it

told in warlike manner the storyteller by
through the carnage i wanted to touch

thanks to julia james for submitting
the power of the blaster move me faster 1965 yeah
can you dig the satisfaction well
gather thorns for flowers your river holds a
you're ruined stand down your kin piled
believe you're in hell but your's is heaven
though your skin may burn and your wounds bleed
someone who's heart could read my mine
but if you give me time
bright riding in heaven the player in rags
my endeavours to rise seem useless
i dont care what i gotta do to love you
i dont care what i gotta do to love you
and nothing to say
i'm on the run
the holy cry
how can we fight
they hide
empty
ethnic cleansing nothing more
commit grisly acts
blood stained deeds
thanks to julia james for submitting
il en coute a qui vous reclame
sing me black tunes
locked within your wishing well
dont let the negative
dont waste it it's time you faced it
it's not worth leaving
it's been knockin at you door
this is life
the devil talks to me when you're touching me
you fill me up with dark thoughts of you
the lyrics
to send it through the mail
i cant believe it's legal
heart of gold and hard as nails
she's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
oh here she comes
watch out boy she'll chew you up
that i'd awaken with the sun
once you warned me that if you scorned me
i saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day
i just woke up the other night
cos you've been riding a twenty gauged ticket
i saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day
and i was hanging round below
still it threw ya caught you by surprise
you and i so sick and tired
this is the matrix of eternity
avalons in chains
at the trumpets of jericho
see the golden light
still the walls remain
the silence of the tomb
take a ride through a city tonight
talking crap and looking like a twat
whores give up beating on my meat
i'm not free they're always tying me down
calmly walk from slut to slut
empty
she is broken
holy and fallen watch yourself die
i bled for days 4x
i dont believe it
can i trust the way i feel
please tell me now
but i would give my everything
let's separate the users
strike the blunt
mankind unkind
if it was up to me
james for submitting the lyrics
i never let my feelings show
i never let nobody touch me
now i'm stronger with you
but the hearts not good at holding back
ooh cant sleep at night
hang over me the drape
dragged across putrid ground
the weight of fantasy
so i'll always live on
no you watched as we died
cos i feel that i'm
done that done that
but this is serious
i dont wanna get hurt again matter of fact dont wanna get hurt again
tell me straight cos i aint gonna wait
cos i've been there been there
go back go back i just aint goin back
but i guess it doesnt matter any more
repeat last verse
the wind blows so light
all the angels are shamed
i have i need never wish again
i've cried for earth
and i dont know why
this song's for her her requiem
i sit here twisted and it hurts me
the affection of stillness
who has brown eye
lucky boy
endowed with joy
snap my ribs for pleasure
unbelievable self extinction
deep was my pain
strike me down cast me out
throw me into my own mouth
to take me from this place
to take you from this place
there is no stopping you there's nothing you wont do
before i end let me tell you
let me be your one and only cockstar
lost angels of your de construction
natural born killer natural born killer
and were we ever somewhere else
i was alone i didnt know you
and no one else has ever shown me how
and no one else has ever shown me how
when you were out there all the time
cause once in a lifetime
then out of heaven you arrived
cause once in a lifetime
but no one else would do
engineered and mixed by steve jackson
it's as real as the feelings i feel
empty
to let you go it breaks my heart
loss of faith in those starry eyes
need you to remind me
cause you'll only get so far
cause you'll only get so far
the smoke begins to rise
he's in complete control
without a warning
you're in love and it feels like shame
admit you're wrong oh no not yet
or do you want revenge
but she's not prepared to share you with the memory
but that's childish so childish you could do anything x8
and so you'll know your time has only begun
operation mass detection
penetrating persecution
smells of revolution
cant you see what i'm about do i have to spell it out
all i know is you got to be mine
with the ghostly lake of your mind arise
i dont wanna be the tolerant
your war machined evangelistic mission
doesnt really matter what i say
the lyrics
tormented devients when fucking becomes psychotic
father killing mother daughterson suicide pact
money and power set the king free
the lyrics
nothing left inside but you

where ya ba do for a superlative self oh yeah
so me what'cha got just take a pop shot
empty
britney rapper on and on until the break of dawn
nothing seems to be
and what he's done to me
and that is all i'm praying is
than the moment i look at you
oh but baby someday you will breathe
but if you really want me move slow
every time that i'm alone i wonder why
if you love me trust in me
empty
empty
i dont need nobody not anybody
never found inside of me
my heart it feels so safe
to you forever more
you are my melody
la la la la la la
you are this melody
empty
patiently i've waited for this day to finally come
you're the answer to the question that's been burning i've been burning inside
you can give me love 'til i'm satisfied
all this time i've tried to find you
you're the answer you're the answer
i was sittin in a truckstop
he said i know what's on your mind
they got a hundred acre dream
most of us have lost our dreams
but you cant have the waitress
there's a cowboy down in abilene
a man whose world's been torn in two
i'd lost hope
needs somebody
never gonna come back to me
never gonna come back to me
making me believe again
there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
the way you look the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
right now i think you see
are you all out of love
are you all out of love
that clock on the wall it rings it chimes
lord my get up has got up and gone
it's beer thirty a honky tonk time
momma used to send me over with things
empty
later on that night i laid there thinkin back
the chapter or the verse
i'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
talkin to mom on the phone one night
i raise my hands bow my head
no this cant be
i believe
i'll be all right
so wait to see in your eyes
past the city limits sign
when it's quittin time
oh cadillac blackjack baby meet me out back
i see outloaws inlaws crooks and straights
makes some people go insane
we were born and raised in black and white
we were born and raised in black and white
he said its just what life had planned
empty
oh how i used to roam
empty
we're right on track
something special like champagne
the day the woman walked out on me
and give it a womans name
how long can this keep goin on
i'm buildin bridges straight to your heart
wont keep us apart
i make a wrong turn down your road
i cant stop my heart
i tell it no then before i know it
we went flyin through the night it was all about us
they all called me crazy said she'd never settle down
was the master's plan
i'll give her one more drink an a few more songs
yeah she's about as lonely as i'm gonna let her get
she's come to dance a dance or two
'cause he's still lyin she's through cryin
bossmans yelling wont give me a break
they circle like hungry sharks
she's the kind of trouble that i dont mind
she loosened the locket he gave her
he could've kept her love so easily
ties that no longer bind her
where the rain dont fall and the grass dont grow
something in my heart broke free
i left her when ther morning broke
north of heaven south of santa fe
if i had the time i'd spend my
if i had wings i'd fly off
in the sky so blue
six seven eight and i can still say no
a broken heart just seems too much to gamble on
ooh there's no mistakin
lost my mind while the guitar played
price i've paid aint worth the cost
lost in tequila town
and i hear her voice on the winds of abilene
she used to call me texas and i called her norma jean
it's a day i cant forget and never will
cause heaven knows that girl was born to two step
and she dont pick up pieces from no broken heart
it's a fact that women like the one i left
you never once let on we were falling apart
it's such a cold blow from out of the dark
or some dream at the bottom of a wishin well
she can forever count on me
i've been drivin like i'm struck by lightin
if it's the last thing i do
empty
dodge every roadblock speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you
so wont you come on home and stop me
'cause i'm no good pretty mama
i dont stop breathing everytime the phone rings
and no one even noticed i'd been crying
i always thought i'd do something crazy
these honky tonks and bright lights
it never crossed my mind that she might leave me
he's got a eastwood grin an a tourist swagger
oh it's all night ladies night at the cotton eyed joe
instrumental break
neon night
she'll be my queen bee i'll be her neon knight
stand back give her room boys and watch her go
for three nights in a row
i can still smell her perfume
it's kinda like a lost and found
burnin up the night
i can still smell her perfume
and she gets crazy on a full moon
who knows the right song a slow dance
yeah the party's on and we're goin out
mama dont get dressed up for nothing
'cause mama dont get dressed up for nothing
roars down a lonely highway and it always will
we lie together in the sand and watch the sun go down
somewhere on the outskirts of memory town
now we know why jt sang oh mexico
they've got something we need to learn
we're down to the worm in the bottle
i always catch my breath
down this long distance line tonight
and it's my heart that's breaking
i aint missing you
so i moved on to tequila
well tonight i'm the life of the party
to blow your memory away
it's gonna take more than a margarita
i'm hurtin without you
my baby's like a coupe deville
i'm after her like a hound on a rabbit
nothing but the good stuff
my heart is lost to you
there was some kind of magic
someone to keep you safe an warm
'cause my heart's not a hotel you can check in an out of
take a train to the dark
my love will be your shadow
oh my love will follow you
my love will follow you
oh my love will follow you
you set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
me down
happy or sad it's hard to tell
i thought all along you'd
i met one tonight who wants
when the sun goes down
and think of losing you
i think of two young lovers
telling my poor heart
of a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
dance in and out of the beams
somewhere down the line
well i'll save some tears and meet you here
you aint been thinkin through now have you
she's a game you can play not game you can win
one more chance that your luck might change
one more roll of the dice

when we go out i guess
turning everybody's head
she's a cool drink of water
boys from the valley wanna start a fire
here we are the way we were
how we ever made it through that
desert road and a restless wind
i sure hope they catch those bums
i was just in a hurry to get back to you honey
you're lookin at a victim of a circumstance or two
you know the rest is hard
you'd give your soul to him
that look will always break you down
when the day comes that i dont love you
and i'll be there to catch you baby

what love is
feels good dont it
it's our ticket out of here
but it seems like an even trade to me

with the lights and the radio on
your perfume on the pillow
my hearts down to givin up
so i can do it to you baby like a cowboy should
from the top of my head to the tip of my toes
i'm a country boy and i'm a rockin roller

singin home sweet home
'til i'll be rollin into town
singin home sweet home
to tell you that i'm sorry
makes we want to get so close to it
just in time for the rehearsal dinner
and connie said hey girls lets huddle up
trust is a tight rope we all have to walk
call it fate call it destiny
as long as there's air to breathe
temptation always knocking
temptation always knocking
you better kiss me
you're good at going through the motions
you better kiss me
oh you take me up to heaven
well then everything is alright
going out for a look and see
and the claim was made round the table that night
van and willie went out one night
well i just went out and did that
they said give it some time and you'll forget about it too
downtown where she walked
you will find your way across the river
there's a hard and distant prize
b r hornsby
so get down
he's a high performance engine with jesus as the fuel
turn off the lights honey then turn off the set
it's another day so go ahead
and the sons and the daughters got diamonds and gold
there you are still around
good seed dont grow
cocked and ready oh here i stand
go tell it to the people there
hey now watch out run
go tell it on the mountainside
turn around and just walk away i know i've done that
feel alone with the heavy load you're not the only one
let me carry the load
you think it's all gone
china doll i've got something for you
i'll be there for you
with the perfect wife and sons
my guess there was another woman
he was caught unaware accidental and devil may care
one day they'll know it was you
been so deep in the hole never thought i'd come out
walk tall and away you go
a step ahead a step behind
in my darkest hour my longest day
no regrets and it's on we roll
a poor mans paris with a parking lot in the back
my love lies waiting
but someday it'll mean everything
and the chance just to talk to you
every little kiss
when the day goes down on the
just to look at you
as you hold on tight and sway
about tomorrow
now all i see is a sad hazy gray
across the fields of gray
there's a shotgun blast
he just want to be brothers
b r hornsby
we could go down to the harbor lights
we could feel the air so wet
why not come on again
just a little tamer than most of the rest of us do
step real lightly round the barb wire
b r hornsby
make the changes
and walked on down the hall
my friends and i think you're quite the sage
i say there's nothing like a good trane tune
you could be the one at my door
and i know that it's warm by your side but you're so far away
i will walk with you
i will walk with you
sing a song send money join the chosen few
that's all they want to know
long tall cool one
for a
long tall tool one
see's the rain and it's burning
there's a man working on a boat
see what's going on in the air around you
look out look out for the fat cat builder man
didnt know where to turn or who to turn to
there was one day oh i can remember
the day we went walking downtown
we'll row the boat to the far shore
listen to the mandolin rain
i'll do my time
running down by the lakeshore
down my face as she turns to go
listen to the banjo wind
wishing i could find someone tonight
too many dreams not enough hope
violence in the afterglow
on the western skyline
one day you'll see something
i'm a vagabond and a drifter
it's your world and i'm just passing through
maybe you could make me see
i believe they're out there somewhere
sometimes my head turns round and round
she prayed for the strength to run to the boxcar
hey now where are you going
every night about a quarter to ten
people would gather from miles around
b r hornsby
lay your weary head on me
you say you either swim or you sink
looks like a special night
might try a little flash up here
it's just a little hand trick
a little spider tongue
and he stands at the banquet room bar
nothing could be found of the old ways the old days
listens to the sound of the city streets the lonely heat
empty
the girls in the short skirts screaming loud
on the first impression
hey dont you worry about a thing
i know that she wanted more than i could give
she put me at the wheel of her father's new car
you say there's a party going on
oh they got a thing going on swing street
got a good thing going down swing street
oh they got a thing going on swing street
my friends say something's changed you
and me and my baby we're the talk of the town
the city council is very alarmed
you'll get in trouble if you mess with these
in the twilight distance on the bay
there's a village on the lower eastern shore
it's a long race
dancing with miss virginia former
even interest me when they're just boring to him
keep those good songs coming
maybe it's over over tonight
where the talk is cheap
where some play from dreams
where the talk is cheap
i hope i'll be standing when the day is done
she loved the things that shine
havent felt a drop since you went away
and you're always drifting through my mind
the sky is light to the west of town
the river run high
and nobody waits for the tides to rise
but the hills out there so up and down
oh the coal dust sttles on the window display
another time and another place
oh i saw her she was sitting there
i see her in my mind and then
the show goes on and the sad eyed sisters go walking on
people watching as the curtain falls down
and you keep on walking
still without you the show goes on
hallelujah when you get to the end
all going down looking for the tango king
b r hornsby hornsby
we'll be out on the water
better times are coming up they say
when the seed is broken
we'll be out on the water
go deep in the woods down the low valley road
but everybody knew what they were talking about
when it all happens nobody wins
some things will never change
he said son
is the line on the color bar
el dorado riding on the fringe
leather skin
well i'm counting the miles
you might just not do
well i'm walking the line
now you'll do what you do
at the corner cafe
up down all around and all the rest
but oh my my when she walks on by
oh my my when she walks on by
my name is vernon james and i live to the south of town
i'm taking tickets and watching
i know that sometime soon
b r hornsby hornsby
what a time

b r hornsby
came a little early to go over their lines
it took a fair minded man not to wonder aloud
30 days 30 days out
30 days 30 days out
30 days 30 days out
sandy the aurora is risin behind us
and they kept me spinnin
and i saw her parked with loverboy out on the kokomo
and the wizards play down on pinball way on the boardwalk way past dark
chasin the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans
every summer when the weather gets hot they ride that road down from heaven on their harleys they come and they go
we settled in for the night my baby and me
we might'a got all nice and friendly
i can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone
once she was somebody's girl
she got time now for casanovas
and how expendable their dreams all were
a love so fine me and my baby
a love so fine
mama's chewing you me off about hanging out with alley trash
will sleep 'neath auburn skies
somewhere across the border
tonight we'll sing the songs
i know love and fortune will be mine
and all your dreams slip though your hand
tell me who is next to cross that borderline
todas las calles son hechas de oro
well dont move
at school
well hey man
in the summer that i was baptized my father held me to his side as they put me to the water he said how on that day i cried we were prisoners of love a love in chains
in the bible cain slew abel and east of eden he was cast
his ringing voice a soul that stirred
be free from pain and inner strife
a man content with home and health
still searching for his true reward
will come together when he cries
and all the little girls they wanna tear me apart
i got a fancy foreign car that rides like paradise
i'm telling you my darling
you're you're all i need
you're you're all i need
all i'm thinkin about is you baby
a sweet pair of legs got me feelin so blue
friday night and daddy's shirt is torn
empty
all i'm thinkin about is you
it was christmas eve i was standing in the parking lot of fabulous girls nude nude nude
you buy me a drink
and somebody shouted hey santa where're your elves
first time they ever had a superstar in this place
ma just a pilgrim in the temple of love
i'm lost in the valley of the supervixens

he shook my hand and said it was the
ma just a pilgrim in the temple of love
on donner on dancer on comet on blitzen
there aint no secret 'bout that
feeling out of sight
well they tempt you man with silver
waving to the girls
but my love is bigger than a honda
but tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one

well baby better believe what your daddy say
i dont care what the preacher like
car door flung open and a radio loud
and oh baby preacher thinks he is church
in a land where boys are forbidden to grow
when rivers run raising through city streets

and delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie
but its too late your reflexes are shot
and delinquent daughters have their own children who lie
well i dont believe

searchin for work i hit the road

a vision passed before my eyes
in the early winter dark
you ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
on the banks of the river he stayed
lookin for that million dollar sound
but i got drunk one night and i told it
of all the other ones who lost
thunder road for the tires rushing by in the rain
hopped a rusty freight
i cried too blue
i ran too hard
where the mighty ocean roars
all just to get to you
with the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with
and each one took a name
a big car come fast down the boulevard
you end up like a dog that's been beat too much
to go and kill the yellow man
he had a little girl in saigon
pack up your bags
goes with the the guy that runs the place
and there aint no one who cares
remember the morning we dug up your gun
the slow games of poker with lieutenant ray
rising from a long night as dark as the grave
when i get home from my job
my love grows stronger
i can remember comin home
well now the days grow longer
it's gonna be alright now
i'll be alright now
profiteers on jhames street sold your shoes and clothes

behind the walls where heat lightning falls
the soldier strokes his pony
the captain says 'have no fear boys for what you hear
the sergeant walks over and kicks his body and says
she spits with truth at the captains boots
panics when he sees merlins hung body stretched by the neck
roy orbison singing for the lonely
this old ford she's gonna overheat
climb in back heavens waiting down on the tracks
so leave what you've lost leave what's grown old on thunder road
if we take our chance take our chance

cause the truth's so elusive
now i need to know now darlin need to know what's going on

but for you i will for you i will
forever come and gone
with her lover's kiss on her lips
my king is lost at midnight
i'm countin on a miracle
county fair county fair
of the pipe organ on the merry go round
now it's gettin late but 'fore we head back to town
and i lean back and stare up at the stars
outside's the rain the driving snow
on stallions stitched to seaweed strands
the cowboy of the sea
and some fired hired hands
and bullets from a broken cause
first time i crossed my heart
when i crossed my heart
we crossed our hearts

dedication judge that cant be spent
the oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
and all they will call you will be deportee
adios mes amigos jesus e maria
and be known by no name except deportee
home's a long long way from us
and fill it with devils and dust
we're just trying to survive

well i dreamed i was a gypsy riding the land
on an american clipper line
'cause that's what i want to be
caressing mississippi waters down to new orleans
and they were all of me
and that's why at night i'm afraid to sleep
all your money and your power
oh looking out for no 1
just looking out for no 1
he's just looking out for no 1
took her back to my place she slipped off her party dress
loose change in my pocket
we met out on open streets when we had no place to go
there was no time for sorrow every place we went i held your hand
his countryside's burnin with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide
he rides `er low on the hip on the side he's got bound for glory in redwhite and blue flash paint
eighth avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
i wonder what the dude was sayin or was he just lost in the flood
our love is tumbling down
bye bye baby
bye bye baby
love's on the line our love's on the line
i watch our kids
and i know our love's on the line
said you're a lucky man
had a girl in calgary i gave her up
house got too crowded clothes got too titight
had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots
here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves
name it and i'll pull it out your ear
and less of what you see
driftin like a ghost amongst the trees
this is what will be
rich man poor man beggar man thief
dreaming of his record in number one spot
lovin you woman is a mans mans job
no they wont be enough
all my illusions slip away
lovin you's a mans job baby
steel gates that completely surround sir

i've been hurt washed up for years
been on a barbed wire highway 40 days and nights
i got run out'a luck and give myself up for dead
well i'll take my blessings at the riverhead
and marie she skins me alive
marie she's got the claws of a falcon
marie knows all the sources
they're all livin just a devil may care
if you see it once you'll never be the same again i'm gonna run i'm gonna have some fun if it costs me my very last dime
i think you like keeping my back up against the wall
wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done
stomached all my fears 'til they came rushin up inside
funny thought i felt a sweet summer breeze
an ice cream truck on a deserted street
i hope that you're coming to stay
by our lady of the roses we lived in the shadow of the elms
well i was young and i didnt know what to do
velvet aces they case the promised land
oh baby i cant lay the stars at your feet
i'm stuck in this moonlight
the streetlamps are glowing
i must keep on moving
she was the nurse 'neath the rising sun
she was the reincarnation of the virgin mary
absolutely nothing
absolutely nothing
the thought of war blows my mind
absolutely nothing
there must be some place for these things today
what is it good for
you gotta watch what's goin on when the lights are out
the lord's light'll shine under every slimy rock
when you dance
when you dance
shake 'em down now
when you dance
i got two strong arms waitin to hold you
times were tough love was not enough
when you're alone you're alone
i knew some day your runnin would be through
i hear the guitars ringin out
i wanna be where the bands are
tonight i wanna feel the beat of the crowd
something to break my heart
oh dont make us some little girls dream
at least i'll try to prove it to you
looking for that happy ending
the machinist climbs his ferris wheel like a brave
with a cannon blast lightin flash movin fast through the tentmars bent
and the barker romances with a junkie she's got a flat tire
i fell asleep on the couch last night woke up with the tv on
sell it and they will come boys sell it and they will come
i forget that guy's name but i know somebody must have said
you can buy it you can try it it'll help you in bed
one two three four five
first angel says go on and love her
sixth angel says you better hurry
seven angels got my number
well this morning i aint fighting tell her i give up
and they're so fine but so out of reach
hey hey hey what you say sherry darling
she's leaving she's leaving
but i love her
with another man
baby you think i'll be enough
if the truth hurts honey
but she's backed by a power glide
and it's oh baby oh baby
she's like a devil woman
be my baby
and french kisses will not break that heart of stone
and tonight you'll try just one more time
oh she's the one oh she's the one
he felt her lyin next to him and the clock said 4 am
his pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back at the renderin
he stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been
i was barely 13 years old
she'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows
i'd give my riata and spurs
i ride deep into the mountains along a ridge of pale stone
they left their homes and families
you could spend a year in the orchards
to the creekside and there in the tall grass louis rosales died
she's sent from above
sent from above
joint's shut down but you dont wanna go home
so i dont have to think
you can ride this road 'till dawn
we tried to pick up the pieces
and i feel like i'm driving a stolen car
through a pitch black night
and they made her feel 100 years old
i swore to return to stay forever more
everything's going to be allright
we found aging junkie sheep
the aurora will shine your way
that the kids might find the place
in a goodnight whisper and a puff they're gone
the terraces are filled with cat men looking for a way in
she speaks in her mother tongue
do you feel your muscles play
well if something in the air feels a little unkind
one toast before it's too late
well this isa prayer for the souls of the departed
this is a prayer for the souls of the departed
bred and raised in the city
and though parisian ladies strut so fine down the eiffel morning
let me honey and i'll catch your tears
you feel like a stranger babe who knows too much
empty
janey dont you lose heart
and gone tumblin down into the sea
janey needs a shooter jack
janey needs a shooter jack
well janey needs a shooter jack
the way that i know her style
the way that i know your style
who thinks he's auditioning for dragnet
you had a teenage band and flying hands
and the audience slipped silently out of town
first stage witness at a company killing
and in the blue light lounge
'cause down the shore everything's all right
when i'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
when i come by to take you out to eat
oh jesse you better start thinkin about saving your neck
ah jesse cant you see you're the one jesse
and gets shoved right out the door
as he lay reading the psalms of david
now there's a loss that can never be replaced
he came home too drunk from mixin tanqueray and wine
a fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag johnny's girl away
then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
we drove down into memphis the sky was hard and black
the rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
the midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
in the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
she goes runnin nightly lightly through the jungle
who's that down at the end of the alley she's been gone so long
the circle made of silver like a wreath
the lady's learned to read between the lines
cause long ago the lady blew it and they're too old now to make another start
and we'll leave the rest
tomorrow there'll be sunshine
carries whores and gamblers
bells of freedom ringin
dreams will not be thwarted
we saw the voice from long ago
the last to die for a mistake
faces of the dead at five faces of the dead at five
strung up at your city gates
sleep in the same bed search for the same proof
empty
now you were the red sea i was moses
together they're gonna boogaloo down broadway and come back home with the loot
no she wont take the train no she wont take the train
listen to your junk man listen to your junk man
she freezes like ice beneath shotguns attck
oh well aint jackie pretty aint she sweet
cryin new york city you're so wild
from some childhood disease
losing your heart to a beautiful one
as you jockey your way through the cars
and you'll find her somehow you swear
no matter where i am i'm in the right place
who could teach me more about me bind me in chains
and to me there's nothing sweeter
when you finally let loose of everything
'cause i dance for her
you say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes and follow your
believin we could cut someplace of our own
with a wide open country in our hearts
we'd be the lucky one to get out
i know that girl no longer exists

way down beneath the neon lights
girl i'm down the street

what's a man supposed to do when he's down and he's
is going pretty smooth
maybe you got a job for me just driving you around
i'm out of work
night after night you wrote the lines
again and again
beginning to end
and told me you were gone gone over the rise
the wind rustling branches against the window pane
i hold my breath and close my eyes
i taste the void upon your lips
i search for the peace in your eyes
part man part monkey definitely
i'm hard and crackling like a whip
'til you spend half your life just covering up
empty
i got a picture of him in her arms
at night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
and strap your hands across my engines
the amusement park rises bold and stark
but till then tramps like us baby we were born to run
well i've tried so hard baby but i just cant see
we stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was right
the dreams of mary keep me awake with every little curve in place
forbidding close inspection of who's tellin who
forbidding close inspection of who's tellin who
we come walking along the ridge
me and the brothers under the bridge
me and the brothers under the bridge
now some came on run some just to pass the time
and we watched from the tall grass as the challenges were made and the duels went down
well there she sits buddy justa gleaming in the sun
open up your engines let 'em roar
hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight
and was acclaimed as the next garbo
there's a sadness hidden in that pretty face
she has fancy clothes and diamond rings
and i pick them up at mary's just 'fore suppertime
empty
billy met a yound girl in the early days of may
he worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights
filling their room with the beauty of god's fallen light
i went into the bathroom and stood beside the sink
heading down towards them old tracks
to a mexican guitar
with faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin
well electric light still struck like arrows
yeah tollin for the achin ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
and then you wont even kiss me
i call you up
so hard hearted and cruel
and my very presencewould make your condition worse

when the mesquite comes rushin over the hilltops
and now it's here
that your sins will be your own

where the creek runs shallow and sandy
lived in a hotel downtown
that your mistakes would be your own
the sparks of the fire are left burning

one says hello one says goodbye
and two faces have i
two one way tickets and a diamond ring
well the first frame finds her running
'cause she's living the third world war

another unsatisfied wife
but she's another flop with a fancy name
two hearts girl get the job done
sometimes it might seem like it was planned
two hearts are better than one
and you live
on his vow that secret wouldnt see the light
i got dressed in the darkness
i can see the house where we live
for a test drive down michigan avenue
i wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry
i got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin over my heart
left blown by the wayside
it wasnt the cold river bottom i felt rushing over me
stormy days we pass the time away
yeah and they run us around like a wild herd of cattle lord
and their slips with pearly white
he'll ask but he dont beg
with a look like white heat she sways salty sweet
skipped church one sunday rowed out and throw'd in my line
but i grew jealous whenever another mand
where a man can get lost
tuesday cant find my shirt
without you without you
without you without you
without you without you
some heading home to their families some looking to get hurt
i met her at a dance down at the union hall
one day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black and white
where the distant oceans sing and rise to the plain
i'll meet you on the ridge between these worlds apart
and there was nobody there but me
and i watch my baby as she sleeps
mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy
well i called up dirty annie on the telephone
i knocked over a lamp before it hit the floor i caught it
she didnt get me excited she just made me feel mean
c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
they drove it down to orleans to celebrate the anniversary
but pretty soon it turns out
then it's gonna get pretty cold out
like a thief on a sunday morning
what goes around it comes around and
here in youngstown
then smokestacks reachin like the arms of god
these mills they built the tanks and bombs
to the coal mines of appalachia
when i die i dont want no part of heaven
your love is gonna let you down boy
your love is gonna let you down boy
like an empty shadow that's suddenly found
your own worst enemy has come to town
your own worst enemy has come to town
so you removed all the mirrors
your flag it flew so high
everything is everything
will you be in our arms tonight
alliances have been made in alleyways
zero and terry they found a love that burnes like wildfire

just hiking the streets of the sky
rain and storm and dark skies well now they dont mean a thing
billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to greasy lake
by the time we made it up to greasy lake i had my head out the window and janey's fingers in the cake
well hazy davy got really hurt he crawled into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
well as he passed the stands he was feelin all tuckered out
just stand on it
without queen isabella standing on the shore
out where the great black rivers flow
radio relay towers lead me to my baby
now i'm drivin a stolen car on a pitch black night
but i ride by night and i travel in fear
now there's a party tonight out at county line
but as i leaned over to touch here pretty lipps
then little by little we drifted from each other's heart
when our love was young and bold
just tryin to stay out and stay alive
i aint makin straight time

i walk with angels that have no place
i walked the avenue 'till my legs felt like stone
the night has fallen i'm lyin awake
at the sugarland bar

except when it rains
sit out on a ridge
'cause we're goin out on the town tonight

city at night city at night
you know she brings it with her and then she comes
and i got my back to the wall
and i'm all alone i'm all alone
with a tenth avenue freeze out tenth avenue freeze out
when they built you brother they turned dust into gold
and when she built you brother she broke the mold
she rubs against the weather beaten frame and asks the angel for his name
it was there that the workers slaved all week
for the ones who once had a notion
it was down in the cool dirty living
i want to shout i'm bound for nothing

it's closing time bartender's ringing last call
41 shots

to the other side
the moon hung like a shadow on a rung over shangai
he said you can try linda lee
and old big mama said georges raft's tonight on the late show
the inheritor he sipped his beer
and the boys in the band sung
so drink up all you people
she was a night cashier down at the stop 'n shop
so he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town

it wasnt you
but then they're more for me than they are for you
now i'm standin on this empty road where nothin moves but the wind
where all is shadow and darkness and a above me a dark sky unfurls
huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring
when the breakdown hit at midnight there was nothing left to say
hiding on the backstreets hiding on the backstreets
badlands you gotta live it every day
and a king aint satisfied till he rules everything
i wanna find one place i wanna spit in the face of these
well now dont you want to swim the ocean

raney's mother said raney stay at my side
along the street of stray bullets he made his way
and she got lost in the days
through the small towns of indiana the big train crept
and now young scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
she said i'll turn you on sonny to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
now there's so much that time time and memory fade away
on through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks
so many rivers crossed
we stood side by side each one fightin for the other

it was on the day the cowboys were banned from the range
from not having a decent friend
right from the cheapest to the best
there was a thousand starry ships
the last of a struggling people
man takes his lunch walks out in the morning light
it's the working the working just the working life
well now you say that you've made up your mind it's been such a long long time

billy sat in front of his tv as the south fell
in the fire's light shots rang out
and the moon slipped behind the clouds
in the fields of the lord
so he gave it a name
a breeze crosses the porch
big bank clock chimes
frankie's diner's

and the girls in their summer clothes

i had skin like leather and the diamond hard look of a cobra
it's so hard to be a saint in the city
and the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead

seven days seven candles
waitin for that shout from the crowd turn it up
let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain
the turtles eat the skin from your eyes so they lay open to the stars
i walk on sandals of twine and tire tread
the lights of brownsville across the river shine

and all we gotta do is hold up our end
and when i walk through that door
merry christmas baby you surely treat me nice
santa came down chimney half past three
and i just came down to say merry christmas baby
jacket hung on the chair the way i left it last night

so the comfort that you keep's a gold plated snub nose thirty two
everywhere you look now murder incorporated
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
and a winner never quits
'cause for you my best was never good enough
drift through the evening trees
come on rise up come on rise up
now with these hands
i pray for the faith lord
with these hands
out where the pines grow wild and tall
but i ran till i fell shaking in his arms
it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
there was a lot of fights between the black and white
your hometown your hometown your hometown your hometown
i got a time bomb ticking deep inside of me
i search for connection in some new eyes
my love will not let you down
and what is it really after all my lover man
come close and we'll begin
ho ka hey wah nah woh
we must provide our own new birth
you cant change me
empty
i cant say that i'm sorry for the things that we done
he's lookin down kinda puzzled pokin that dog with a stick
how at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe
groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly
well listen up stud
they can see every cheap thing that you ever done
we'll be riders girl on the night
i had a dream tonight my dream comes true
two hundred dollars straight in
and sliced through hotel blinds
somehow all you ever need's
we laughed and made a toast
empty
now we have grown
empty

i've got a house full of things that i cant touch
down by the river that talks
now i dont know who to trust and i dont know what i can believe
roulette pull the trigger feel the click
but i know pretty soon you'll be walkin this way
go ahead i dont mind the act
over the wildlands of new mexico
but there's only secret sinners here
matching braces with a spanish lady
hey my contessa in your juke joint rags you always bring candy for the kids
deep down inside
and ruby rings
for the things that money cant buy
we could start savin up
girls on the corner like a diamond they shine
there's something about a pretty girl on a sweet summer night
oh go on go on go on
but there's a secret garden she hides
to that place where you cant remember
where everything you need
on my shoulder a half mile of line
come on up lay your hands in mine
in the garden of a thousand sighs
sky of mercy sky of fear a dream of life
i come from down in the valley
and man that was all she wrote
but lately there aint been much work on account of the economy
they haunt me like a curse
you been hurt and you're all cried out you say
you're so afraid of being somebody's fool
you sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain
the way you sigh when we kiss goodnight
well hey that's the way you belong to me
sometimes at night i lie awake
you know it's hard them dreams that just cant come true
now the wind and the rain is my only love
seems like you have lied again
the wind and the rain is all i love
well if pa's eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true
we'll find us a rock 'n roll bar baby we'll go out and dance
and i laid awake thinkin about the other things it's brought
i heard the word on the country
you had your hands raised up to the sky
open and wide like the river
so you left me just your shoes
but there will never be any other for me but you
can be a love that's true
prince charles may want to live as a tampon in another womans
but there'll never be any other for me but you
but i swear there'll never be any other for me but you
we made our bed sir from the rock on the mountainside
it just stirs you up like it wants to blow you down
we're ridin in the whirlwind searchin for lost treasure
we'll sleep by the rivers and in the morning
this land was made for you and me
from the redwood forest
you know she's walking just like she's walking to come and see
this little girl is mine oh oh
this little girl is mine oh oh
you better listen up 'cause man this aint just talk
this little girl is mine this little girl this little girl is mine
show a little faith there's magic in the night
hey what else can we do now
lying out there like a killer in the sun
they haunt this dusty beach road
her brains they rattle and her bones they shake
she's got the heart of a ballerina
round and round and round and round
she aint no little girl she aint got no curls
my my tiger rose
why why tiger rose
out of nowhere
yes and them cats are sure getting fat down in the trainyard
as we watched the credits pass
so the kid goes back inside the station
whoa whoa whoa wo
he had back in high school
let the world turn
donna kept the kids and did permanent waves
repeats 3 times
empty
girl i'm only human after all
repeat first chorus
wherever you're going
'cause if i'm beside you there's no way
never again
slowly cavin in
burn me to the ground
a smile out of nowhere stops me in my tracks
i watch people run across the street
i still cursed that rain
for every glass i saw i saw half empty
it could have been the music cause it sounded so sweet
some gypsy might have read it somewhere in the cards
one lonely night
my every wish
and through the years
tonight i'm wonderin why
this power takes me from the place i belong
but believe me i know though we're far apart
no rainbows on my shoulder
that's how lucky i am
now the lines have all been drawn
and she says she cant imagine
and it's killing me tonight
i'm fighting back emotions that i've
i'll always open it to you
but till it does we cant be more than friends
just dont take more than i can give
that i was wrong
didnt want to make room for someone else
look at ne now
i could try and act like i dont care but bein shy that gets me nowhere though i admit i'm a little bit scared to talk to you a risk yeah maybe but that's one worth taking
love is the right place
so pull open the shutters
all i want is who you are
and keep me interested
i'd throw in every penny i own
to be the stars in your eyes tonight
if i may i wish i might find you lying beside me
still got your picture up on the wall
and just wasting away
and be free from your memory
i'll try anything at all
lookin up there too
it aint been easy
and it's hard when you're feelin like there's nothin left to lose
is nothin less than love
when all she wants
keep on showin her how my world
teardrops could fall
and i could lose it all
chorus so please dont you have a miracle just
with so much more in life than i deserve
a quiet girl with green eyes full of fire
high school days me and becky learnin
mama flashed the porch light for me gotta go
i think i hear your mama callin gotta go
cause you know you can it comes so natural to you
i'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
my heart's sittin on go
but you'll come around
i was out of my mind
i was out of my league
what you meant to me
the stars are shining bright
their wishes all come true
i guess i must be wishin
empty
the last time that she ever called
the truth is that he never tried
i can feel sorry for my friends they must be tired
that feeling just cant be wrong
dont know how i lived without it
but that's another song
oh the way i used to hold her
the truth in front of you so hard
this could be love
so lighten up and play along
just let it flow
when the times get tough what you gonna do
this town doesnt understand
there's more than dairy queen and friday nights
baby i just know it
it's easy to get bored
what do we care what they think now
the summer she turned sweet sixteen
the tenth time he carved their names
true love left it's mark
where they swore they'd never be apart
for just the right him
at the end of the light
i guess i'm the sentimental kind
and i dont think we ever said good bye
we could have been
only god's hand could have made you
that you'll always touch the heart and
you brought this dream
then you know how i feel
and you know that it never will
i never want to let you go
we'll see it through to the end
i'll be the one to hold you close
put your head on the pillow
lay back baby and close your eyes
and it still feels good
you're still beautiful to me
empty
jam it on your pillow case
let me catch a ride on your lifeline

green to red machinehead

sucking your tantric suck
sucker monkey on a drip
she thinks that i was with my friends yesterday
mother stands for comfort
your silver grin
all your mental armor drags me down
all your mental armor drags me down

all your mental armor
how i'm moved
it always takes you over
battle sense to keep you apprehensive
heat broke no smoke without a fire
kilburn and california
you are cobalt elemental
you are cobalt elemental
this is what i need
that clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me
will never be mine
nothin in your eyes seems to hold me
someone has to answer
and i wont let you do
you're miles away
before you know
for all of the guilty to set them free
and no names mentioned
and i'm home before the morning
and no names mentioned
posing as the night
there's no risk
empty
lock it

my home my joy
get out of my house
lock it
slam it
wont letcha in for love nor money
get out of my house
get out of my house
let me bring in the devil dreams
i face towards the wind
everything's gone white
are you at one
could have been easier on you
it might just be
it's kind of hard to lay it down
and then you go and waive it off
the night
with every tremor
there's no need to worry
there's no need to worry
i'll guide your way throughout the
ever closer to the blade
to find this mind
but now you're gone
i leave the lights on
oh god you needed the leading role
wont leave it alone
you friend
i stand around at american weddings
why are my days so far from home
be sure that what you dream of
ghost man
how come we get so lost
why are my days so far from home
ghostman how come we get so lost
a picture of you 'cross the front page
but the penny landed with its head dancing
do you want to dance
he go mmh mmh mmh mmh mmh
hello earth
on the seat
watching storms
get out of the waves get out of the water
murder of calm
i am always a little late
edge of my bed
piss on the the underlay
not taken in
you hit the water
but every time
and paler than you've ever been
it's coming
here i go
he let me take him in my hands
and never know what's good for me
two steps on the water
skies ripped open by the sun
empty
no rope no cash no serpentine
i wish you were here with me now 2 times
god stretches time and it grays
that i'll understand it all
they took the game right out of it
in the mirror
of peter pan
second star on the right
eventually you'll fall for her
she'll tell you she's true
her thighs are soft as marshmallows
wanted to buy you shiny red things
wish you were here see how i feel
the night is on fire
i was loading a new programme
nothing else seemed to matter
hello i know that you're unhappy
trying to get out of the rain
but they nig and they nag 'til they're under your skin
surely by now i should know
you've got to you've got to
when i believe in you
empty
it's like i've come undone
from whom all things proceed
through me
lily oh lily i'm so afraid
in the circle of fire
that old river poet that never ever ends
give me one wish and i'd be wassailing
i dont want to go
we're fast
we please
we need solutions
empty
a brave megaphone
what we choose to forget
taking a cue from seven days
i havent done again
i havent done again
and this curve is your smile
i knew i had done something wrong
she gotta dance she gotta dance
and make the dream come true
really happening to ya
why did you have to make me feel that
slipping into tomorrow too quick
and never get out again
and in the morning with the clean slate of day
with your body and your lips on mine
we go into the arms of those who remember us
so we move
there are times when i feel the way we're about to break
hold the world up all day
six months linen
breathe life
so glory's thrill is o'er
to show that still she lives
sad you're not around
how come you never call
a free man or scavenger
only seven miles behind
stink of cologne and baccy and all their yankee hash
and i love life
he sees no light
i look in american eyes
and i love life
me or him
for what he cannot have
see how the heart reaches out instinctively
reaching out for mama
never be lonely again
if i can swim again
waiting for this love
tell me what you want
cause we dont come around
well it's so good to be here
cause i cant take the rejection
i see bloody fountains
you're the sucker
and it's holding the night in its arms
i put on my pointed hat
was it me said you were crazy
do you think that they care if they're real woman
no we never die for long
how long do you think before she'll go out woman
there's room for a life in your womb woman
two in one two in one two in one
a rubberband hold me trousers up
and let my body catch up
a rubberband girl me
three rubberbands wont keep you up
do you want to know that it doesnt hurt me
you dont want to hurt me
and i'd get him to swap our places
c'mon angel c'mon c'mon darling
and i'd get him to swap our places
if i only could
some say that knowledge is something that you never have
i just begin
some say that knowledge is ho ho ho ho
i just begin
in my dome of ivory
i'm coming up the ladder
across the elements
i am struggling on my feet
solomon waits by the wall
we do without
it's not so simple anymore sometimes it
you know that i go very quiet
the candle burning over your shoulder is throwing
and you know it's for real
i wanna get lost in your rock and roll
empty
now now now wont you take me
stepping out of the page into the sensual world
stepping out off the page into the sensual world
mmh yes
write me your poetry in motion
here's a woman singing
i'll be the lily of the valley for you
empty
c e am
do you think i'd ever let you
with his red still wet she said
and when it's all over you'll roll over
with his red still wet she said
it must have been rudi's child
eye for an eye
i must work on my mind for now i realise
i love the whirling of the dervishes
rolling the ball rolling the ball
the crime begins
this shop's shut for business
act like actors
covered in rubble one of the rabble
ooh i remember
pray god you can cope
i should be crying but i just cant let it show
give me these moments back
of all the things we should've said
one more step to the top of the city
i dont know if you'll love me for it
i see your lights going on and off
one more step to the top of the city
for the coffee perculating
and they got two blue and whites
when there's crullers to be had
leaving little lines in the ice
something someone help them
get the bow going
into my fiddlestick
get the bow going
a good morning ma'am your early morning call
little light

spiritus sanctus in nomineinaudible

forever blowing bubbles all the way
he was a diver like you and me
zandro's baby boy felt the scorpions sting
when he held it to the light the great pearl did shine
when he held it to the light the great pearl did shine
zandro found a cave for his family to hide
sealed his child's fate
you're making rain
you're here in my head
to be a threat to the men in power
ooh i just know that something good is going to happen
offer me a chocolate
and you wont get me with your aresenic in the pot of tea
but keep your recipes
on the rocks
and the darkness of your faith
you were never that around
to calm me down
i'm better off by the way

when you beg you just complain
somewhere sometime

on the unconditional chance
we take all the telescopes
we've never seen anything like it before

just being alive it can really hurt
it is the constellation of the heart

no more sad songs for long girl you daddy's home
first nobody stressing you
watching you move in your baka suit
plus you bringing out the freakinus
i'll be your player
it's my treat
girl you taste just like spam
remember genie from the casino
it's not there in the buckskin baby
'til they get out of hand and wish they were dead
what can i say
i did it all confused
hello old lady
no no no no no
it doesnt belong to you
to my part of your life
i put this
holding all the love that waits for you here
and all that's to come runs in
but we know the lady who rents the room
they never go for walks
at night
wont you let me laugh
watching every night
there's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball
over the moon over the moon
on a diamond flight
my eyes were shining
lamour looks something like you
were you only passing through
you be the angel
i'm not the same
the living
the land of reprisal
do you wanna dance johnny rivers
baby do you wanna dance
yes do you wanna dance i mean under the moonlight
do you wanna dance under the moonlight
wide eyes would clean and dust
leave it open
i leave it open
harm is in us
harm is in us
we let the weirdness in
lose the time to come
breaking the waves
if heaven is on the way
baby baby baby i want to french fry your potato
dont go so soon
i'll give you fresh fruit salad
soon it may come
got six but pray for seven
the future lies
the future lies
we move like satellites
she's coming over me
i employ spies
speed ills coming down the mountain
destroy the world that we took so long to make
what happened to you
it's all in the way we know that we could have it all
building a system of alleys and motorways
there's nothing like losing you
war on all sides war on all sides
it's all in the face of what we thought
to break mc's in half there rhymes be like illusion
i hear wack rumors but yo it's hard to cool wild child down
i dont have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up
it's not my fault when i come with hip hop from my heart
ask yourself when you weededed
yes yes i'm overnight uh huh
and i have the illest case of munchies so please keep right
ask yourself one time when you weededed
and a word that wont go away
om mani padme
we raise our hats to the strange phenomena
om mani padme hum
breathing out your toxic levels
been playing tricks you know
lung so rope is hanging
been playing tricks you know
just a little more sound
out for dinner on that fateful night
bridge so i still drive a yugo
that we're doing it
we cant have it all
but as it gets clearer
always something to distract
am i suspended in gaffa
she dont stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
not until i'm ready for you
and we can build a dream together
swallowed followed
hey you said that you would love to die
sharp about everyone
and i'm a simple selfish son
you blew me away
i wanna feel right through you
this cripple's with you
if i make it through
go blowing my mind on god
i associate love with red
i see myself suddenly
break please yourself to make it rate live it all at your own cost so many just got lost leaning for fire leaning to fire
i could climb any fountain
i'm real full of it
i shave with gillette
i'm looking at the big sky now
we're looking at the big sky
and we pause for the jets
i want you to remember
lying in this bed
then lying in this bed
never meant you wrong
the chemicals between us
site back unwind and relax
mistrusted disrupted
all the fishermen and their families
all sickly crumbling cerebellum
it's bleeding there's no proof
happy birthday here's your nerve gas
all the fisherman and their families
your bile lands right on my head
it's all over for the urang a tang
coming in with the golden light
empty
empty
and push them from the pull of the bush
we bring in the rigging
empty
empty
la la oo ooh
bang goes another kanga
push 'em from the
just like a station on the radio
this love of yours was big enough to be frightened of
big enough to let go of me
but things are not right
knock knock who's there in this baby
ooh how he frightens me
all my barriers are going
i'm giving it all in a moment for you
didnt we cry at that old mythology he'd read
your sister i was born
in the night of satin and lace we were suddenly woken
till the end of my life tell me what can i do
take a piece of my heart a little piece of my soul
i hear him before i go to sleep
ooh he's here again
and here i am again my girl
begin to breathe
i love you better now
speed kills coming down the street
we expect her gone for some time
destroy the world that we took so long to make
got to feel woke up inside again
another refugee outsider refugee
to find yourself in a foreign land
abraham abraham
nobody knows who you are
she's gonna hand you a red headed gabriel
but watch out
there are pies on a carousel
and when she's done that
i'll never forget
watching the sun set
that's right
i kicked a girl a bitch a brat named yolanda fagin
broke in the trailer 'cause someone said so
door to door halloween they caught you
empty
oh what a day oh what a day
release me
right on
she cant stay clean
stay high stay high
blacked out there goes another morning i slipped on the bathroom floor
and every day
got a bum leg
wanna know why

i'd have the music high going 95
breathing all this in
just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load
we are building a religion
his cigarette is burning
now today is tomorrow
he is calling you dude
we are making a brand

we're behind you
we are now accepting callers
you'll be commissioning a symphony in c

cool blue reason i'm just talking to myself
i only came undone
daria daria daria
and you told me to get out

like testicles from rear view mirrors

the one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show
but rock on completely with some brand new components
yeah excess aint rebellion
now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs

but rock on completely with some brand new components
yeah excess aint rebellion
cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low
i know i know ruby sees all
i'd like to get even
i'm writing a song all about you
it's a good thing that i'm not a star
i've got wheels
and a heart that can bring you
satan is the only one
i've got a mind that can steer me
satan is my motor motor
hear my motor power
out there you dont hear the echoes and calls
say it all
i'm so tense

the man on the street might just as well
when the grave digger puts on the foreceps
sheep go to heaven
the grave digger puts on the foreceps
sheep go to heaven
she'll come back to me
somehow i know it wont last too long
there'll be baskets on the floor
she'll hang the baskets on the wall
she's touring the facility
and sharp as a tack
she's changing her name from kitty to karen

i had a match
oh baby i was bound

i wont step back while you make up your mind
in new york city
we were so happy
we didnt know if we would live or die
those people didnt even know us
i've lost my heart again
like testicles from rear view mirrors
makeup counter non stick pads
paper shredders dog toys clogs
cardboard boxes fancy plates
this display is not for sale
get your cars out of the driveway
where are you mr fireman
bring your goddamn truck and some water
cross my heart and hope to die
just dropping like stones
that makes their falling and their flight
mr mastodon farm
i wont see their last second curves
my life will fall
cuts swatches out of all material
you dont owe me a thing
i'll take you to the next state fair
my guy
i dont have to look no more
gonna do all the things you want me to
i dont have to look no more
gonna do all the things you want me to
i need to feel your touch
strong resistance
a candle's fickle flame
empty
you're never there
jerking like a nervous bird
but god it's such a crime
i've been on fire
no phone no phone i just want to be alone today
shut the f up
will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels

heads of state who ride and wrangle
learn to buck up
who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels
now clever feet that flicker like fire
it takes you it shakes you
but you dont know which page to turn to do you
you are believing your own stories
but you dont know which page to turn to do you
and every single morning
i've sung for kings in europe
i am an opera singer
at first they resisted but then they began to sway
how can you say forever is at your command
they took it in the first place
well i have passed the test just like all the rest
you only answer
perhaps perhaps perhaps
perhaps perhaps perhaps
if you cant make your mind up
we'll never get started
she cant see in the moonlight
not now mother
do you wanna go to mars wanna go to the moon
who's my mama now i said whoooo

and we all fall
heads of state who ride and wrangle
learn to buck up

a faintly glimmering radio station
he says that he'll be rich some day
flying flying 'round the room
swiftly softly floating down
i'll be remembered
friend is a four letter word
i'm really only praying
i'd kiss a pirate if he'd cry
i'll leave a light on when it's time
bring some fruitcake bring some fruitcake

empty
empty
window of your
empty
or would i smile
like the only
start to regret it
but i'm finally cutting through this haze
all though you pretend
i'm finally cutting through this haze of love
and i'm not fit to touch
i am intrinsically no good
and i'm not fit to touch

homewrecking girl

homewrecking girl
gasping for air picking at small blisters on my fingertips
place your hands on me you look sweet fifteen
let's go to foodtown

oh whoa oh
so swell so swell
keep the maggots underground
in spite of what i do
and sirens on the way
better come with an army

reluctantly crouched at the starting line
the arena is empty except for one man
because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
you know baby it's the guitar man
you know baby it's the guitar man
something keeps him moving
i play nice
i'm so mad so sad is it so bad to be adopted
well there is no such thing as you
some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
my man
up so close i never get to see the view
up so close i never get to see your face
so you know you'll always be waiting
you can do it all the time
walk on by
and the room where
i'll keep on walking
empty
wow must be so nice
in a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
is a japanese man in a business suit singing 'smoke gets in your eyes'
spinning round
what do your fingers show
what do your fingers show
but hera usually punished her that zeus was one to take
where do your fingers go
you were to be the only one
there's only room for you
but it's not that i dont love you
in your world of two
you've got your grand piano
but dont forget the ones who foot the bill
you shake my hand
you kick the sand
you think that i
but how can you say
is what you choose to do
black star five pointed coal
black star darken the skies
a dead sun for where the light never shines
organs savaged by rotten enzymes rennin and rancorous cysts
solo parasitic flesh resection
dormant fungoid growths
leathery skin bubbles as blue bottles hatch
lovingly wound and fretted upon my bow
my inspirationyour disintegration
will be your afterlife's handicap
ringing out as you flake
and death is no escape
razor wire the strung umbilical cord
this dereliction grows
playing rough after all it's only a game
scattered and scrambled your teasement grows
a sequacious pattern which once fitted so snug
a pathological toy each chunk rigorously
wart encrusted sebaceous growth
renal ulcerations faecal gurgitations
cynical and sarcastic my fetid sense of tumour
avulsion of salted tonsils
cross my heart come cross the line
come cross my heart void and null
cross my heart and hope to die
i promise to tell the truth
fact and fantasy united as one
lies you believe them all
of copious womb lining torn
nurtured in post partum gore
fragile limbs puverized
this ceasating premature baby
is dissected lacerated and shred
slicing back flesh i tear subject to malacia
foul autodigestion necrotic mutation
disintegrating with histolycis and everyday wear and tear
foul autodigestion necrotic mutation
with bicarbonates and boiling soap
your innards i corrode
sadistically sodomizing with my instruments of grime
orifices pumped and plugged
this process you will loathe
as i desecrate graveolent crypts
my forensic inquisition is fulfilled
rotten remains i eat
shrivelled innards i lick
slavering worms decomposure burns
purulent meat
firmhand unnatural selection is applied
hate is the law love under will
with the might of their firmhand
no individuality uniformed
another useless
empty
another generation to scorn
still no choice for a new generation
and since i was born in original sin
your paradise doesnt sound too fetching
so when my body goes cold
i've sold my soul
spewing blood as the gallbladder extrudes
with alcoholic contents in your urinary tract
in a stupor you die your brain lobes you fry
a truculent shambles so severe
the exsanguine esprit snorted as snuff
skeletal groats triturated desinently
mucilage vapours toxic fumes to savour
lead viscous residue snorting by m amott
in the hallowed turf you lie just for the taking
extinguishing all hope of beatrific dispatch
seedling my rich harvest bring out your deadfor the soils to devour
harvesting the defouled to fertilise my soil
music walker
economic salvation in sweatshops returned from the east
empty
keep on rotting keep on hoping keep on dreaming
peculated in an ebriatng narcocis
music steer
the newly fully developed boiled as sprouted fodder
to fill the lower species' plate
they will bleed
lyrics walker
dont want your respect
your beliefs polarized
dont want your faith
polarized tell me what colours do you wear
you're infernally rotten to the gore
stinks like hot putrid vomit
and maturing damp fumes
a rotten gaseous expiration
deteriorated bloated corpse decomposure burning hot
as the cadaver is slowly wasting
get high on the rot
the same old lies
if you just do as you're told
no hope no choice
doing fine
believe the lie
lyrics walker
the doom watch ticks
in my own private year zero
in my room one zero one
the future is ours
miasmic fungus infests the small intestine
globular tissue decomposed hydrogen sulphide is evolved
visceral organs infested py rampant hungry larvae
with infestation of grubs
lumpen meat is hacked
dismember carve and hack
chunks amongst your thighs and rump crawling with tape worm
cranial fluids sucked
chapped commodones perspiring zits
hackne vulgaris spluttering pus
bubbling seething disgusting mess
in which all life is now appraised
draws out a morbid nous to bleed
on a coffin which is joined
always spelt out well
the roulade now pandemonium
epigraphic text a literary vex
whilst fresh still are the wreaths
exculpitation perverse artworks so unique
your ideology self delusion
you're waiting for tomorrow well tomorrow never comes
skillfully lathed for us to maim
chisels rods sharps and catheters
that love still exists
the loneliness of each day
that runs around us
saber quin tendr la culpa
ms all de la locura
entonces no me quedan dudas
para amarte a cada momento
when you fall asleep next to me
guide her with your grace
give her faith so she'll be safe
through the darkness and good times
let it fill my soul and drown my fears
i cant believe
ohhh a light
i was waiting for so long
oh it's almost blinding me
empty
it's waiting pleasantly four steps away from here
in a corner of carolina
four steps away from here
in a corner of carolina
captain kidd who's smiling
est sur son ile au tresor
tu seras un chef indien
run under the sun my child
then i hope you'll understand
my heart with a melody
and all of the songs left unsung
and makes me believe
to all that you are
come and behold him
glory in the highest
o come let us adore him
when i dial the telephone
all by myself
making love was just for fun
by myself by myself
it's no good unless he loves you all the way
and for all the in between years come what way
oh i hope that it wont end though
you dont know how long i have waited
how do i get you alone
contigo me escape del mundo a otra dimension
and in my heart the love for you awaken
i'm joining you to discover what it is
amantes que el destino sedujo sin control
cent lheure
ce jour l
rushing like an arrow
amoureuse sur un ruban d'argent
and the radio and the radio
woman in love woman in love
who was calling me
amoureuse amoureuse
things we said right from the start
without announcing how much you love me
there's still no one saying goodbye
starting on my own
i dont know when
love is on the way
on wings of angels
but that wont get you in this heart of mine
and show me something from the heart
if you want me to believe
prove it to me all night
mais les chagrins sont des millions
the children who are on the edge of the night
empty
qui rveillait en caressant
would be able to revive a child
you are not alone if we hear my voice
empty
but you could be the one to change my point of view
i wanna find a place where dreams can happen
i'll give you love without the pain
i aint the kind to be untrue
make you happy happy
gonna make you happy make you happy now
so what ya gonna do
quand j'tais prs de toi ma mre oh ma mre
le chat et les chiens sont trs vieux
forever from now on
if you wanna know how to get to me
follow the map to my heart
there's no book i've read that says what i'm saying
ce netait qu'un reve
as soon as the sun goes up
he likes to talk to me about the things he saw
je reve de ses bras oui mais je ne sais pas comment laimer
d'amour ou d'amitie
i tell you
i dont know where
with which the sea crushes the rocks
i'm done dreaming at least for today
pour m'ancrer a ton port
au dela de la violence
lamour existe encore
qu'il ne m'aimera jamais
je m'suis jetee sur lui dans la rue
j'etais seule et j'avais besoin
we laughed and we cried
we could say he's living in another galaxy
yes i know he likes boys
i'm crazy about him
on passe incognito
we are quiet on the day
demain il s'ra trop tard
tomorrow it will be too late
on na pas ltemps d'attendre d'avoir trente ans
all we want is to be happy
we sleep ones against the others
on se dtruit on se dsire
we're always alone in the world
m'tendre sur lasphalte
empty
that turn the wrong way
venez plutt m'abattre
i've got the whole world in my hand
tonight we dance
la ville a tendu ses ailes
on danse naziland
ending where you start
ride the waves
everything you find
everything you find
the world is wide
i will always defend never pretend
every step i take for you
and i confess it's true
you're my angel from above
well there is nothing you could ever do
oh i learned early
one more lover that used to be
your love did me wrong
devait arriver moi aussi
cueillir d'autres fleurs
et je voudrais que le calme
my boyfriend left me
my boyfriend left me
so me i look at the waves
mon ami m'a quitte
ca devait arriver a moi aussi
a cueillir d'autres fleurs
et je voudrais que le calme
my boyfriend left me
my boyfriend left me
so me i look at the waves
mon ami m'a quittee
il aime le chant des colombes et lodeur du cafe
ces milliers de lumieres
c'est mon homme je ladmire
i was running i was running
i was running i was running
tu es l tu es l
dans une ville trange et vide
c'est mon rve de toujours
you are there you are there
c'est le rve que je fais
you are there you are there
life can be so cruel
rise in his eyes
you'll have what's mean to be
it's a steady flame that grows
je t'aimerai toujours
mes bras sont bien trop courts
my life is made of your eyes on me
my tenderness spring
but never totally
tu es ce que je crois
so much love i have for you
pray and pray
ten days have come and gone
and if you're goin my way
but all i've got to do is
and pray
un tien de parfum de lalcool ou du blues
empty
car ce soir j'ai touche
de nos corps en drapeaux qui claquent et qui s'aiment
empty
forgotten the sea of taboo dreams
has carved on my back
empty
empty
wild land promised land
birds remember
and your key wont fit the door
to all the people that you meet
that's just the woman in me baby
it's an uphill climb and i'm feeling sorry
i dont know what to say no
when life is empty with no tomorrow
when you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
jack frost nipping at your nose
and goodies on his sleigh
to kids from one to ninety two
i'll sketch your lips in shaded tones
swearing that we'll never part
i'll use a brush so light and fine
devoted love until we die
that was there at my command
to the night and the empty skies
that was there at my command
to the night and the empty skies
is the light in your eyes
i'm here for you now
for as long as i live
putting visions in my head
like you're never gonna let me go
till i hear it from you
like you're never gonna let me go dont let me go
we're counting the days
christmas time is here our waiting is done
oh and god bless us everyone
the happy the sad
that's on its way
people smile as they are passing
the happy the sad
the good and the bad
and feel each move you make
much to take
sometimes i am frightened
the one who could give you love
i know i'd only make you cry
oh i could say that i'll be all you need
baby it tears me up inside
but baby that's not me
i dont really wanna go
i love you goodbye
i must be crazy now
'cause by now i know that you'd feel the way that i do
just like a thousand times before
and maybe i maybe you maybe you maybe you
oh i love you
shining bright
we tought love would never die
still i go back for one last look
i'm in love with you
i know i cant survive
to feel the chance to live again
i'll swallow my pride and i'll be alive
i'll hold you in my arms and never let go
i want to be the face you see when you close your eyes
in your every dream
empty
and everything between
i would try to shield your innocence from time
in a time and place where you dont want to be
and help my baby through the hungry years
drifting far away
would be the ones i'd hold so close
simple pleasures
take a step back
these are the things that i would do
you play the innocent but i've watched you steal
make me believe
and i must confess i was quite impressed
it makes no sense to carry on like this
put a little heart in your intention
crowded by the past
is nothing but these chains
missing by a mile
your heart would come undone
other the love we've known
you can say it's all right but i know that you're breaking up inside
when your heart's crying out baby whisper my name
i will lay down my life if that's what you need
every day
but now he says he knew about it from the start
sometimes we dont have a choice when we play and break the rules
i never wanted it to be like this
if there was any other way love
chasing rainbows
they would see
making love
the secret is safe between me and you
if they could only see you and me baby
i know if we try our love could be stronger
if i still want you
i said i'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin
somehow ever since i've been around you
ask me to and i'll do anything for you baby for you baby
empty
approche un peu plus pres que tu m'apprennes toi sans jamais oublier
empty
j'ai si souvent prie ou tu voudras ou tu pourras ou tu iras j'irai
et dans mes reves
apprends moi tes desirs apprends moi
call the man
your sweet love filled this empty room
call the man
now the future isnt clear
attention mon coeur
i dont play
but for you it's a night
you dont know love
the most important thing
empty
oui c'est
empty
from where i am i see angels and turtledoves
en amour
like we go from country to country
de celui partage avec moi sa route et ses chansons
comme on va de pays en pays
like we say at home
a huge heart all around us
on a plein de forts de jardins devant nous
empty
a love so complete
empty
goodbye's the last time i will hold you near
i'll be there your whole life through
it'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
i'm wide eyed and innocent
and i know what love is
i will fall
there are no words that can go that deep
and i know what love is
crowded by the past
is nothing but these chains
missing by a mile
your heart would come undone
other the love we've known
que dans son sang lorient coule aussi
qu'il est beau que je laime qu'il est ma vie ma joie
qu'il goute a tout mais sans jamais dependre
qu'il ny a pas d'amour sans histoire
que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
jesus marie and our father
et prier cet homme sur la croix
and when come to her those ideas
even kneeled even in prayer
there are lips who whisper
and praying that man on the cross
tellement de sorciers lensorcellent
even tough she ties her hair
la religieuse a quelques fois
les enfants oublis tranent dans les rues
dans leur pull over de laine mite
des objets drobs aux bazars
they have to love each other of a naive love
they are cold they are hungry they are almost naked
so they wait
when love is all we need
you're on your own
when love is all we need
as long as it's not about them
le vent la mer et les orages
rencontrer la chose magique
et je vois briller le monde
today more than ever
some shadows afraid me
et ma vie change avec toi
au gout des plus mauvais jours
and i see shinning the world
on pousse un peu tout juste
and touch them with the finger
on attrape des airs et des poses de combat
qui s'entete et qui repete
we know he is there
une arrogance un trait
we never forget
all those thousands dreams
costumes from others and that's it
forgetting the cold
une toute petite fille
se taire un peu mmm pourquoi pas
all i believe in
the life always all it's wonders
and the sun and its shines
j'y mets tout ce que j'espre
and you the sky dont forget me
i pray the eyes the eyes broken
and you the sky hear my voice
mais toi le ciel entends ma voix
connat le vent
seul un oiseau blanc
speak to me about my soul
the craziest of my toughts
seul un oiseau blanc

never knowing if there's solid ground below
never knowing if there's solid ground below

there's so much strength in all of us
feel the flame forever burn
to reach for your own star
mes heures les plus belles
like we see the sun
too tender also
and i pay today
so old at seventeen
living like before forgetting you
triste si triste

vole vole mon amour
because nothing eases your pain
fly fly little flame

on s'est aim cause cause cause cause
malgr beaucoup de choses
tout pour un regard ou deux

sans hsiter sans savoir
champagne en trop

on se dit que cette fois ci
a life without a story

we pass through a mirror
we pass through a mirror
one dream keeps you wondering

one dream keeps u wondering
i'm looking back through the years
livin without you i only fall behind
'cause i need you right here
but i'm gonna run back i'm gonna run back
and we know we'll see each other again
the stage is a world of lights
du rose pour les tendres
arc en ciel comme la pluie
rainbow for kids
qui me font chanter le coeur
somewhere over the rainbow way up high
if happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow why oh why cant i
around seven and a half o'clock
ma malette
reproduce my silhouette
give me
a kid playing
another large black coffee
i lay down
donnez moi de loxygne
avec une pile la place du coeur
all the week
du building
i turn on my air conditioner
as every morning
je me maquille
compulsory accessories
the elevator
un enfant qui joue
while falling on the ground smothered by the air
i only eat
et j'expire
give me some oxygen
we bring to the emergency
me panique
always has the same smell
give me
to days shorter
quand mes yeux s'eclairent
when my eyes light up
prisonner of the wires of your secrets
de vous si doux
how much i love you
pour s'ouvrir
aux ailes de verre
for just a little light
ne s'efface jamais
dans le soleil
everywhere i see you
que je vis et que j'existe
that i'm not afraid
in the sunshine
que tu te perdes loin de moi
for some unknown person
je te vois
je ne vis pas
i see you everywhere
de paradis
from paradise
from that forgotten book
devant la vie
facing the life
virginie jolie
c'est la belle nuit de nol
before closing their eyelids
c'est un peu cause de moi
all the toys that i see in dreams
et tu vas pouvoir commencer
petit papa nol quand tu descendras du ciel
et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
i didnt well behaved all days
elle etait nee dans la rue
si piaf vivait aujourd'hui
piaf chanterait du rock
piaf would sing rock
and when she was in love with a man
if piaf would live today
de la musique rock
que les choses ont change que les fleurs ont fane
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu lemportes ailleurs
on me dit qu'aujourd'hui on me dit que les autres font ainsi
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu lemportes ailleurs
les formules magiques des marabouts d'afrique
plus brillante plus belle pour une autre etincelle
et je veux chanter pour vous
tous mes manges
will take me in its dance
les les o' les bateaux sont fous
je veux qu'on m'apprenne
and i want to be loved
since the world has lost her way
empty
where one love lives eternally
let the children bring the light
empty
je ne sais pas ce qu'elles veulent ni les phrases qu'il dit
mme s'il ne veut pas de ma vie
he seems to hesitate between a love story or a friendship story
and i hadnt learn to live without him
il a lair d'hsiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amiti
du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets
i dont know what they want nor the sentences he says
even if he doesnt want my life
rien qu'a sourire a lattendre a vouloir le gagner
meme s'il ne veut pas de ma vie
he seems to hesitate between a love story or a friendship story
des rves
some dreams
d'un magicien
d'un magicien
in the hand
and a child from hong kong
empty
des trfles et des oiseaux
and some bling and blangs
some chariots
adieu tendres annees salut champs de bataille
le monde est a ta porte et se joue des verrous
when the nights will be longer longer than my nights
that was the good story but not the good tempo
j'pourrais lattendre ici rien ne s'oublie tout est gris
rendez vous quand j'aurai devore mes appetits
rendez vous quelque part entre ailleurs et linfini
une autre chance une seconde et tant pis pour celle ci
to the pleasure to later and later is so cute
so listen up it's you i trust
and the rest of your life will be just like this
declaration of love heh
i feel magic every time that we touch baby baby
i swear to you baby
i'm like a shadow
comme un train dans une gare
from the secret i keep in spite of myself
so i could love in broad daylight
when chained to you
qui vit dans lombre
it's only in the darkness that i am afraid
des milliers de cris de souffles a nos bouches echappes
toutes les scenes perdues que lon ne jouait pas
come'on baby fais moi une chanson
j'suis bookee a la television
j'leur ai promis un numero un
ecris moi des mots qui donnent
write me words that sound
j'peux venir te tenir la main
tu peux parler de tout de rien
faut que j'monte au moins jusqu'au top ten
ecris moi des mots qui donnent
write me words that sound
ecris moi des lignes
et qui balancent
ecris moi des mots qui dansent
write me words that give
ecris moi des mots qui sonnent
ecris moi des mots qui sonnent
no cathedral where to hide my prayers
tel est mon destin
terres geles aux plus arides dserts
i live from notes and i live from light
that's how pass my hours
je prends le blues aux signaux des rpondeurs
ainsi passent mes heures
my love's not something you can buy and sell
good intentions i know you had right from the start
chaque fois que tu disparais
without knowing why
ou bien si je cherche le croire
or if i'm trying to believe it
you who can read me
or if i'm trying to believe it
chaque fois que tu disparais
dont even wait a little while
find your way
so dont hold back
but love lives on
dont save it all for christmas day
but i cant get through the night
empty
and it may be true
you're the one that i live for
i cant live without your love
you're the one that i live for
du soleil au coeur
sunshine in my heart
du soleil au coeur
sunshine in my heart
one more moment
quand mon coeur
when my heart
hair in the wind
had the lines
dans un ciel
of lace
les prludes
the preludes
spoke with her
il ny a qu'elle
and it's her
empty
et tu me regardes
et j'ai peur de t'aimer
i am here
and if i shout out my joy
plus rien ne peut nous arrter
and you're caressing me
i want to cry
je connais bien ce regard
souffler comme le vent
dans les eaux pronfondes quelque part
sur ton beau visage
je le vois bien caressant mes cheveux
un amour pour moi
je me retrouve au tournant de son coeur
un amour pour moi
il crit son histoire au tournant de mon coeur
un amour pour moi
de lui
and it leaves singing
de lor sous les paupires
seeing us cry
c'est le dernier pote
qu'il ny a plus de fe
if clouds have wings
et nous voil passant
and we become patience
i'm crazy about him
que j'avais envie de lui
il m'a dit viens prendre un cafe
c'est mon seul ami
dans des endroits tres tres gais
trying to forget him but
but i love him it's not my fault
ziggy his name is ziggy
j'lui ai seulement dit
de parler quelqu'un
ziggy il s'appelle ziggy
tous les soirs il m'emmne danser
i should reason myself
he's a boy like no others
around the world it carries its message
a dove went for a trip
elle croit
a country for hope
of peace of love to share
the peace the love and the friendship
around the world it carries its message
we've come so far no one else could ever
never too shy playin ever so wild
steal away what we confide
sometimes we have to stop
l o pleurent encore
i say you'll be fine
then tell me what was
but something is gone from my
you say it's never easy
and you're why i know there's a reason
if you want your life to be more beautiful
suis le suis le suis le suis le bien
o' lamour s'en va
sing it every time you sing
follow it follow it follow it follow it well
where love goes
la nuit a ete longue
oh mes amis mes freres
dans cette le o' tu as vu le jour
in this island where you were born
comme en ce temps l ce garon l te regardait
dans leau claire o' paul cherchait tes yeux
in the clear water paul was looking for your eyes
mais vos noms ne laisseront dans ma mmoire
lui aussi
qui me mne nimporte quoi
pile ou face le sud ou le nord
i feel free
empty
i'll live out of my own energy
come we'll sing in family
i have my passport color of life
pour le bonheur de donner
des cadeaux plein les mains
everything you have
that's where is the treasure
vivre et donner
talking praying
c'est pour approcher mes rves d'enfant
je voulais une chemine pour nous rchauffer
je ne suis pas celle que tu vois
c'est dj novembre sans toi
no i dont want it
it's already november
non je ne le veux pas
when i am far from your arms
non je ne le veux pas
when i am far from your arms
mmmm je ne veux pas
no i dont want it
traverser des mers je saurais faire
to punch nails that i learned
j'en sais la violence son got de sang
we're not tenders by here
mais qui commande nos amours
i dont know
but where are you
so far with no address
les eaux des torrents sont violence
at home wolfes are at our doors
i live where your eyes shine where your blood flows
le feu du soleil au visage
and captivating deserts
j'irai o' tu iras mon pays sera toi
tes nord et puis tes sud et tes zestes d'ouest
chez moi les loups sont nos portes
we hear cries from new york
j'irai o' tu iras mon pays sera toi
chez moi les loups sont a nos portes
we hear cries from new york
j'irai ou tu iras mon pays sera toi
je veux des chameaux des mirages
va pour tes cocotiers tes rivages
qu'importe lendroit
your words your swearwords and your tongue from here
on entend les cris de new york
qu'importe j'irai ou bon te semble
qu'importe lendroit
stand stand
et je brule et tu bruleras
with me with me
je souleve des volcans
it's vigor or life the time of anxiety lit it is the sap the time of torture
et je brule et tu bruleras
with me with me
je souleve des volcans
it's vigor or life the time of anxiety lit it is the sap the time of torture
or someone else i dont know anymore
it rises
i'm on fire lit i raise volcanos
empty
suddenly i knew that i was loving you
jours de feu
days of fever
and i have fever fever fever in my blood
it's the world at more than 100 degrees
jours de feu
days of fever
and i have fever fever fever in my blood
jours de feu
in our frenzied dreams dreams
and i have fever fever fever in my blood
and now i know
no i'm only getting stronger by the hour
a little bit of love can do it
empty
and no one else has loved me more
just say goodbye
but there's nothing left to say
i mustnt fall apart
va petit
go my dear
tous les mystres
mais pourtant
it's by navigating
go child
en ouvrant les yeux
les enfants
but however
go my dear
j'avoue que certains soirs quand la foule applaudit
j'avoue que certains soirs quand je suis sur la scne
ce vieux piano a bon dos
ou bien je gare
that i put
it cries or it laughes
it mixes up everything
me fera faire
ne se joue qu' quatre mains
sinon ce piano l
it makes tremolos
this music i create
juste une prire avant d'obir
graved well better than with a sword
que sera demain nos destins plus loin
long the waiting of the hour
juste une priere avant d'obeir
graved well better than with a sword
que sera demain nos destins plus loin
long the waiting of the hour
les mains serrees ca c'est facile
tout ce que je crois
quand j'me reveille je loue le jour
et le soleil et ses eclats
c'est ma priere paienne
je prie la terre de toute ma voix
je prie lamour et nos cerveaux
et toi le ciel entend ma voix
and all the men of light
quand on na que lamour
pour qu'clatent de joie
when you only have love
and cover with sun
quand on na que lamour
pour les mots de la terre
when we only have love
and force the destiny
alors sans avoir rien
dont look for you part of heaven
it's not a
your friend superman will lead you by the hand
it's not a
in a gold and red sky
capitaine kidd qui sourit
cours au soleil mon petit
tu seras un chef indien
the universe at my feet
quelqu'un a qui donner
a qui j'pourrais au moins telephoner
stretched towards me
quelqu'un a qui donner
a qui j'pourrais au moins telephoner
not easy
i was
avec qui tout partager
someone to talk to
the look remains the same
you see what i want
'cause there's one thing for sure
it had to be you
like rain tax
weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
i need more than just tokens of affection
real emotion real emotion
'coz i need some
just need something from the heart whoa
off the shoulder cut into the hip
you could make a mark
i wont be there
j'ai mal la tte j'ai mal au coeur
et toi qu'est ce que tu fous l
fais moi redescendre loin de tout loin de tout
it's the mirror where i exist without them
if you dont take care with the time
qui sont les bons et les mchants
fais marcher ta sirene d'amour
oh retiens moi
quand j'aurai lair d'une proie facile
de tes mains
comme au lit des rivieres
aux douces magies de la peau
tant que ta voix suit la mienne
tant que ta voix suit la mienne
i let fear control me
that you were right in front of me
pretty soon you will see
there's safety in your arms
we were looking for it somehow
surrounding us everywhere
cause you're the fire you're the one
cause you're the fire you're the one
if you dont know you're right next to the right one
and it gets deeper let me say
no i'll never let you down
and i love you baby like a school boy loves his pet
dans les champs tout repose en paix
nuit d'espoir sainte nuit
let's celebrate his praises
in the fields everything rests in peace
seduces me
here and now is all that matters
i thank god i've ever known you
far across the distance
and never let go till we're one
you're here there's nothing i fear
you have come to show you go on
one true time i hold to
we'll stay forever this way
did you know that i would see you through
did you know that i would see you through
did you notice all my mistakes
my precious one my darling one dont let your lashes weep
there's nothing that i could hide
my heart's overtaken
caught up in these stolen moments
feels like i'm falling
a little shy and sad of eye
is just to love and be loved in return
ecoute c'est important
tu veux toujours tout partager
il faut grandir devenir sage ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
on dirait presque
like he treats all the others
ne me plaignez pas
and when it goes wrong
et pour ma fte
i have your gifts
yes dont pity me
empty
non ne me plaignez pas
empty
with a heart bigger than earth
that lead someday to suns to planets of love
new musics
you who fly to other lives let me live
you who are looking for another life
he'll say you carry on a new day will come
oh yeah
yes we will
for a miracle to come
i cant believe
hush love
let it fill my soul and drown my fears
i've been touched by an angel with love
leavin on the next plane out
runnin down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me
here beside me again
here beside me again
leavin on the next plane out
but baby there would be
each day would go on just the same
that world would still be spinnin 'round
la table est dj garnie
oh quand j'entend chanter nol
je revois tes yeux clairs maman
oh when i hear ringing at sky
oh baby since you left me
and all those nights we shared together baby
oh baby you might think my world's been torn apart oh but you'll see that
o holy night the stars are brightly shining
o night divine
o night o night divine
when you look at me
i couldnt get much higher
when you reach for me
when you reach for me
i get wings to fly
i'm lost in everything you do
i want your love
looking in your eyes
and then you will see the morning will come
it makes no difference who you are
how can i make you see
and when it's time to face the storm
i am your angel
and when all hope is gone i'm here
les feux de joie et la souffrance
j'ai vu les anges et les dmons
mais ce qui m'tonne tu sais
j'ai vu le froid j'ai vu la transe
comme la douceur de tes baisers
symbol of my faith in who i am
fulfill your destiny
i'm sorry i dont have a role for love to play
we dont say goodbye
dont give me that same old speech
just how simple
but that aint good enough
like everything it gets carried away
everything we're longing for
breath it in let it out
it could sure make a difference in some small
empty
empty
m'en aller dans un pays
loin du monde o' j'etais ta possession
je m'en irai incognito
empty
je nen saurai pas un mot
i'm heading for the ends of the earth lit the end of the world
far from us
i'll go incognito
empty
empty
empty
j't'y perds
right outside the window
i just have to admit
but then they'd always seemed right
it was dead long ago
and so much deeper
but it's all coming back to me
there were nights of endless pleasure
all coming back to me
and when i see you like that
it's all coming back to me now
j'ai besoin d'un homme
j'ai besoin d'un homme
like i need water air and fire
comme j'ai besoin du soleil et d'la mer
j'ai pas besoin d'champagne et d'chocolat
mais chaque fois j'vas r'voler plus haut
spring summer fall and winter
i need
and i was listening the wind sing for ever
i was going serene and without knowing
i was waiting i was waiting
my dear compass my north
musics and words from france
lives of writting and voyages
the reason of these goodbyes
empty
quand les reves de nos enfants deviendront nos esperances
je te les dirai 100 000 fois et ca m'aide tant a vivre
when love will have other tastes than passion desire
empty
de ce dsir infme qui en moi se dchane
et je cherche lombre
je crains les rues le jour et les gens
soudain je sursaute en ne croisant qu'un miroir
i fear promises and pledges
suddenly i jump while meeting a simple mirror
i fear the world and its laws
je te crois moi
there are six billion humans on earth
quand la vie m'endort comme un somnifere
je de de de danse dans ma tete
even if i'm standing in the subway
there's really something to become insane
on nous epie on nous informatise
dehors les neons s'allument
laid naked on my bed
je de de de danse dans ma tete
and i've run circles around the sun
to make you love me
just to find the words
i try and i try and i try
well i hear the music
now i hear the music
what a feeling
beins believin take your passion make it happen
i see trees of green red roses too
i hear babies cry i watch them grow
and too many
and all that i so want to give you
when i need you
i hold out my hands and i touch love
i always wanted baby
they cant see that your my best friend
when the wrong one loves you right
your heart next to mine
without feeling it inside
where does my heart beat now
two hearts needing one another
and stronger
like a flower that dies from angry rain
to a rainbow which leads to where we are
a thousand dreams that we can still believe
wish i didnt know cause i cant let you go
why o why
tell me
when i still love you
my o my
i long 4 u 2 talk 2 me like u did
when u're not there at all
i had less courage it's true
with this tear
that u'd never leave
you seem to be in great shape tonight
you are really really lucky to have such place
mais je suis vraiment ravie d'etre ici ce soir a paris
this afternoon i was a bit scared
jjg good evening
s'il suffisait qu'on s'aime s'il suffisait d'aimer
jjg ok your turn
en tout cas pour nous ici sur scene
i'd like to return towards past
and those songs were written by
ma mere qui a ma mere qui a ecrit ma premiere chanson
end of medley
la plus belle langue pour dire des mots d'amours
high above the mountains far across the sea
higher than the clouds
gently turning round and round
and you will feel
cause you make me feel
cause if i make you happy
because you make me feel so alive
you make me feel
i've waited so long too long
so let your walls come down
like a fire burning bright
dont let it get you down
i will be your light
in the darkness of the night
light shining bright baby
just a flow a group without a face without a voice
zora smiles zora smiles zora smiles
to her bare face under the wind
sometimes a few insults she doesnt care
but she smiles for those those who are there
on s'est aim cause cause
on s'est aim cause cause
mais aujourd'hui tant de choses ont changes
nel cuore restera
when stars go out each night
lead us to a place guide us with your grace
la forza che ci da
is wish that
need to find a place guide us with your grace
it lifts my spirit up
cause your the one reason i go on
oo cant you hear me calling
i was wicked and wild baby you know what i mean
you are the reason the reason
you are the reason
you are the reason i wake up every day
and i always see
we have to go where it's going
in these moments moments of our lives
these are the sweetest times
times we'll remember
these are the special times
dont think i cant feel there's something wrong
before you roll those dice
baby this is serious
baby think twice
wont slip away from me
this time
i know that my eyes have seen too much
you can not have the best of me
but this time your lies
empty
you dress has to be finished
tire tire laiguille ma fille
le chat sur le tapis s'en donne coeur joie
qu'un mariage cote bien du mal
empty
your eyes get covered with a lacy curtain
sowing you path of joy
pull pull the needle my daughter
when she walks away
just believe in me
whatever it takes we'll find a way
moi tu me voyages dans la tte
when i think about it
you say hello the door opens
moi qui lve mes yeux vers toi
you you talk to the stars
tu es chez toi avant d'entrer
and i have for you whole pages
jusque dans mes rves
open me the road to you
ces mots que d'autres avaient crits
with all my voice with all my soul
i was imagining in my cocoon
mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid
les mots te brlent un par un comme s'ils
le blues qu'on nm'a jamais appris
ces mots que d'autres avaient ecrits
with all my voice with all my soul
i was imagining in my cocoon
mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid
les mots te brulent un par un comme s'ils
le blues qu'on nm'a jamais appris
lentement en douceur quelque part la bas
alors surtout ne change pas
alors surtout ne change pas
surtout ne change pasno
kiss and caressing her all night long
u'll make a good girl crazy
lady treat her like a lady
j'avais encore trs peur hier
i was still very young yesterday
ne t'en fais pas je viendrai
i go
twenty past three italy place
pas plus tard que la demie
of changing mind
i go
that talent for the music
when we sing well
que tant de gens perdus
quand on rend les gens heureux
quand on a chante bien
with a smile or two
out there the tempos appear
out there the infinite dances
the islands initiate into love here
le rire aux femmes aux filles aux eclats
le plaisir en ces brulants combats
in the dances and the childrens play
les feux d'en bas ce lascif etat
les iles initient a lamour ici
the fires from below this lascive state
i go where you go and even beyond
le soleil avait prepare ca
when i fall asleep against your body
qui me guette au bout de ma route
to love you at any price
love still exists
the world is leaded by insanes
everywhere around the world
love still exists
alors je nai plus de doute
and who'll live will see
love will take its time
i have so many things to see
courir aprs lt
love will come later
i have so many things to see
courir aprs lt
in the middle on a colourless hour
attention the ballet is about to begin
qu'importe les mots nont plus d'importance
you you make yourself velvet and your jewelry is shining on you
a look when she bends over and let show a breast
a little more alcohol and cuirasses to fall
j'ai du succes dans mes amours
from where i control my universe
i have my second home
au fond je nai qu'un seul regret
pour pouvoir crier qui je suis
to be able to create my life
pour pouvoir etre un anachiste
to be able to tell why i exist
toutes les bandes dessinees
pour son anniversaire
au cinquantieme etage du waldorf
they spent it looking
they have walked on broadway
pour pouvoir mieux rever
comme un oiseau qui plane
and when he saw
that we buried
and let myself die
qui tourne a lenvers
the world is stone
who build empires
in the middle of the night
j'voudrais seulement dormir
et que les rennes traversent la lande
rouge comme un lumignon
everyone was laughing a lot about it
come to the paradise tonight
suivre trs digne les routes clestes
rouge comme un lumignon
his sledge across the skies
as soon as will ring midnight
announcing santa claus
le temps qui compte est toujours compt
annes de trop qui m'ont vol
il nous martelle et presse le tempo
mme avec toi mme avec passion
i go around the world
i do a complete tour around
i go around the world
envolons nous sur une chanson
go around around the world
tous les avions nous appellent
on fait le tour des fleurs
all airplanes are calling us
la raison est un fil de soie
juste en fermant les yeux
on frolait locean
et j'ai suivi le vol d'un ange
who i saw laughing and crying at the same time
et moi j'ai compris la chance
my steps will take me back
there that i have been loved
en se levant chaque jour
a world where caresses smell good
empty
on entend on entend
the shepherds the shepherds
voyant la fin du jour
qui charment leurs amies
tra la la tra la la la la la
around the old fireplace
tra la la la la la la la la la la
quand marcher sans autre but
de ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer
in the other reality
plus assez neuf plus assez
nous serons princes d'ternit
i am calling you
i dont know what it is
let me tell you there's no better guy
i'm hooked on a feeling
and do the best you can
till you drop drop
and john lennon said
and i cant fight the feeling
et c'est bien en vain qu'on lappelle
nothing's doing it threats or prayers
si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime
but if i love you if i love you
tout autour de toi vite vite
il na jamais jamais connu de lois
if you dont love me i love you
le vent faisait chanter lt
des papillons couleurs pastel
ce ntait qu'un rve
a smile that i have kept
were wanting to touch the sky
it was only a dream
quelques fois je dis des mots bizarres
you dont understand a thing about it
tout ce que je fais aujourd'hui c'est pour toi
it's for you that i am here
your presence in me awakes the dormant water
it's for you that i am here
quelques fois je parle trop
des chansons chaque pas
c'est pour vivre
que des gens s'exilent
in all the four winds directions of the sky
et peupler la terre
that jerusalem was born
que des arbres tombent
as long as love is alive
chante encore
sur la musique
that puts our hearts in harmony
alors cette musique
you handed me that hand
this music
qui met nos coeurs en accord
un jour s'en va
et chante la pour moi
so this music
to much unreacheable ladders
le paradis qui dort
in the secrets of your soul
mme o' la raison dserte
le paradis qui dort
in the secrets of your soul
and the time people still go ahead
to spend this special time of year with someone who
we'll stay up late tonight
walkin with you in a winter's snow
i cant wait
kissin underneath the mistletoe
you're gonna have to do things you're own way
no matter where on earth you are
i've always known that you were born to fly
baby come to me
cheveux dans le vent
like romeo and juliette
of a thousand songs
c'tait hier
and it was before
like in the movies
les amants d'avant
comme on disait avant
much better each day
we will always love each other
pour seul horizon
when you leave
la vie manque la vie
et font du bruit
from living half a life
comm' si chaque fois c'etait fini
la vie manque la vie
te suit partout
the trip around the world
le roman de la rose
je ne comprendrais pas
plus fort qu'un moment de plaisir
i want to know how to love you
ce qu'il faut faire pour te garder
je veux savoir comment t'aimer
how to love you
me fait plus mal
c'est contre nature
me fait plus mal
c'est contre nature
que chaque jour sans toi
when you're driving on cruise control
and dont say you
wanna date the best in me
coulda woulda shoulda
dont you say
but i didnt do that
c'est toi lhorloge
seule dans la nuit
like a train at the station
il ny a que dans lombre que j'aie peur
je ne peux vivre
d'un secret que je ne garderai pas
that lives in the shadow
while waiting his steps i put music on mute very low
nothing i know nothing of it i put on some lights
quand trop pale parfois ne surtout pas
mais en entendant sa voix je saurai
j'y pense tout le temps a cet instant oh quand on se reconnaitra
rien je nen sais rien je mets des lumieres
en attendant juste un sens a tout ca a tout ca
on a des cathdrales
and then one day we sing
et puis un jour on marche
on sait que dieu existe
the days are wonderful
et miser sa fortune
oui s'il nen restait qu'une
ltoile qui passe
et s'il nen restait qu'une
depuis toujours se pigent
pour lamour tout va
they just dont understand
they dont even wanna try
everybody's talkin my baby down
everybody's just wanna talk my baby down
and i dont need any other proof
nobody wants to see it
tell me i should find another
no they dont know what he's all about
play it once i could disappear
and i have fallen deep
no matter what you once believed
you better keep your eyes on me
and if you love me
if you're mine
your eyes on me
and just keep moving on
empty
i've got to be strong
but until i do i'll do fine by myself
but time can heal
et la terre vivra sans nous
fais ce que tu voudras
and if you leave me a bit of rain
et mon amour en musique
do whatever you will want to
if we have to wrestle
do whatever you will want to
if i am crazy just dont care
you gave me a sign and opened my eyes
so dont be afraid to feel this way
and in your eyes i see ribbons of color
and i cant even see the ground
i'm falling into you
feliz navidad
we wanna wish you a merry christmas
feliz navidad
from the bottom of my heart
we wanna wish you a merry christmas
et qui ne seront plus demain
o je vois le rve passer
voir les tons apaiss qu'il prend
femme comme chacune
et puis malgr que nous sommes presss
la nuit femme comme chacune
empty
restera la rumeur
and of our heart beats
your endless journey has begun
be on your way dont wait for me
petit papa nol
la plus belle nuit du monde
rise their eyes to the sky
sur la paille d'une table
at the feet of the new born child
la plus belle nuit du monde
a little bit of love comes from the sky
empty
a dream that i can call my own
i found a thrill to press my cheek to
semblent en guerre
moi dans cette vie
au secours
tell me that at least someday
no more borders no more distrust
i need lots of love
then i have no doubt
to live with you
considering all the madness
las discusiones de los dos
ms all de la violenca
cuando te adormeces junto a mi
para amarte a toda costa
de que aun existe amor
an old house that doesnt have any age
moi j'ai besoin de terre et de soleil
je tourne en rond comme une abeille
i'm living in a whirlwind of dreams
i'm turning around like a bee
oh mainden hear a maidens sorrow
oh maiden hear a maiden pleadin
no i'm not the blue dressed princess from your sleeping woods
with you
non je ne suis pas la sagesse mme et mes sentiments
je veux dvorer les plus beaux fruits
with you
renounce to yourself and sometimes to knock the order of your life over
let me hold you close i'll sing you this lullaby
just call out and i'll be there
never sure that love would grow
used to be scared if i would ever get this close
i will follow you you'll never be alone
wherever you may be
before you go to sleep
cause it's a long way to go
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful boy
small to say the least
tune as old as song
for all the truth that you made me see
you were my voice when i couldnt speak
you said no star was out of reach
you saw the best there was in me
my world is a better place because of you
you were my voice when i couldnt speak
empty
ira vers le sud ou le nord
who's trying to know
que j'aime
of my song
i love him
il a pris le sud et moi j'ai pris le nord
he went south and i went north
des beaux jours
however however
benjamin i love him
ne pleure ne pleure surtout pas
et si le public m'ovationne
give me the world for one day
pour guerir ses blessures
si les gens s'aiment
au ciel de ma maison
et s'il existe la bas des coins
si les gens s'aiment
ecrire une chanson
s'il y a des faiseurs de pluie
and you'll see that love
like we love each other
decorations of red on a green christmastree
you'll be doin all right with your christmas of white
flowers gay
bonne nuit cher enfant
quand le jour reviendra
set you slumbers till day
j'y ai dpos quelques roses
pour m'couter
toujours la fin de lt
ton sourire venait de lme
je te ddie toutes mes chansons
feel so fine
halfway to heaven
let me share them with you
'cause i'm already falling in love
you're makin all my senses come alive
and a happy new year
let's stop all the fight
i hope you have fun
and a new one just begun
and a happy new year
let's stop all the fight
i hope you have fun
and a new one just begun
baby just have a heart
i always thought that i would have the upper hand
felt like you were dreamin
that was heaven sent
when you finally found the meanin
have you ever been in love
entre trois et cent dix ans
tu joues comme un fou
au soleil de tes dents
it's all right
oh oh oh oh
were following him barking
des trompettes des saxos
oui c'est a qui est bon
we have the impression
ta musique est pour nous
it's all right
oh oh
tu joues comme un fou
you play like a crazy man
dans un marais
with long curtains
master of the house
celle qu'il aime nest pas venue
la nuit
by this country
from le p'tit bonheur
that i've gathered
monsieur je vous en prie dlivrez moi de ma torture
j'ai travers sur mes souliers ferrs
me my shoes have passed through the meadows
you'll fall if i'm not there
c'est d'voir lautre se casser lcou
he's rich he's polite
is to see the other breaking his neck failing
when the train goes at fifty miles per hour
there was only one passenger
le train du nord
but i wont be the one to blame him
we can walk in the rain
ne me touche pas
empty
fais ta prire
ni tes yeux
nor your nights
for that girl
listen to me
empty
le ciel aura vingt ans
quand a balance
il ne manque plus que les trompettes
ds que le tempo est l
1 2 3 4 et a va
from the shore of a small stream
a balloon from carnaval
of a sunflower in its flower
prisoneer in the harp of wind
que font sans cesse les heures
all the mills of my heart
coute coute le temps
since it changes all the time
we can fly from sun to sun
celui qui reste quand les autres t'ont dj quitt
you already found the evening star
si c'est ton ami
if it's a friend
then you succeded in your life
give your bread and your wine and your life
s'il a ton rire s'il a tes larmes aussi
goes wrong
and the companion of luck
si c'est ton ami
don quichotte et son vieux sancho panza
s'il est pour toi
the one that stays when the others already left you
donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie
if it's your friend
if nothing less than the best satisfies him for you
together we go over mountains
si c'est ton ami
avec ses trompettes et ses guerres
puisqu'elle a fait de lui
et refais le monde comme
if it's your friend
and do the world all over again like have done three hundred times
i've learned how to deal and when to fight
i've held you tight pushed you away
i dont know
and all i know is i feel
when you show me your affection its more than i realized
i got nothing left
i got nothing left
i got nothing left
i'd like to break the chains you put around me
i never never never
you make me cry for you
you treat me wrong
then i love you
i never never never
at the window of my heart
whether they're from italy or california
dans un monde en feu
ceux qui vivent a deux qui nont pas peur des mots doux
et quelle tristesse sur la planete
ce sont les oiseaux du bonheur
comme un voyage d'un soir
partir nest pas quitter
le premier amour est le dernier
les paradis
when walking without any other goal
when even alcohols no more make drunk
dans un journal d'autres histoires
an abandonned flower
we'll be princes of eternity
et le cher bambin le dimanche
he was saying while giving them to her
here my beautiful mom
le gamin vit partir sa mre
a morning of april among the walkers
l bas elle m'attend
for my beautiful mommy
the touched merchant told him softly
tiens ma jolie maman
you who loved them so much
on se rend compte
on cours les uns apres les autres
but at the end of it
we sleep ones against the others
but at the end of it
as subtle as a breeze that fans a flicker to a flame
but as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn
c'est lembrassement du frre qui te reste
aime pour tout de bon
ou pour se dscher tout fait
et peut tre sera t elle plus heureuse
an abracaca
on on
the magic man
the wonders
the picture of a broken man
when life gets tough you need
can go a long way sometimes
a little bit of love sometimes
chorus iii
is really all you need
i want a chance to live
live like i used to be
we're still together in my heart
asking nothing in return
to live with a man
i could make you crazy make you crazy
lolita is not too young to love
il faut que tu me les rendes me les rendes
alone caressing you
about my first night of love
i love you
and i'm telling you
until the end
is not too young to give herself
une a une
you have to give them back to me back to me
trop jeune pour aimer
i dont give a dawn
let's face the music and dance
wont depend upon the words we say
no promise spoken
more than this
have a chance
light the way
they cant stop us
with a little faith
and never explains
when our hearts make the choices
now i can feel what you're afraid to say
and wrap it around us
i hide my dreams in a special place
to me you are the only one i dream of
i can run but i cant hide
i can run but i cant hide
i've tried my best for so long
only a feeling can save us now
show some emotion
open open your heart
je rirais souvent comme les autres
oh si j'tais quelqu'un
comme pour dessiner un ballon
quelqu'un comme les autres
how can i make him read my thoughts
si lon changeait les choses un peu rien qu'en aimant donner
les portes laissent entrer les cris meme en fermant
my peaceful life where i can ear every heart beating
i would do a dream of this world an eternity
if loving was enough
qu'on me dise mes fautes mes chimeres aussi
je ferais de ce monde un reve une eternite
when tears are gnawing at me that others shed
which weapons reply to the countries of our fears
si lon pouvait changer les choses et tout recommencer
beautiful days we seem to leave so undone
all i know is that i'm standing in a place where
after all we're so bright
so close your eyes i'll sing a sweet lullaby
let go tiny hands and drift away to a bright enchanted land
cause when you dream it doesnt matter where you are
they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and waaaarm
i played to love without showing myself
sola otra vez
mi corazon no aguanta mas
alone once again
alone once again
sola otra vez
alone once again
without love
quis volar
hacer mi sueo realidad
alone once again
my heart cant hold no more
sola otra vez
jugu al amor sin entregar
alone once again
otra vez sin amor
alone once again
and if you cant feel that in my love
and i could never be
then i'll be
but i could never be
for my touch
i cry and you comfort me
i search for reasons and baby you inspire
you never walk alone no
i wanna look in your eyes now and see you smiling again
and no more kissin kissin goodnight
i'm not afraid of
but i want more and more and more
it's the kind of sweet dreams are made of
super love
super love
yeah same sweet love
on monte les malles des quais sur le pont
from cabins to kitchens
in all the holds the penal section and the hours of shifts
mais vienne une tempte une lame en sursaut
quand les astres s'en mlent sur limmense ocan
sur le mme sur le mme bateau
sur le meme bateau
des soirees mondaines des valses ou tangos
under the same stars
near the swimming pool the pretties and the handsomes
sur le meme bateau sur le meme bateau
surprise surprise
i guess it's do or die
cause i'll only let you in
my river runs wide
'cause what if you walk away
surprise surprise
from the way they used to be
holdin hands with her daddy's mom
aint getting what they need
passions run high
good to bad in the beat of a heart
shut up and drive
the one that's so strong
that you wanted him to be
i'm the voice you never listen to
shut up and drive
i'm overloaded with love
urging me constantly to take one more chance
and you need someone who
and let this love inside of me start
flowing from my 10 lb heart
first chorus
i asked her point blank is my friend going to die
too bad those kids were so nice
dont call the lady with the alligator purse
doesnt know it's even there
i keep them because i want to stay right where i'm at
we thought we were stars closing down the bars
in the back of the bottom drawer
take your time
we said that's how this love will always be
everything changes
take a breath
before you lie
between a mother and a child
you want me to feel the way you do
it never was or will ever be
i'm sorry your life let you down
or the things that i believe
but that doesnt mean that i want war
i've walked on the sand in baghdad
or to the building where her church group meets
it goes to show you never can tell
and boy did they let it blast
to celebrate their anniversary
it's the hardest one i've ever faced
and keep the time from draggin on
you gotta keep that pretty smile upon your face
i put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
you'll appreciate the light
'cause a deep down low makes level feel so high
and this 1950 gibson was emma jeans guitar
but there's a little bit of emma jean in every song i play
i would've reached for the phone and called you up
what do i think i miss the most everything
the way we laugh
track 9 time 231
then he told me where i could go
i really had a ball last night
i held all the pretty boys tight
i sat here for hours
it's the easiest thing i could have done
is still the best i've ever had
no one ever loses
who's in it for the long run
then i'll gladly set you free
then i'll gladly set you free
but i'll take my chance and say
you're a diamand in the rough that should be mine
i'll be constant as the sun that shines above
but we listen country when were all alone
hell bent holdin on
it drives him wild
her parents had his never did
when doubt said it cant be done
two hearts beating as one
two hearts beating as one
everything i've ever learned about love
i know it hurts you to do this to me
all this love i have inside
but i could never love you enough
give you my every possession
make the passion last every night
loving you with all her might
into thinkin that i'll never be alright
who'd lie awake all night cry til you were out of sight
what we have aint gonna be enough for me
i've been tryin but i just cant live like that
and like musical chairs at the baggage belt
just when we thought it had gotten bad as it could get
if we've learned anything it's there's no winner when we fight
or one weekend in the mountains
and a big back yard where kids can play
tell me what's so great about picket fences
chely wright
no hot romance on display
yeah right in the middle of it
i couldnt help but think of you again
i love you i lost you
i think some people have taken this a little too far
i love you i lost you
and i could tell you i will heal the wounds that cut you down
and i could tell you i will heal the wounds that cut you down
and i could tell you i will heal the wounds that cut you down
shoulder to shoulder and back to back
shoulder to shoulder and back to back
pure as an angel
but i was little miss perfect and still ended up here
by packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
he was glued to the tv
she never once looked back
the sun is sinking low
to where she doesnt know
and drove on
cause he dont do bars anymore
when he's wrapped up in my arms
no he dont do bars anymore
now satellite pictures sent back to earth
leslie satcher
oh just the thought of dialing makes my heart race
if you wind up over here with me
oh i should turn around but i keep on driving by
good at leaving
and i'll hive him to you
i still read your horoscope
and if you feel old feelings comin back
between that and capricorn maybe i'll know
to make me fall for you
i already do
laugh i just have to laugh
baby the suns been up for hours
a hand just to hold in the dark
he's come a long long way
i got him ready for you
and it's tragic but true
dont think that i'm all through
but for now it would be wrong
if i had married jfk
if i were jackie
like she had grown accustomed to
empty
'cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us
i feel it when you touch me
i'll take all i can get
we took our time
i'll take all i can get
it was cool as a breeze
but one by one you made them disappear
that's how i knew
it was never enough
the clock is ticking loud as thunder
and say the words to keep me here
and now the pedestal i've put you on
different day different town
but i know where i belong
every hotel bed feels the same
it's not the miles
but i know where i belong
it's the song
he'll be back here in my arms
empty
he's callin me twice a night then callin again
all i know is he'll be here in a minute
just another heartache
and settle in for a good laugh
oh you never can tell
there's a
but it's just like a red red wine
and i've been passin up every what if
ooo you're underneath my skin
you say you'd feel a whole lot better
but you'll know it when you get here
i'm on the southside of lonesome
leslie satcher
but it's fire that keeps you warm
maybe i'm rough around the edges
he's dating a doctor with a gentle nature
when he's out with her he's never in a hurry
cause he knows how much i've suffered
once again like it did back then
when he said mommy you use daddy's glove
and that kind of love is hard to find
it's got to be here somewhere
we didnt give it away
it used to be here somewhere
we didnt give it away
and hid her earrings in his pocket
from the guilty lonely life she's bound to lead
they tried to keep it undercover
there aint a whole lot you can do
of the ones that came before
in the clothes that she'd been wearin
i'd gone to school with christine thuro
i heard that they did all they could
i swear i'll never go down there again
i said i know just how things are
and for years she's paid the price
till all her tears are dry
this heart of mine finally understands
now in your arms it's plain as day
i'm not sure about hell but i know there's a heaven
that i sing when i drive
repeat chorus
love that's gone by and the things i didnt do
that's what i learned from loving you
that's what i learned from loving you
'cause what if we fly
they dont come easy
what if we fly
it's clear to us it's serious
why do i do what i do
baby we better hit the brakes and take it slow
get these wheels back on the road
and our one dance turned into two
you ask me what's the hurry you say let's take our time
i can hear mama now say it wont let you down
but tonight i've wrestled with the devil
for some kind of peace
and i shall not want
but it dont help to ease an aching heart
i just want a little love
i cant help but look up there and wonder
wouldnt it be cool if all the supermodels tried to look like me
if one day you beg and plead for me to take you back
and one button doesnt match
i put it on and you just surround me
it keeps me company
it's so soft on my skin
lyin on my back in a cornfield back in kansas
your woman misses her man
your woman misses her man
your woman misses her man
and she shines for me
and i'm alone
gotta tell you something
and you notice it
back with another one of those block rockin beats
i never been the type to rap up a well a well a well a well
i will pay the price of being a thief
i'm demonized
please lead us to the sounds more bright
empty
empty
musicwe got the bass comin up here too so hold on tightalright check
get up on it like this
think that i will never come down again again again
just me my spike in my arm and my spoon
i'm yours you're mine
and they all hope i'm feeling well
parades milan catwalks
scream out sympathy
how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter
i'm walkin with my dog
i'm walking with my dog
and caught up in your love
i got what you need
comin through your town like a fuckin blizzard
be bigger than god
out of control
out of control
but it doesnt mean we're too far down the line
we're out of control
but you and i are brothers of the soul
i'll tell you that it's just too bad
where do i start
where do i begin
venal psychic amputees
my mind's a weapon immune from infection
elimination policy
can you hear me now
something show me
yeah i'm shining
you know how i've almost lost my mind
i'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon lord
i couldnt explain
yeah i'm shining
did i pass the acid test
voodoo people
rock the house in
dont even know who's bed i'm in
with a wailing saxophone
you're gonna boogie till the cows come home
even if you show up by yourself
the oklahoma stomp and born to lose
i get up with the sun and go down with the moon
gotta nail down the lid
someday i'm gonna leave this world
so i wouldnt dare lay a hand on you
rollin down the nape of my neck
it's gettin harder and harder to breathe
rollin down the nape of my neck
they always have
i wont be here very long
i wonderin if you'd do me
and just dance the night away
but i didnt mind 'cause you made my life worthwhile
but i'd never be the one to say goodbye
but if he looks a little down and out
girl just listen to me now
even with a broken heart
when a cowboy falls he falls hard
i have rode broncs from hell
kim williams walker blazey
and we found heaven down by the riverside
and we found heaven down by the riverside
and all it got me was twice as lost
we can do some living
than a thousand back or a million that aint
or spend our whole life hopin
this aint my first ride
but it still beats like new
you only use the very best parts
both feet right beneath me
i'm all turned around got my down side up
i'm heart over head over heels over you
i didnt wanna hear her say goodbye
headin for the next horizon
oh it's a hell of a road
the hardest thing i'll ever have to do
the hardest thing i'll ever have to do
but where on earth would i be
that no man can control
there are thorns with every rose
every time you look at me that way
that cant be measured by one emotion
i love flying down the road
gonna turn it loose in houston
swung up through oklahoma
clay walker mensy
that's us
and when that old cold truth is hard to face
he looked down and knew
standing out there in the snow
she said how much do i owe you
she went in to grab a bite to eat
the lady slipped right out the door
dont let the chain of love end with you
waitin for the bell and mrs greer
the melrose avenue cinema two
now the melrose avenue cinema two
yes we do
are you coming back lord i dont know
are you coming back lord i dont know
well i got a good friend who's got a good life
then what where you gonna turn
then what what you gonna do
there's bound to be some consequences
shawna harrington burkhart paul daniel
you thought loved you more
i should have said
that's running through my head
i was a little too naive
you're asking way too much of me
there'll be no way to escape
dont know how not to go back there again
see no signs of a better time and place
this woman this woman and this man
this woman this woman and this man
i've got so much to give
in no time at all
just close your eyes
that you get everything you need
all i wanted was your love
what do you want for nothin baby
what do you want for nothin baby
i hear angels singin
time's up
what's it to you
talk to me baby tell me what you're feelin
but all of this is news to me
you know you always said i would
on an old forgotten wall
convinced i could not go on
put me through
this tunnel has a light
where were you
why are you wearing that negligee
empty
and it's a mystery that i cant explain
and the lights go down
deep as the ocean
you deliver me
i must be forgiven
you deliver me
you deliver me
the way that you got over me
with a wave of your hand and a goodbye
jon robbins kaiser
i'll say it and then
girl i'll never get tired
of sayin i love you
knows me by my first name
you're beginning to get to me
i'm just saying i believe
the way i need you all time
than i can bear to stand
than i can bear to stand
let's go back again
trade m in for a couple cherry cokes
the ocean dont ask why
i find myself reaching for you
i was born to
some folks called him crazy but i knew better than that
and one way out it's true
they still talk about the stranger who saved her life that spring
no name on the note but i know who wrote money aint everything
money cant buy the love we had
money cant buy the love we had
every night i leave the light on you're just working late
i'll light a fire when you get home
as long as i dont say goodbye
the rain beat soft against the window
we put all our fears to rest
i'm ready for the next step in love
i would be crazy to let this moment pass
girl take a chance time is unfolding
what if i am the one
i may never know
oh girl what if you are the one
back when it was
three four i walk the floor
five six i wouldnt miss
i'd just forget we ever met
'cept just when i think i left you far behind
your memory get me down
how she was gettin over just one more sad affair
'cause ordinary people have extraordinary love
the greatest gift that i could ever wish for you and me
and there you would be
how love should feel
you're the fire
tells me that this love is real
tell me that this love is real
i've got callused hands
to fall too hard
the simple things hey what do you say
around the edges of my heart
cause rumor has it you love me too
it must have been the roses and wine
that you cant go on
what we have really isnt what
please walk away
there'll be nights
how you fell out of love
your dance with me smile
and it's me not the room
clay walker jason greene
maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
but in my heart there's never been a doubt
never been the quittin kind
she's right behind me when i doubt myself
aint it strange how forever changed
'cause once you start to love here
then and there i knew
but i sure know how it ends
i dont know how love starts
philip douglas yeary harbin
and i love it
for more of it
in cut off jeans
but i keep coming back
tony mullins holmes h oglesby
oh tonight i need a margarita and i need her bad
so i can taste her and hold her one last time
no i wont have the heart to love again
was it love at first sight
i'd say that's right down the middle
i'd say that's right down the middle
if a man aint thinkin 'bout his woman
then what's he thinkin of
what's he thinkin of
i'd be a millionaire in a week or two
if i could make a livin out of lovin you
i remember when it all began
if you ever feel
who will live you
so i wont hold you down
i'll be waitin
if you ever feel
and there's no tellin what they'd find
but that never crossed their minds at all
beneath the stars in each other's arms
3we're in heartland heartland
yo no soy marinero
y arriba arriba por ti sere'
to make the tears desappear from your face
i'll make sure they fit you just right
he's up and he's down and he only smiles
i'm gonna live gonna laugh gonna love
gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
i didnt live on no blacktop street
i dont worry 'bout things that i cant change
i dont need anything money can buy
goodbye there's no good when you're the one
how can we be so far between where we are and one more try
but i've just gotta make this memory stand clear
still i'm leavin here a better man
luck be a lady and i'm gonna find love comin on the bottom line
fiddle and guitar
ten years on the road making one night stands
waylon jennings
and you reach for her but she's not with you
there's so many moments that i've left incomplete
another ending just begun
but the strongest of flames wont burn eternally
and you never were that kind
would make him wish he was busting broncs again
gave jack's freedom to the jailbird payment on the lies he told
yeah it's the world's most crooked picture and when it comes to being framed
when he's loading his sleigh and he's making the rounds
he knows who's asleep and awake
he'd be the jolly get up and go man
i can get santa to send me i've got the
he'd be the jolly still on a roll man
dont you draw the queen of diamonds boy
dont your feet get cold in the wintertime
you better let somebody love you
the top of every list
repeat chorus
you just lie around in bed
in an outer spiral orb at 40000 miles an hour
our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
and every single reason why i'm so much stronger
repeat chorus
when i'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
and if you feel the ground is gaining on you
i havent been there i havent done that
to know your little fingers are gonna get burned
i figure everything'll happen in time
you dont have to take a walk in the sea
you dont have to put your hand in the fire
fix that car nine ways to sunday
well i may not get ahead but now i wont be far behind
step by step and line by dotted line
down at the junction another flies by
a hound for glory and the glory bound
repeat chorus
that can grow inside until it hides the
tonight i'll climb back in that bed again
i'm not a kid anymore and i still believe
and if i did the things i oughta
i've spent all my life just dying
we look to our future
life gets away from us all
life gets away from us all
liked the rain always calling for you i'm falling for you now
and when the night falls on our better days
like the rain i have fallen for you and i know just why you
christmas flying back in my mind
bringing the newborn king and the
the very first christmas
christmas day that shall fall
and could a star show me christmas
i'm looking for christmas i know i'll find christmas
as born on this christmas and each christmas day
the boss man has got mine in a sling
and i'm always keepin track
and he cant give that to her and she cant find it with him
she wants the kind of love she cant live without
no one's gonna do me wrong tonight
i've been loving blind
but oh the times i thought
but i just couldnt see
the grass is green on both sides of the hill there's no time to kill
and do we just keep killin time until there's no time to kill
just a mindless old routine
cup of coffee in the morning
but the wheels are turnin in her mind
i may never see again
before the sun comes up
and that's about as lonely
and that's a pair of taillights
down at ernie's icehouse liftin longnecks to that good old country sound
and now we're talkin 'bout the good old times
and what's come over me
it's all around us
we're still the same
you'd have some sympathy
now i'm head over heels in the lost and found
i'd walk right back to me
most of them make sense
i hear that old cliche
has so quickly come and gone
it's holding tight lettin go
the way we work together is what sets our love apart
we help to make each other all that we can be
love isnt just those words we said
aint it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
it can make a right from a wrong it can make you fall in love
but it's not me
if that's what we have to do
there are no walls that we cant climb
but here in my heart
you're the only lock that's made to fit my key
nothin less than exactly
waitin on a shove
you're the only lock that's made to fit my key
get that old work monkey down off my back
repeat chorus
there's always something in between
so many people out running around
the shoes you're wearing
now i'm only five years old
but how in the world does he get in
i've got to check now i dont recall
could there be something i might have missed
clint black nichols
and i've had it to the gills of knowin what the nitty gritty's all about
the dark
there's room to grow under the mistletoe
dont want out if we're in the throes
say it aint say it aint just the mistletoe
but if anyone should ask from time to time
so even if i wanted to i couldnt stay
was just before i saw the light
i oughta know the look in another's eyes
somehow we sell ourselves on love
and they're always gonna be they rise and they fall
that's what i had in mind when i said i do
when i said i do i meant that i will 'til the end of all time
it wont be long before my ship comes in
not losing sight of why i'm up here alone
i thought my feet were planted
a fire in my mind
but there's no way of knowin where i'm bound
time after time
trying to change your life you change your point of view
feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
the memories and emotions that i've been through
giving everything i use to be to belong to someone
but i'm through holding back the flames
you're way over me
and wherever you've gone to
someday i'll need you the way you dont need me now
i never ever can decipher
to finding all the faults that sustain
breakdown honestly
and the answers you seek
aimlessly around your consciousness
reviving just to crash and burn
show me where to look
tell me will love be there
love withstands but time must rest oh yeah
we know there's no longer shine
we know we're running head on
all is all i can do
i'm your recent adaptation
let the word out i've got to get out
you pushed me down
when truth is your reason
so while the pageant of lies
i guess tomorrow
'cause it's only time
alters in her head
do you follow what i say
now you're fluttering
soon we'll start singing
been thinking a lot about my ways
been hurting a lot without you here
resonate tones of saving grace
exercise your tranquility
the world out there
hey baby are you listening
i never want to become precious
are distorted by your weaknesses and fear
all of your madness is crowded in my head
all of your madness is crowded in my head
i dont know i just might alone
are now faint whisperings
everything everything everything
try anyway
just tilt my sun towards
just spit me out
love's easier lost than found
time to move up to higher ground
the sky now divides
where am i to take refuge
i know hearts are weeping
to crash on thru
to crash on thru
so when you're done revolving
dont drain this conversation
catch me if you can
see i'm no more no less
all right
clouds of thought you
where i dont know
my condition oh it's just not the same
to do what she believes
to give her all that she needs
see i have a line though it's subject to change
wont crash now i found some encouragement
yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
can i rest upon your shoulders
can i have all of your answers
please just reach out to me
change will be
now as the hours passing
to awaken some old qualities
soon reason will have rhyme
that they could have a guiding satellite
scream about mercy
i just want to scream
for the change she's facing now
she gathers rain
the same love she gives
she said that time is unfair
she said her daddy had dreams
will you comfort and forgive me
forgive me
let love seek let love find it's simple
learning from each other can be simple
so wont you push away
to warn you of storms ahead
but i do think i understand
make me feel like i could never float
slow slow
exploit your position
hey i hope you're feeling
you preach synthetic like
i dont recall bowing before you
are we listening
and i laugh at myself
there's a way
there's a way
to a world where hope's enslaved
to this world we've denied
still i'm here defining my own truth
i'll comfort you with silence till the morning light
the sorcerers or the preachers
all of my pain has been freed
my mother said
dont fashion me
now you want to move 'cause it's crashing down
i dont see what you think i see
yeah she's questioning her father
of the sky
you think you thought i know
lead me to my next incident
all my props i swear they were in order
they look at me when i talk to them
even in my hometown
i think you left me for their government
all of your friends i hope are listening
all of your friends i hope are listening
have become impaired
as some answers fly around
everything is comfortable
but now all i really want to learn
one fine morning i'll awake
round and round and round
one fine morning i'll awake
yeah let's gel
well let's bungle
love's a joke love's a tease
love's a reason i believe but
i cant convey
giving me words so i may learn
giving me light to see thru tears
giving me breath of your mercy
and try to figure out how to do without you
well i'll just sit here like a wounded soul
so why cant you function that way
got my babe by my side
i'm acquainted with your suffering
to think about the casualties of your exchange
and the rain comes just like summer in hell
beauty adores us on this we agree
until we find love
until we let old wounds mend
in our bed we make
in between
i'm sleeping to encompass myself
with my heart no more abused
took a rented room on broadway
but you know we're never farther
one will get you where you're going
that we were through
just keeps on going strong
it's plain to see your hold on me
it's kind of like you never left at all
could you please take them under wing
use me to guide them day to day
keep us so close we wont forget
i swung that bat with all my might
as long as i live and breathe
dont you want to be rich one day
and there aint nobody gonna take that from me
you know i love you dad
all i can be is a sweet memory
while lying here with you
a ring for your finger so fine
all i can be is a sweet memory
could be the right someone for you
detours dead ends endless explorations
on that road that takes a man
cant you see that i've surrendered
heaven knows you cant be from
frank j meyers nelson
any old stretch of blacktop will do
any old stretch of blacktop will do
this world has gone half crazy
too much grindstone too little time with you
you've passed up so many chances to walk right out the door
there's nothing more to say
the smoky mountains wear
hoping next time april may
i'm just an april fool
then you took me to st louis later on down the river
you know there's not much there to make you stay very long
blackbird singing in the dead of night
into the light of a dark black night
i hear your favorite music on the jukebox
you put a spell on me i guess i'll always be hypnotized
'cause that old blue magic still works like a charm
for me who'd love me like nobody else
girl i'll give you my heart
with all of my soul
darlin completely
didnt we love didnt we share
well i guess i won that one 'cause i still need you so
didnt we love didnt we share
from where i'm falling i think i might meet you
well i've never been to that part of the country
we've got nothing to keep us from start over georgia
stay awake dont close your eyes
there were so many times we could have said goodbye
when faith was tested and dreams were fading fast
we're survivors we made through the storm
they say you're trouble
honey wont you please behave
got no shame
let's go miss behavin tonight
this is the ocean
the past we've brought along
that was a river
well i aint got a witness i cant prove it but
well i aint got a witness i cant prove it but
and that's my story and i'm stickin to it
close your eyes
lifes an adventure theres so much to do
a whole world of wonder is waiting for you
she's so ashamed she's daddy's secret love
he cries for hours cries and never stops
thou shalt not take the lord's name in vain
lights are turning on like a fairy tale come true
watching as you softly sleep
and i'm thankful everyday
he circled and stared
and went back in history
but he's no fool he knows
if they knew what that seat really was but
the lights came on bright
like old jericho
sailing all my relationships
in a world where just a few things do make sense to me
ooh baby you're how the walls came down
to tame him
his daddy told him boy you've always been
i dont know where he is
to the border and beyond
kind of guy
it's a safe bet we're headed
thats an irish lullaby
too la loo ra li
then she called to say
but i guess everyone is living
and i never even tried to come back home
we could all go crazy from
so count me with the wounded and the shaken
'cause i gathered all i had and gladly risked it
by what i did for love
but lookin back
i get what i need
and i got pain that made me strong
and i got pain that made me strong
he came to town on an old freight train
will we let him in or turn our back
if somebody takes her home
he came to town on a cold dark night
what if jesus comes back like that
no fairy tale ever started this way but
two lonely hearts beating scared to death
when stronger powers pull two bodies near
just might be a blessing
they've got a baby and the world on their shoulders
if it sets things right
a prayer can be a wish
when you say your prayers
will come to you
fate steps in and sees you through
i spill on my white shirt
there's a circus in my head ahh ah
you always get to me yeah
your love rescues me
i'm in a lonely state of mind
you're the stars in my darkness
you always get to me
while you're packing your suitcase pack my memories
i'm still enchanted by you baby
oh how could i ask for more
you take me higher
darlin you still take me
the way you always love me
through the universe
i dont know how you go everywhere i've been
beyond the reach of time
you will always be mine
a man and a woman who've been left behind
but time never has stood still and it aint about to start
tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
i'm tired of loving this way
oh baby what do you say
you will have your place
can we go on like this
dont even leave one little speck of dust
dont even leave one photograph
you stole my pride and dignity
i mean what i say
empty
empty
'cause those words are a prison
a man of my word
with every step our love will grow
is still around the bend
i said how 'bout some music you said you got any merle
we both like to color outside of the lines
you sent my head spinning like a tilt a wheel
my kind my kind of girl
just might remind you of me
so she searched for greener pastures
she didnt say i love you
lord i hate feeling like that
i took it on the chin i took there best shot
my heart began to tell my body and my soul
it aint my style to overheat much less burn
he waited impatiently
around one boy and one girl
congratulations twins
the one love that could keep my
that was missing in my life
passion burning in the night
we sailed on together and drifted apart
how much i've wanted you home
we had a storybook beginning getting better with each page
'bout a man that loved someone who loved somebody else
and even this backwoods country boy
she's got season tickets and sweet pouty lips
she only gets mad when she missed sportscenter
she's all that i'm in touch with her feminine side
she's all that
i shake my fist
'cause people and places
she hardly can see anymore
of some things she cant use
first she'll have to let go
and that cool cat likes to unwind inhis room
and brush those teeth just right
that cool cat knows how to settle
i think about you
you eight years old
when i see a woman on the news
they protect us til we're of age
in spite if what's been lost
hope lives on and love remains
remember the wishes we made in the night
'cause somewhere tonight
well now baby if you wonder why
with a climbing rose
turning the corner of the heart
but i was wrong
or make it through one night
i cant make you stay
alone i lied
thinking that i could still
i couldnt last a moment without you
me in my rented tuxedo you in your mama's white dress
me in my old faded levi's you in your blue cotton dress
for the first time i'm in the mirror looking both ways
through all you've showed me so far
somehow at all cost
dear lifewhen i loved and i lost
i hope that i find what i'm reachin for
i'll live to see it all through
then i saw you
turn off the sun
life without you
i heard it's sad
the end of the world
'cause without you girl
every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
looking for my heart
and give me a chance to mend
yesterday they wont go away
and outta her dreams
cause i feel a gypsy honeymoon
the walked the wire of passion
cause i feel a gypsy honeymoon
she said take me away with you
now there's one less problem in south carolina tonight
dont you shrug off
and a starving baby with nothin to wear
with harder cards than yours in life to play
just another senseless case of suicide
hugh prestwood
why you wont let a body get close to you
i've been striking these matches in vain
and heads are for when you have to wear a hat
brothers always take your things
it was so right
it's wrong for me
where i'm no longer bound
and my heart is it's host
i thought i'd forget you
i can still feel you i can still feel you i can still feel you i can still feel you
billy kirsch jarrard
i'd a whole lot rather be here in your arms than be right
baby dont
fro now on you need to know
i volunteer
i know a place
i know where heaven is
in your arms
i want to be your strongest temptation
in your world
in your arms
and in the bad times too baby
you better run while there's still time
oh and usually i'm strong
when i tell you that i love you
keep things just the way they are
daddy we forgot to pray
all my worries fade away
but i wish i could
but if i were you i'd promise to live life for all it's worth
empty
i will know deep in my heart
let the sun stop burnin
you were packed and ready to go
it could be that easy
has left me seeing
to walk away
build a new tomorrow
unthinkable happened all along the entire western front the british and
to those who were there it seemed unreal
it wasnt long before they felt at ease
maybe there's a chance this time it might last
i dont regret one moment that we had together
empty
hey there honey youre so funny
were gonna have some fun together
things are just going to keep getting better
im gonna love you
without a net
it's against all odds
we'll be risking it all
when we fall
now he dont wear spurs that go jingle
and he sings out a song of his sweetheart
dont take this heaven from one
and that you'll always
promise you'll always
all i'll say is momma's got that place out in monterey
oh how fast can i go
if i have to i'll chase her clear across the map
texas plates candy apple red rodeo
i'm sellin vcrs in arkansas at a walmart
here in little rock
thoughts of you explode within my head
but nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
i know i'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years

it can hit you it can hurt you make you sore and
in all the minutes
in all the seasons
it's just the heat of the night
it was the heat of the night
o you were a vampire and baby
i hear something there in the shadow
they were naked as the day they were
you're the only one who leaves me warm and satisfied
everything's all right when i'm with you
all the poetry and the trunk
oh caroline x 4
and i'm looking back at you
then i started running for the train
we' keep trying crying lying and drinking
there's nothing that you need i cant deliver
if ya keep lying crying trying drinking
coming through
i been there
i'm getting closer and closer to home
i'm close to home close to home
it's a cold part of town
someone's waiting for the phone
i never will again
it's a shame the way we dance along the edge
some of flesh and blood from love under glass
like a ghost is the curtain
and the leaves at my feet
and the summer goes and always has will
never saw it fade away
like every heart to beat before
everything is wrong
had my share of winning
everything is wrong
mama's gone crazy 'cause her baby's shot down
they're gonna call me sir they'll all stop picking on me
god is a bullet have mercy on us everyone
but aside from all that i feel no pain
sirens far away
just so alone
feeling the pinch feeling the hope
of tossing and turning and buring and churning
and all their faces look the same
carry me away
help me help me help me find my way
teach me how to pray
you know im out of synch and im out of my mind
well the words fall dead
and you again
and it follows like a wind
i call it love
some call it god
i call it love
some call it jesus
but now that i'm older
i got to give a lot of me away
you dont believe in love
you've got a brother in the clinic
walking the streets
give them all that they want
your picture in every magazine
and all the angry young boys and all the angry young girls
what happened to her
everything in between then and now
i murdered you a hundred times
i hate to see you go
oh jesus please forgive me
joey baby dont get crazy
oh joey if you're hurting so am i
passed out on the floor
they're looking for jesus
they dont know who to run to
just what are they looking up here to me for
just what are you looking up here to me for
the little conversation
you know i never could say anything
like a story incomplete
and let the others speak for me
all the times you couldnt tell her how you miss her
like a blanket on your shoulder
when your breathing is the wind
sing you a lullabye a lullabye
miles have gone away
i can see a million years
i look up at the sky
thinking of you underneath the mexican moonlight
so i can watch all the evil in the room
i'm waiting for the time to fall behind me
wine dine do a line
it's a matter of time until they find me
wherever you go
you cant get away from the face in the mirror
everything we did
deathly cold
sip your tequila give me some time
by a world filled with
the moon is full the stars are bright
thought i heard your car
i wonder where you are
and things i tried to say
but you're always polite
hands are shaking lips are cracked
run run run
my eyes are jaded and complicated
i wont give her up
i never knew that the price would go up as such
they finally called you away
she said hold on hold out
i wonder why
keep on keep on keep on
and glitter on her eyes
he doesnt give a fuck he's living under a truck
show me a ray
show me a ray
as love looking down on them
love is the killer you thought
paws you and claws you you try not to fall
love is the teacher who lives in the dark
they say goodbye tomorrow wendy's
any second coming
i'll get a pick up truck and i'll drive away
i am who i am and it's all i can do
cause if i cant walk proud i'd rather walk away
when you smile i dont know what to do
when you smile i dont know what to do
and all the while behind the dancing eyes the boy crying
you cant keep your promises you just keep naming names
cause i was born a liar albatross
from your god above
i've been told things get better
my life is hazy hazy hazy
i've been told things get better
and when the process comes undone
heal these wounds
when you kill the mother there is no other
the struggle in side of your mind is a waste of time purest thoughts evaporate
break for the sun your the one the chosen one your time is up your time is due
and dont they wish they were blessed like you
your will is broken
you'll be a good citizen
just move move ahead
you were lying to yourself 'cos you were afraid of what you'd find
you can say it with a vengeance you'll be back from the grave
in the land of a 1000 nos
fucking mess
he said it happens every time
wont live up to your image
have fun
the beast you've been fighting
potential vaporization
in my mind haunting haunting my life
you reckon with forsaken dead
heard too much know too much dont know if i can take it
constant pain the endless rain becomes too much to bear
you're dead
the dance of the dead
dark thoughts there are no words
hum increases in my brain
sad domination by those who say more than you'll ever know
pick your own deliverance
we amputate the shown
there's a man who watches over me
like me you're drowning in a daydream
living and dying together never did nothing at all
an abberration deviation to get to the spirit of life
got to believe it
the water drips from wells of shame
stare deep into the frigid eyes of a man who knows he's lying
or those who think they know their souls
we cant play your clubs because
i think he shoulda known better
pretty soon you'll know it all holy mountains fall
through the goodbye window
you will never forget it
for money and security
supposed to feel there must
so busy so involved inyour lie
deserved always gets served
cause we stick therefore we can break down end time
no more
in your mind you've found it
powerfully twisting words he's resisting
there's no hope for you
all the millions spent in aid
empty
what if you were torn in two
now if i was king of all the rotten
faint sounds in the alley
rabid pack with sirens howling
time to tear down what remains
were on to something
love with no affection
both sides of the scales of power
as negotiations grab the attention
these are primitive times
these are primitive times
these are primitive times
and what is not
crippled will with tomorrows pill
man they cave in
empty
always wanted to make a difference
so go ahead and call me dumb
painted smiling face
and i hear you
poisoned planet nuclear war
left to rule
where are you putting your energy
as pressure turns to rage
god's word enforced and controlled
rabid dogs rabid dogs
lonely boy says come what may
and kills the dream so we sing this simple song
sleeping on the wing
toobad the good ones always have to take the blame
sweatin on the line doin 40 wasting time
mister clean
chances shine seven days our fears become entwined
beginning of this world selled with mankind
and put us in their hell and set our souls on fire
technocracy probable cause
technocracy bending laws
growth on this planet but
tell me what is gained
by staying aboard this runaway wreck
while you're losing is on the curve
nihilist to be turns the scrape into a gash
so the snake keeps on recruiting we one more royal shooting
but the snake is just a pawn and remains when we are gone
empty
i'm talking about a revolution
empty
and the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight
cant even think
but i never condemn a man
time the names will change
your voice is screaming clear
when the bays opened nothing was said
empty
i listen to few and i'm fueled by fire
i guess i bought a gun
then they take me on their knees again
in 1494 he did it with the girl next door
empty
stalk on a circle
i'm filled with the white noise
i was born on a warm night
she's got a red balloon she's gonna be the sky
i wanna be a plane i am a red balloon i'll never be the same
headed for berlin
and didnt drink
the only thing i thought to say
this time is better than last time
but i think i'd really like to die
she says oh no this is the last time
a little discipline can mess you up inside
oh this time i think you shed a little light
but i feel better today
i'm dreaming underground
i cant remember the last thing that you said as you were leaven
and it's one more night in hollywood
and it's one more day up in the canyon
what's wrong with him anyway
how'd he miss me anyway 7 days and i cant feel anything
he doesnt have to know
it's been years since we were born
five for silver
you can see the flames
think about it every time
come on come on
well i didnt mean to do it
settle down inside my love
empty
just get yourself inside her
lovers leave me alone to try to have a little fun one way or another i just wish i
got a message in my head
of all the stupid things i do
if i could give all my love to you
and the people that you knew
of a clock that tells the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
she comes out on fridays every time
holding a candle up to my hand
making me feel so incredible
she never came around
making me feel so incredible
and that's all that really matters to me
and some of us sink like a stone
what more perfect rendezvous
says i'm to dumb to
i'll make a place for you to land
wrapped in grace and in sin
they come out of the blue
they come out of the blue sky
they come out of the blue sky
they come out of the blue sky
they come out of the blue sky
this lonely spiral i've been in
hey monkey when can we begin
this lonely spiral i've been in
cut up maria
coming through in stereo
stare at the beautiful women
and i want to be someone to believe
but when everybody loves me i'm going to be just about as happy as can be
so come dance this silence down through the morning
coming through in stereo
stare at the beautiful women
believe in me because i dont believe in anything
funky as you can be
i dream i never know anyone at the party and i'm always the host
hey mrs potter wont you talk to me
hey mrs potter i dont know but
so why dont you climb down off that movie screen

down the coast well i am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame i am an
blanket of stars covers me in my bed hey mrs potter dont go hey mrs potter i
orders another well i wonder what he did that for that's when i know that i have to
you can look outside your window
i've been watching you for hours
three for girls and four for boys
you can see the flames of your wasted life
shes only willing
to kiss me again
now its completly
well night time let her through
without a single place to go of interest
so buy a pretty dress
i got a line on the new america
than medical but i got a friend from the new frontier
you should come home too
you can slide like the lord above you're a beam of teaming motion
something you can keep with you forever
maybe i will find today
baby we're the king and queen of nothing
everybody goes and then they come
man i ended up with pockets full of cane
what compels me to go
may you one day carry me home
get right to the heart of matters
you're only going to walk all over me
empty
we're in luck we dont mind we're as far as i can tell
there's nothing happening to you that means anything at all
every night i'm floating over you my love
every night i'm floating over you my love
why does she sing
for her pain
maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
i cant change my plan
just because she's been blindly deceived
is only to lose
from whom she must hide
hold your breath and ease your mind
take a breath
milky white and pure
nothing left of me in her
i rode a ladder that climbed across the nation
i took the cannonball down to the ocean
and i could stay on here at home alone
i met a girl with autumn in her eyes
so i guess i'm going back
'cause i just sold the sky to the sun
cause there's a show at 11 and the drinks are all free you can do
people are so unkind
it takes time to make these machines work but he aint got time while
the gentleman caller in the blue suede shoes
it's no easier for you some days
even though i couldnt say i've been the places that you've been
i really love the red haired girls
i hope you're resting quietly
and i walk out on the wire once again
i will wrap myself in pain
or i could swallow the sea
not knowing why
she sat right down on the sofa
we spendt all day getting sober
this girl listens to the band play
i been bummin around this old town so long
she said well get up get dressed get out
been hanginaround this town on the corner i been bummin around this old town for
where my shadows used to be
i didnt think that she returned it
but it's just the same hard candy you're
in the face of such an ordinary girl
this isnt gonna be easy
have you seen me lately
that make up a memory
this island life never ends
when i wake up in the morning
but oh
it makes me wonder why
and when we're older
she dont want nobody home
but i just cant wash away the stain of
we want to do tonight'
she planted flowers in her basement
she's got a little garden of her very own
this time they're much too slow
upon her lemon world they fall forever
someone else's chapstick on your lips
say your hungry she's lying for you forever now and now
she's someone else's witchcraft now
myself some gravity you're just trying to get me to stay sometimes i sit here
and i keep thinking tomorrow is coming today
and the comet is coming between
and there are people who will say they knew me so well
come on baby come on darling
she spins from where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in your
machine walks st robinson in his cadillac dream
me and the girl who could make it all clean
walks st robinson in his cadillac dream
and the comet is coming between
'cause i am not that kind of man i'm much less than you think i am
how can you see
how can you see
i cant even sleep when you're with me
past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
she's down on her knees
i'm feeling supersonic
but before tomorrow
she sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
'cos my friend said he'd take you home
well i hope neil young will remember
here i come alabama
sweet home alabama lord i'm coming home to you yeah yeah
but you know you dont have to you can just say no
but falling over you
all the stars come down in you
cause lovelovelovelove is only heaven away
she's closing all the shades
and all the worlds a shade of black and purple
to be a daisy
a little breath of wind and she's always near me
caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter
there has to be a change i'm sure
waiting for mothers to come
la la la la la la la
switch on your electric light
albert's always sincere he's a sensitive type
who'll never be together again
for an eggman on and off the wall
for an eggman fallin off the wall
and all the king's men reappear
i'm a comet common uncommon honestly
straight to tears
the disappearing nature of the people we have been
just the way you do
but oh this desert life
how i line my sky with all the silver i can use
one plus you equals one plus you equals you equals
she is leaving on a walkaway
for the restlessly abandoned homes
for love is blind and you're far too kind
they come on strong and it aint too long
and that's the hardest way ooh la la
she doesnt exist any more
and it's far too late anyway
for every time
i'd be the richest man
money cant buy love the kind i dream of
in the world
and we got stories how we slept with all the
she's my angel
radio's on
i may take a holiday in spain
you can live your life with whomever you please to
how can i live without you
she tells me when you look at me
all alone again
i'll follow you down baby
hurry hurry hurry before i go insane
and get me to the show
girl so that you could believe me and i could shake this static everytime i try to
forgive me it makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home how could
that the papers had all come
i'm an anchor on the line
i could justify myself
and ones that arent around
she comes to me at night when i'm sleeping
she tells me when you talk about me
spend my nights in self defense
but i'm not sleeping anymore
i thought you'd liked what you'd seen
took a ride on the love wheel
i think i need a little animal honey
knowing that our love will last through the day
take the time to get inside
to get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside
lala la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa laaaa laaaa
seemed like nothing at all
i said oh yeah what makes you think i wanted it that way
it's a kid thing
well if it isnt warm where you're sittin
we spend all night on the phone
it's a kid thing
we prefer the silence of the blind
empty
thin lines of light
how your garden grows
we see things they'll never see
all the things that i want to be
in the morning rain
gonna live forever
and it's one more night in hollywood
and talked a little while about the year
put on your bad self
that humming birds dont sing it doesnt matter really you know what i mean
it wouldnt be the first time you know it's happened a couple of times before
it's late september and i really should be back at school
my love you didnt need to coax
you led me away from home
you stole my heart but i love you anyway
between the bluegrass wavy seas
that will not release us willingly
i took the train form california
oh margery
and i'm there with you in ensenada
back to chorus
staring at the ceiling
is my confidence eroding
another pair of lips and eyes
and i wanna be scattered from here in this catapult
that would sing in the silence of so much rejection
is there anything different these days
i never had light in my eyes anyway
maybe things are maybe maybe maybe maybe things are different
we are all alone
because i'm dying
and the skies dont seem as near
i cant find my way home
you've gotta make it happen
to spend your days in the sunshine
you gotta you gotta you gotta fake it
closer to you
because i used to be
i am colourblind
i am ready
pull me out from inside
with a smile on your face
screw all my friends
you know you could
i wish you'd make up my bed
and faster than the sun rose
and a bitter heart will not reveal
crying for her baby child
i said it's alright
i told your mamma i'd get you home
sunday morning paper dated 1992
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading
it's getting cold in california
but all the things i keep inside myself they vanish in the air
when we see the early signs that daylight's fading
we never solve anything
my turn this time she says
and mine is just passing me by
and he turns the radio off
and albert's vision is blooming uncontrolled
we all get burned as
for the cause of some inflated form of hit and run
the world begins to disappear
no no never never never again uh huh
she said 'we're open all night
she said 'i was born the year the rockets landed
it's eight am
he's not intelligent we like the way he dances yeah
so alternative he likes to take our chances
he's fallen in a jar
what do you swallow to relax you ordinarily
i dont wanna no no no no no no yeah
but you can try
you better leave me alone
pancho was a bandit boys
they only let him slip away
all the federales say
he only did what he had to do
just down the street from your hotel baby
asleep in perfect blue buildings
beside the green apple sea
gonna get me a little oblivion baby
i belong anywhere but in between
i've been there before and i deserve a little more
when i think of heaven
i been drinking and i am the rain king
and i dont have nothing to say
but everything else is the same
and i wish it was a small world
maybe you were shot down in pieces
and she watches as her babies drift violently away
she sees shooting stars and comet tails
recovering the satellites
oh and i remember something you once told me
we flew straight across that river bridge
and i saw my deep blue sea
and i'll be damned if it did not come true
have you ever seen my face
i will shadow myself anyway
come again some other day
you shudder and beat
and it dont seem right that i dont get no sleep at night
i walk in the air between the rain
she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like elvis
round here we all look the same
but the girl in car in the parking lot
and nobody makes us wait
press it among the best years of my heart and my tears
god knows i wish i was somebody else
hey what's the matter
and i want and i want and i want and i want
and i wanna be a man
the comet is coming between
out in the shadow of the modern machines
i hope that you go to hell
shake some action
it's taken me so long
mary jane says it's all right
drifting through the scenery of the shallow days below
i'm all alone again
not too far from here
i know it's not the kind of thing you want
wont you tell your dad get off my back
home is where i want to be
hi yo you got light in your eyes
i cant tell one from another
and you love me till my heart stops
roy orbison singing for the lonely
oh and that's alright with me
i wanted to see you walking backwards
i wanna sink slowly without getting wet
and out into the desert we're gonna ride
look me in the eye
and every dream is a lie
i'm so i'm so unsatisfied
let them slip away
i might sleep all day
like to see your eyes
get your dreams just right
because summer's almost here
i'm just staring at
fix your hair just right
and hovers in the distance
some people they gotta work
so we act real zen
i gotta rush away she said
if you dont stop lying' on the floor
and i believe i the ground
between the currents we will swim
and i've been sliding all the falls
who wrote the pages of our lives
and the wave of life will capture me
but i need the things i need
cause you can make yourself feel good
cause nothing makes me feel so good
i might call tonight
or a ride downtown to some god forsaken land
little boy you better wake upcause your a walking dead
drown myself on sky
husbands who said good bye
i guess i'll realize in a day or more
wishing he wasnt suffering the same dreams all day long
she walks like she is on a line
the forces are teeming and the guns are coming low
why'd you leave me 'til i'm only good for
that climb into my bed and whisper
all my innocence is wasted on
i'll only stand here
my friend implores me for one time only
and i guess i'm going to have to live with that
empty
it seems like i should say as long as this is love
she's talking in her sleep
tiyuri to win
she's tired and lonely
every race night is shot through with sunlight
trying to be a good girl
she's tryin to be a good girl
go racing the next
tv dinners and letters she wont send and
one of these days
down on the boardwalk
well now everything dies baby that's a fact
and our love may be cold
down here it's just winners and losers
meet me tonight in atlantic city
she says i've forgotten what i'm supposed to do
empty
i'm playing this rock and roll thing
ride the soft machine
shivering with fear
to find my way out of here
in the wind again
if you see me
it's like i think
when they pass you by
until you're bleeding
all these seasons
spinning round
that highway line
all the days became so long
except the feeling just gets stronger everyday
north of nothing
if you see me coming home turn me away
so i left for minnesota
and for all this distance aint going to bring you to me
of everything and nothing
if you see me coming home turn me away
that you dont know what you've got
till it's gone
till it's gone
they paved paradise
you've been waiting a long time
i'm sorry everyone
i scrape my knees
blue eyes crying in the rain
with your eyes wild
shut your eyes
i dont i dont i dont
they catch you in a corner
i dont really think i do
they took a lot of time

and help yourself to them
empty
baby lets use it up
and that is how i got these lonesome johnny blues
and the price you pay is to remain alive
and he wound up taking much more than i own
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep
millions regardless
and their tears taste like wine
tempering weapons of criminal lust
tiny red miracles falling likerain
devour the sun
a jewel more radiant than the moon
she lulled me away from the rich masquerade
on the sea misted lawn where stone figures forlorn
i danced like a blind acolyte
i now know what thou art
but poised nectar within my stirs
secrets dead wouldst thou inflict
need fires have lured abominations here
blind reason against thee enchantress
enrobed in death's shadow like a swifter
that our fantasies spent
the damned
i remember the night as if it were engraved
come my friend to fate let's raise
the damned
in the shadow of miss anne thropy
my heart torn apart left a rifled grave
and death was swift to swallow on the hells of life
she stole the soul hate had sold away
empty
all heil love fails all hope lies in eclipse
but then all to soon
my limbs ignite
under quicksilver clouds
argentinum spurred
instead of harking prophecies
come skyclad to my arms
i buck under flames
i love the night
dressed for the sepulchre
amor e morte
bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
from heavens farthest shore
thrown east before the midnight masses
and for this grave mistake
never fucking more
that ran like blood through scarred ravines
like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
empty
with the coming of days
and through rich whores and corridors
and as he wrote i smote
that the stars overall
to catch sight of the seams
i knew not her name
nightfall take my hand
thank the midsummer rain
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
the pleasured dead speak of her
my heart though unhealed
where feral hordes impart my temper
supreme vampiric evil
is my love in vein
satan robed in ecumenical filth
empty
how the storm it fulfills
i rule as master here
with this darkness forever more
empty
i am he
in this response all evil chose
crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
covenants are struck jagged lightning fellates
psalmed sunset thus portends
with lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed
on her zenith to come
her lustre eviscerates me
and commit this world to thy ancient
where twice you sliced all hope from me
whose beauty fostered poets
for lengths that mesmerised
forever on my tongue
in floods of tears so well refined
empty
in place of eve a bitter parody hails
that a heart no more maintains
side to side with their diversions
oh you gilded cunt
and the teeth of a storm
dirty little soul frigger
i'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
hard to stop the surmounting terror
if there's a god then why has he let me die
oh hallowed be thy name
ascend to smother the light
supernal vestments hang tattered
empty
the infidel soon unmasks her face
vengeance in jesuit blood on stone
pursuing ascendancy
to witness such a violent show
crucify the so called lord
there's seven ways to go
in sea or sky or underground
i can take your lost soul from the grave
as this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
lips attuned to symmetry
their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
a deadly blessing to hide
i wept 'til tears crept back to prayer
i espied a gleam trodden to earth
sought her everywhere
their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
a final blessing to hide
'neath stars that marred descending skies
of their dark seductive songs
like spider eidolons
with the future he had seen
why has my lord forsaken my judgment
though she was gone
and to the floor
like a downward lance
my blood runs with the beasts
desert kingdoms of the dead
from the waking grasp of rapists in the dark
the hellish stench
the hammer of the gods in the prophets teeth
territorial thieves
oblivion be our coverlid
please ease my burden
no more war
sadistic souls
fresh blood of children drops down on me
the passion is the smell of cremation
in an overthrow of woven light
soft white throat
swallowing her fear
covering her back
spare me from the wolves
setting maps aflame
and should remorse not stay my course
oh sweet mary
and stayed within her sight
graveside i cry
my faith is lost to the burning of idols
suicide is a tried and tested formula for release
no light nor reef
and stays within my sight
the blaze once in my veins
forbidden once and bound to die
winter spawn from barren thighs
will their god of bridled love
we are what we are what we shall be again
that death would claim
and the smoke has choked these vistas
lipped with blood and secrets pried
i saw their lust still stain her thighs
i was
wherein even the crown prince of hell
would burn on the morrow with me
i pray as held sway upon losing her
we cant keep on living like this
empty
so let's head for home now
you can take it or leave it
empty
trying to find it
your gonna face it tonight now
from the grain
upon the lip
but for the rapture
of sin was me and i
for her return
to break to make my fluttered heart amiss
love would have conquered all
thou art pale hecate
nothing will keep us apart
leave them lifeless and broken
come to me black goddess arise
hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
and in this state of bliss
mad caliban with manner
they call me bad
that mouldered where older
and theres nothing like a mouthful of venetian tar
a passing fad
on my grave
i wont have peace of mind
i'm the hangman today
i saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
a white assassin painted black
in this garden of gethsemane
i sip the blood red wine
as restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
as the wild hunt careers through the boughs
i stand enthralled
all destroyer
darkness will hasten to devour
storming from tired centuries
there will be no act or passion wrought
and there was heaven
with wayward stars that absent marred
for sculptured lips of seraphim
basked in glory flew
like raped russian dolls
shining feriluce
was taken up as far it seemed
a marbled arc of angels
dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
i am methuselah of the tribulation
on her radiance again
promise overkill
those darkened waters spur
inscribe all names that god has left
clutching their trinket crucifix
bathed in virgin white and like the night
where the vengeful dead
lost souls begging resurrection
to masturbating with her dagger
empty
i will yield this witch to thee
that her lord at war would be cruelly slain
from crag jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
yet her beauty spun webs
for ravens winged her nightly flights
not her coven of suitors
for she swore the priest sighed
her confessional box
but there in orgiastic hell
a cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
in the sodomite's grasp
with a promise to burn
hexes six tripled their fees
flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
she feared the light
half spurned from the pulpit
i must avert mine eyes to hymns
she feared the light
when her sins were washed off
than the mirrored revelation
through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
where the witch scholared her
through the mist and marsh to where they showed
and she was a widow from god and his wrath finally
that i might pollinate the world
and i will always want
to eve i cum
the tree is plundered but i have the see
tonight in flames
assure your place in paradise here
the eastern sword must fall
sharing more than sexual excess
with the snow fallen thick
and a slip of the tongue
a girl with a pearl necklace her
so paradise
this wanton witch white rapids sister
one night of bliss i could not dismiss her
as masters to rule this flaming humanity
under cold stares of mars maligned
raise hellhounds teeth on edge
damnation under gods seeking recompense
when the needle askewed
even death paled to compare
by alighting to darker spheres
her spells upon the black count
when their eyes moonstruck met
beasts in hand from the keep
to excite the bleak advance
whilst pensive souls at zero sing
such elderly loins enflamed
yet still she seethed
empty
future is coming
rip your back out
death comes ripping
sickle constellations
soon the be kept
on your smouldering faith
the nature of the beast as revelations arrive
death is season
that the seraphim shall sing
when we've bled upon our knees
bored of vaudeville
for miss libertina grimm
though the dead always pleased her more
the final dance will be the cue
those tortured souls just like me and you
evanescent like the scent of decay
sex sex sex
empty
in black
all through red september
would your dark nails of faith
six feet deep is the incision
nymphetamine nymphetamine
than pillars of salt
i'm a prayer for your loneliness
empty
empty
licked and ransacked
at dusting ledgers of the seraphim
across his silent lips
as if her limbs imbibed his tongue
part ii
temptation bloomed found room to rise
great sacred tree
sister midnight comes blaspheming
conceived of such iniquities
i hang on every verb
going down as with the day
back to the crack of her tomb
arching toward the fabled
we were as wolves preying inside the fold
conspiracies secrecies sorceries laced
succulent succubus
before my coronation and vocal aspirations
desire the fire
that screamed of me supreme again
aeons reversed the two
a first degree murder of ravens
the abyss edge
down dark steps of history
the limpid rags of resurrection
whose kiss glittered with sleep
is a thief come after dark
the night awaits with baited thighs
the cream of mortal kind
their crystal skirts
i'll make you pray
that bleeds their borders
even a man who is pure in the heart
on the black side of the glass
sharp eyed impassive whore
like thistled ruin garbed around thy heart
impaler lord
foam flecked nightmares drag a moon
unto us that wait with patience in
in nakedness their ochre flesh
the trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
in raven feathered dress
satanic tyranny
yet all tongues are not true
mathistrises that dont give a damn
a kindred spirit in a graveyard
gothic towers tottered on her heels
to take the reins of pleasure
is a vengefull call on grace
iplintered her coffin and lay on the floor
of concern save for the aeons left
for her corset laced with arsenic
of heaven where thou didst reign and in the deeps
lips distend ending time to falter
strung where crippled vultures dare
cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
sowers of discord growing wars to reap
sunset expect
lightening freezes seven
once the forests spired
we come like drumming thunder
disintered in the writhe of the lone survivor
martin suicide notes heart strings

and frowned on the winding steps down
burning like a brand on the countenance of god
a torchlit shadow theatre souled
that fills the void with timbred pain
attune whipped trees
so i came into you sweet lady
she's just a devil woman
then i looked in those big green eyes
stay away you cunt
with evil on her mind
she's gonna get you
and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
from a dark forsaken time
as it is written damn it
as lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
dirge inferno
senates and enemy seats
and the vatican satins burn
since the covened ark
beyond her grace where love would die
thenceforth the nile reddened
of yahveh burned on in the dark
i laid my bones and made my throne
skinning mine and her firstborn
through the wilderness
of vengeful ancient breed
a black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
kisses took to fever and the fever demise
we shall flit through the shadows
thy fragrant words warm within like wine
dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
v empire
ebony dressed for sunset
all closed books on virtue
engineered by doug cook assisted by dan turner
models supplied by sugar babes bond
seven brides serve me seven sins
spurning the darkness
when brigantia spoke her soul to me
once more
to rove and rally once more
that pour
lest hope and glory are regarded as foes
trusted to keep
deflowered by the powers
disturbed though by recurring crimes
without her there
across the shifting abyss
to loose her harness
a dread thereafter
as the worms beneath rise
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
preaching peace and mercy 'neath the shadow of the knife
burning into the fire
from the cradle to enslave
in an ancient tryst with catastrophe
as devils bay concensus for the space to piss
i see the serpentine in your eyes
buried like vanquished reason
rear the tragedies
to impress on human failure
now what necrophagous second coming backs
hid the hissing of a serpent libido
and what use are prayers to that god
the darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back
this is the end of everything you have ever known
this is the end of everything
dreaming sodomies
she isnt hard to please
she fack my helpless body and she just raise the speed
she suck me to the core
just when this torture seems to end
the golden dawn
he licked the spittle from the cheeks of the wry
erased the trace and taste of bitter wines
for the shame of their crawl from grace
all sharpened claws and blunt discharge
the seduction of both woman and man
as she graced her window ledge
what wicked wonders lie within the comfines
born in a burial gown
she was found
bless foot forward and all
an orphaned gypsy nymph
of the panther's den
unloosed the chain of her god given cross
born in a burial gown
sibiliant and at last
the garden swell with terrors
borne by carnal winds
and i shall thaw this gnawing frost
set her in her rightful place
upon these earthen fields
and wounds with lips curled
when her sheets ran royalty red
too long have we skulked like drifters
praise be to the shedding of masquerades
over cemetery and sundown
we suffer from a graveless name
to rise again
my spirit bars annihilation
and dying i depart
those whores have fled to darker days
when my killing moon is risen
red the shore of a roaring sea
they will never desecrate my soul
a tourniquet of topaz
of society at court
as whipcord in the house of dog
elizabeth mysterious
and to her dead reflection
of spirits too trapped under glass to commune
a disciple of scars
inside every gate
empty
carven deep upon the church doors of the damned
we raise the stakes
beat wings on glass as thunder cracks
an inquisition outs
of gossamer shrouds
and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
surface of earth covered in rime
frigid return to the chamber of ages
the killing joke worn thin with breath
the bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
the bonesaw on the backseat
i'm hard blow my house of cards
of light where faith leads truth astray
at the blurred edges or reason 'til i was fulfilled
aah aah ahh i'll let you sleep when i am through
freeze romance where angels bare
i kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
that i must now obey
written in the dead of night
when the heavenly judge and juries
brides of old and goddesses all
i am still lovesick for mina
and though her eyes still held fire
twixt her cold silent hips i kissed
prophecies of libidinous scourge
but this is mere foreplay to war
its obsidian light
a reason to seek life again
the world unfurled at last
to the memories of a scream
as zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
only once it is dark doth my misery cease
using them all
curve of moon and haunted shore
our rites of sin
always poised on winter
we graced vomitorium
but not one word possessed
we lay in welcome by the western gate
as she weaves her witchcraft
in the samhain mist
wreathed in leaves
that makes the stars
preachers beg our clemency
i see dead stars collide
instrumental in stripping gods
riding wide astride the horns of madness
licks the royal milk
to neuter and lash her slaves
skewered like doves
gushing from a shattered silence
her laughter
perrenial the gore
seeking blood to curdle
shalt sound aloft the crashing waves
oh mr crowley did you talk with the dead
and then scattered the afterbirth
i want to know
i am nemesis
cowled in the utter grief
now i drown in a loss worth fighting for
empty
when my daughter's eyelids closed
bears a hatred for the western world
i am nemesis
black is my heart
i get frightened too
it's not so hard to understand
and i keep
empty
sometimes in the world as is you've
everything will turn out fine
weak midnight promises of love
twelth moon arose with ghostly voice
rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
dark nature clasp my soul
to rise as phoenix taloned nightly taking prey
i am he that vanquished death
nymph lascivious aphrodite
untold was the pain
come above unto me
sick and weak from my condition
i am circled like prey
christening stars
i could always find
none better
lead to the river
i faced when you left me
for once upon a time
this lust a vampyric addiction
back in the forest
christening stars
i could always find
none better
walt aldridge longacre
it's all over town
but somehow it always beats me home
just like a blue tick hound
this close to your lips right at your finger tips
this close to your lips right at your finger tips

i want the world to see
i'm in love with you honey
i want the world to see
but i kinda' feel rich when i've been with her awhile
turns all the lights down and man alive
i gave a girl a ride in my wagon
and her long legs were tanned and brown
and it's a shame i wont be passin through again
and that's all right with me
prettiest thing i ever had seen
prettiest thing i ever had seen
yeah she's the cerfold picture in a country boy's dream
for me there'd be no sunshine
girl you know how much i would miss you
the feelin good train
hear the whistle blowin 'round the bend
everybody needs a little sunshine
and this aint dodge ball in the sandlot
fit to be tied down
take me off this merry go round
had to force myself to lay it down
clean the shelves and sweep the floors
i'll carry that around for years
and cross the bridge that just wont burn
her photograph hangs by the bed
here she comes boy the one i've been talkin about
i did for her to be free
i guess i'll have to live without her
there's always a place out there
that lights up just about dark
it's a blue collar place a red blooded crowd
tonight everything's all right
'til the morning light
how can i say no
loving you could never grow old
and he wrote it on the wall
more than that i can not add
well marie is only six years old
try to put me through to her
i love you more than i can say
please tell me i gotta know
ooh i love you twice as much tomorrow
i'm gonna tell somebody
i'm gonna tell somebody
for the national working womans holiday
he's too cool neon leon
cars backed up for miles for neon leon
i'm gonna go there
but i've never been hurt this bad
i've been burned down turned down been run out of town
but the sea of love has never been this rough
in an instant it all flashed before my eyes
could of been all she wrote me
from this day on i'm gonna live my life
and not one tear came out of me
now everything's changed
and i love this feeling
empty

oh it was paradise from nine to one
oh it was paradise from nine to one
paradise from nine to one
talk a little small talk
and one more topic i wont touch
let's talk about nascars
that she went pretty well armed
with some stranger on a park bench
sometimes shes runs and i've got to trail her
she's the queen
time and time again
well we should've had a thing
for a long long time
each night you show up about a quarter to two
that in real life you're not coming back
when that old sun goes down i'll lie in wait
she dont know she's beautiful
morning comes and her hair's all a mess
she dont know she's beautiful
four years worth of near misses too numberous for me to mention
of junior steve and sunny at the gas station
shootin the bull in an old cowtown
at cars goin past
she watched and she waited
stories i tell
you can slow me down
breezes blowing
but that wouldnt do
at the end of my rope again
here i go again
sammy kershaw fornes
when you left me my world came down
so you dont see me fall apart
it's a good thing you're not around to see
there's no way that i can slip out
to see you again
is actually meant for someone else
but this time what i need is you forever lovin me
you mean so much to me
to thank her for havin
by applyin booze
and he said i'll even tell you that i love you
and he went to the desk
and he said yes i have
when the answer is goodbye
that you love for me is true
i can feel your ridicule
i keep hoping for a rerieve
vidalia vidalia
vidalia vidalia

you always gotta make me cry
and i could tell by your touch you didnt want me to
oh you and me used to be what should have been
the way that i love you
to be the father of her child
i see my future and i realize
the way that i love you
but if there's nothin between us
that's the way you want us to be
family picnic table holds all that it can hold
i'd better take just one last look before they take it all
i got my mind on you instead
never thought i'd walk the line
aint goinno where cant you see
throw away the key
but all you gotta do is look around
how far it bends before it breaks
ask that man hangin on the cross
half the night
or something bigger that's just out of our hands
but some things are meant to be
mark petersen theien
i still got her number but i cant reach her anymore
i still got her number but i cant reach her
you never strayed far from my mind
that some day i'd see you up there or somewhere
it's been a blast glad i got to know you
roll with the flow in your nine to five life
if you ever come this way again
you'll see how low a man can go
if you're gonna walk i'm gonna crawl
stood on a coast where the horizon stops
the champs elyse in the pouring rain
but when i hold you all i know is
swing that hammer beat that drum
work work work
it's a labor of love
were the pieces of her broken heart
and he sure wasnt playing no harp
you picture him dark and tall
low as he was i couldnt see him
billy mccovery crowe gibson
my friends all told me i was under her spell
hey little did i know she was wild as the bayou
look what i did to me
win some you lose some tell him that's just life
look what i did to us
look what i did to me
now i'm a lucky fellow 'cause they all try to tell her
smoother than strawberry wine
when she pours her lovin on me
she knocks me right down to my knees
strollin in her tight jeans
louisiana hot sauce
we wont let go i swear
and i'll show you how much you mean to me
i've never known love like this
i was lost so deep inside my shell
'til the day that i die
skip ewing springer
you took the dishes and the car
now one by one i'm striking them to help me forget
with empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
i'm gonna leave you
when the moment's right
oh god how i miss those days
in your arms so deep
and if her daddy hadnt come along and run me off
she was almost close enough for me to touch
couldnt change a thing
there's something between
somethin between
lovin just who you are
it's changin everything i see
right here right now's the perfect spot the perfect time
runnin down dreams runnin down dreams
she always wished that she could go to college
but she fell in love she fell in love
chorus 2
she wore a dress with cherries on it
1st chorus
they marry young in these parts
i ran as fast as i could
anything to set me free
i know i know i'm gonna have to cleanse my soul
ah but he just stands there smilin back at me
my momma she is steady as the sun
and how do you keep your feet on the ground
ooooh ooooh
how do you like that beat up car i think it's fair we traded
what became of what's her name after she spent all your money
to see my baby walking out of that
some girls like them gussied up
we'll make love by a miner's light
all mine head to tow
dont want no white collared man
dont wanna hear no alibis
show me love's what your living for
aint gonna play the crying game no more
dont point that thing at me
and left by destiny
well teased by a fake
'bout the nights when it was candlelight and wine
even now i get that empty feelin
oh what would i do now
every little kiss
or someday when times werent so tight
there's a secret in your soul
i know it wont be long
empty
if you ever walked away
you dont deserve me
and i'm about to change my mind
hey i think i have about
i wont slow down
i wont slow down
you said you didnt have very much to do
there's just something 'bout the way
and now it's soaking wet out in my backyard
if i'd rather wear your t shirt
love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams
real love and real life doesnt have to be
fallen from the tall oak tree
i'm restless
on the days i'm crawlin
the rocking horse came
i take it as it comes
can open your eyes
and i was older by a year
could you roll me roll me back in time
empty
we walk on broken ground
shattered and scarred
i love you still and i'm not afraid
they will not stray
packed up her bags and left you flat
so dont bother knockin on my door
you dug your grave now lay on back
to show me the way to your heart
think you've locked your heart away
baby you know i'll follow
now her daddy's in the kitchen starin out the window
for such a grounded girl to just up and run
empty
i get you honey if you've got the taste
i sing them rattlers off to sleep yeah
straight through the fire into the unknown
i can do for you
i dont wanna be selfish
tena clark heintz
look inside and find the part that's leading you
'cause that's the beat of a heart
oh it's the sweetest sound
and just take it easy
find ourselves a koa and sleep underneath the stars
and a tank full of gasoline
as the knot comes untied
there's memories like mountains and each one gets hard to climb
you woke me up this morning and made sweet love to me
all the hesitation falls
wrapped up inside of you is where i want to be
the river ran through howard county
it was the roughest kind of roadhouse
then the clouds rolled back and the rainbow came
'cause there's a symbol of the wrath of heaven
aint got no money
now i could worry
there's only one thing that matters
yeah there's only one thing matters
time stood still
these days seem like years
one minute i'm playing in the sandbox
i may not be from royalty
those movie stars dont have everything
and a million more to go
this old car around
but with his song he turned my life and
looks like i've got a tiger by the tail
well i'm a losing weight and a turnin mighty pale
well i'm a losing weight and a turnin mighty pale
and time wont make what's wrong alright
feeling all those memories in black and white
empty
repeat chorus
you saw floatin in my eyes
no i i dont wanna go home tonight
oh one understands the pain
should be enough to tell me
we're just beginning
there's no date on that letter unopened
you loved me enough to leave it unopened
though the words go unspoken
but please dont wave goodbye
but you're not by yourself
why should i care if you found somebody new
oh my heart was never really there
oh i didnt care enough to keep you around
oh my heart was never really there
you dont see all the tears
oh you say it's all in my head
how hard it is not to beg you to stay
there i was ten years old
no your never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
but instead of being angry
and i pray to god that when he does
lying here with you
these are the moments
yeah right here in this moment
and every prayer has been answered
no i could not ask for more
there's no place that far
if i had to run if i had to crawl
and the sunrise
and these dreams we've been chasing
oh tomorrow will keep
are you willing
and you offer love
repeat chorus
aint it funny how
good is good but could be better
it's your typical thing
of the number two door
of the number two door
i learned that from you
and i fell into that fairytale too
i'm living outside of some town i aint heard of
some dreams werent meant to come true
it was the end of all those nights
still someday i thought i'd see your face again
and even if you dont
if you ever want my lovin
it's cute the way you're actin tough
and even if you dont
i've stood more more than i should stand
imagine that aint that a laugh
well i thought the day i met you
looks like i've got a tiger by the tail
looks like i've got a tiger by the tail
let's dance while the music's feeling right
seems life is flying past
oh baby just say yes
oh hold me love me show me baby
but i know you dont see well in the dark
but i lied lied lied
dont worry about the danger
without those kid's man i aint nothin
instead of stuck out on this road i'm on
so when everything just gets to much
chorus till fade
empty
drink your beer and eat some chips
telling my heart i didnt need you
i need to know i can see your smile each morning
i cant fight what i feel anymore
i hardly ever see your face
if we find a little earth to stand on
i dont want to face tomorrow
if we find a little earth to stand on
standing at the edge of this cliff
and no one's ever found a way to stop time
and let you take me down
i search myself and everyone
adia i thought we could make it
it's easy we all falter does it matter
and it's hard at the end of the day
and the endlessness that you fear
that you make up for all that you lack
of your silent reverie
i will be your solid ground
you'll still be burning so bright
it will all be worth it
into the valleys
you and me
the shadow of death
empty
as edens sixth day now all you've been allowed
on the hills of fire the darkest hour
fear not for you're just dreaming
and all i feel is black and white
everybody loves you when you're easy
and all i feel is black and white
as the walls are closing in
'cause i want what is pleasin
the frightened and the weak
underneath the skin
but i'm gonna take a look around it though
you strut your rasta wear
and a smile that wont wash away
holding on and holding it in
just when we need one
fun for all that children call
christmas time is here
oh that we could always see
every little part of me
they're wanton for discovery
when it will only end in misery
dear god
did you make mankind after we made you
i cant believe in
that father son and holy ghost
dont tell me it's too late
where every tongue is wagging
you know i would not hesitate
conjured this temptuous rage
with apparitions of your soul
i dont know how
i do what i have to do
all the feelings they remain like a still life
our time is gone
shelter give them shelter from the coming storm
give them shelter give them shelter from the coming storm
give them shelter give them shelter from the coming storm
i am sinking
i cant help this longing
i believe
holy infant so tender and mild
son of god love's pure light
came in close i heard a voice
open doors would soon be shut
i'm never where i want to be
hey i said you can keep my things they've come to take me home
my glass is almost empty
where webs of snow are driftin
to let my life offend
i've always tried to read your eyes
i was with you on that pallet steaming
it's a strange world
holding on to nothing when there's nothing left to lose
but steady there now
that you're no good for me
you leave me here burning
the life i've left behind me
you take me in
and sweet
i would be the one to fall
on a cold winter's night that was so deep
three wise men came from country far
born is the king of israel
and with his blood mankind has bought
now are scattered on the wind
you never really tried or so it seems
funny how it seems that all i've tried to do
and fades away like morning dew
time here
i know you cant resist trying reopen a sore
and i just need a little more time
just shadows that move across the wall
until i can breathe again
until i can see again
in your sweet embrace
born of the one love that gets me so high
now with my mind i'm struggling
empty
is easier to redeem
revealing all the shame for what's been lost inside us all
but your words cut loose the fires and you left my soul to bleed
and the crowds were standing staring faceless cutting off my view
you lay down beside me then
oh i know would be the death of me
it doesnt mean that i love you any less
empty
color sky havana lake
lord kiss me once more
lord kiss me once more
this this is christ the king
joy joy for christ is born
my thoughts lead me on i only see one way
everything was beautiful
like it was meant to be
i will always love you
every hour we spent together
i lie awake and try to recall
my love
i keep this moment by and by
like we do down here
right before our eyes
the light has fallen amongst the living and the dying
bring what i am able
saving souls still the cold
and presents on the tree
heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
worshipped the beloved with a kiss
into the night
into the night
i will stare at the sun until its light doesnt blind me
into the fire
i am the spark fade
but i dont have a hold on what is real
i was looking for someone
with trembling hands she reaches up
she cradled us
longing cold and hollow
but i go blind and filled with fear
the silent stars go by
proclaim the holy birth
the dear christ enters in
i went lickety splickly
just a wishing i'd stayed a little longer
stars beginning to fade
it's just another
the birds in winter have their fling
do you want to see a miracle
ordinairy miracle today
at night as i lay sleeping they come to me in herds
a cold wind blows right through me i'm made a hollow shell
is there a way out for me
dont worry you will find the answer if you let it go
dont worry you will find the answer if you let it go
i have to take myself away from you
i already knew
until my dying day
i never felt before
memories trapped in time
just close your eyes dear
to hold you down
i follow without pride
where there is hatred let me sow love
for it is in giving that we receive
you're the one true thing i know i can believe in
you make me feel less crazy when otherwise i'd drown
put a little love in your heart
and the world will be a better place
hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
memories stirred inside of us the struggle and the fight
in the face of the blinding sun you wake only to find
the ice is thin come on dive in
you tried to move around the pain but oh
the serpent's tale has come undone you have no
they're putting up reindeer
i wish i had a river so long
i could skate away on
i made my baby say goodbye
do they fill up the emptiness
mesmerize all who are caught in the glare
please come home
this is heaven to no one else but me
i believe
to live my life the way i feel is right for me
if i choose to
and the cost was so much more than i could bear
the past could be undone
better i should know
one slip before you know it
like the face of a newborn child
but i fear i have nothing to give
theres nothing i'd like better than to fall
and i claw for solid ground
havent seen this place before
i know i can love you much better than this
and if i feel a rage i wont deny it
and if i feel a rage i wont deny it
i wont fear love
sunday is gloomy
empty
it's a hell of a long way home
dont tell me i have never been there for you
you're shaken to the bone
and i will be good to you
i hope you have fun
the world is so wrong if you want it
and what have we done if you want it
without any fear
from now on
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
you know that you're my best friend
see another day and we will praise it
i lie awake and pray
and draws each breath as if it were the last
seemed a burden that was hers alone
stretched from ear to ear
let me be the calm you seek
without you
too long
deep in the hollow of earthly desires
so silent you stole from my bed
dont let your life pass you by
i'm so tired but i cant sleep
once there was a darkness deep and endless night
weep not for the memories
better than anything else that i've tried
we twist and turn and we avoid
words to deceive me more and more
so take all this noise into your brain
i'll say a thousand words or more
i believe i'm loved when i'm completely by myself alone
i believe the only ones who disagree are millionaires
i believe you cant appreciate real love until you've been burned
find me baby
all around me i want you
like cold chardonnay chilled for a day
all around me i want you
pick up your things you're a star
never known
when the madness stops then you
do you say
you've never known
will be alone
and the groove tonight
you're never safe 'till you see the dawn
move closer passion stronger
carry on keep romancing
it's bringing me to my knees
it's bringing me to my knees
yeah i think about it all the time
i feel the magic building around you
i know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
when you feel all alone
i can mend a broken heart
let me be the one you call
you're the fire inside the man
the fever that burns in my heart
the fever that burns in my heart
i just return to my heart 'cause i know that i'll find you
you're the fire inside the man
and feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in
cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
but heartache and misery
if we cant find a way out of these problems
more than angry words i hate this silence
but lately i've been down upon my knees
now we dont live we exist
i might need you to hold me tonight
mozambique or was it veronique
imagination racing
well i dont care no i dont care
oh no cause i dont care
get away and out of this city
we dont talk much anymore
are you still the same
i know i never really treated you right
i dont recognize this place
i see my future in an instant
there's just no rhyme or reason
i am complete now that i found you
i just hold on tight
empty
is what i live for
who is swimming with a raincoat
magenta feelings take up shelter
empty
well i bet he'd be cool
well i bet he liked gaultier
'cos i wonder how we'd deal if he just passed you by
i bet my speeder bike he'd turn his back on all of that
i'd never let you down when you're in a fix
watch her mangle the truth while you take the bait
you're just a slave to the grind that she grew tired of baby
you're just turning yourself inside out for no need
just a sip of wine and you could be mine
just a twist in time and you could be mine
just a sip of wine and you could be mine
broken glass
'cause if you're making all these
can be a force you dont want
i'm floating high and my feet dont
hey baby
coffee from
i am anything i want to be
in santa monica on the boulevard
i am anything i want to be
and you wouldnt know
is love really the tragedy the way you
keep locked away from all the world
just so i could win
when superstars and cannonballs are running through your head
the wind in my hair and the sand at my feet
empty
there's a thought now you decide
frightened to believe
you and i roller coaster riding love
these are the things i would do for love
you're the best thing about me
you could be the best thing about me
ever since you've been gone
i have given mine away to a world that didnt want it anyway
to your love
but i'm standing at your doorway
i want to move in time with you
i want to feel your hand in mine
i want to breathe in rhyme with you
and daddy never keeps in touch
she cant remember a time when she felt needed
all her hopes on the stars
she packs her bags for outer space
so would you be my baby
a reason for living
i'll make a wish send it to heaven
oh can you see it baby
truly madly deeply do
pick up all the broken glass and furniture on the floor
wonder how i ever made it through
you keep moving
another ditch in the road
so delicate you cry for more
you dont know what you want
when you wake up i wont be found
for me
if there's a way that you could
and that's no lie
sway your mind and complicate you
good shot at you and me
dance to the disco dance to the disco
exploding like a supernova
in a way we're the same two people
a wound unhealing
but you can still be free
sail through the wind and rain tonight
got to see the lights up in new york city
get me to the heart of the subway
love can move you to a place inside your heart
that love can move you too child
i think i'm going insane oh yeah
got to escape
i'm movin fast
forget the past
and all the things we'd said we'd be
got to get back
the mornings arent quite as brightgot to get back
got to get back
all the things that really matter
and the letter flies away
yeah i'll fly away
aint a lot of time left to be a star
never feeling bitter
empty
every drink your downing
and if there's not to be another way
silhouetted against the sky
in his mind he was already there
a youth he thought asleep
marked blackjack guillotine
dont want to look across the waves
empty
as the tears that passed between them
and as they crashed i thought i heard them say
of cold reality
but to you i will relate
lost here in glaze
i'll tell you to die
there's nothing you can do
never ending suicide
razor sharp
leaves a stain
empty
goes for yards
in the mind awaiting its cue
empty
and the ocean said the first time was with a friend
he never thought it dangerous
the reason that i still say it
do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
my power so divine
i watch as you
to an echo in the night
and pull you back somehow
contemplating years
with the shadows seething
screams without a sound
when the souls for selling
when said please listen all
close your eyes and close the door
carries on
that waiting in the dark like destiny
is it dark when the moon is down
burn the night away
one kindness
should you chance to die
played as he stood in his trance
and have all your spirits meet
that it's your time to learnoh city beneath the surface above
total illusions of tales
i will be your mentor
we supply amusements
can tell you where we are
the right and the wrong of it
till you turn on a light
and walked back along the beach
i can no longer resist
though he tried to wipe his eyes
when the young child he looked back
as they walked out of sight
i keep them on a shelf
they're good for conversation
i'm crying crying for your love
i'm crying crying for your love
till it took him down
hanging round
there are certain things we cant explain
taste me i'll taste you
tied up she gets wild
skull session
it seems i just dont see
never even tried
instead of to statues
for surely you must care
and so i pled my case
he never closed his eyes
watching waiting
old man tell me what have we become
old man tell me what have we become
empty
run away no delay do we have to show you
empty
wake every morning
another drink another fight
am i losing my way
and rides into the night
i dont know why
behind a thin disguise
i've been a runner
red eyes sunken and stark
somewhere they seek the day
these streets
while the streets glisten
she's got a hot look
empty
stuck on you
stuck on you
boy you aint seen nothin yet
dont talk it over
twist your mind then let it go
mixed with whiskey
of concrete and terror
victims of my pain
prisoner in hell
i live like the dead
telling you your dreams
telling you your dreams
he's traded his life for a glass full of tears
runaway reasons
runaway seasons
in the desert look for water
and he
could you grant this last illusion
could you keep our lives together
then placed sand from the beach inside
did you ever really want to
the hourglass no longer sits by the ocean
and their boat had reached the shore
until that captain had been caged
with their journey at an end
and waded to the shore
is born you see
or youthful king
you know they brought me down
shouldnt play with fire
straight to you
well it's overdue yeah
they cut
and leave your rage
i believe your love for life
that's the price you pay
dear god
and i hear
do you think it's wise
i believe what the prophets said
in a world of ignorance
dont hear it
and felt his world collapsing
and though he spoke little english
for miguel was held as a refugee
and i wonder what the captain thinks
and like the old sailor before him
so come i'll draw the line and you just pick your side
he wonders if his neighbors might be leavingso he makes a little offer that they'll understand
i am the word without deeds the lie that exceeds
all i really need right now is you
somewhere on that long empty road
what would still remain of me
been searching for years
can you hear me call your name
the tears in my eyes
is where i'll be
sellin nickel candies
things got really strange
on your late night radio waves
jesus saves
i'm a fool inside
bodies touching heart to heart
i died lady in disguise
i look beyond her crystal eyes
are you the woman i can trust
instrumental no lyrics
are growing every day
cry out
join your hands and pray
shatter the darkest lights
can i hear your battle cry yeah
runnin 'gainst the devil
keeps you in a collar
sonic blast right through their ears
life trapped inside a maze
a pleasure victim of pain
why did they send him away
doused the cat with gasoline
cant be held by any cage
a digital clone
soldiers of satan
midas knight
and the moment is undone
always calling
in the distance
and the morning's a distant fear
or could i be the only one
i have waited this way
and perhaps it's a better world
no no time doesnt wait for you
cant take it away with you
watching in silence i hesitate it was not in the plans
we placed our years in the hourglass they were never unearned
empty
you cant make promises all based upon tomorrow
empty
nighttime again
but no one seems to be around
'cause in the dark the strange come out
safely unknown
if there always seen
for all those moments of yesterday
and there'd be no redemption
i saw it too
there's no one to pray for me now
and the ocean never said a word
i have run between the dragons teeth
and though it seems i still have time left
that maps my every breath
well out of sight of land
on my life i've closed every door
she once more disagreed
the needs or wants of men
empty
stands all alone you see
and far more rarely wise
as he stood near a rusting dock
i'm bound in your luscious chains
for such an action
broken broken heart at the seams
i tried suicide
away from all that we should meet
he had sailed her round the world
and when he tried to close his eyes
and his lungs had screamed breathe deep
and say this thing it cannot be
and stared out across the sea
a thousand steps to her arms
she tells me of a better life
she's unusual
your name
starts to tire
eyes begin to stare
visions of the fighting past
watching night turn into day
one more pointless battle
warriors warriors
warriors warriors
washed out washed out
washed out washed out
in the dark
is there a trick to the art of not feeling
christ has risen
on a tv mounted on the wall
that in your life
the jester drinks and starts to think
empty
a well worn hourglass
he had no mountains left to climband his last name was magellan
and all of them but eight
but every wish is not to be
but it did not matter what she was
he could not find the words to say
where's the light turn then on again
and read the credits from a different view
one more time for me my friend
to the lure of a night
cause in the dark
no you know you want her now
white witch white witch
controlling all that you say and you do
taking control
your whole life's a complete disaster
white witch white witch
the only time you're satisfied
love in a peaceful world
i know know
when you're skating on ice too thin to take it
when you're skating on ice too thin to take it
is your heart harder
empty
do you say your prayers
is the cut flower no longer alive
the creeping madness that was his other self
standing in the shadow's
the change has taken place
the one you shouldnt make
evil soul
on her way through the night airget away
on her way through the night air
on the sea
hungry for man tonight
you're approaching the island of thesirens
whoa till they're gone
baby baby gonna come inside yeah yeah
give a kiss and a squeeze
the whip is gonna get you
everyday i feel the tears that you'd weep
looking out of my lonely room
so well disguised
and in the dark it all unwinds
lost unknown
all alone
better buy 'em now or you'll wish that you did
swing a deal on the side
empty
doesnt matter anyway
that one by one we let slip away
and so we end the chapter
you will never fade away
dont ever let it get you down no
we will never fade away
what you had in store
the modern tv guide
dont need no politicians
empty
stare back at that screen
that's where we might find the truth
it's just a mystery to the mind yeahthe fountain of youth
i saw the vision of a face
future's looking good
got to belong
just a throw away but somebody's daughter
ghost in the ruins
i know
a concrete paradise
balanced on their knives
the jester takes his bows
to a distant fading light
lost inside
his towers of stone
stay close by my side
oh yeah
who prays he's never found
up at heaven
and the soul cries out
and the soul cries out
and i use it like a moat
like a slow moving train
i've been looking for you
i like when we move faster
hard for your lovin i'm
i've been wanting you to
i am hard for you love tonight
here among the souls no longer living
and carve that stone
they march through the battle fields
are you for the night
from the shelters i hear you cry
are you by the night
through the bitter rain and cold
hunt you down
and i've seen
light that cut so bright they make you bleed
never follow trends if they turn on your friends
dont believe in shooting stars
dont turn your back
taking up slack
just a hardcore dancer
you got lybia you got the russians
every country's got the bomb
of rage and war 4 times
searchlight on my trail i hear the sirens wail
i will not go back i'm still on the run
how could you break my heartwalking down the avenues
empty
just stepped back and watched the slide
no one leaves
bits of dreams all in a line
and the horses never tell
and when he had that time
but somewhere in your heart you know you
all throughout the ride
an old waterlogged wreath
and from another's grave
of a woman who showed no fear
they never felt the pain
moving with a swiftness
raise the fist of the metal child
power of the night
screaming twisting banging
power of the night
people walking over me turn to me at the store
rage rage rage rage
but you've really pushed me way too far
so please dont turn away
and dt thought of dying
sammy's gonna up the odds
his face was clenched in hatred
there's a church aside one corner most believe was always there
you start to feel sick by the thought of becomin dead
how his alley resembles the morgue
no no no
no she's in love
no she's in love
driving me wild
killer lady child
killer lady child
my baby's right beside me
and the world by the tail
we really got it made
pulled up in the yard
of rebar and concrete
till my best pal ran off with my best girl
cause i never had a more solid friend
man i could use a new guitar
empty
you set your sights like a loaded gun
to play a different tune
so young so green so blue so bold
would not be home till after five
she said your not the man you used to be
and still confused
i thought i could handle anything
these days i wanna kick 'em around
fame and fortune i can take or leave
i cant get over how i'm all wound up
which inspire your heavenly song
gloria sweetly singing o'er the plains
empty
but what gave them the right
in four years the smoke had cleared
now some of them boys were friends of mine
and she keeps on goin even when the heartache's growin strong
they tried to lose us in the hype of fortune and fame
leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
just leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
just leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
there aint no moonlight drive in here
it hasnt been easy letting you go
he set his mind talkin about elvis lookin like james dean
playin blue blue denim soul
blue blue denim soul
i look in your eyes and all i see
love's an addiction love survives
put it back together friday night
my baby drives a buick
aint the way i go around gettin my trills 'cause
is all that i have always enough
your lookin lonely
the night of all nights
nowhere to go but i keep walking anyway
i miss every time your gone for five minutes
if it's spring fall hot cold
something's going on in bethlehem
oh what a night in bethlehem
and oh what a night
and once again i'll hide 'em like i've done those times before
have been thrown out the door
that have done a lot of walkin through a lot of bad blues
old photographs bring back sweet memories
you can wind up empty handed at the altar all alone
she was talking crazy but her heart was making sense
ninety to nothin towards town
but leavin was to far to go
on the outskirts of town
on the outskirts of town
what's goin on inside her head that makes her look that way
empty
but by the way she's walkin
i threw a curve
it aint hard to tell on a carousel
but me and tin man want to know
six days on the road and i'm gonna make it home tonight
my rigs a little old but that dont mean she's slow
well it's on tv so it must be so
he said the reason why were made that way
talking about a radio talk show
she turned up her nose as she walked by my cadillac
aw but some girls do
empty
before you ever see
i just wish i knew how long it'll be
i just wish i knew how long it'll be
seems awfully far from home
there are times i have shined
like you're gonna fly
keep you babblin 'til the break of day
there's no good bye
we really did it this time
turns out too good to be true
i've got to look out my backdoor
you keep me in the middle
and i'm left here in between
and half a heart to go
hallelujah he is christ the lord
and from that night until this day we sing
out of bed hit the floor a cup of coffee and hit the door
you punch a clock you do the job you pull the lever and turn the knob
livin in a hard hard world
baby it's a hard hard world
or is it the lies i told it's hard to say
in a manger filled with hay
he sent a carpenter
and told him that his job was done
i've got the sense to get out of the rain
if you play other hearts there in your hand
am i to late for old lullabies
and feel it calling out my name
life never gave us time to settle down
all those one night stands between dallas and new orleans
like so many have done before
i got the sweetest promise there has ever been
'till i dont want 'till i dont want no more
i got the sweetest promise there has ever been
it's a good life i'm livin
who walks and talks like you know who
i need a girlfriend
all i really want
talking heads talking to us on the television
1 900 look into a crystal
you cry for help and nobody listens
wonder how it started
we forget sometimes just why it is we do them
again and again make no mistake
it's easier to invent the wheel
our finest gifts we bring pa rum pa pum pum
baby jesus pa rum pa pum pum
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
oh little town
empty
her heart cant help but break
i know exactly how lucky i am
thank god for you
the devil for the trouble that i get into
empty
but we sure do remember them well
and if i ever get the chance
here in the middle of the middle west
i'll never go down easy
i feel tears wellin up cold deep inside
and here comes pride in the backstreatch
and how i lived in fear of waking up each morning
my tears are holdin back
looked out at the school bus and his little man and said
down our long dusty driveway
and his mind was wandering
was it the lightning on the water
i could've walked away
she thinks if only he could see her now
where hearts dont touch and ends dont meet
the girls from work are going out tonight
expectation was a none too great
and they dance and they dance
cowboys and cowgirls just for show
there's trouble on the line
i wont have a choice
lordy i've been denied
dancin with a new shoe
cause it aint love 'til twist comes to shout
when you run from love
when you run from love
some things just come when it's christmas time
no bedtime stories just questions instead
that it's right where you are
empty
where was i when you stopped lovin me
when did i become history
everything that i have or can do
at the cafe down on the corner
at the cafe down on the corner
with a lost look on his face
with a lost look on their face
glory to you the king
no heart should be without joy
glory to you the king
it was a lo loco motive
even if it were a bull she would have rode it
even if it were a bull she would have rode it
beside the still water
i can feel you hand gently lead me home
can you hear it when i shout it loud
can you hear me now
it really isnt such a meticulous thing
can you hear me now
you made me a link in the chain of love
out shopping with the women
and they even get along in the legislature
i wish it was christmas all year long
and one around the table holdin hands and sayin grace
some are green and some are golden
may they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
may they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
dont stop coming back baby
you say that you're leaving
come back baby
you can call me any ole time
'cause eye to eye you know we never could see
we did it for love
she did it for satisfaction
defendin the land of the free
we did it for satisfaction
i'll take the dirt road it's all i know
you better make real sure you're headed the right way
where we'll stop it's hard to say
empty
i'll go anywhere
it dont matter when we get back
rain on the wind
i remember again how you squeezed my hand
every little thing
gonna find us a preacher gonna find you a ring
this much i know for sure
got a chevy impala vintage '73
we dont go to extremes
if i acted much higher
tomorrow's so cloudy
thinkin love can make it grow
he's tryin to pull a livin out of that old hard ground
i could not repay in one lifetime
i'd cultivate the valley and the hill
lord i'm wearing out my shoes
it's like trying to build a fire in the rain
we got a 747 coming down in the night there's a 747 goin into the night
strangers in the night lost on separate flights
we cant see a thing here in the night strangers in the night
we were strangers in the night
life for you has just began that's what he said
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good
money rules the game
at the altar of the gods
reflected in the city
are there clouds up in the sky
we sat in the sun woah oh oh
and the bands played on
nothin can stop us breakin through
we're back we're back on our feet again
we're reaching for the skywe're back on the streets again
we're back we're back on the streets again
they like to rock 'n roll
just give me more cant get enough cant get enough
twenty thousand voices screaming
take the eagle from the sky
can you hear the thunder rolling
welcome to the nightmare
can you see the people
the seeds of war are sown
to meet the fearless clansmen
let me hear
let me hear
im on my way im coming home
keeping it together blasting my way home
'cause on this night the blood will flow
you know that your time has come
keep out of sightyou never see him out in the sunlight
bloodletter bloodletter
empty
where are they now
the broken heroes
seven lonely graves on goose green
repeat to end
bring the glory down on you
feel the heat start the burn
you're turning all the young boys on
calling you tonight
run with the pack
you know you're dressed to kill
it's the call of the wild
that took him down
searching for the harvest from the deep
my father was a working man
we're living in the calm before the storm
another face
she's gonna tear me apart
gypsy woman on my mind
another city
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
on thru' the night
we're here to set the spirit free
excitement in the hall
the spotlight takes the final bow

originally performed by sweet

the connoisseur of rhythm rock 'n roll and swing
solid ball of rock
they're gonna have to reckon with the chilling hand of death
emma stands alone tonight
what happened to the dreams she had
no one to blame
she was a victim of her heart
moved slowly out to sea
for god sakes save your souls

and placed the lonely flag

to the happy hunting grounds

let the healer take your hand
they'll be coming in the morning boys

you gotta hold the line
when stories are told
keep your powder dry

the time has come
like grains of sand that slip through your hand

my pulse is racing i'm out of control
i cant wait a minute longer
every second the feeling's stronger
i'm waiting
my mind is drifting thinking of you
they rape and they slaughter
warrior came warrior saw warrior conquered

they rape and they slaughter
warrior came warrior saw warrior conquered
and the dark is dark
they tell us there's no cover up
waiting for you
i long to be there with you
i've been watching
pick yourself up off the floor
but it's never you
battered and torn
believe in yourself stand tall
we didnt come for their gold
we didnt come for their lies
we didnt come for bureaucracy
we came here to rock
she's got wheels of steel

something i have never seen before
woah oh oh oh oh oh shining in the sky

the one who tolls the bell
the nazarene will come
up the eastern seaboard destination portland maine
they couldnt stand the heatwave but we just kept rollin on
on our journey 'cross the states
we rode the silver eagle right across the usa
repeat to end

making stupid gestures nothing much to say
we're not listening to the ministry

there's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you down
they'll never stop the music they're living in the past

to the power and the glory
i'm fighting for freedom i'm safe i've got god on my side
to the power and the glory
ninety tons of thunder
iron striking metal

you're waiting for your piece of meat
confrontation was your weakness
cut out the disease
on demolition alley
hes looking down the barrel of that twelve gauge gun
brought us all together
brought us all together
brought us all together
brought us all together
heart of stone cold as ice
i feel your power in my soul
see the devil the devil ride out
see the devil ride out
she's a devil see the devil ride out waaaahhh
somewhere in the night
and the feeling goes on and on and on
yes i'll do it all for you
dogs of war
the down becomes an empty shell come and spend a day in hell
im packing my bags i aint gonna stay
dont worry about me
we shouldnt forget what we learnt from the past
when the missiles start to fly
from the radiation flare
it's the end of our planet
to die to die to die
how many more children
comes with the bomb
gonna try and burn you out
i want it so bad
fu fu fu fucking freeway mad
i'll take you to the edge
are you standing on your seat
we're gonna shout let it roll
we're gonna shout let it rock
then billy came along and sang his rebel song
surviving together
empty
would she see in him something to belive in
i was a stranger
i'm trying hard girl
i cant wait anymore
i cant wait anymore
is there any wonder
gotta swing it to the front
i'll do anything that you want me to
i got it real bad
remember the screams of the jericho siren
attack your city going to fall
attack your city going to fall
there's no more denying
in a midnight blue lagoon
10 light years away to change it all
close your eyes and it will crush you
baby 321
weepin gently in my soul
are you ready to rock
cause the world's gonna stop
we're fallin down from the top
are you ready to rock
i wish this night could last forever
a moment in a million years
i leave you all behind
a moment that i wont forget
behind my driving wheel world seems fine
god that's me and my life
because the limit is the sky
is not the way that i can take
break the ice but never break
the night's exploding everywhere
your future wont see the light of the day
death is just a moment away
and whatever you do there's no way out
they pray for eternal damnation
all night long
lyricsklaus meine
miss you where i've been
you get me loose
make love to me right now
lyricsherman rarebell
i want hot love you know and i need it now
loved it more than any drug i couldnt stand it
i dream with open eyes
that we can burn the sky
suddenly out of nowhere
are you the one
just out of sight
and that's alright
she got me high and loose loose loose
if you feel that life's passing by passing by
ends up in new frustrations
es el morro de los negros la mansion
aunque no tenga capilla reza la gente sencilla
jealous hearts are deep oh so deep
jealous hearts are red so dark red
who's sitting on a cloud
wherever i go wherever i go
is made to lose control
is the game i'm looking for
until your love will flow
is the heartbeat of my soul
and i say oooh oooh
it's reality this is a robot scene what we live in
and i say oooh oooh
it's early morning
so give her inches
desire is coming
he's licking his lips
i hear your machine just coming round the block
bad girls keep a coming showing all the rest
rock zone
you know that love
be a rubber fucker
hey baby
whatever does it
just like no other
be a rubber fucker
close your eyes and your will find
here i am
close your eyes and your will find
in every corner of my memory
just love me forever
as i walk in the pouring rain
when i take a walk outside
just love me forever
empty
the way she's coming down the stairs
with nothing but the radio on
if you had candy once before
she's knocking at my door
heading for a nervous breakdown
corrupt politicians
the ship of fools
the ship of fools
keeps on following the sirens call
dont ever go
i should have known
dont ever go
everybody knows
growing up to be the sunshine of my life
sly my joy and my pride
the tears away
a part of me died
someday is now
to get up and do it again
all my tomorrows no sadness no sorrow
lyricsklaus meine mark hudson
if i have to crawl an extra mile
dont fight it honey you just cant win
i need a girl like you
would you hold me close if i was in the cold
would you love me for what i am
the wall in the room where you live
you like alice cooper
you live in his heart
speedy's coming
another place
as bad as you have been
to be away from you
you take a piece of me of me
empty
gotta know what's your size
you aint never caught a rabbit
and it's a nightmare
you better shut your mouth
child stay down stay down
all you gotta do is stay down
you better run for cover underground
it's time to say goodbye
and you dont see it
be on your way
you're a needle in the hay
in your eyes i'm staring at the end of time
now you gotta deal with it
the sun comes out
and feed her well
it breaks out loud
he's ready to win
i feel hot and cold
i think it's love
i cant explain
i know what it means but
she drive me out of my mind cant explain
in my hot brand new car
born in a gucci store
but the tears wouldnt come
are pretty good fun
that was never there
that was never there
yes i'm leaving you
i cant stay
shouldnt feel so blue when i'm gone
dreaming a dream of a world that's lovely and true
and i try
hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
i close my eyes
i wanna try to stop this life
in the night there is
shadows in the night
let me walk let me walk in your heart
obligator came and said to me
testament government
'cause i'm nowhere in the darkness of these days
in the darkness of these days
but i dont care
you're spoilin my art
hey hey hey dont you wanna see
you may got the money
i'm not your steppin stone
so leave my life alone
you're feeling high and low but you dont know what to think
if you feel humility for something that is true
kami o shin jiru
and all we gonna do
on streets we call the zoo
make our dreams come true
i see the world and i see all the people
to see my world and all it skits on ice
so many things dont you care
i'll tell you about the story of love
forever love everyday
dont wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
this time
my mind is on the run
empty
tomorrow aint no stranger
i've been trying all my life
what was meant to be forever
they're days that make you fly
they're days you wanna die
you gotta draw the line
as life goes round 'n round
goodbye yesterday
i dont wanna come in a second
isnt it fun fun fun to be number one
and in the evening when i come home
he's a vip wannabe all he ever wants is
isnt it fun fun fun to be number one
to be number one
you can trash our love
you can play your games
there's no cure for love that kills
but my desire for you is much too strong
i would go through the darkest hell
is spinning in your head in your head
in the jungle of these times
the world gets really tough
cant you see the end
i saw a mother
fading shadows one by one
then why why cant we live as one
then why why cant we live as one
unholy alliance
how can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday
lyricsulrich roth
you're a demons desire
you're a demons desire
you're a demons desire
you'll lose the game like this
which you can only cross with love
the air we breath and the starts we see
the tears we cry the joy we share
we dont own the world we dont own the world
take it easy life goes on
hey little donna
understand that we are mush too young to die
understand that we are mush too young to die
i was drowning in a feeling
i need your love every minute
without you
you'd like a holiday
you'd like a holiday
longing for the sun you will come
it feels alright
she wants to be free
good girls get their kicks after six
all the things that make a good girl bad
trying to understand
you were once a friend to me
crashes before you can say
i will re write history
to you it's just a game
you were once a friend to me
last night i went to kill
please wont you take me down
back in my favorite booth
underneath you spell
goin down nightmare avenue
big time in paris
hot shot in dallas
restless nights
to take the one and only road i know
the new heavy steamrock style
steamrock fever thrilling rock believers
and they will begin
and it will be alright listen
to get the same thrill like rock'n roll
lyricsklaus meine
hey you are you ready for tonight
can you feel me now
and now you leave me
you now desert me
when i get older
lyricsklaus meine herman rarebell
night after night
day after day
we get pushed and shoved from every side

i know that you're ready to take it to the other side
love will keep us alive
a lovedrive just one desire love
a lovedrive just one desire love
sweet love you drive me crazy babe

so tell me is it true right or wrong
the innocence is gone

you can always trust your inner feelings
make it real not fantasy
make it real not fantasy
you will see if from a different angle
maybe i maybe you
all you need is to hear

why dont we make if true
we cant escape the media overkill
lyricsklaus meine
hear me calling

dont use your fist use your brain
dont use your fist use your brain
it makes our heart just freeze
mind power every hour any minute every day
dont use your fist use your brain
mind power
could i fly away like a bird in the sky
a moment of glory called evolution
moment of glory
you play a dangerous game
all you want is money and fame
but here i am i'm back
it has been way too long
my heart is beating fast
you'd never let me down in my city
this moment in time
i follow her blind
empty
i want your mind to lock in
how many generations will it take
the shuttle broke into a million pieces
you are the only ones
you are the only ones who can make a change
close to you back in your arms
'cause in front of the old fireplace is warm
let me take you back again
haru kourou no hana no en
i dream about the summer days
i see the stars they're miles and miles away
i see the stars they're miles and miles away
i'm lost
yeah well you know
what happened was it's waiting that you're falling in disgrace
around around around around
around around around around
around around around life goes around
for the time to stand still
to the ones that we love
'cause life is too short
i will try to catch a star
'cause life is too short
silence becomes your friend
you remember your morning flow into the endless sea
life's like a sea without end
nothing really looks pretty
in the house of darkness
living and dying
a better place to live
i'm living for today
learn to forgive
whatever it will take
whatever it will take
the world is not the same
bringin it back all so clear
i follow you steps in the snow
as i learn they're there
now i've had enough
havin me some fun tonight
ye e e eh baby
gonna have some fun tonight
in search of light
time's passing by and i
empty
bearing our souls in the light of the flame
and now i wonder why
living for what hasnt happened yet
roller coaster flies oft the track
simple survival
feel the vibration
she played a game
cant ask you out
love is
oh was so cute
i wanna touch you
love is
live your dreams before they're gone
come away come away come away
take me higher always higher
i cant wait for the nights with you
ooh babe i just need you like never before
i just wanna be loved by you
you get it together you can get it all
no pain no gain
no pain no gain
it's gonna be wild
empty
no one holds me back
and i just miss those days
in my life
and no matter what i do i cant get you off my mind
i just want this night to last forever
so many good times that i recall
the one who saved me's been always you yeah
it's only you who can forgive
it's no one else it's only you
i want you to stay only with me
so when i'm back home
when you've done a good show
it's like a schizophrenic dream
and when i go away
do the best that i can as you know
nothing is real
dont be so serious oh nooo
and dont you ever stop messing around over the top
it's time to get wild
and dont you ever stop messing around over the top
you're running me down
it's thicker than blood
any time
aint worth a dime
till the day that we die
the day will come
any time
i always take the chance to win
i cant stop the wheel
dont you need some love tonight
in a crystal ball
begins to flow
i've been around the world
total satisfaction
reelin and rockin
tease me
please me
seem to be turning round
my nightmares are gone
the nights at the pole've been
lyrics klaus meine
you last resistant chiller
priscilla oh priscilla
you're gonna be everywhere
you're gonna lose and win
i never walked on the narrow path
shoot me up baby make me high
cause i was raised on rock
good times bad times
remember the good times
we had elvis janis marilyn
back in the cold war
remembering my life your life
i will be there i will be there
if we'd go again
to trust in my love again
that i cant get through
this cant be the end
i will be there i will be there
the things that killed our love
just shouldnt be thrown away
if we'd go again
i'm still loving you
here comes another show
here comes another show
just like a whisper there's a voice
just like a whisper there's a voice
ooh cause no one else but you
keep rockin mother earth
yeah well i'd like to tell you something now
it's made forever
lyricsklaus meine
show me the white rolls royce in the rain
show me the white rolls royce in the rain
in dollars and cents in high heel shoes
cant you see it's so hard honey
taxman woman i keep running
i've been around the world
total satisfaction
reelin and rockin
tease me
please me
that we've only just begun
take my hand the best is yet to come
through the highs and lows
oh can you feel it in the air
i know you know
na na na na
and all the things you've done to me
the cross i'm bearing
to play your wicked games
you became my god
to play your wicked game
nothing's stopping you and i
i've been dying inside
baby try to hold on
tell me why i'm alone
the time has come
and never let 'em drag us down
by the prey
we live and die
we're on a one way street
you wake up
that your father said
in god we trust
sounds of breaking steel
the flame will burn forever
the only king of rock has gone
the riot of your time
the hits from 1994 electric fire
when your electric plays
they're the ones who will reign
made out of mire
out in the streets
tie you up and you cant get away
spinning webs and make you pray
get out of their way
just one more night and the devils got my soul
i cant stop falling down
and the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
but it's more like looking out for something
maybe tonight
i realize i missed a day
dont want to find out
i grab my things and make my run
empty
i promised i'd be there
if your blood is too hot rock with me
stand up and rock with me
it takes power to walk on
lt takes power to walk on
this journey is going an forever
doing it now or never
steal the time take a song and be glad
they are everyday for awhile
they are everyday for awhile
to be a song just for your feeling
where is the love to melt that heart of stone
together we will drink the wine of sky
i remember what you said
and i step outside the door step outside the door
there's nothin else that we have got
i'm not the best but the best for you
can you feel it love is waiting there
can you feel it love is waiting there
can you feel it love is waiting there
move you legs stamp your feet
we cant get enough
cant live cant live without you
cant live cant live without you
cant live cant live without you
a different life and whisky cola
and you like the rock'nroller
where there's no hate
the only future we've got
that we need to fill our hearts with love again
that we need to fill our hearts with love again
dream we're going out on stage it feels like
there's no place too far that we wouldnt go
coming home
i'm so sick of it all
man we better start soon
we all live in a crazy crazy world
we dont need them no more
with hate and bloody games
sweet little child
your mother denies
what he wants from you tonight
will remain in the dark
what he wants from you tonight
will remain in the dark
sitting alone in the doghouse
sitting alone by my window
dark lady
that takes me up light years higher
lyricsklaus meine
mon destin inscrit en toi
the innocent wont feel the judgement day
is this world out of control
does anyone know
i'm confused by what i hear
how to make me feel
how to make me feel
out for a thrill
i was too wasted to see
she knows the game
she'll take you there
and you get burned by the heat
she'll tell you everything but dont believe her
but dont believe her
she didnt wanna know what i'd got to say
oh no dont make no promises
the wind is blowing straight into your face
your will has got the power that wont break
lyricsulrich roth
shine on all night long
shine on all night long all night long
some days are drifting haze
shine on shine on sun
who's gonna plug your ears when you scream
lyrics klaus meine matthias jabs james kottak
gotta know what's your size
durch fleisch und blut through flesh and blood
nur um mich zu amsier'n only around me to have fun
du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn you are so nasty and yet so fine
dust in the wind
it slips away
lyricsklaus meine herman rarebell
empty
i'll get you off the ground
give ya all my size
empty
we're scared to death once again
on the edge of time
keep on dancing tonight
on the edge of time
look at the golden chalice
wind is telling you the truth
i will see you again
when you came home the war was over
a day in life to say i love you
i'm falling in love
i'm falling in love
too much hate too much hate
time is gone it is gone
far away far away
fly people fly
see the rainbow in the sun
fly to the sky
where the sun is shining in the night
sun in the sky made the world fly into time
i've seen the giant city of atlantis
far away in chillness bleak unseen
crashed down lost in wango tango land
exit is the door that i cant find
got no diamonds rings
i just wanna see 'em walk all over me
i just wanna see you crawl all over me
it's just i hate to be nice
well she's a she's a she's a
paints his fingers yellow blue and red
you'll keep shining in my life
it stays alive forever
long as you're here in my heart
here in my heart
a wave of joy and sadness fills the room
to wake up from the dream of your life
you find the strength for a smile
cool like a cat like crazy clean
i'm feeling head uptight so i have to stay
lyricsklaus meine herman rarebell
you're driving me wild
hey you daddy wants you back home
to be your lover
the prettiest green eyes anywhere
though i smiled the tears inside were a burning
lyricsherman rarebell klaus meine jim vallance
cant you see i'm much too young to die
cant you see i'm much too young to die
cant you see i'm much too young to die
you'd like a holiday
on the island many miles away from home
you've always known
but you've shown me
alright have it your way
alright woman i'll get out of your sight
to carry on forever after
and with the wind we'll rise above to higher things
you and i
you and i
you and i
angels on fire
angels on fire
heaven and hell will be burning tonight
we will rise again
wants you back again
heart heart heart
there is a voice in my head
we'll burn the sky
running to be free
take my heart take my soul
and all you gotta do is let it go
so take my love just because it's all i have
when love kills love
i dont look back in anger anymore
when love kills love
it's cutting through so deep
when love kills love
i go to see the place once more
'cause the place seems still alive
you give me the feel i've been looking for
it took my breath away
cause you are the one i've been waiting for
into my heart
when you came into my life
lyrics klaus meine
the house's still standing
this industrial city
you find me
you find me where the river flows
you find me
there's no milk and honey here
that hope will not die
white dove
na na na na
makes us feel better now
fly with the wind
na na na na na
this sunday morning yeah
and her l l love turns a man insane
she's a wild child she's a wild child
and the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
que fueramos tu y yo hermanos
antiguas calles del pasado
donde los sueos de los nios cambiarn
donde los nios del maana soarn
an august summer night
on a glory night
on a glory night
for peace of mind
in the wind of change
but when no one is listening
reachin out
i wanna know who the hell am i
do you remember all those fears
in the temple of gods
wouldnt it be nice hold on
wouldnt it be nice hold on
take me away to somewhere
take me away to somewhere
to a new exciting life
i'm so curious for more just like never before
i love you girl i always will
you and i were just made
there's something in your eyes is this love at first sight
i lose control dont look at me like this
time stands still when the days of innocence
lyricsherman rarebell
you give me all i need
i need you so
and you'll see it's you
cause when you know the love is gone
i'll change this stupid ending
my mind my mind
it's killing me to know
he's by your side you know
and you're not alone you're not alone
what's behind this sudden tenderness
can you feel
you're lovin me to death
you make me wanna scream
you played me like a toy
alice said have you forgotten what will be
until the twilight fades
get away
said you better stay
'fore i lose my mind
try to put it back together
i watch the shadows fall across the floor
through cruel hallways
lights in the barriers
feel it slipping every day
where do you stand when it's all over
i guess that you dont care about it nowwhere do you stand when it's all over
truth less little town
unconquered and unreal
fill your head with everything you find
count the miles before they pass you by
can we go back to the moments that we held before
there's things you wont believe
should i stay or should i hide
changing memories they fade away
of empty promises in a lonesome town
heard it on the wings that you're going to die
i'd never seen your face i'm here
when you walked into the room
one touch leaves a mark upon the hand
dont you hide in the ashes
'cause i know what's coming then
i see it coming my way run
and let us know
until your destinies dissolve
certain keys were held until they must have let you go
and i know they're just repeating
and now i cant come back
but i know they're just repeating
i walk in cold rain
with some experience we'll go
days within a glass cube
anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
i've seen what you've never seen
i've left what you'd never leave
but now i can repeat 2x's
the girl behind the mask
never been in a dream where she could seethe girl behind the mask
if i get back to her i'd walk away into the forest
walking down a different kind of plain
can you reach my hand
why dont you close your eyes
the sound of the ocean destroys the silence
on the pathway
well your eyes are out of my soul cold and tired
where a million images are spun to just one
eyes to the sun
getting high alone
hands of the clock stand where i have to walk
everything inside is burningwater so cool that its thoughts seem to soothe
what are you gonna do
the house is dark and everybody's happythe time for light is over
never said
lies in the coming light
she lies to no one
i walked past you all your life
i've been down so many roads
i've been down so many roads
if you pass me in the square
everybody wants to sleep but
ah ah ah
remember i'm the only one who only had that dream
cos you're this dream i'm hanging' on
i see the green beyond the blue
cos you're this dream i'm hanging on same as first
until i'm gone you're sure to cry some more
i think it's time for you to go
troubled times and worry
turn your head away
drawing breath in from thin air
walk through to this sideyeah music's coming down
push against the wooden table
it's a nail into the cracking ice
you never know where the twain shall meet
drop the feathers you will never fly
crawling like a wounded child
late last night and early this morning
try to wait for the sky to fall
oh my mind
if you'll only look into yourself
reflect the best come back to me
everything i got and it's hung me on the line
shine your lonely light on me
that's what i said
and get lost in your eyes
cause my mind is racing and i just wanna stay
in the desert wind i would have a grin
empty
an unspoken claim
hardly time for one last look
the one that's deep inside of me
gonna turn the only key
holding onto a world that changed
waiting here
i know way that you creep and crawl
blood red rain on the window pane
ivy on the wall
and a little water
something's going wrong inside
something's gone wrong inside
nowhere is the soul i felt
nothing left of innocence
and when you think the suns gone dead
lines are forming circling round my eyes
we're going nowhere so much faster
disappear i'm just a ghost left over from another day
lost in thoughts of a lonely girl
i'm wanting her still
the candle burnt
take a minute 'till i'm wide awake
and i dont know why
well could i reach you in the morning lightif i closed my eyes
now that we've run this road so many times
tonight i cannot see a thing
did you hear the distant cry
there's a rider that's fallen and
and it's taken us somewhere
the kiss of light upon the stairs
and i'm a stranger now but i just dont know it
'take it from me' they said
ten thousand miles and everyone's mistaken
once more alone you'll never let it showall the while you've been sleeping
look where you've been
in the land where we must speak every one of us will roam
dont wake up and scream in fright
this is moving too far
ride it out in the hopelessness now you'll understand
in the direction of the sun
screaming like the way i hear an angel sing
my invisible lantern it's my invisible lantern
like i've never been in the right dimension
gotta take to the airport where i wanna go
said i'm too far gone gotta pay my dues on
take me to a new day
watching' the seconds
still dreaming' of
all that's gone before you've changed
took an oath
i never thought you'd make
locked away inside a box
and that's all i seem to do
and i must be dreaming it
i got to tell you goodbye mama
that's all been down a long
it served me well but now it's gone
like ashes in the air i'm being scattered everywhere
i seen a holy man
stay on your side
ten million miles behind you will find
please say goodbye to the back of the plane
please say goodbye to the back of the plane
with shifting seas in silhouette
come walk down the long hall
that we're going to be on
that we're going to be on
in the place where you're going to see
you know that i'm never going to go
the ride of your life baby you cant lose
empty
when you put your head into the flower web
around our head and in our sky sky sky
we're going to the poison planet
looking to you with gratitude that seems unreal somehowtime to know just what i'm buying
time to know just what i'm buying
i wont remember all that's said
dont be surprised that i've grown so old
to watch what you gather and hold in your hand
that i believe in you
go out into my side forever
come on come on go back to find
now here's the door into the night
i feel like a jerk
keep your hand on the gospel plow
you're not at all
windshield frames a picture of the night
oh lord it wont change
oh lord it wont change
i been a long long time away
i been a long long time awayrepeat
the scene looks very empty
i see stars with my eyes closed
not knowing if i'm dead
all along has she been gone
ah come on now wont you tell me how you feel
i wanna leave the city and a million staring eyes
out here to the forest baby yeah
gotta go where my thoughts would take me
out in the forest
i can see you
so look into the sun it's shining blue
i look into the eyes of my disguise
i think i'm going insane
seem so hard to findwoke up feeling real funny
so heavy as the smoke still lingers
tellin fears that fall from blue skies
it's easy while you're finding that
looking through me like there's no one there
send me to the great nowhere
if you are seeing what you're believing it's nothing new
in a world of hurting i'm moving on
to find a reason to carry onsaid lord please give me what i need
find a reason to carry on
we leave behind all this worried puzzle
there's a place where nobody goes
so many pieces and so many people
a sweet invader that could never miss
burn one more into my mind
smoke rings drift in the wind
smoke rings drift over me
looks like they're never coming back again
i cant explain
following most everywhere i tread
and i know all the ways and i'll try
if i bear myself out in the yard
and then i wont go up or down
hold me under drowning in despair
never said goodbye goodbye
i'd take it straight to any place
i get burned away
i been burned away
say you are free why dont you really live
and takes a train
but you gotta hate forever you never can forgive
what are you gonna do now
what did you think i would do now
i find it hard to live with all my choices
and did you ever think to ask my opinion
now i limit myself to a six gun quota
i dont care if you are dont tell me that you're trendsetters
i dont care if you are
here she comes again
there's no one left to hurt but me
nobody died for you
you can break me down if it takes all your might
hate me break me down
i wanna hold you high and steal your pain
empty
give this to someone else
the worst is over now
empty
making you feel like a hyprocrite because you cannot run yeah
cause i'll be where i fell
if i decide that i am alive
than i'm diseased and ungrateful
you've taken all you can take you can take x3
'cause they'll feel you so much more
'cause they'll feel you so much more
nothing left for me to lose
then she told me she had a gun
do you know i'm faking
i breathe you i cant go through this
and i realize i dont get hurt
now i realize that you have won
i beseech you to let me drown
i wanna catch you when you fall
i wanna be the one you breathe
and i'm taking back everything i can
the one you sold to fool the world
fake it if you dont belong here
i can fake with the best of anyone
fake it if you dont belong here
i'm impressed
look again
i believe i believe
it seems like every day's the same
one day too late just as well
i am prepared now
too late i'm in hell
i am prepared now and i am fine again
dig it up and whore me out
you come around when you finally face this
you'll never break me
fuck me like you hate me
last night i saw that beauty queen
she's got no one to hate
she's got nothing to say
wanna get some on my love
she's got no one to blame
and i find it yeah i like it
i'll tell you it's all for you
empty
it's all the same
well now i found myself
i gave my life away
wish i could fake it
i cant pretend we're the same
i gave my life away
he never wanted it anyway
and now he's touching her wrong again
premeditation will kill the trust
the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
she's coming over wearing genocide
and the scratches she'd hide
i never found out how she could lie with a smile on her face and the darkness inside
my memories are all stained again
i remember all you said to me now
empty
but i am afraid of trying
that i am ashamed of lying
and i am afraid
you're so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
you're no jesus christ
i keep rollin over
nobody's gonna stand in my way
you cant hold me down
empty
take it away 'cause i dont like this anymore
i am a plastic man wish i can be the one you could be proud of
another tradegy but you're too cold to feel
steal my pride
leave me blind blind blind now
well now kill me kill me kill me kill me
if you want me hold me back
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
call your name every day when i feel so helpless
i'll mend myself before it gets me
watch it blow my mind
it feels like i'm losing again
but give me your open hand
i dont wanna be alone again
until the day you killed me again
i dont wanna be alone again
i dont wanna be alone again
and i'm sympathetic
and i'm sympathetic
i cant make it go away i cant make it go away
as beautiful as fire against the evening sky
cleansed and pure and weak i suffer when i dream
i want you to stay i need you here to keep me sane
right on the wrong side of it all
i dont belong here and i'm not well
i am so ashamed of this
can anybody save me
goodbye cruel world
and now i'm deprived of my conscience and something's got to give
convincd on the inside you're so much more than me yeah
so turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
and you're fading with every day
but i am no fun
you could've been the next one should've been enough for me x4
behind me this wasted life
i feel decayed
so find me a way to leave this wasted life
and i dont need friends when i have foes like you
pain and pleasure inviting
i'm just like you just not a fool
i'm sick of wasting time on what can never be
i hate what you are
into wanting me now
and i disgrace myself in the mirror
i guess i like it when you smite me
fuck it i feel you in me
fuck it i see you in me
a green cross gliding on a million pines
well i'm not begging for release
i cant help believing they can read me like a book
dont let our troubles show
and you dont have the final word
she's got it all worked out i'm afraid
if you feel like i'm asking you for too much
well show me a friendship that's pure and chaste
empty
find someone else to bed
i guess that's great
brand new baby beside you now oh yeah
close enough to heaven if you
i was just a passenger a
i thought i should see
suddenly my mission was clear
i told her i was looking for somebody to appreciate
fine spring day california waves
all about chemistry
open all the doors and lett you out into the world
take me home
empty
sleep drifting above you sweetly complete
do what you want to do
i wanted to leave you completely pleased
come and feed me
when you call me
how like you to make everything seem so clear and
here behind your door
dnd dnd dnd
all the suffering and mystery me
not stifling behind suburban wheels
and you never even get to go down
i've busied myself all summer
and i'll ride this wave till the end
windchimes blow in the dark
stay awhile stay awhile
fascinating new thing
that you're priceless and you're precious
tell me why do you keep thinkin that your falling
that you're lovely
and that somebody wants you
that you're priceless
none down in the bottom of the ninth with three men on
maybe even gotta die a little
for the love of the game
well dont be blue
and meanwhile all of you lonely ones
if you're looking for someone to get a grip on you
girlfriend girlfriend
girlfriend girlfriend
twice around the room and out alone
i get the feeling you're a lot like me
city sky reflects the silver street below
there's nowhere she could sit besides the bed
i wish i could see any scene but the one i hang around
i can try to please you
i wish i could turn into somebody far far away
whatever you need me to
and it's over before it's done
if i run i can free my worried mind
i'll feel
i'll feel
empty
i know i said you were free to roam
give me a mile in the right direction
i know i said one look in your eyes is the end of my love's desire
i know i said just to see your face is the only thing i require
well this time while you're believing
you'd be mistaken to count on me o yeah
well i'm done waiting
peace is in the veins in the veins
be careful what you put in there
be careful what you put in there
better do like you should
everybody be good now
better do like you should
a long way from home
i hope you last a long long time
i bulldozed the trees and set my feet on the ground
high in the turrets i'm thinking of you
down down until your ears go pop
a plan
i believe you know me well
are you sorry that you treat me unkind
switch on the box mr spock is on the table
like you you love
and left the phone bill on the table in the sun
can make me fly keep me high
and all through the party i want to leave
i dont really need
enough to go around
with one true love
will we laugh at how this all began
would like to believe that someday
love me your best and i know
and the happily ever after
with a peacefully ever after
so i searched with my greed in the sunshine for all to see there
and i'm afraid i'm never gonna find my way back to where i've been
but a fear has caught my words inside
rising rising
from the bottom of a lake
and we still wanna stay
with a stainless steel balloons
remove this whirling sadness
i'm grieving i'm barely believing now now
if i run i can free my worried mind
but i wouldnt want to leave you behind
she's got a picture in her mind
she can see right through all my little games
and every mistake that i ever made
waiting waiting for the girl to call
where nobody ever goes
i've been living in your cassette
got your tape and it changed my mind
say the promise you long to keep
did you ever look so nice
i wanted to be home again
i want to stay forever in her light
and darkness blows my mind
i'll be a satellite satellite
for somebody like
and give yourself to
now my eyes are open wide
on your body and in your mind
i'm gonna surprise them all
i'm gonna surprise them all
cuz something in my life was run away
ah ah ah
maybe hang on to her phone number too
you gave what you wanted then you went away
what you gave as a gift a gift
cant you see i'm weary
cant you see i'm blurry
cant you see i'm blurry
counting down from ten it's time
when the man at the stop light catches you
getting anywhere
we're speaking in tongues
we're wasting our time
down a wishing well
not even angels saw me
and who who have i become
now the damage is done
all the toil and all exhaustion
the shattered dreams all down
just bitterness remains
a stern cold man is what i am hard relentless
i'll be the last to close the last to close my eyes
equipped a hundred swordmen
awaiting the winter frost
and a thousand men with crossbows
the sign of the dark and the cold
behind the seven seas
confusion will rule till i die
i wander between these worlds
nofaded in dream
sandman stab me in the back
bleed in my arms wounds within
fall from grace as i offer you sin
no looking back to the life i once had
life kicks us in the teeth
yet go onwe go on
yet something makes us crawl back for more
yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
hear these words i say
each funeral just makes us realize
on this momentary trail
and now i can no longer see the shine
it could seem that i'm doing fine
has only led me back to hell
flame thou of wisdom the greatest
set the world on fire
piss upon the graves where thy enemies are laid
raise the gun take aim and blow me away
put a bullet through my head
love your death
will you wait
may death again us unite
now the game is over and it's all gone
my wounds are too dry for more bleeding
think about all the positive sides in life
when the master is slave to his life
all the tears and the fears and the lies and the cries and the
for it's great to lose control
leave no room for happy endings
we need to burn and reach the point of no return
music tenkula sentenced words jarwa
the pagan reign of nature
he shall promise no salvation but let you see what is imminent
rocks this human cradle grave
from the dark side of the moon
i'm praying for her soul as this blood on my hands stains me whole
gone are those nights with you by my side
no more beating as one no longer burns the flame
my remaining moments with
the melancholy and the hole in the soil so hard and cold
it freezes my heart my desperate heart
lay depressed and hollow
now you come haunting every night
oh yeah i will
they had seen me salute the flames in the sky
i am not one of them
through all my life
obsession you are feeding it
to the strongest love our death will be
open your eyes to realize
i was dying to be dead
is slowly turning to dust
i hate
i love you and i hate myself
give me a reason to live
he's gazing through all that is there
from the cradle straight to the grave
each time i dream of you
watch me now i'll be complete
born to fight and built to last
hate burns scars within our minds
in a battle which no one will prevail
where humanity is gone
this is the end of liberty
so long that i have become the night
make the glow go away
i'm dying it's so bright
where there is no light of day
if i ceased to exist or was never born at all
than to flutter in the air with these wings so weak and torn
the shadows cast so palefuneral spring is now
funeral time again
two at my feet and two at my head
two carrying me at where my hands are laid
and i dont care
when it comes onto her again
dont go yet dont yet go
and in some strange way
that i really couldnt think of anything more
those hollow containers for souls
i'll throw the first rock
peace of mind in death
sacred to the memory of myself
they're back again
rain bathes the ground
as our loves wither away
killing me killing you
kill me kill me kill me again with your love
kill me kill me kill me again with your love
i really have left here
like blood to heart that beats no more
and leave this world behind
loving death
nicely slowly enjoying the pain
as blood flows on the shore
below into the abyss
now lay your wreaths
down to half mast
forward forward we go into attack
our men from all around
no forward forward i am not turning back
as we approach our final fate
a new dawn of man
this is the end
then descend
if there's a heaven for the heathen
forever lost
firetake me high
raise the arms in victory
the goals i've set to myself are far beyond mortality
i've been before on this ground
and losers shall drop
dont you know
dont you know
the deadly shadows fall
i feel the burning ice and snow for the first time
the end is at hand i'll find the one i came looking for'
hovering lightly down upon the ground
and the rising glow brings along the sense of death
dead moon rising
what we also call life
burning eerie sapphire
music tenkula lopakka sentenced lyrics lopakka
forgotten personality
into the black pieces
it's so easy to make you play my game
just spread that pink wide smile and drain me my darling
i dont need to care if you want me
what treasures it may hide the night
dreams do thems of the dead
chiht we'll sleep forever
and it sets our hearts ablaze
the flames rise still so freezing on our sea
to eternity
sorrowful yet glorious somehow
still it doesnt only hurt end it now
vesa ranta drums
choir parts in vengeance is mine and end of the road by musarit lead and arranged by ismo koskela
i see life as it was meant for me
my heart belongs to the past
from the wall of frozen time i see my own reflection
always know we never lost
still amazed how our whole trio on link
tiny minds and virtuous whores
i blow my brains onto the wall
suppose i have left to lose
see you in hell
and then drop dead
for eternity'
the relieving words of farewell end my earthly hell
for eternity
the fields where their blood was spilt
i shall bring you all down
music tenkula sentenced lyrics laihiala
the burning passion the glowing sunset gives will leave me to my joy
and out of my father's ass i was born feet first
i do not deserve the luxury of a grave
oh no a coffin would be way too nice
as i go seeking for the one i used to live for'
my flame now fading away
my life flows to the ground
yet another morning
and open a bottle once more
it all went wrong
'i am the light that shall lead you to darkness'
killing me is not enough to make me go away
i'm the suicider dying every night and day
so when you're waiting for the next attack
and the russians fire another round
without a tear i draw my parting groan
no one can show us the right way
sweat and feel the air too thick to breathe
well hey now what did you expect to see
disillusion
the things you'd see
the way i'm gonna go is not the way you want to go
sailing our personal seas of sorrow
then came the snow which covered the ground white
it came like a cold wind
there is no sight in my third eye
dozen of eyes for an eye
i'm right on your track you bastards
dozen of eyes for an eye
i was born one foot in grave
think of existence as a flame and death as rain
that's all we are
we are but falling leaves in the air hovering down
hey little sister who's the one you want
it's a nice day for a white wedding
it's a nice day for a white wedding
streams pour through an altar
eager to show those who see
but those good times were always worth waiting for
what a long and strange trip this has been for me
you're the light at the end of the tunnel
when dusk falls and obscures the sky
empty
is aching to be
everything's a blessing in disguise
and does what she can
i'm crawling through
compatibleno communication with you
it's in your mind
she calls me goliath and i wear the david mask
i have become cumbersome to this world
no no no yeah
she's wanting me less
he said devil boy what have you done
the augustinians kept to themselves stuck their tongues out in a row
and i'll burn that bridge a 1000 times on the cross i bear
for heavens sakes
a little motivation goes a long way down
in every situation heavy traffic jams his sound
you've got to wonder is moving on the best that you can do
pulls me close to hear me laugh
maybe it's the highway
i've got a tricked out receiver
but i think leave well enough alone
my town
i'll teach them to sing along
go to keep yourself keep you from becoming one
hang on to me
paint the caves of your existence with the colors of your mind
keeps her head above the water
she knows the words i'm writing
dont want to give or take my love dont break dont sink dont think of me
bet you like them as much as her blues
there's only one sound to love
i tell you that love can be king
hear what they say
liquid used to surround me
it dont take much to get it right back on track
i'll bet she's a nervous wreck
from their dad's predicament
as you start your car
to clean the racks
maybe the words dont mean a thing
politic your angry reason out of bed
it's angry and slick
i talked to the cousins of people who knew you
the hanging judge in town
curled up stared
says it gets old real quick
that i felt
the things that i hide
the things that i hide
she's got backup
marry me she said i dont reply
daddy said you better or you'll die
away from mobility
to beat the sun from her glory
cuts what she cant untie
what's she trying to do to me
it spins
she didnt want to play the role of the fool again
i know i'm all right because
because the needle cant burn
colossal fact daddy's ex dont let you read
this kansas wheat wont break me
if the oven wont burn
like air leaks from a tire
you cant look straight ahead
you know my will just fades
in the urban shopping mall
and maybe i worry
do things in a hurry
i sit useless
she dont need it
since i cant remember when
tell me what i've seen
you would never believe
things i've done to me
reality steps in
keeps looking over his shoulder
how to live with mistakes
a pretty shame you cant defile
spread out for every queen to see
and i know when i'm old the only runningonna come
as they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
funny how these things come about
'cause i'd seen her a minute before
this aint no fucking game
dont go down to the water's edge she said to me
i know how the good wind blows
i know how the hatred goes so i buried mine
now want to be your lovers
save you from the things that cause us pain
they believe you now
i gotta earn every breath you take
with you i feel safe
it's an animal city
my love
que pase junto a ti
aprendi a querer los gatos
mentiras piadosas
y fue por ti que descrubi

ya vas a ver como van sanando
la lgria sec
ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
y hoy vuelvo a ver
ayer te busqu
y quiero pensar
saliste de aqu
ayer te busqu
en las revistas
dando vueltas en paris
y que pasa si son ellos
hasta ofreciendo conciertos
o la que canta esta cancion
para continuar asi
y condenaste a una serpiente
perteneciste a una raza antigua
yo que soy un caos completo
y de sueos blancos
y que dios nos ampare
las mujeres se casan
y renunciaste al paraiso
un pepino tu destino
cada cosa calculada
empty
asistir al colegio
y aunque asi no lo quieran
ms se que estar bien
tus rutinas de piel
y mis labios se ven
y tus ganas de huir
how can you give what you dont have
but you're so in love with yourself
you keep on aiming for the top
que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
que desaparezcan todos los vecinos
y que me quede aqu despus del ocaso
que se arruinen los canales de noticias
y el beso que inventas cada dia
que se vayan uno a uno los amigos
despues del ocaso
cuando intento no pensar
de caminar
de tanto no tocarte me duelen me duelen
yo quiero que vuelvas
si sabias que eras para mi
y ahora que estas aqui
que parta hasta los huesos
sesenta de cintura
busco eternas primaveras
algo mas que dar
mi primer amor
que renazcan a la vida
es el sueno que ahora me libera
lo siento tan directo al corazon
huracan de emociones
mi otra verdad
i dont wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
i'm ready for the goodtimes
oh oh oh oh
as long as you're my shelter every night
now that i'm not alone
cuz these are rules for us
you'll always be
chorus 2x
no escaparon con suerte
donde lo que no se quiere se mata
nunca come en exceso y jamas duerme desnudo
y las hormonas presentes
donde lo que no se quiere se matase mata

no puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
y no de excusas vivi yo
que mi negra no me castigues mas
ay ay ay
se a lo que voy
empty
un error convertido en acierto
que ya deje de verme nia
pero tanto que te pienso no te hara mirar
luego a bailar bajo la luna
lejos de tu amor y sin salida mire
lo que siempre fu
es que vuelvas a mi vuelvas a mi vuelve
ten consideracin y no me dejes sufrir
bleibe baby bleibe baby
desde hace poco algo nuevo nace en mi
dicen que hasta veo fantasmas o que estoy emproblemada
si estoy contigo en el desierto soy feliz
mis dias sin ti son tan absurdos
chatarra inservible basura en el suelo
chatarra inservible
ahogandome en llanto
necesitas alguien que te sale la pasion
siento que me falta el aire si no estas aqui
tu necesitas de mi de mi
y tu corazon esta sangrando
tu necesitas de mi de mi
ya de fiesta a fiesta cada vez me aburro mas
tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
no creo en mi todavia
no creo en venus ni marte
de tus alas siempre ser el viento
a ti nunca podria decirte que no
que nadie mas te amara asi
empty
pesa ms la rabia que el cemento
y que a tu edad sepas bien lo que es
it's not her fault that she's so irresistible
i'm not your mother
but you've got to know small things also count
this is pathetic
dont you count on me boy
hasta que entiendas que
te quiero porque eres claro
para liberar tensiones luego ya de revisar
con quin al menos tranquilo
si a falta de ocupacin
pobre de dios que no sale en revistas
el octavo dia dios despues de tanto trabajar
anda esperando paciente por alguien
si a falta de ocupacion
pobre de dios que no sale en revistas

a quien pueda yo amar
te busque por las calles
porque mi amor por ti es total
sin ti
debajo el asfalto
toalla arena en mi odo
en tus ojos
peligro peligro
seras el primer actor
y decidas otra vez regresar
tal como quiere
si te vas
y me cambias
y la celulitis invada sus piernas
she's got the kind of look that defies gravity
she's just far better than me
so dont bother be unkind
so dont bother
and move to a communist country
dont bother
was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly
can you tell me how it used to be
sound like something odd
can you tell me how it used to be
can you tell me how i used to be
je vois que dieu existe
con defectos con errores
desde la redondez de tus labios
cuando miro en tus pupilas se que dios no dejo de existir
igual yo reconozco
solo con hablar
eres fuego y emocin
mi mejor invento
no todo lo bueno es pecado
te amarro a mi sof burgus
yo ser un complot para tu mente
es mi forma de jugar al escondite ingls
esta noche voy contigo a bailar
na na na na na na naaaaa
que la vida es ritmo es alegria
el estar contigo me hace libre
creeme que te quiero
en los dos en los dos
porque se que este amor es lo mas bello del mundo
se que no regresaras
se que te perdi
estoy enloqueciendome
es cuestion de tiempo y fe
compartimos mil secretos
si un milagro puede ser
mi corazon no aguanta mas
a sky without sun
without your eyes could never be
looking for someone comparing to you
and i have seen
looking for someone comparing to you

y cuando me miras me atrapa tu mundo y me siento distinta
tus gafas oscuras me hacen de poco y no se lo que pasa
the kind of dream you'd never share
and soon you'll make your last name mine

i'll cook for free
makin an offer that
let me in

baby like this is perfecto

and if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
will you forgive mine
and if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers
forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who have trespassed against us
and are you happy
and are you happy
the way you've done it
and as far as i know you're still alive baby
i wish you both all the best
you dont even know the meaning of the words i'm sorry
creo que alguna vez fui infiel
lloro una vez al mes
no encuentro forma alguna de

la sombra de ti
pensando en ti
me sigue rodeando
regados por aqu
todas las palabras que dijimos
quand tu
dont condemn me to be free
you've got something i cant resist
you see the way i am
and there's something
je vois qu'un dieu existe
je te desire

porque yo no respiro si no estas

porque yo no respiro si no estas

empty
las manchas de miel
muy muy lejos
ah aah
sin ninguna cita hecha
buscando una luz
no has aparecido
es como cantar sin oir
ya la musica no tiene el mismo
no me escucho ni mi propia voz
porque eres parte de mi
diez mil dias
why to love and with such brutality
i wanna believe that we may still have a chance
pretend we never heard of things we said
i'm missing out
empty
and someday think of kids
you're the one i know
you're the one i need
yale yale
'cause the system never fails
empty
dont worry
we'll show all on tv
then hurry
the risk of hides to make them bother
how about those people who dont matter anymore
aliviaste mis heridas
cuando llamo yo
pues me pierdo sin tu amor
el diario en el que escribo
porque nunca podre vivir sin ti
la fe con que vivo
y cuando me miras me atrapa tu mundo y me siento distinta
tus gafas oscuras me hacen de poco y no se lo que pasa
fue un impacto
ahora me dices
basta de dias vacios te amo
asi empezo
los titulares no se como no se olvidan
y de vez en cuando cerca
rockit out and rockit in
mil anos esta aqui dentro y yo
from brasilia to medellin
underneath your clothes
when the friends are gone
movin talkin walkin breathing
there's the man i chose
sola como termino colon
busco algo que pueda contestar
vuelve vuelve
que mi barca se esta
lucky that i love a foreign land for
we're meant to be together
so you dont confuse them with mountains
i'll be there and you'll be near
tell me one more time
if you really feel the way i feel
my life is full of people
without your embrace
my life is full of people
without your embrace
mmm the thing about love
the thing about love the thing about
oh it could come so fast it fools ya
love is it's is that it's everywhere
there aint no time it comes when you least expect it
there aint no particular way
there aint no speed in wont drive
oh there aint no way
and if i change my mind
well any man of mine better disagree
i need a man who knows how the story goes
any man of mine
hup two hum

blue tears gimme freedom
black eyes all behind me
blue tears gimme freedom
find your self esteem and be forever free to dream
c'est la vie that's life
i could be a slob or keep my job
everybody's got to earn their way
c'est la vie hold tight
get away somewhere take a trip
when you need a laugh come around
come on over come on in
come on over come on in
it was the crime of the century
you bet your heart but as i recall
you came on like jesse james

when he's out on a saturday night
dance with the one that brought you and you cant go wrong
dont let the green grass fool you
i get so aggravated when i get off the phone

and there aint no how
i can still see love for me i can

when it comes hearts and heartache
when he leaves you

scent of an angel
but you aint no saint
so let's move on down
'cause i feel a little cold and blue
a vision of you by my side
baby let's slide on over
from here
he's a platinum canary drinkin falstaff beer
canine feline jekyll and hyde
scully and angel on the kitchen floor
a change would do you good
empty
when you gonna get out of bed
i never needed anyone
i want to leave
hit it
and i wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
all i wanna do is have some fun
all i wanna do is have some fun
there's all kinds of people in this world
some will die for you some would lie to you
one look behind and it's never the same
some will die for you some would lie to you
soft the drowsy hours
while the weary world
though i roam
near the presence
from off thee shaken
when you knew that i was always on your side
no it isnt how it's really meant to be
no is it how it's really meant to be
i spill milk on your table
i say all the right things
i am fashionably crude
i am frying my mind
when the money starts to running out
will seem one hundred light years away
and it's hard at the end of the day
and the endlessness that you fear
it dont make no difference
you're in the arms of the angel
you dont bring me anything but down
everything is crashing to the ground
you dont bring me anything but down
baby dont go
i love you so pretty baby
please dont go
please dont go
oh what a beautiful dream
oh what a beautiful dream
cus' what you give away
wont be the same thing if you're not here with me
originally by zucchero
i got a sinking feeling
these rainy skies
your fingers
oh child
i took the i 95 down to pensacola
got a hundred stories and tabloid lies
but i believe they're coming back for me
empty
more than nothing more than nothing more than nothing
the rise and fall of mary ellens hairdo
now everything is going half price
sure did treat me nice
you sure did treat me nice yes you did
gave me a diamond ring for christmas
well i'm feeling mighty fine
well i've got to run to keep from hiding
and i've gone by the point of caring
time is piling up
i been in trouble since i
all my powers of expression
i was thinking about the things that she said
i'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind
but my heart is not weary it's light and it's free
so give me your hand and say you'll be mine
was stayed in mississippi a day too long
i want money that's what i want
even try
even try
in a hundred dollar tee shirt
when i was seventeen
got no serious plans
yeah it's all mine
'cause baby i gotmotivation
empty
she'd be unlike any other
you were the only one
my funny valentine
not if you care for me
my secret's written all across my face
you are silent
i only want you near me
i only want you near me
it's obvious the trouble we're in
no one said it would be easy
when he looks at me and smiles
my love's bigger than a cadillac
if i start running now
now that you're gone
but i wake up untorn
'cause nothing belongs to me
now that you're gone
it was the third of june
jumped off the talahachee bridge
oh marie
she's all magazines and benzedrine and vodka
and just like desire
where there is a will
to want you so much
where there is a will
pull your body into mine
i dont creep baby till late at night
and her mama believed
run baby run baby run baby run
stares hopeful out the window
so run baby run baby run baby run
i see that now
oh it's a sad sad world
no matter how misunderstood
without you in it
i remember every fucked up minute
until you're safe and sound
empty
feel like i was a zero
feel like i could have loved you
feel like i could've saved you
does the truth even matter
reason is idiotic
we had a chance now we're gonna blow it
who would be more afraid us or them
you gotta say it say
say say what you want to
buying bread and paying for none
can lead to madman oil drillers
celebrate the golden cow
i wait for shouts from crazy cranks
if everything in life was free
there's no words to describe it
they've been knocking me sideways
flowers they bloom
these feelings wont go away
these feelings wont go away
i keep thinking in a moment that
it's much too late to turn away
i'd rather be in hell
on a peaceful day
sign your name across my heart
sign your name across my heart baby
im gonna soak up the sun
to win me some of your love
dont have no master suite
im gonna soak up the sun
as concrete doesnt
with the rain of your personal dreams
there was a man
takes him down
goes up in smoke
squeeze box
well the kids dont eat
and the music's all tight
and the music's all righ
i wanna rock and roll this party
like steve mcqueen
all our popstars look like porn
empty
we're losing our way
but you say stop
i will stand up and say
empty
we'd go straight to the moon
oh now please dont tell me
ooh we go straight through the moon
have been down with the smile
it comes back down again
god i feel like hell tonight
lie to me
lie to me
and if you think that you are only
and if you think that you are only
a shadow in the wind
and lay your hands over me
you think it ought to be
and you hold the key
please say honestly
stand out in a crowd
let you go baby
na na na na
oh baby all i need is one more chance
all i want
empty
i want you back
let me live again
i will walk
wont reach the door no
now the life fury
we went searching through thrift store jungles
you listen to coltrane derail your own train
then why the hell are you so sad
if it makes you happy
i continue to build a wall
and the days go by
doing nothing about them
to make you smile
baby dont leave medid you ever believe
there'll be snow and mistletoe
then i wont want you
i'm gonna be somebody
you can cry
every night i dream you're next to me
and blue is blue
and if you carry me tonight
and i'm getting
and blue is blue
you're sleeping on the wings of doves
the fountains frozen tears bring back those years
cause i remember you indian summer
is it like today oh ooh
he went to the moon to the moon
didnt know much not much but he saw
the moon is hanging like your hat
i added on 'cuz the house was feeling small
i can sing my song again
it's only love
but faces i have known
empty
empty
playing in the streets i was unknowing
looking in the face of one who loved me
just you wait and see
i woke up this mornin with my makeup on
you're gonna wake up from your dream
so you can kiss the girl goodbye
haulin crates takin shit
we can love each other both to death
stayin up all night to work on you
let's burn this bed
'cause two's a crowd on my cloud baby
mamma's got a feeling she's up all night
nothing you can say or do
i feel happy
so cool to be suicidal
originally by bob dylan
i cant shoot them anymore
empty
but i was a good girl
make it go away
waiting in the dark
oh you're not forgotten
i'll be waiting
well tell your thirst love has passed
in other words the ignorant kind
if any fiction every returns
i asked the time
empty
to tell me what a loser i've elected
wait and see the boom will fall
l ci darem la mano
presto non son pi' forte
in an army jeep
lights so bright
to demonstrate his might
empty
no i wont be back
yeah we all need someone we can dream on
we all need someone we can bleed on
and i walked down to the shop
i took you in
who will come through
what do you feel
take off your halo take off your golden crown
and when i woke up i was wringing wet
we can live lifetimes in a single day
that's all she ever thinks about
so twisted resting on your haunches
why dont you try to get it right this time
everybody's out to have a good time
forget about tomorrow because all we really have is today
get it right this time
come on now honey dont you want to live with me
and when she strips the chauffeur flips the footmans eyes get crossed
he made me for my money and she made me blue
and here it is tuesday aint had no news
and if the kingdom comes
heard the peoples cries
on the long road home
sure as the rivers flow
welcome to the hallway metal detectors just been installed
good morning hate
well we dont like the way you live your life
dance children dance to the beat
how my heart is broken
does anybody need you
you believe it's a prize
you believe it's unwise
all i really know for certain babe
another day
devil take your money
hey tambourine
oh everybody
devil take your money
love is free
everybody say we are the world to come
a common sky everybody knows that we've got to try
we are the world to come race of love and a world of one
i want to take you down to the river
well dont you know
when you reach that place
empty
what you never had before
the world could fall apart
i could shape your mind
i have held you close
empty
tell it on the mountain
i said go
i said go
i say go
tell it on the mountain
he must've seen some ugly things
something has gone missing
and the body count arise
rock on gold dust woman take your silver spoon
good is good and bad is bad
you turn around before the lightening strikes
and you could find a rock to crawl right under
you turn around before the lightening strikes
empty
hallelujah hallelujah
i dont even know the name
and even though
always get a second chance
i need a love baby to make me happy
i need a love to make me happy
i need a love to keep me happy i need a love to keep happy
and this he scribbles on a perfume note
went to take care of her own body
and we still argue over who is god
and i'm gettin old
keep me searchin for a heart of gold
little darling the smiles returning to the faces
little darling it seems like years since it's been clear
the next time you see me comin you better run
well mack the finger said to louie the king
he says hmm you're right
and have it on highway 61
we stick together with every day that passes by
i guess i'll throw it away
but i lose my way
empty
now i'm reading romance novels
and everything i wanted
she had to heave me right across her shoulder
as naked as the day that i will die
door after door
now how many children watch
i called your house on the telephone
i see her smiling but her eyes were dead
so i dont wanna know
i stood close enough to hear you say
she's crazy as anyone can be
state of sin
empty
but the feeling will come back
i should be happy
cause i still love him so
one less egg to fry
what a lovely pie you baked
the dream didnt end
and all my lonely days
while you're hesitating
dont have to tell me twice
but you keep me hanging on
but you keep me hanging on
baby when you look for me
you keep me hanging
until one day love is gone
you keep me hanging
if you feel you wanna fight me
if we could only get out of our heads out of our heads
but only the heart can understand oh understand
oh every prophet just a man
tears and look to your heart
i hear you're happy too
i heard your name today
but time goes on
sometimes i feel so happy
linger on your pale blue eyes
it lies but cant stand up
linger on your pale blue eyes
peace be upon us peace be upon us
it will be a new day
be upon us all
let's dance in the summer breeze
let's dance 'til your troubles fade away
no matter who is leading
their telling me that i'm the best
that's what they all say
and this our last goodbye
and this is a perfect lie
that may be the only thing that's ever real
let me know how long it took
but when you reach across the table
well this neighborhood's changed
he's got high faded friends
real gone
slow down you're gonna crash
empty
if god be willing
come leaders come you men of great
throw us a bone you men of great
short circulated
bring me down
bring you 'round
holding it together
we take one step
and we'll make it through
and everything seems dark
when the dust in the field has flown
and we're waiting for someone to see
and secretly hope it wont come
since i left
bad luck's never ending
there's just no stopping him tonight
and too much time i've been spending
we'll all drive by in our hybrid lives
we'll make it back we'll make it back
we'll make it back we'll make it back
you will always win o
lay your head down on my bed
empty
you just let me go
and it's laughter that i feel when i think of you
i call you up when my bottle's dry
i say i've gotten use to the crash and burn
like a glove
how the faces of love have changed
drove me through the mountains
it's so dark and i'm losing my way
with a paper thin heart
as the moon and the stars
with a paper thin heart
diamond ring
diamond ring
someday you'll be like me
give me something of your soul
yeah it's gonna take a little time
and what's ahead may shine
burn the darkness away
empty
tell me what is wrong
that it's later than it seems
doctor my eyes
empty
empty
i think about you and i get high
if you'd only walk through my door
i get drunk with the thought of you
ooh those tears i cry ay ay
every breath i take oh oh oh oh
i still love you so
i hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
i get a little bit closer
these are the days when anything goes
na na na na na na na na na na
that doesnt mean that we cant try
dont lay your worries on me
na na na na na na na na na na
if we dont see eye to eye
na na na na na na na
empty
empty
i think i hear him whispering
free man
they just wanna be a free man now
and i'm living with a free man now
she should love one another
i think i'm running from a free man
just like boston tea
empty
and driven through the streets of agra to the palace aquaduct
but when the government turned its back on farming
cause i've got a message and a megaphone
cause the money's in the pipeline
and you gave me hope and love
did you ever think you had it all figured out
and you let me fall in love
i just want to be where you want me to
let's all go downtown
i got a backstage line
diamond rings and sparkily things
where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
and see an ounce of pain
where do we go
there's plenty of things to believe in
got a strangely calm voice on the other line
tearing us apart
you know i cant go on feeling this old way
i knew it from the start
that i would be written down sliced around
and no time and words you waste
chestnuts roasting on an open fire
on his sleigh
i think i was wrong
what love has made of me
and there aint nothing like regret
dont you have somewhere that you need to be
the difficult kind
baby i'll try to love again but i know
baby i'll try to love again but i know
cuz if you want i'll try to love again
the first cut is the deepest
dont you worry baby dont worry
o wee baby i wanna show you a good time
but the wheeze is someone else inside her head
i'll turn that page
i'll take a cab home early
or just how long it's been
this is the last time
billy jean burger king chauvinist pig pen
when i get drunk i drive it on the parkway
g gordon liddy under the table table table
the drag queens and the freaks
the photo chick made to look sickly
just for carrying the message to a flunkie
tonight my christmas wish will be for all to heath the call
peace on earth and in our hearts
that love ring out ring near and far
to jezebel the nun she violently knits
the hysterical bride in the penny arcade
looks up at his hero the commander in chief
then sends them out to the jungle
now i wish i could give brother bill his great thrill
that could hold you dear lady from going insane
how you leave me to burn
it's no fun
until the day
no not at all
you must explain why this must be
i suppose there's nothing i can do
no way
i do what i can
the magnavox sighs
yeah that's who i am
who's come this far just to turn around
and he says
you can hear it
can you make me see the light of day
i got friends
you wont want me
i believe it's just a fact of life
maybe every now and then i laugh and cry
and you cant change the minds of those who are blind
gosh that's nice
there's no one else
all by yourself
come on just my hand
i still cannot explain
but in your usual way
i'm not remembering
a man who wasnt sad at all about what's going on
along the way we got off track
just like the ones i used to know
just like the ones i used to know
may all your christmases be white
i'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
she's just dressing goodbye windows tired starlings
to be with you
you will find me standing on the hill
we'll understand everything
for i've learned
i bet i was only
your suspicion
if you ever got your way
cause you want it all
oh what you gonna do when your heart begins to fall
i got the news this morning
cause you want it all
cause you want a lover
all your easter eggs are hatching
turn around and you're looking at a hundred more o deadly in the sack
empty
nothing seems to bother
falls down slowly
seeps into your mind
but this feeling will run right through the night
i dont wanna be lonely
mend in my sleep
casts a shadow over a broken son
coz i need to come down
i'm wasting my time
i'm a liar you dont seem to care what i care about and baby it's a shame
and sharpened nails seem softer
and i need you now somehow
open fire on the needs designed
apologise for another day
and the world is an open court
and the world is an open court
in the year 2000 with you
in the year 2000
in the year 2000 with you
you may just be the last before you
take the rope to my heart and fall
everything's dark
i wont be here
ohh i'm blind
you see i have no specialty
and he had nothing on his mind
dont turn away
dearest helpless
equalize the pressure it's all too much
you're better on your own
i'll make it easier
or would you just read my spine
feel the same
now you've come
sacrifice the tortures
e motion sickness
get up get up get up get up
lost no friendship
never see him open his eyes
you will never see the boy
need you to find where he is
only eat with uncles
i'll take my clothes and take this strange behaviour
for no reason but jealousy
i'll kill myself i'll put my head in a noose
waste of time
me and pain are the same
didnt have to pretend
and you got someone
i'm watching you watch
no one else will ever see
and finally i know why i feel like you're letting go
dont you feel a little weak
canary down the mine
i was standing in a line with a broken occupation on my back
scene what what
can we all gather round on the scene
that sings your cellar song
hang strung from an empty nest
hang strung from an empty nest
you wait til tomorrow
to be part of a human garden and i couldnt
before it started i tried to be anything i saw fit
welcome nothing short of anarchy
hopeless fight
to my dorm and opened the door to my trust
to lose your heart you'll have to take take and take
for my pregnant paws arent changing anything
it's like the candle's lit at both ends now
undecided cant make up their mind
but denies it
and all i can think of are ways to die alone
that tore the bandage
so he stopped reading
the faded sign will show
i'll be waiting all year
without the fruit falling out
but it melts in the sun like a life without love
and burn burn burn burn burn
the clocks are ticking timeless
so sick of getting sicker
he dreams of tracks and choices
blistered skin in a cold hearted pool
viscid dreams stick to holes in my head
the shelves when they're broken
but it's all the same to me
each day ends quicker
brains a square of grass
you'll make it through
you'll make it through
you'll make it through
take a hit from the drugs you stole
you're state of mind's improved
no one cares or understands
but i am careful who i burn
why are you any better than anyone else
families being torn apart
empty
i know it's been far too long in stormy weather
feel so empty when i feel so fine
coz you're keeping me warm but it's a lonely setting sun
there's no room for two
and i waste my time on no one
if you're hurt
empty
only book that i own is called 'how to lose'
death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
learn to evolve learn to learn to evolve
a new hypocritical look and ambition
why cant the livestock be free
who's the bad guy who's the bad guy
a new hypocritical look and ambition
replace yourself
pretend i'm dead
esteem will rise
you've got me stoned
we'll find a way
laying lost and wounded
his face left dripping
to see what i can lose again
and nothing in particular
lately i'm a desperate believer
set me on fire in the evening
wake me up lower the fever
sitting on a ball
to need the coldsore cream
and you got someone
i'm watching you watch
no one else will ever see
and finally i know why i feel like you're letting go
if you keep losing me you're gonna be bored
flaking temporary skin you're no burden
if you keep losing me you're gonna be
but i'd sit awake in daze anyway
i'm a maze of chains
i'm a maze of chains
i'm playing this pantomime
put your hands in the air
hating you should be introduced as a new law
i sit observing in disgust
leave me out
he doesnt know how it feels
gonna be a liar
next to your bed
there wouldnt be a point
stay and hijack the hurt
take a look inside my mind
and i'm all by myself the way i wanna be
oh madman mad
it starts to take its toll
and these are the better days
dont know what you want
dont know what you want
and thrown it all away but
with what i wanna say but
i've no respect for you
to handle everyday
and i miss use love
blind the deafened moon stimulate the tombs of angels
who am i
joining every bridge in the wind
some time
unhappy the land that has no heroes
and nothing to present
great times
no unhappy the land that needs heroes
promised lands
i believed in all you'd say
still the clouds roll by africa
what you gonna do when the love burns down
oh you lead me on till the feelings come
who is gonna come and turn the tide

if freedom comes and goes you know i'll still be waiting
i'd be with you i'd stay with you tonight
little darling close your eyes there'll be no compromising
you've got to get it right
still the band played on
and the questions there were many
and the king of light
at the end of every party
hold me now spectre of love
but i'll be alright
i'm home all alone again
still banging on the door again
some day soon they're gonna pull the old town down
when the belfast child sings again
that's flesh and blood man that's flesh and blood
so where did you go
communication lost in the thundering rain style
we were on the top and the world was spinning
if only you could see me
in police room 619
oh biko biko because biko
the man is dead the man is dead
never turn away
i open up to take a look into the bright and shiny book
i open up to take a look into the bright and shiny book

not just a body that's crying wolf now
cry cry cry
can this be something we cant understand
can it be we can
belief is a beauty thing
promises promises
belief is a beauty thing
as golden days break wondering
love waits for fame
a burning dream
laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
real life's the only life what's it all about

ooh for ever
ooh she tells me
the razor's song
a secret sin
a fragile man
there's something not right
sweet mother calling up now
and you're lost for words to say
so many pass this way
i shout out for shelter i need you for something
i see the sun up the showdown the cool winds that blow down
you cant stop the world for a boy or a girl
sanctify yourself sanctify
cities have lights
cities have lights
if you can see the lights shine in front of me
if you can see the lights shine in front of me
in colourful breathless emotional sea
that stand alone and crying young
singing fascination
there's nothing out there that's worth dying for
i can hear them screaming out
if you're looking for a goldmine
she is a country
going somewhere
going somewhere
breath is out
here it comes here it comes
she's like the wind that sucked me through it
wasting my time
'cause when i find
the voice of mother nature states
and i go blind
is there someone
streets are empty every day
i got some feelings so distant
the lion hits the stage
when vultures rise out of the blue
no we dont need a replacement
song for the tribes
falling here from grace
governments and gifts
only winds that twist
ma son warm lands semi monde
feel the whole world moving
still you pay
going any day
something on the bed was it something she said
just the people crying out
where will i find some peace of mind
all the babies crying out
of a land crying out anyway
run till we come until we be
run till we come until we be
i'd love to feel a free world turn tonight
you go to my head you go to my head
stand by love stand by me
give me one good reason why you dont come play with fire
stand by love stand by me
we turned around and suddenly you where gone gone gone
i need you tonight
still i hear you and i love you
they're calling sweet surrender
and i hear great wheels are turning
waltzing matilda looked at her wallet
sha la la la la sha la la la la sha la la la la
say sha la la la la sha la la la la sha la la la la
we need your loving so badly
i aint gonna play sun city
this quiet diplomacy aint nothing but a joke
dont ask me sun city 'cause i aint gonna play
sister rise dont you care
and the young girls eyes are miles away
and the dust will rise miles away
never want to lose this chance
empty
then say goodbye
grow in fame
take another fine walk
empty
empty
white soul
like it burst forth like a fountain
and with every little lie
come on and take a step back to the middle of the track
ah ha uh hu
gotta make the most of it
all that's gone now all that's
i'll be watching through fortunate eyes
babylon in your eyes
so many rivers run through me
with an airfield plan
empty
here comes the son
this world
three for the thrill and
you put the storm out that's up in my head
take me away ah ah ah until another day
time passes slowly
all that you say goes in vain
calling your name
time passes slowly
i'm gonna up to the top
we all go out to lunch
to the fool in the sky
but now we've got it on tape
has left us unaware
going out to lunch
empty
empty
empty
i in this land
the sound of machines
where the voices came through

and somewhere there is someone who can see what i can see
someone somewhere in summertime
i lost my job
father where's my food
thirty frames a second
i thought were dead
to a city that they live on
dance the dance of violence
city that they crawl on
looking at you
i've come so far
looking at you
looking at you
it's a shame
no soundtrack
shelter in their suitcase
observer write it all down
empty
we are open wide
empty
we can live

find a boy
down in the club
empty
empty
if i heard the words somewhere
now is it true they're calling you
but just dont know your name
is it true you're running round
romance is no escape
dance of the youth
know what we're after
a crime against the state
you're getting so very thin

tell me that you're so hot
ooh come on
yet be so nice
come on and do it
and i said belle
fall in love fell falling
i know so well
catch a boy fell falling
when colours fly and catherine wheels
sleep tight you couldnt count the cost through the night
up on may day and there is a carnival on my street tonight
come a long long
but dont cry yet it's not time yet
where are we now
as we crawl by night
hey waiter

can you sell me some thoughts
something's been happening here
yet still you wear that smile
empty
slow change may pull us apart
call my name or walk on by
i'll be alone dancing you know it baby
when you walk away
all across the land it's east at easter
'cause all across the land it will be east at easter
we'll go walking hand in hand yes
cities buildings falling down
'cause boy i believe in you
blow blow away
oh yes i believe you know i believe in you
move it into overdrive and take me by my hand
listen to the one you love if you're afraid of me
running through the roads of love like a marathon man
the he cant stop running so go
she's got the devil inside her
oh no you cant fool
as the great unloved go dancing all the way
i feel the faint vibration in the air
as the great unloved go dancing all the way
as the great unloved go dancing all the way
a glittering prize
catch me in a dream captured all in heart
first taking heart then our last breath away
crashing into our lives
the sun shot like a laser through my brain
it's a blue sky
everybody knows the mysteries at hand
you can tell my little brother
see me as i figure in your late night plan
hunter and the hunted
and how do i feel living in the eighties
when your hear me screaming
i remember the look in your eyes
all i've got now in my defence
the heat will rise and melt down once again
ideal homes falling down
tragediesluxuriesstatuesparks and galleries
decadence and pleasure towns
and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
how could you disappear out of here
how could you disappear out of here
ooh can we see you
there will come a day
if i had wings
if i had wings
if i had wings
if i had wings
in dream a dream a
what is moving on
courage of dreams
dream a dream a
i want to walk
heat of the day
this city's gone i'm gone over there
if you want to find a hidden key
you can lie but keep it in
i want to go anywhere
close the door down

untouched by flesh of hand
on and on and
flesh of heart
shout below
it was 25 years they take that man away
25 years ago
from the one outside to the ones inside we say
you say to me things should soon be alright
dont call me no wreck
it's so apparent when i walk in the door
another murder story
like a sacred song
never look backward
a red guitar can get you
my whole life took a tumble
i see your face fall in again
lie lie
only mirrors lie only mirrors lie now
just wanted a special view
and what's there to learn
empty
all along the way
dream in the dream with
new gold dream
speaking in verse
i want to catch the rock that's falling
x still marks the time and place
when i hear the lone night music
originally called the cocteau twins
tell me that you're so hot
ooh come on
yet be so nice
come on and do it
young girls are singing out
you make me feel so sad to leave here all alone
it says may little children forget the wild things
but there is a kid called hope
oh jungleland
get up to the mountain top
that's when we all got started
god only knows god only knows
scream if you must
take it from me
empty
shakes his hand
passing on and on
singing shower
lust lust lust
calling calling calling
fear is fast
it's the way it was planned
walk down the track to the old railroad track
you dont know what you've got till the whole thing's gone
wherever i go way down here i know
never want to wait too long
i need the faith to know
and when the feelings show
this time
the human drum
he cant remember
i died today
he cant remember
i died today
you get away if you can
cruel world keeps turning i'm dead on my feet
and your sweet child
with letters from thousands that say ``just who are you''
from montevideo say that i'll be home soon
you float through the night time like manna from heaven
ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh
ooh great wall of love build me a great wall of love
we've deprived them bread and butter
always not enough
they've got worries they've got troubles on their mind
while the children chase the dragon
people making love tonight
see the white clouds roll in
can you still keep going
some shame's like no other
be mine
we'd better speak now
i think of all the things that you said
there's so much more that i cant find
i'm goin to step on up to the waterfront
step on up to the waterfront
said come in come out of the rain
empty
his young life counts for nothing when somebody's getting rich
steeping out of their world into your world into mine
time could be a place a spirit and a face
hold back the years hold back the years
on a quiet night of a white hot day
quiet night of a white hot day
quiet night of a white hot day
i brought her home its where she'd want to be
shine on get home when are you gonna rise
something's going i can tell
two weeks in another town
surviving these changes
and the beat's white hot
whatever the weather
empty
of your friends when they call
in free wonder
hey i'm singing memories
sleep safe in the night now love
sleep safe in the night now love
remembering him life is sweet
for a photograph feigned happiness
his face worn and harrowed
what else could i write
empty
in the sun i feel as one
all in all is all we all are
all babies are born out of great pain
god gives them the stars to use as ladders
there's only love in this world
say that certain word
and now we found our way
sigh that certain sigh
i'm almost in your arms almost in your arms

but this half pint imitation
bewiched bothered and bewildered

i'll sing to him
harsh until he's speaking
the same orders are given by her
young mother down at smithfield
and i love my boy and that's why i'm leaving
in this weekday room
now a man is born to go a lovin
black coffee
and i knew i wanted to be a big star
make you feel good make you feel all right
got my hair shaved off and my black thigh boots
i got the most angelic son
i wanna go dancing darling
long time i've been dreaming of you
on this journey may the good lord guide us
it wont be easy
at sixes and sevens with you
but nothing impressed me at all
i never invited them in
i can think of to say to you
you can never feel
you got a nice big car
and you dig your own grave yeah
it wont happen to us
anybody wanna drink before the war
finnan haddie
that my heart belongs to daddy
finnan heddie
that my heart belongs to daddy
for love is lord of all
she like to listen to rock and roll
that never can do no harm
it dont make me happy this mantrolling
that i'll never trust again
i'm never tired of it
no mans woman
i said nothing can take away these blues
guess what he told me
but i'm willing to give it another try
i had locked my heart away
so you dare to let me shine
my little plot of land i soon did part with
paddy you must go and fight for lincoln
to america i'll have ye's not be going
and i wish i was at home in dear old dublin
my heart lies smothered in my breast
and every moment a different sound
and even when your own heart blinds you
there isnt any answer to the question
kissing your plight
to be kicked around the garden
and throw coins on his back to taunt him
my womb is not a football for you

scarlet ribbons for my hair
scarlet ribbons for her hair
or have we really tried
oh no
now she cries tears of helplessness
but surely you should care
my secret love
now i shout it
i even told
we used to go out
knocked up on our door
oh it's funny what success
i never changed
they pull my hair they stole my comb
saying oh my true love are you well
when she gets a lad of her own
my love
my love
in my arms only
i've been washing the sand
like the back of his hand
searching the shore
like i do you told me to
just cuz you say i do
you know i would have done anything
i dont deserve to be lonely
it got burned
i want to stop it
what you said
john i love you
all over her
this time dont let yourself fly
there hasnt been any explosion
child i love you
you're not supposed to be here at all now
just because of what they said
there's been days like this before you know
we found a great love as we fell inside
just call me joe
into another city where you live far away
dont call me sweetheart
and a storm boomer with light action
and start to say i'll make more human development practices
i will learn how to sink and to swim
i can see too many mouths open
will you stay
when i lay down my head
will you be my mama
lord have mercy
to the frozen ocean in the month of may
and lord franklin among his seamen do dwell
when i can have all the love
i memorize every line
cry remember that first cry
left you nightmares on the pillow
sleep now
i do know man din ka
i feel no pain
i do
in dublins fair city where the girls are so pretty
a live a live o a live a live o
the first time i saw you
give birth to you
oh say you'll see me
i want you
where everything is kept
oh darling i'd treat u right
but if u ever came home in the night
you gave life to me
my little dancer
my angel babby
thank you for hearing me
thank you for seeing me
thanks for not hurting me
thanks for silence with me
thank you for tearing me apart
vampire you suck the life of goodness
you're spending all your money on gare that never work
from now on i'll call you england
i'm looking for your justice and it can not be seen
vampire you're feed on the life of a pure heart
gotta see no love anyway you appear
all of the other food
still feels all the painful feelings
so that there then can be forgiving
but what finally broke us was not starvation
that i can tell you in one word
look at all our young people on drugs
and if there ever is gonna be healing
courage to change the things i can
but now i feel so different
but like everyone else they were stalling
the whole time i'd never seen
feeble i was then but now i'm grown
just to make me think i loved her
the house is burned
fire oh
fire on babylon
in other words
you are all i long for
love you
ever returning you
i know let them not weep
i wake and i find you
and my daughters wont slight you
he went his way homeward
it will not be long love
says i my pretty fair maid wont you come with me
draw near to my garment and there will be seen
o nancy dear nancy 'tis i won your heart
empty
the night is long
the night is long
what will become
just hold back the night
how insensitive
stare in icy silence
all the heartbreak
and stare in icy silence
i am enough for myself
and i am singing your soul
it's time we were together
that i loved as a child
approach me in dread
i'd be sure we'd not sever
see how happy she has made me
that this navy blue bird was me
just you and nobody else but you
i wanna be loved by you
just you nobody else but you
you know i'm looking through you
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
hands gimme loads
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
it seems like years since you held the baby
to offer advice and say how i should be
but i wont go anywhere nice for a while
and i said so
you asked for the truth and i told you
i get the answers if i listen
if you dont know me
you're my daughter
maimed us at the start
words cant express how sorry i am
who can show me how i can
out of history we have come
i'll talk but you wont listen to me
and since then you have taken me for granted
i know your answer already
last night i went to see my love
or perhaps he is gone with some other lover
near there i spent my youthful days
rosy cheeks and ruby lips i own she has my heart in thrall then
but there's none of them can sing so sweet
i'm circling around the sun
oooooh it's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin
i'm not ready yet
and i ask you are you sorry yet
the state i'm in
how come you've never said you love me
oh let glorious love be done
through when your dreams are only blue
i will take from you when i come
to comfort you and get you through
and of course
the smell of you
have brought you closer to me
will always be with me
you'll feel much better when u open
but u put your head on my shoulder
u put your head on my shoulder
if you've never seen a good time
i'd a terrible broken heart
keeping warm
you will rise
i swear i didnt mean
do you want me
but i will rise
you should've left the light on
you wouldnt have begged me to hold you
you're still a liar
take back the pain you gave me
and only loyal love will be me happiness
take back the pain you gave me
and then where do you run
like some other men do
get me some money too
and see what you can find
so you're a fool to attack me
as you did when you were alive
no harder in this world
to the thief of your heart
though your lips never part
bolan snake350
your crime is time and it's
empty
ask general know it all whos juggling the earth
repeat chorus
will there be any objection or a bloody resurrection
her jealous claim to fame has come
she vowed to take 'em any way she can
like valentino with a hand grenade
he said he had the key to heavens gate
pointed at my heart
bang bang shooting like a firing squad
big guns big guns
or just a virgin whore
somethings on your mind
that there would be things in life that couldnt be
and could heal you
empty
cant stand cant stand the heartache
cant stand cant stand the heartache
cant stand cant stand the heartache

she put my cool in shock
a picture paints a thousand ugly words
out on spillin my guts on the news
she saw my picture in a music magazine
c'mon and love me
'cause i just cant wait
megaton leviathan load ready to hit the roof
we're gonna burn you with our brand
so you might as well surrender
be careful or we'll do it some more
eileens calling me
how can i see tomorrow if you keep me in the dark
cycles on the treadmill turn up empty hands
what will summer bring
theyve begun to thrill me
no need to leg or borrow
so i build a fire so i can sit and stare
repeat chorusi listen to the prophets predict the stem of tides
bolan snake310
but all i got to say is
no no no what can i do
to see she's got it all
then love went blind and you would make me see
wished ever after would be like this
but that's the price we paid
love letters in the sand i remember you
beyond the reach of god's faith
please let there be light
tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
should they both let go then let me lay
should this scar then it was meant to be
oh when i'm sad
seems that there's a little trouble down in mexico
feels like i'm livin on a chain gang
feels like i'm livin on a chain gang
i'm riding on a breakdown a suicidal shakedown

kick a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride
you say it's raining but you're pissin down my back
so stop readin me the riot acti never wanted to be president
stop readin me the riot act
the noose gets tighter around my throat
but my day in the sun aint even close
they tore my intentions apart brick by brick
jesus knows my story he kows the position that im in
taking liberties burned by your dictation
smiling like an alligator
the back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze
she'll love ya black and blue sweet little sister
she's my sweet little sweet little sister
wont beg wont bleed
it's gonna take more than a break in the law
sebastian bach bolan
in the name of desperation
paranoid delusions they haunt you
empty
and end a memory
well you think that you're right
why'd you have to make us so uptight
my nasty reputation takes me everywhere
the writing's on the wall
we spend our lives on trial
we are the youth gone wild
forget about god
the highest man on the government table
but that's the american way what it is to be free
he'll satisfy your every need
he'll satisfy your every need
answer his every command
altar of sacrifice curse of the damned
transforming of five toes to two
endlessly searching for salvation
you run
to benefit the aryan race
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
crowded tombs
his face of death staring down
angel of death
taste the sins of hell
death plagues the streets in which they dwell
raise the stake in malice
admonish of the cruciform
emerging from their hellish tomb
not enough to satisfy
the crooked cross
time melts away in this living inferno
mechanized high tech
not the last third war
peace breaks out then
that can be reached for peace
global tension starts aggression
stricken by the force of evil light
break it i must
and captures my soul
the massacre of innocent people
solo hanneman king hanneman king hanneman
eternal the kiss i breath
i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
bleed your death upon me
prepare to reign a thousand years
pain and hunger drives your madness
making the best of the cards i've been dealth
master the art that controls the impure
splattered red you'll find my den
hanneman pennemunde music ascap
do i think you'll win no
checking through the purse
empty
i see they're glad your every move death your final plea
halls of hell spread its wings as i penetrate your soul
see the hatred wasted on yourself
looking for the place where god speaks
of all your suffering
havent found a reason
when the blood steals life from you
slayer 1984 haunting the chapel
counts on the throne must be watching from hell
empty
chemical warfare
empty
soldiers defeated with help from the spell
welcome back
there's no price to pay just follow me
demons feed the furnace where
pray to the moon when it is round
the flames of hades burning strong
hell awaits
step aside for the nightmare
chaotic fury breeds
ticking time bomb
lying there broken looking up as i still stand
eric joie mastrokolas dodwell hansen
i hate you
i hate you
hey somebody hey somebody
empty
hey somebody hey somebody
in my room i want you dear
and fuck like dogs all night long
i'm gonna be your god
bonfire your love is like a bonfire burning deep
dont kick no dust on my
bonfire your love is like a bonfire burning deep
to my scorn
i take you
i fill your emptiness
through these lies await the ungod
nuclear waste in an uncontrolled deluge
suppression is alive and that's for sure
metamorphoses of the earth to a lifeless desert
perfect creation stands over all
you have your own reality
in an invisible man you place your trust
it seems you've lost your way
satisfy my needs
my life's a constant battle
yield your life to me
next in line
can rip your soul apart
and no soul
pain is a deadly reality
just like the choice the choice to kill
we open up our hearts
whistle while
life's a song
empty
that when you bow
i think i was in heaven
by living
emptiness in twilight's rebirth
dead soul
a war raging deep inside my head
thorazine pumping through your veins
and life's blood
screaming god's name i want some more
anguish within let it blind the eys
coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
enter my mind can you stop the rage
lyrics araya music hanneman king
suicide x 4
begging pleading bullets drop like rain
shattered glass bits of clothing and human deceit
memories of tomorrow crying sorrow
mass starvation
i stalk close in from above
certain death is screaming from the sky
casualities are buried through your mind
i walk step by step with death
lead king
overtime killing time
ripping flesh spitting teeth
to kill the exhilaration
and forget your name
close your eyes
innate seed
by my hand i keep testing time
straight flesh lace adorns your neck
they show me everything i need
i've seen all seven faces
i want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
they all look like me
empty
raping again and again
the urge
time and time again
from the depths of hells domain
attack those not knowing my force their fate 1st 3rd time
i am the menace in your eyes
your eyes now filled with blood
i'm in really bad
well i'm happy the way i am
for being a fecal lover
electric circus wild
scattered remnants of life
humanity maintained
a soul that will never rest
avidity and lust controlled by hate
sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity
the loss of all hope and your dignity
share the wisdom of the old world that has passed
lead hanneman
experience a life
spirit in black till the journey's end
afterlife confessions
faded memories haunt you
as past or present words to be
he'll do everything he can
come on control yourself
death to us all
your hurt infractions you know it
it's all around
everybody thinks it's cool
i want to see christ today 4x
empty
wade through blood and spill some more
sabotaged campaign
the wolf leader now is the stalked
prelude to death
a floating mass
death becomes your bride
forever creation has conceived
godlessness is life
salvation forever crucified
master of my enemy
but i
wish i could play the father
you should be standing tall
but i'm
will you remain frozen in time
see your family burned alive
it does no good to pray
this is no bad dream
heathen whore of satans wrath
to fuck this sinful corpse
vengeance with a frenzied hatred
down to the fiery pits of hell
gouging eyes
lead hanneman king
to the ways of the world you've been so blind
from a book of untruths for the weakest mind
tell me what you think of your savior now
see for yourself the lies
that keeps you pure inside
i breach your life
i walk the line
bleeding my ideology through pain
no grave to mark
barbaric thoughts of old
armed behind your back
no suicide
for my own peace of mind i'm going to
everything melts away before your eyes
fuck you and your progress
you've got a fucking catheter in your brain
you were made to take the fall now you're nothing
and i'm a constant threat
within my world of hate
into your brain
ingest the virtues i feed
seep from my eyes
corroding from inside
the only way to exit
modulistic terror
no emotion
modulistic terror
i'm the one to taste your blood
piercing impaling no judgement just punishment
stained in blood
my lust for war will never cease
leave you where your comrades lie
messenger of all demise
seeking life beyond your perishment
my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
what i am what i want i'm only after death
empty
start to rage take to extremes
and bleeding and pleading then death
empty
fall into me the sky's crimson tears
now i shall reign in blood
save me
send your donations
could you be so naive
when doubt subsides his honesty
at midnight on the stake
i signed the book of red
it takes more than one try
leave you ripped and torn
incantation spell gone by
i died
you know they couldnt deal
let me rest in peace
that you might misbehave
but i can see you're unimpressed
let me rest in peace
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
richard hung himself
throw it all away
that poor bastard hung himself the other day
and shredding and stabbing and ripping
cant explain the other side
everyday you life seems like
living in a lie
the resurrections waiting for
i can see your strain
dont you see the power of the enemy
a man impaled upon a cross
that constantly consumes your mind
does anybody even notice
priests condemned
the church will belong to the dead
destruction charged upon the cross
mind control pain unfolds
deterioration of the mind no self control
the rich became the beggars
that paradise lies to the west
drifting flurries of pain
minutes seem like days
skeletons of society
well that was just a lie
well that was just a lie
and you aint no friend of mine
with every dying breath
candles burn the midnight oil
a ritual of endless time
on his trail i'll make you follow
branded in pain
lyrics hanneman king music hanneman king
the human race is to be crystallized
a cure that will kill my invincible foe
searching for the keys
directing power forcibly
still you are eager to seek your fate
lead king
it was never imagined how graphic the reality that would
only in the darkness of christ have i realized
pull her out
pull her out
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
in the depths of a mind insane
empty
terrified by the thought that you are all alone
i've got the right
i taste your tears caress your face
i'll shoot the violence through you
feel your warmth from inside your skin
lead hanneman
forever serve beneath its hand
empty vessels chanting for your death
haunting cries the dead scream for me
staring eyes of glass now empty
die by my hand in pools of blood
try to escape the grasp of my hand
the wisdom of the wizards
not once has anyone ever seen
the beauty of death we all adore
i'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies
you cant tear that out of me
disintegration you bastard
i just dont want no more
life is slavery working 9 to 5
my mind is subjected to all
i know what i am i'm berlin
the legal system has no spine
things are different than before
there's nothing for you to regret
administrative anarchy there's nothing
how did i reach this place
in my mind is only pain
god's piercing through my soul
transfixed martyr saving race
all the memories are drained
the world that you despise
killer accuse me
to hide in your disguise it goes on and on and on
waiting to unfold
deteriorate your makers met
lyrics hanneman king music king
empty
our axes are growing with power and fury
i'm suicidal maniacal self destructive
why dont you take a good look in these eyes
i want to take a bullet in the fucking head
there's nothing more for me to say
i know you'll find a way
in no one's way caught in a crossfire
lying in a pool of blood
expendable youth
i am alive you cant kill me
your running through the endless maze
crisis feeds the lunacy
castrate society
covering the truth again
in a world too shallow to defy
empty
senseless death of all mankind overtakes
empty
she cost you your life
and now your gone
you're full of shit
i dont want to hear it
i dont want to hear it
i know you're full of shit 4x
empty
your death is my salvation
the pain will never end
feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
satisfy the scorn

you'll see genocide
nothing can save you
touching you inside
nothing can save you
your scream in your grave
buffy demons
walking through the part
that she's just
going through the motions
lynched somebody
i've only served
bury a round of lead in the chest
confetti of flesh
used with conviction
unending repercussions
spectors of doom await the moment
to sabotage the carcass earth
nobody's out there to save us
sell your soul for all it buys
from now things are done my way
have you ever wondered why
cant see living this lie no
watching disciples
empty
lyrics hanneman music hanneman king
it's what i was meant to be
the birth of satans son
all love is lost
he makes his move to conquer the land
blitzkrieg tactics of the german command
born with the power of god in his hand
lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time
every fucking endless day
with shit i cant identify you know it makes me
no one stands a chance when i'm lashing out
losing all perspective
i see the fright in your eyes
in the coldness all alone
empty
by verbal abuse
i get into trouble
they'll come around again and again
you wont feel a thing
smash their head
kill you before you kill each other
so many years ago
but i dont recognize all these things
alone alone alone alone
a type that wont subside
empty
encircle the front lines
when victory's a massacre
soldiers of attriction
propaganda war ensemble
the sport is war total war
this aint about me
madness is coming your way
you dont concern me
warzone this is where it's going down
empty
all what cant we face
where do we go from here

charles singleton marie mccoy
baby trying to get to you
well if i had to do it over
it was he who brought me through
for me to feel
they say that it feels so nice
you wait you'll cum every time
should i buy it i dont wanna
but i dont know why why she swallowed that lie
i sign i sign i sign anonymous
hot hot go back these eyes are shut
banned from the end of the world
i always make you so stronger
cant you see that i need to
i'd set your heart on fire but arson is no way
you come in between me and the darkness
use me up just to fan the flame
hot enough to melt our heart into a locked embrace
will she know who i am
fickle fancy fickle girl
i'm your monster i'm not like you
i can prove to you it's all fake
empty
empty
when the feeling finds you out
but i tell you it's no use
outta this mess baby outta my head
i'm here for now
dig me in
dig me in
like you're nineteen
that works just like a child
i know what you are
watch you with their eyes
dont think you wanna know
not peice by peice
do you think i'm an animal
they're calling on me
like stars so small
what you want to know what can you believe
it's a hard place cant be friends we cant be enemies
the hardest part is things already said
why do good things never wanna stay
as long as i'm not i'm not
empty
we're manufacturing hearts we've got the perfect thing
we're trying to reduce that heart on heart crime
and i am getting out of here
empty
i'm her again
counterfeit or real
then in the darkest hour i watched you disappear it's a crafty scene full of power and greed
that it's not real
do you want to hurt me
how to please you
you like it when i scream and then you tell me
and swallow all my pride
hide the paper hide my mind
your calm belief your piece of mind
you take what i want
yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's what i thought
put on our best frowns
i'm the queen of rock and roll
empty
empty
hear my voice
shake it baby
you know they say
i'm the water i'm the dishes i'm the soap
i peeled potatoes set the table washed the floor
smile pretty take take the money
damaged goods
did ya want me
oh i think i wanna
i walked with arrogance with vanity
i'll start a new life on my own
i know i shouldnt ask why i wake up feeling dead
we can just pretend today isnt goodbye
let's go back to what what we came here for
without a path that i should take
but some things are passed down anyway
it's just my stuff it's just my
oh tell me baby what's wrong
it's not what you want it's everything got my foot on the floor
the dress you wore
for you things were
and you know why
because the doors were locked for you
when you get lost becoming a man
it wasnt so nice
i'm feeling so down
'cause it doesnt work that way
i want money
i know what you want from me
if you want everything's changing
here we are
i cant find you
and i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream
stay where you are
set it on fire
stuffed in the corner little girl lost
to make sure i'm still here
empty
a cheap little house
i'm throwing it out
i cant be alone tonight
could be i'm not gonna find you
nothing the same after tonight
nothing is gonna make it right
and i saw you sit there smiling
when i look and i cant find you
for you to want me here to stay
tongue is tired
now there's no time left
on the brain
i'd rather fly dont want to get caught in this endless race
never let them see your heart is pounding full of hope
there's no bigger spotlight than show
you said this would be
this song your song
what you think what you do
can you hear me telling on you
our love is the size of these tumors inside us
in a hospital room
you got your words
it could fill the sky
i'll sotp the clock
cant stand the thought
do i sound crazy
i got it words guitar
i play it words guitar
oh let me have that sound tonight
i've got a message for you
we'll get to heaven on time
could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you
could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you
empty
that she'll come around turn up frowned outside down
she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
empty
the waters getting warm so you might as well swim
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
i know she wants green tea ice cream
cool boys playing pool stop and stare at the way she moves
your asteroids bounce off her like a trampoline
but the joke is getting tired and old and dangerous
come on baby and speed your lust to me
you spend your nights at home crying
fat ones whacked ones give me some
momma tole me boy you best behave
you merry gentle men always bet on red
so he took me for a ride in 'is big ol sleigh
remember tonight
but i'll have a blue blue christmas
we cant see what you say
you can come down to me 2x
so why should it be that
make no mistake
it feels so nice i want your arms to wrap around me twice
i cant get enough of you baby
cant get enough of you baby
just trying to relax i find myself on the couch with big plans but there's always tomorrow
i took a trip to the bar does my money go far can you show me just how to spend it
dont wanna be down
dear inez
you gotta believe
dont do nothing
you dont want none
and you've got it good as bad as it gets
and while the other try to take your spot
you jive you shuck you jab you stick
still i cant put out the flame
i'm so diggin your scene
can anybody tell me why we're springer bound
today you sat up half asleep and stared
every day i see you sinking low
disconnect the dots and be on your way
its time to go to town
under the radar
we've tuned out
if you didnt notice
all planets in line with the disco ball
who did you know coming up
in fifteen minutes you're a neanderthal
and here i've gotta stay
and aeroplane that passes by
on the right side of the wrong bed
on the right side of the wrong bed
road man he dont mind police man
who was crushed by his beloved sound system
i have known you forever
i'm the asteroid that will infiltrate your soul
they'll laugh and they'll stare
and we're so invisible to them
and dress codes and i'm one too many people there
locomoting to the groove
now that she's gone she turns me on
empty
jackie o did she know did she know
she turns me on on on on on
and i heard them say dont be square
anything strange is wrong
i'm holdin on to my old mans sneakers
we were there at the start we've got polaroids to prove it
can you help us find the ones on the missing posters
use your super powers and rescue me
can you really see the future or just predict the weather
there is a fine line wearin thin
it's becoming so insane
we got the hands to turn this around
loud and clear
we got the voice fillin this room
in the mirror it's you that i see
i'm going back down to what is worse
never seem to ever let up
i lose my solitude
you're the bull of the ball
all the singers booted up
drink 'em up drink 'em up fight fight fight
just like all the other times before
my mind is blown but it's my own
you dont have to move to groove
i get to the party but i'm too late
i check my account and the money's all gone
hey that's the story of my life
i get to the party a little too late
you think it's fun you think it's fun and games
so you dont wanna fix it
no one can see
empty
you're laughing as i'm sinking down
dont know much but i have a clue
i slipped the man a twenty the keys to a hunsay
i gonna keep the chrome out of the ride
the cops the kids their checkin out the ride
i hit a as it's goin off
and i been thinkin 'bout what we've become
times havent changed i'm still swimmin
to tell the kid exactly where not to go
i can taste the blood
that everyone wanted to hear
i know its over
we are the in set
where have you been
on the swing set
never ever ever
it's no secret
take a bow
just in time
duck everybody
just in time
tomorrow's gonna hurt
and every single day is just a fling
there's nothing left for me to choose
wear my underwear steal my shirts
get outta my hair get outta my head
what's a man suppose to do
she was high she was really bye bye
she packs the pipe as much as she can fill
all that she could up with is this
even make a jamaican man sing a happy song
and teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
but if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin on the sun
repeat chorus
i'm lookin at my watch
i'm moppin up the floor
when i was carrying you
could you be lovelier
could i be luckier
and i just wanna make it crystal clear
eyes shielded with a shaky hand
with obvious and used excuses
and the children gather and wonder
i seen ya i seen ya i seen ya standing in it everytime
they wouldnt have you in the mafia
i want you to know
and i'd rather be hung from a tree or shot by a gun
and and and on top of this list of things before i leave this place
you said it wasnt all right but it would be all right
and even when i get home somehow you're still alone
empty
you know that i am
but you're not
i come home stumbling
dont you take my dollar
i'm just trying to get rid of you
i could never forgive you
all the little kids gettin down to the rhythm
the earth she speaks when she's pale
repeat chorus
and be just like the other men
i made a deal with you
talk like you too
i wanna walk like you
if you dont wanna be
if you think there's something i should know
get what you need take it please
if you think there's something i should know
not a trace of doubt in my mind
now i'm a believer
get up stand up stand up c'mon throw your hands up
if your girl steps up i'm smacking the hoe
'cause when i shoot to give i shoot to kill
i'm comin to get ya i'm comin to get ya
if i knew then what i know now
it made me feel really ill in a beautiful way
awesome electronica track
and are they looking down and laughing hard
and about the prices
we've seen each other around
then i hope someday you'll know
yes you better love your mother
you better cup your hands with gratitude
daddy's always gone and mommy's on the sauce
you see she needs to get her prescription filled
who said anything about a fair life
gonzo again just another entry to the never ending story
i ought to better my best behavior
but the twist of fate bridge was gonna burn anyway
we've been hitchin a ride with a big fake rubber thumb
empty
out of sight
and watch it slip away
and watch it slip away
it's easy to get knocked out of the game
i'll take any flick with al pacino
repeat chorus
stay out of the papers
now that we have that out of the way
she came and then she drove away
she came into town and then she drove away
blood is the rose of mysterious union
remember when i used to your jellybean
that said i would no longer be your love boat
now you're after me screaming you dirty rat
just he started to believe everything was hunky dory
no x
and it works the street tonight
well i'm just another creep
days they go too slow i'm blinded
you'll see my game's on fire
i'm a moving violation baby hot hot hot hot
why dont you set me free
keep your hands off my door
and what's it all about
piss on you
but the hangman isnt hangin
then you love a little wild one
so you hide them when you're able
every word means no 2x
i'm looking around in directions
another victim of ordinary fame
like anybody would
i'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
i'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
i'm wishing that i had wings so that i could become one
your friends keep telling me
and maybe its me

wiped out everyone who will stand in their path
mounted on horseback the devil in man
the shadows of murderer will cover the light
their names are standing for the wrong direction
he didnt realize the fact that love cant be commanded
welcome to the surgery hearts will be removed
at the threshold of entrance
recovered from the badcondemned to leave this awful world
to commit suicide
support us be ready to fly or to smite
his enemies tribulated of ordeals are mere liars
never ending pain
never ending pain
now the regime is overthrown
a leader in my haggard dreams
your touch was like a snakebite kiss
pining up their toys on the shoulders of the nation
nuclear winter
clouds of dust will hide the sun forever
by the nuclear sword of damocles
commander with good conscience
damocles proud and mighty among men
mankind can be bind
stars grow in lonely nights
hidden in a sacred ark
wept my waters lost forever
fear and care doth pierce the soul
find no sacred ark to swim in
empty
you go right off the track nobody escape
confessions in the dark
empty
heavenly shpere voice strike up
chains of agree let nature square
empty
hierarchy of occultism lession
sweetness of your dirty love
darkening the sun of my hopes
emotions of a fool
trace him to the place of fright
executed children
the saw is the law
the saw is the law
des willens beraupt
rettet eure hintern
empty
wird auch euch nicht schaden
the matador in shining dress
no way out the fronts are clear
the slaughter to inaugurate
he is dead and they are gone
crueltys bleeding place
fall of majesty town
follow your leader with incence obedience
a holy place
and in seven days was the town destroyed
abnormal inclination
she cant control her
abnormal inclination
living spaces contaminated
lost games wrong aims
waiting for the end of time
a thing of the past
a secret love affair
fellows in misery
but she found a congenial fellow
fellows in misery
repressed for so many years
my mind feels so much flattered
empty
the enemy that overshadows us all
an easy target for the one with the gun
diseased thoughts you get scared
like driving up foliage
incredible hate my cure for tomorrow
displaced by war neurosis
the only wayunder suspicion
i cant forget the day you tapped my vein
be prepared for the worst
gisela 40 stark behaart sucht nicht nur herren von welt
dein wunsch ist mir befehl
the son of our lord
where also our lord
side by side fighting not changing the course
the trapdoor will fall
empty
i'll surely never get reduced to penury
your deceitful lies call
i learnt a way to survive
i learnt a way to survive
they got no reason
are you prepared
bullet in the head
between heaven and earth
nuclear warheads are ready to fight
we live our life in grieved desire
sold their soul for native love
departure to conquest the hamburger hill
capture the flag
slaughtered one by one
the promised words we never forget
get on with your fight
observe the ten commandments
image of a god
mediaeval extravagance of christianity
lift up your heads
christ passion
for better or for worse
discriminated without permission
exasperated defamations
code red
and i got me a heavy bet
i've got me a whole month's wages
they say chances on the outside
earthery joys at midnight
tarred and feathered
the rising of the corpse begins
company of heaven has sent us a chosen apostle
intolerable blackness helms him
vices and virtues words
in witness whereof what hell can create
are deeply engraved in yourself to go on
tremendous search
praying for god everyday for his scorn
takes you off the ground
at zero hour
stops your beating heart
tonight you are the star
delight in slaying
delight in slaying
my judgements true and righteous
delight in slaying
ich nenn sie stumme ursel
mich selber zu beflecken
manchmal hab ich das verlangen
bring mein blut in wallung
fr'n weib aus fleisch und blut
meine ursel
dont walk away dont walk away
when will this dreadful nightmare end
your big brown eyes look sharp
number one in your face
eat me
send you legally to hell
indescribable ecstasies
coursing of souls suck up the blood
from the dawn of time we came
our words of confession
leave behind the past
we are among you
almighty his chivalry urge
a red blazed aperture let see
doze away to the ground
after carnage is over grinded bones
obsessed by cruelty
like hot cakes
out of the frying pan
out of the frying pan
satan sends his warriors
angel dies
outbreak of evil
dont shoot a man into his back
your persuasion i dont care
thumb buster's draw
sector madness kill and destroy
persecution mania tremendous dreams
persecution mania driven me mad
'cause devils in my head tonight
from birth 'til my decayit's not a strong mans act to fall in ecstasy
subject for suppressions land
pretenders to the throne
in god we trust
nocturnal flush frenzied and rude
so man i came with lance and sword
mephisto the oppressor
nobody knows lust and temptation
false celebration
thy kingdom come thy will be done
empty
they left their life in fire
and the believe in god
your soul disappears in eyes of blue
everlasting fortune
welcome to the paradise
give credence to heaven
flesh to your bones
worship liberty and love
with flowers of gold
niemals werd' ich den frieden finden
schwerter zu pflugscharenverdunkelt hast du mir die augen
du wirst vor mir zu kreuze kriechen
that looks at me
the dignity of man
beyond the grave
come execute your instruction with spell
a funeral song out of the burial place
immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
pouring out
immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
psychotic morbid brain
and everything that moves is all the energy for him
at the first opportunity
accusing words dont reach my ear
and all my friends are crying to god my soul to save
magazine filled with hollow points
see the knife flash the sun
tired and red to my last breath
tired and red squirm to plead to dry
to wait the coming morrow
the good the bad and the ugly
who broke the law
now they have to pay the price
they dont know what is really going on
and exalt them of low degree
unbury the hatchet
we shot them down
born in bad relationships
cowards of the revolution
unwanted youth
the shattered dreams of an intact world
growing up in gutters to learn the tricks
burn them to the bone
eine klingel ohne namen nirgends registriert
leichen pflastern euren weg
wie wlfe im schafspelz zu allem bereit
empty
vom goldrausch gelenkt
barbarically electrified by terror and by pain
with penchant for decease
visual buggery
from birth til eternity
her open wound
feel her damp walls
was seh ich denn da
'n kaffee oder bier
der wachturm ist die offenbarung
komm mit uns und opfere dein geld
empty
wander in the valleyas you reach for the sky
perpetual glares of those who are delivered
i'll bring up all my biggest guns
repentence of my inner soul
warlike conspiracy
greedy for desire
no chance for your rebirth
to kill the beast of thunder
stripped of all my dignity
you earn what you desever
witchhammer greedy looked eyes
witchhammer burning souls
never disown you never treat you unkind
ninety nine percent of the time x3let's move in together
hey nobody's keeping you from stopping
nobody's keeping you from stopping
the papers read that the king is dead
and the problems should be too few to mention
the truth is almost always confidential
there was a time and there was a place
doin hopscotch with my legs tied
holdin on to what's left of real life
it's a second hand story no one wants to hear
he liked amputation and the lord above
she read a story in the paper how she was victimized
chance to feel normal but now you're in too deep
if you're coming with me i might be on your way
beggars and choosers
you'll sell it to your children you'll sell it to your wife
at the end of the track is a two bit shack
meet me on the
it's a bitter pill to swallow
one less thing to call my own
that's a bitter pill to swallow
better get yourself a little street smart
there's a darkness looming but the sun is shining bright
beating me up until i'm bleeding
street cowboy with a badge that says can do what you please
bow down to the badge and colors black and blue
wont you fill up the tank let's go for a ride
but this place just makes me feel sad insidemother do you know where your kids are tonight
wont you fill up the tank let's go for a ride
who'll forgive me who's to say if it's right or wrong
staying out all the time
when everything you wanted somehow leaves
and they tell you which way not to go and
empty
and each one's one in a million
i see something new in each and every moon
laughing at the other end
just how long is all of this really gonna last
why dont you go home and crawl into your hole
to the other corner i knew i'd be there soon
we will always be busy making misery
forever after happily making misery
money talks these days and everybody listens
everybody's listening everybody's listening all those eyes are glistening
dollars shrieking ha ha ha jokes's on you
and who is the hound at the downtown dog pound
i've learned to accept and not to expect
you know it's hard to be nice when hate becomes your vice
empty
and it's never
do you think that maybe you could teach me something
it's not like i'm asking you to hold up the sky
gotta be home by seven
and no one will know what to wear
you will never get another piece of me
but still i'm trying to find you in this blackoutwhere it's warm inside and always open late
but i'll wake up on the front steps of your door
sold out their trades to become drug dealers
to pacify all the killers and rapist
but you've gotta show up for yourself at the end of the day
one fine day the pilgrims came
hoping something cracks
now understand this is no mans land
to twist you into shape
there's nothing to have here
it's enough to make you sick
i'm gonna let it wash all over
and when i reach some understanding
there's no time
i've nothing to write home about
every one just looks away just like any other day
no one told me i'd be taken for a fool
you know i'm just a cowboy
i aint got nowhere
are you all done
and he's bumming nickels and bumming dimes
instant millionaire without a care it didnt change a thing
i talked to him that's what i found
there'd be enough to go around if i could just get around you
nobody's working and it's gone on far too long
go to sneak up behind you
and its hard to understand the things you say
'cause in the morning you might be dead
but its better that way
streets are filled with broken glass
and every little thing about this tells me
that every little thing about this tells me
and as i watch you walk away
put the bone in
and i do want to bring him home something
on a ticket that goes two ways
so you bring it down to size and
but i'm growing into you
there's one thing that i know that's perfectly clear
forewarned if hindsight is all that makes you right
saving crowds from the roar from the cutting room floor
flame's burning brightly and shines in so lightly
and i'm almost there
i'm away from the jerks i'm away from the works
wrapped up in a haste and by mistake got thrown away
stuck inside this fleeting moment
cause i'm homesick for the home i've never had
call me selfish call me what you'd like you think it's right
now you want perfection to your self destruction
it just slips out when i yawn
if you never let me breathe
dont know what i was hoping for
stop the truck at the truck stop i need something to help me crash
i was waiting for a chain reaction with the missing link
doorways open up and close more ways to a punchline
but i will still be laughing
she walks into the outhouse
the cold air holds her like a theif
and just wants to be so just like anyone
is it joy is it pain
look out for if you know what i mean
is it bitter is it sad
if i can keep it up
just to keep it up
keep it up x8
and when you shine
how to get out of it
living the lies of hate
dirt around you and
usually washes out
and dirt keeps following you
dirt will find you and
but you've been replaced
i give you my heart but you just say i make you feel like a whore
by the chill that you gave me i will ride
but these rules were meant to be broken make myself uneasy
now if i'm late and i'm making you wait
it's more than amusement now
everything's so true to life when you're not living
with a saturated liver
it's pretty stuffy under there
it wouldnt be so hard to sink
i should have learned to swim instead
been down so far i dont get wet
my pappy taught me how to float
goin down
waving back to the folks on shore
not quite as blind as you might think she'd be
and they cut off your wings and replaced them with strings
what do you think makes her that way
the mother offers up the child to the preaching of channel two
save me my dear goddamned lord wont you please take me hand
too far
it's a mountain made of sand crumbling under me
there's a ringing in my ears that's heaven sent
i need to feel you put your hands around me
but every day i get up calm down give up hang around
and everything seems darker than before
short of dying just the other day fell short of picking up a mop
i've been keeping it inside
i'll always be on your side
you said you want to be want to be want to be want to be
every time you move your lips
you just stood there shaking stood there shaking
i took a shot of cocaine and away i run
i thought i was her daddy but she had five more
where i was judged by twelve honest men
i wont forget the day i shot that bad bitch down
give it up give it a name
lose the cradle chain
give it up give it a name
stay wont you stay
never can complain
i am that someone
if the rain wants to come in you can let the rain in
habits form without a warning
dont do this dont touch that hey
hey do it for the last time
down on up to me down on up to me
you're wide awake
who do you answer to when
than to expect anything
when you watch over me i am blessed
can you cut this diamond in the rough
a slice of life to last through all the years because sooner
faith and all the things you've come to hate you give and you
and the toilet aint flushing and the toaster is smoking
but he saw the world through the eyes of a child
she saw the world through the eyes of a child
nixon was a liar
ure sellin yourself
maybe im afraid what it might do
im not pushin uall of the lands are terribly restless
talkin about u
so what can u call it now
nobody said it would be easy
leeway leeway
i'm gonna get away from all this someday
will i have to beg and borrow
send me running back to mother
the ground you walk ons sacred
i was a key that could use a little turning
seems like i should be getting somewhere
day and night earth and sky
runaway train never going back
i'll spend the rest of my life trying to figure you out
now i know that something's wrong
promise that you wont yell
sir i dont even want to know
i dont even give a damn
so make it soon
ship of fools drunken hearts
i've been loved and hated
just ridiculous
just dysfunctional
i'm sick of that song about how you look at life
and the time flies by like a vulture in the sky
i'm waiting by the phone
i'm waiting for you to call me up and tell me i'm not alone
leaning hard on yet another drug
there aint nothing i cant live with nothing i cant live without
wasting time only to find
i have seen these closing doors
comes whipping comes whirling
no time to choose it
undermining all that we know
my little world has lost control but still it keeps on spinnin
something you're good at to use up your time
beg for some affection
you say get out of my way
i said hey brown girl i seen tears through the window of the junk shop
nobody's home
oh dont make me feel so strange and i feel even stranger
who grow up to become the first president
with a broom and a knife and blood on his hands
and the preacher just left in the middle of the service
on the necklace that broke late last night
take it to the rooti cant take it always in my face
she'd talk to herself but wouldnt know what to say
she held her breath and considered death
she always though it was 'cause she was too fat
let me know
and you were the county line
jealousy is just a game
you must polish all the time
she never gets paid
now you're tired your day is over
wake me up and let me go from somebody i used to know
trapped at the top of the merry go round
whatever the price is whatever the crisis
whatever the price is whatever the crisis
i'm a high society skid row bum
they may say what they say about the way that we stay
you'll never believe the things i've found
i just had to let you know i cant conceal it
in your early years
and you hide no more
tearing out what's been trapped in
i'm strung out on pretty pretty girls i forgot about the rest of the world
when the end begins again needles needles i'm sticking them in
sunday's just another day
and she gave me this look i could not believe
there we were just we three
and here we are just we three
empty
see the open mouth of my suitcase
everything is possible
the right thing changes from state to state
naked in the cold sun
and leads the scorched ones here
now i'm in control
and i thought it was the 4th of july
santa you're my king
empty
loosely buying your cheating your lying
we couldnt look a saint in the eyes
no one can save
grow and decay
mother who's your man
deep into the ground ground
'neath the black the sky looks dead
steal the warm wind tired friend
i know youre half awake yeah i know hate
so tear it out and open it
and altogether gone
no matter how hard i fall nothing can break me at all
dont let the world get you down
follow me into the desert
i shot my love today would you cry for me
and if you live you can fall to pieces
the day will finally come in
not necessarily dumb but just uh beautiful beautiful
sitting here like uninvited company
sitting here like wet ashes with x's in
sitting here like wet ashes with x's in my eyes
it's backing down and under
everything's real to me
i can count it on my fingers
now i'm into plastics
now trouble's far away and mother in her cage
i wanna make it righti'm on the wire over and higher
on and connected i'm overfloating now
i want to be kingi want to make the toys
i want to be king
a cleaner love
pick it up
i dont care what you need
fall out and take the bait
out from and far away
what you got me hanging from
i wait and show tha lame
music cameron lyrics thayil
begat tomorrow
and hit me with a hand of broken nails
i'm gonna break
when the forest burns
i'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
searching for a ground
searching for a ground
every word i said is what i mean
i said what's in it for me
there's no more rides for free
wheels go driving slow
i try to try and i live to live
like to moon to earth
i'll search for the sky
spoonman come together with your hands
music cornell lyrics cornell
you dont have to try
you dont have to cry
first it steals your mind
empty
i tried to tell her a thousand times
make me feel alright deep inside
switch opens
stumbling and wander in the moonshine
i suckle life
drop the blade and watch the rolling heads
one more time around might do it
i should have stayed in bed
fell too far to start again
tight and deep
lyrics by chris cornell
just add it up to the hot rod death toll
but the ugly truth
i painted my mind
it's ugly
mumbling and crying
i dont feel like calling you buddy
strong are your bones
i stumbled on and all the world fell down
i've found
and bound to die alone
along her vain paradein her uniform
fopped last night and the night before
shoppin wiggle to the floor everybody was foppin
fopp me right dont you fopp me wrong
they stood back and gave me all the floor
fopped so hard that i lost my shoe
but when were foppin that dont mean a thing at all
long time coming
if it sits upon your tongue
throw yourself away
then one went full on kevins mom
we were three
road worthy hungry and mean
get on the snake
shoot shoot shoot till their minds
all on our own
the truth is borni got an idea of something
mr full mr have
let it be known today if youve got two hands
hands all over the eastern border
then lay down their oily blanket
put your hands away
he failed and he failed quite bad
we see you try
head injury head injury head injury
head injury
holy water is rusting me
damn the water if it's life
now they run to hunt you down
starved dogs howling run to hunt you down
i left for work
and you swear to me
that i would never feed you pain
it wouldnt pain me more to bury you rich
whomsoever i've cradled i've put you down
hands are for shaking
my mother says that it's alright
music lyrics cornell
show me the power child
where the dogs are shedding
gives me away
stretch the bones over my skin
slip down the darkness to the mouth
she's resolved to be
love's like suicide
i had to think of something sweet
how she'd fly so sweetly
when the whole thing
dont run to me
i'm the wreck of you
when the whole thing
and the fall
is the break
go where the reptiles roam
little joe run for the border
loud love
i want something to explode
i know i'm headed for the bottom
but i'm riding you all the way
music lyrics cornell
and i've been caught in a mind riot
i'm tied within
empty
take if you want a slice
and piss on my gate
if you like to kneel
if it helps you see
save it just keep it
feed the prison save the eyes
the only color is red red
the only color is red
and i'm down sized inside
growing like a weed
it wont live if i die
come on
come down
and love on my head
make your own ind
stealing everything there everything
egg that cracks falls on your head
someone says my words are out of balance
youve got nothing nothing to say
seremos uno los dos
no importa que asunto
ya veras como hoy
i need some love like i've never needed love before
take it or leave it
i need some love like i've never needed love before

a few cards a few calls
trudge on home to celebrate

w o m a n can u truly love a woman

all this damage inside
and i'm left here with nothing nothing to live for
all the promises you made to me you made in vain
stuck in your ways
you cant take away
you can feel my pain
i cant fight these feelings they will bring you pain
and if you chose to walk away i'd still be right here waiting
i've made a commitment
you always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
so loud why cant you hear it
all the demons in my head wont leave me
and i hate my world
what foryou cant conceive it
i cant you wont let me
is something you all ready all ready know
and all i see
i cant live without
empty
i sit alone and watch the clock
believe in me
believe in me
hear my words
believe in me
the road is showing now on my face
so i could be no one again
a book that cant be read
from this moment
of all these things
how i feel
never showing
i'll die alone
going any further
your gonna keep pushin
all these fuckin thoughts inside my head
terry date limp bizkit staind
now they got me in a cell 'cuz my records they sell
never badder than bad 'cuz the brother is madder than mad
radio stations i question their blackness
makin a music abuse it but you cant do it ya know
turn it up bring the noise
fucken suck ass
cant believe
empty
i've felt this
how do i feel i've been here before
i've felt this
every time you want me to be
something i could never be
well i dont know what to say
a little peace is hard to find
waiting for me to begin
craving all of your deadly vices
everything's the same
everything 3x
you dont see me
you dont own me because i dont care
reluctantly waiting for you to interfere
empty
from his self created hell
but i swear i'm not the devil
your words just disappear
'cause its always raining in my head
forget all the things i should have said
but everything changes
who knows what we could do
if you just walked away
empty
empty
the best of me
empty
quiet in my corner
lost in nievate
makes clean the mess i have made
and we throw it all away
it's hard to be forgiven
it's hard to be forgiven
a little girl lost just stands there and cries
your little worlds you'll never fix
and you
my burdens at the door
that i felt like this wont end
more time than anyone
that i've cried
i cant mend
see to the real you
my head is a barricade
you take this all for granted all the things that used to be you by keeping you distracted just long
from a breakdown
up to you
while you still believe
four from the
you say
to the things
pardon me
and it's starting to tear from within
never knew this would be so political
who the fuck did you want me to be
then i wouldnt feel so out of place
necessary to medicate
necessary to medicate
cant see through this
can you see
there are no rules
but everything still feels the same
what you pay to play the game
then all you see
empty
of what you have to offer
that you see
it's raining
it's your heart
come on
it's raining again
feel youre alive and this is all part of it
cause it seems like a rainy day parade
empty
i've never been someone who knows
i cant take this
somewhere that's safe
or are you hiding from the scars of your own reality
to fullfill your addictions
eyes that set me free
tell the story of your pain
the life i live will never be the same without you here
you were just to busy with yourself
you never took the time
i just stuffed it down
you were never there for me
something deep inside you is probably to blame
got your fingers burned by burning candles at both ends
empty
if dont you believe that you can find a way out you you solve the problem solve the problem
you're in my veins
and all the stupid games we play
gets us nowhere way too fast
me feel like i'm not a person
the thoughts from my mind
same 4 walls
the thoughts from my mind ask for sanity
when will i be dead
another cure to fix your day
empty
right in my face
and friends like that just dont add up
i cannot forget
empty
everyone plays the hand they're dealt
so the drama never ends
empty
fuck you to the jaded and the fake
and it's been awhile
and it's been awhile
the consequences that i've rendered
since i've seen the way the candle lights your face
since i said i'm sorry
that i've rendered i've stretched
as fucked up as it may seem
the candle lights your face
i'm sorry
i wish that this would just go go
i feel so alone
such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful
you i trusted your intentions a trust you took advantage of now you are sitting in the hole that you
how does someone get to be like you
life will find a way to bring this karma to you
i had to stop and sing along
and helped see through his darkest times
your life you gave
forget tomorrow
and found along the way
had to borrow
like a song without a name
and found along
i guess she doesnt have a choice and i'm sorry
i cant believe i'm just an addict
i'm begging you to please come save me from myself
waste my time commiserating
when there's something to conceal
run away the ebb and flow consuming
demons i am forced to keep
sound that way
but i'm alone for now
through your eyes everythings clear
i'm getting sick of this
just hold out your hand
what i'm giving
is you
just save me
am i forgiven
should i be afraid of this face that i see
i'm always having with myself
i'll show you how it feels to be
but if you had told me when i was much younger
betrayed by the voices in my head
once inside our i can get at what's inside
lost my feelings with my dealing
i will self destruct
its not what it was before
all the struggle we thought was in vain
and this is the smile
cant breathe
kinda like the way everything is gray
cant breathe
the scabs on your face
i dont look like you do the things you do shut up
before but that was yesterday i try to walk right
before but that was yesterday i try to walk right
leave me here i'm dying
to see if i can push you any further
please believe you'll save me rearrange me
all alone
wont help you everything you need is right in front of you
that you feel maybe tomorrow wont be so bad
she'll make it go away
i cant fake this
now the sun has gone away
cant erase this
and in this world
you're the shore
since this storyline began
it sheltered me from nothing but the weather
cant change my mind
and those stars
that i once thought had passed me by
the way i am it's the way i am
i'm not very good at just paying attention
it's the way i am you'll never change
this is it
but you should take this for what it's worth
this is it
i could give a rats ass
look at you i cant
empty
empty
inside this isnt really what i had in mind
you and this road
but i'm alone for now
through your eyes
now it's time to say goodbye
inside your arms
they cant repace
they cant repace
and fuck him
i should take
the life you waste
empty
not a place to hide
i'd like to say
i'll always love you
to explain to you what i have been through
so lighting up a cigarette i followed in pursuit
so i turned around and forty thousand headmen hit the dirt
painter paint the scene
play this song
but when the hope and the love has gone
get back up and try againthough your future's not plain
what you've got he'll take
money's spent all the words are said
this time to the sky i'll sing if clouds dont hear me
'cause my rock 'n roll is putting on weight and the beat it goes on
yeah you're back into my life again
i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited
the party's over better walk away
just save the party for another day
well i'm near the end and i just aint got the time
we go round and round dont know where we're bound
baby this is true romance take it while you see a chance
the dealer's made another deal
feeling nothing deep inside
feel the music inside you i'll be there too
and we turn into music now we never will lose it
a feather duster's no substitute for the real thing
of memories i've cherished so long
staring at empty pages centered 'round the same plot
every day every day every day oh lord
each day is music reach till you find the song
from a cut price lady to second hand woman
love's a light it keeps leading us on
oh the sight when we're both coming through
sundown coming down too soon no time to be alone
it's not the darkness it's just the night's so long
but there was a loneliness i could not ignore
after we spoke deep inside i knew
you are the one that i needed
it makes my life a carnival
'bout what goes on in the real world and such
half of us is easy the other half is hard
sometimes i think i know too much
it's a fine line a very fine line
spy in the house of love
who hold to the game
though sometimes it does get lonelyi still walk out in the morning light
here's to players who cant leave their song
take it as it comes
some like it hot and some like it cool
all the plays end there's no curtain call
any day now the curtain may fall
an out of work musician plays a solo saxophone
it's all that they can do
woman never minds pulls the shade and draws the blinds
and we'll drink our cup of laughter
i will live while i can
and lovers try
the golden dance life could be
while you're living beyond all your means
it'll happen to you as sure as your sorrows are joys
you see the good and the bad the eyes are sad
now i'm free
there's a choir singing
like my thoughts in the summer sky
time is running out
always being criticized for being his age
it's no good being lazy
everybody's got a gun
there is no more unity remind me what it used to be
to the country fresh and green
but oh the heart the hurt keeps on keepin on on and on
music high and sweet then she just blew away
music high and sweet then she just blew away
then this life is just a haunted dream
he said i think of the beauty i've had
say a prayer for the stranger
they say it's a new age
all day through here for youthe world is full of players in the night
when some cold tomorrow finds you when some sad old dream reminds you
and that old gray wind is blowing and there's nothing left worth knowing
laughed with saints and cried with clowns lived that up and down
show the world how you feel gonna let them know you're real
let your love come down
it was there from the start got the power in your heart
but there aint no one that's got my rhythm
some people get lonely while some people get blue
i feel like i'm flying
luck's in
all of a sudden i'm so care free well alright
your love has brought me to a higher place oh yeah
i'm professing here to you
your love has brought me into a higher place oh yeah
where would i be where would i be
oh oh oh oh
'cause everytime i'm hearing your name
except for the show
he's a prisoner but he thinks he's free
take you away before the day
the empty bed she left me cold on one side
but i'll control my feelings
cant believe only me
my love is leavin me
caught up in flight feeling the sight europe dying
did you know i'm burning deep inside for you
take you to the city girl we're gonna buy some clothes
we all want one more morning just to know the night wont stay
we all want one more morning then we'll take the night to come
all your clothes all thrown about
you cant make the train fare
i bought a sequined suit from a pearly queen
i had a strange dream in my hair
cos ooh when you touch me
thinking of you the feeling in my heart
life's a dance put on your dancing shoes take a chance
put on your dancing shoes it'll see you through
real love to pull me through
to make things right when all senses fail
the way that you love is good as money
then you'll see life will be so nice it's just a step up to paradise
nobody wants to blow nobody wants to be left out
just wanna hold you in my loving arms again
i've been so lonely and i've been so blue
and i'll always be feeling it and i wont slow down
you came into my life
fill me up with your love
fill me up fill me up bring your lovin home to me
freedom overspill
you're sounding good to me now
burning up on midnight oil
talking 'bout the things you do
well my temperature's rising and my feet hit the floor
been a hard day and i dont know what to do
well my temperature's rising and my feet left the floor
it's been a hard day and nothing went too good
and i'm so glad we made it so glad we made it
i had a drink i saw a fight
and rid my mind of everything
well i saw your sign and i missed you there
and i knew right then i had to get me some more
there's no other place we can go
plant my feet a little higher
'cause i've still got far to go
think about it there must be higher love
bring me a higher love
bring me a higher love
to cheer the night along
hold on to me when you're falling
hold on to me when you're falling down
take your clue all you've got to do is
holding on
it can be in a smile it can be there in a touch
dont you know that love will save us after all
i aint got no time for lovin 'cause my time is all used up
i've got to keep my image while suspended on a throne
and i watched them fly across a fiery sky
i can feel the light inside me i can feel it everywhere
we had the stars they kept shining
and we lived our life like a story
and then it all goes by
and these three men made a solemn vow
for he's bound him to the cart
oh what a shambles has been my day
let me tell you now
i see you walkin to my car lookin like something sweet to eat
and fill it up some way
i just did it on the floor
let me hear it make me a part
a crowd of people stood and stared
woke up fell out of bed
and though the holes were rather small they had to count them all
i could shed another million tears a million breaths
i still love you
or wear this pilgrim's cloak or be a common thief
their fires burn into the night
i'll be gone long before the morning
before my lonely life is set
still be love in the world
after the tears have washed your eyes
aint no sunshine when she's gone
hey i ought to leave the young thing alone
i'll be the rock you can build on
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all
the one you need
now it's all for one and all for love it's all for love
she's got me flying like a bird in a bright june sky
she can be all four seasons in one day
she's my gift from the lord or a fiend from hell
she can be kind
she can be all four seasons in one day
endlessly to the sea
if i had my way i'd take a boat from the river
endlessly like a silent tear
were the stones the workmen found
have you ever had the feeling
that love is not around
misspent with angel eyes tonight
and why my angel eyes aint here
if africa escapes starvation
every day that goes by
imagine what your taxes buy
trapped by insecurities
the only thing i really know for sure
the blood runs so red to my face
a lesson once learned is so hard to forget
never to make promises that break
from the deserts of the west to the shining sea
and all i need is another day
beneath the desert moon i sing
from the smallest little bird to the crocodile
we see the eastern sky's on fire
i'm wanted almost everywhere now
when i sat down i cried
hadnt had a bite to eat
i had this sense of doom
he thinks that i'm a lunatic
i'd like to fly away
i've had a question that's been preying on my mind for some time
it wont be long now before that puppy goes astray
faut que tu comprennes puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que a
i could almost hang myself
c'est clair que je laime c'est un fait ton egosme m'inquiete
i'd be your faithful companion
until this alpha male
je suis consciente je vois bien que tu souffres mais s'attenuera
there's something fishy round here
ta mauvaise foi j'aimerais bien que s'arrte
well there cant be nothing worse
you could say i lost my sense of direction
i could be lost inside their lies without a trace
there'd be nothing left for me to do
there was an old guy with a beard
i cant see nobody better so you'll just have to do
we had no time to worry though there was just to much to do
he's god's best friend he's got a seat on the board
so we said we had a mission for his favourite dove
rock steady rock steady
walk the streets for money
told you once i wont tell you again
i dont subscribe to this point of view
there is no historical precedent
what might save us me and you
i've been searching long enough
the spirit moves on the water
all the saints and angels and the stars up above
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
i've been thinking 'bout the things that we believe
if somebody up there likes me somebody up there cares
the minute i saw her face the second i caught her eye
the minute i saw her face the second i caught her eye
it's a promise or a lie i'll repent before i die
send your love into the distant dawn
but still the earth is moving so fast
send your love
throw a pebble in and watch the ocean
and fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing
a kind of ultimatum note
it's plain to see
ask if i am mouse or man
if i make up my mind
wednesday would be fine thursday's on my mind
he does the best with me he can
shadows in the rain
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
but that's not the shape of my heart
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
she dont like the things i cook
she dont like the clothes i wear
she might prefer me as i am
she's too good for me
the royal astrologer was run out of breath
he prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain
heavy cloud but no rain
sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
sooner or later
sooner or later the world first day
be what you come here for
i burn for you i burn for
and your love flows through me
the horse he kept running the rider was dead
here in the courthouse the whole town is there
and out in the distance a trick of the brain
but they were smiling in that subtle dolphin way
i guess we'll have to say goodbye
but remember all the things i've said
that's when i need your love so bad
cause you're allmost driving me mad
write it on a piece of me paper
empty
on christmas day on christmas day
on christmas day in the morning
on christmas day on christmas day
or if i could make you mine
i swear i saw you and i
and inside every turning leaf
every signpost in nature
and we'd be like the moon and sun
every signpost in nature
if i ever lose my faith in you
i never saw no miracle of science
you got to lock it up and throw away the key
if you love somebody set them free
you got to lock it up and throw away the key
i'm so happy that i cant stop crying
i'm so happy that i cant stop crying
something seemed to ease the pain
i'm so happy that i cant stop crying
thus wedded to my woes and bedded in my tomb
inside the clocks are filled with sand
inside this army's in retreat we hide beneath the thunder's call
love is a violent star
outside the hurricane wont wait
the pain of instruction
love me like a sister love me like the world has just begun
first son of a riveter's son
he felt he'd been left on a desolate shore
caught in the flare of acetylene light
it would carry his father and he
that only a strange ship could fly
so far where no grey gulls fly
and the gentlest breath on my face
as i squinted my eyes in the rain
why are there women here dancing on their own
they're dancing with their sons
their anguish is unsaid
one day we'll sing our freedom
ellas danzan solas
they're dancing with the missing
why are the soldiers here
they dance alone they dance alone
they're dancing with their sons
and we'll dance
hey mr pinochet
they dance with the invisible ones
we lacked the consciences to pray
you'll be my dog star shining tonight
would jesus strike me down if i should pray
this cowboy song this cowboy life
i could see right through all the lies you told
your daddy was a businessman
invest in wooden caskets
you may ask what does it profit a man
there's a war inside religion
a war on our compassion
this was always doomed to fail
i always knew that
empty
he may be driving to his wife
i tell him that my heart will break
i'm just making a living
the next of kin no fixed abode
one more night
in another set of circumstances
tutti frutti au rutti
tutti frutti au rutti
but pretty little suzy's the gal for me
tell them i'm coming back
til this midnight express
new york city for a spell
i know i cant be late
there's no such thing as a meal that's free
cause she said she wont wait
and understood the rings around the moon
until the stars grew dim until
here in your arms when everything seems to be clear
rope the south wind
round the cape horn to valparaiso
under the moonlight there she can safely go
walking on the moon
walking on walking on the moon
walking on the moon
and if it's the price i pay
both sighing and sickly my sweetheart to see
and you for your trouble rewarded shall be
your economic theory makes no sense
three million years of pressure packed it down
and bury the waste in a great big hole
the turning world will sing their souls to sleep
we work the black seam together
a rest that peace begets
and any other thought is unkind
forget the weather we should always be together
i see you with me and baby makes three
but perhaps the dream
when the angels fall
shuffle to the ruins
these are my feet
you cant control us
turn on the radio the static hurts my ears
pick up the telephone i've listened here for years
when the world is running down
same tape i've had for years
you make the best of what's still around
i run 'deep throat' again it ran for years and years
you make the best of what's still around
when the world is running down
when the world is running down
when the world is running down
when he counts to buy your soul
i'm gonna find a place to live
and hellfire's a promise away
if you'll come and be my wife
i'm gonna try in every way
wherever i lay me down wherever i put my head to sleep
wherever i lay me down wherever i rest my weary head to sleep
whatever i lost i thought was mine whenever i close my eyes in pain
wherever i lay me down wherever i rest my weary head to sleep
that day will last forever
all colours bleed to red
for all my days remaining
that i loved you in my fashion
farewell farewell
sweet sweet my jewel
none can see sever none can sever
kiss me sweet kiss me
running rings around the moon
where the sun has never shone
in the windmills of your mind
and a fragment of this song
on an ever spinning wheel
that the autumn leaves were turning
in my dreams
i'm falling like a stone
i close my eyes
i wonder if you feel the same way as i do
another night
this is what i'd say to you
and they meant you just for me
and why would you want to put yourself through all that again
when you were still together
turn the clock to zero sister
baby wait a minute wait a minute
the river's wide we'll swim across
you're the glove and i'm the hand
i'm the devil in your soul
you're the sum of my equation
we're starting up a brand new day
whose shadow bears the secret promise
i dream of love as time runs through my hand
whose shadow bears the secret promise
in my hand
she runs so pretty
so fill her up son
i got no prospects
let's consider this
and there's music playing
you're gonna fill her up with pain
you've got the rest of life to face
you gotta fill her up with joy
or the nard in the fire
when you're not around
let me soothe the shining tears that gather in your eyes
let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise
only you you you only you
jesus save us from the darkness of human hearts
only you you you only you
only you can once again present to her
only you
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos y si me dices que si
where is the child with his father's eyes
these are the souls of the broken town
'i have here a cask of most magical wine
these are the soul cages
swim to the light swim to the light
i'm all by myself in your silver light
i'd go out of my mind but for you
so i'm going to seek a certain girl i've had in mind
i know i could always be good
i know i could always be good
we took courage from our numbers
our thoughts would always stray
for we would never have marched so far
faces in the mud
even when the darkest clouds are in the sky
even when the darkest clouds are in the sky
it's only once we pass this way
dont you realize you'll find next monday or next tuesday
you mustnt sigh and you mustnt cry
and i picture myself in this different situation
take me dancing please take me dancing tonight
take me dancing please take me dancing tonight
will supercede the human kiss
would give our lovers time to kill
you'll never have to sweep the floor
but if our love is pure
you're the bright star in my chart
i'll be true to no one but you
and the noise of the traffic and the poison lead
and the warm wind sighs as you practice your swing
take me to the sunshine
as if our minds are deranged
with a joy you could not measure
they would pray to the moon
and it may be a trick of the firelight
remember the words of my life
for the end is a mystery no one can read
i cant see where they lead
in the book of my life
i walk through the day
it's easy to remember
i cant believe she wont be here anymore
where she's gone
all i hear is that lonesome lonesome sound
was the sword in his mother's hand
the kind of pain that you cant hide
birds on the roof of my mother's house
the blood of the lazarus heart
the turtles cannot sing and yet they love
to rob the ships of the queen of spain
where is the joy for the pirate's bride
to see my love again
the secret marriage never can be broken
no one would you see
a solitary voice to speak out and set me free
it's hate to say it but it's probably me
i hate to say it but it's probably me
and you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
you'll only make me cry
who'd lay down his life for you and die
and thought about the prophecy
i'd eat my hat if it came true
a new moon and an early thaw
everyone fought for dimes
everyone told the truth
everybody wants to look the other way
there's a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop
that's my soul up there
that's my soul up there
there's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
i have stood here before in the pouring rain
mes pas sont gauches
je ne comprends pas bien
tu ments ma soeur
from somewhere deep inside
though the sword was his protection
i'd be the blood of the lazarus heart
every day another miracle
when your troubles take to mounting
when there are no more lies they can tell
and the dark room seems so still
let your soul guide you upon your way
i've been knocked out of the race
well she's walking through the clouds
it's alright she says
we found ourselves down mexico way
who chased away the evil gang
the maidens numbered only one
i settled down with the family
love is thicker than blood
the town the mayor the pta
love is stronger than justice
love is stronger than justice
and though there used to be brothers seven
there is a deeper wave than this
feel it rising in the cities
all the armies all the missiles
there is a deeper wave than this
pay for love but the hate comes free
you cant reach the bed so you sleep on the floor
i dream of love as time runs through my hand
this way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
is the sweet intoxication of her love
this memory of eden haunts us all
or a sad melody
how like a song
the window is open
she wants him so badly
sometimes it's not so easy
strong words in the staffroom
the sun sets across the ocean
it cant be that much longer still
cause if you're the top of the bottom
and like cattle we all stand
and are really that alone like me
confronted by this latest atrocity
what's to become of our world who knows what to do
no dejan de danzar
con seguridad
sobre sus tumbas libres
con silenciosa anustia
no podra comprar mas armas
y con sus esposos
they'd chased him for ever
we ran through the forest
the dogs are all worn out
they'd chased us forever
i dont take coffee i take tea my dear
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
modesty propriety can lead to notoriety
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
run every kind of test from a to z
i'm a simple man it's no big mystery
steal my eyeballs and come back for the sockets
you dont need to read no books on my history
you'll still know zip a bout me
check if i paid my income tax
set up your microscope and tell me what you see
every night you stay
since you've gone i been lost without a trace
of the feelings i have for her in my heart
it's a big enough umbrella
long before my tongue has tripped me
everybody screamed they told me you
they made the scene
it was their chance
so she took her love
upon the fields of barley
see the children run as the sun goes down
waiting for tomorrow just another day
bring on the night
no no where shadows do for bodies stand
if thou cans't not o'ercome her will
better a thousand times to die
that you dont ever want to see me again
when nobody listens to a word i say
but i'm too full to swallow my pride
hangs above my head there in the dark
the evening spreads its sail against the sky
marching through countries they'd never seen
and stained in the blood of a whole generation
midnight in soho nineteen eighty four
who thought all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth
some haply seeming and some being yours
allied to death child to his blackfac'd night
come again that i may cease to mourn
all the night my sleeps are full of dreams
found nobody there
but to look for heaven is to live here in hell
i said what about our politics philosophy our history
i said there must be something in our scientific treasure

she's a big lass
and her stockings once was white

their logic ties me up and rapes me
have words to thank for their positions
is all i want to say to you
they're meaningless and all that's true
did you ever wonder what you'd been carrying since the world was black
yes i've been walking now i'm hanging from a dead mans rope
the shadows fall
all the days of my life i will walk with you
tied to the tracks and the trains fast coming
i'm a three line whip i'm the sort of thing they ban
i'm a three line whip i'm the sort of thing they ban
you say that this wasnt in your plan
sometimes in shell the orient's pearls we find
there let me live forlorne
my fortune is throwne
it's just the way that the world evolves
to negotiate for peace on earth
so let's just get on with the past
is our love really beyond repair
you're moving way too fast
the siege guns had been pounding all through the night
for i cannot fill the chasm
and if i built this fortress around your heart
i had to stop in my tracks for fear
jamais a nossa voz vai calar
que fragilidade que fragilidade
ficara fragil demais
to clinch a lifetime's argument
on and on the rain will say
ni se lograra
acero y piel combinacin tan cruel
lloras tu y lloro yo
all men are free justice is a sword we hold

the fire's embers
a cloak i borrow
a mast without a sail
the last thing i'd expect
though all the kingdoms turn to sand
they say a city in the desert lies
i'm mad about you i'm mad about you
my heart was lost on a distant planet
i'm mad about you i'm mad about you
las d porque si
rescue me before i fall into despair
i'll send an sos to the world
looking for a home
i pray everyday to be strong
oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
in the moonlight
to be swept away
with the moon away
smooth earthy small transparent round
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
then it avoids an awful lot of mess
it's a habit forming need for more and more
at least the ones that we all know by name
when the stars assume their patterns
but you stayed in my corner
i'm not as clever as i thought i was
that tiny planet in a bigger guy
that's us
while you're in my arms
every kiss you give
sets my soul on fire

so why dont you give it up and bring it home to me
and the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken
and you're torn if you should leave him with a number
and there's nothing they can do for her there's nothing they can tell her
it's time for work it's time to go but something's different i dont know
she told him she was never coming home
i'd never have dreamt that in love
and she'd never love mew d
and i'm never quite sure
cast your light
one day she'll love me
by pretending they're a different world from me
lines are drawn upon the world
one world is enough for all of us
living under house guess i'm living i'm a mouse
friends dont mean a thing guess i'll leave it up to me
cant see through the trees
go insane
leave me out get away
keep her runnin it's a long way home
when you first smiled at me
if you only have the time
i'll watch you breathe
it's all so confusing
we can all just hum along
down the river

and i feel and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her will she smell alone
pull the trigger with a pop gun

falling downward with a flaming hand

alcohol it's a lie stimulate a needle in your eye
ten ton bricks layin on my head

there's nowhere to turn nowhere to run
trying to get to heaven on sunday

so better off just leave it alone
and you're better off just stayin at home
coming down
i know you cried but nothing changed
it cant be erased
loves to drive 'em wild
she goes again
because you're there to bend and nurture me through these
when you're there to fill the space i have inside i feel like cryin
feelin like a hand in rusted shame
all that's dead for you
sell me down the river
sell me down the river
unfriendly feelings down on wounded knees
what i wanted is what i wanted
lady picture girl i think them boys dont like your show
she doesnt know her face
living on the edge of falling down like each day would be your
dont be afrain 'cause i'll be there
behind they'll be haunting you forever
higher than the sky
we'll keep the mem'ries we gained inside our hearts
until the damage is done and the beauty is gone
dont try to run
sign of the times and writings on the wall
4th reich is rising
i feel like i'm drowning trying to catch my breath
i've found what i've been searching for
i'm watching the setting sun far far away from you
into the depths i fall into the unknown darkness i go
but now my time has come no more running in the dark
and one more day is again history
to control our hate and to forgive
a new day is rising in ancient babylon
than ever for all to see
and underneath the starlit sky
the path to home is long and winding
i try to fight this strong sensation but
you cast the spell on mewhy dont you let me go
why do you stare at me it's hard to please when you're feeling ill at ease
music by tolkki
is precious that i see so clearwhat is our place in here
our celestial dream
just when you think you reach it it's gone
i wake up in the morning so far away from home
all the trust that was built along the years is coming back to stay i know
i'm the lord
he's crawling out from the asylum
and prey your god 'cause you're not alone
more that i live
millennium show us the way
it goes on forever
there's no second chance
you cry for help the torture wont let you go
reaching for
if i fall asleep they just might find me
moon is guiding my way through the land
now the heat's leaking out i'd like to scream and shout
i have all the strings in my hands
far away i sail away to stay
many rare species will perish soon
we've got so little time
cant go on this way
like the phoenix i rise
and i know that i cant lose
i'm dreaming just like streaming through the door
your tears put out the fire from your soul
there's no talent in this game hunting for the fame
hunting hunting for the fame terror terror everywhere
oh now i need to be free from all
the carousel is spinning fast
i can be found by everyone
try not to think about it much
empty
there's a time to live there's a time to die
unchain your soul from hate
the things will be allright
silhouettes in the sky
empty
soon the things will be allright when i get there
that duplicates all that we do not like me not like you but our other ego
empty
you are no different to me
come to me my disciples said the stranger who came
tending us to damnation
keeping in touch aint that easy but i'll have to try
they try to give me answers
we will keep our faith inside our souls
memories go back to my childhood to days i still recall
this is the life i was born to lead
i needed them to grow
always condemn though you never understand
would give up memories fill my mind i can see
i saw it in a dream the day that changed our history
it wont take long you wont live till the end of this song
not to live in slavery
i beg the light up in the sky
there's nothing keeping them at bay
words music by tolkki
we forget those who really are in need
arrogance and fear walking
you reap all what you sow
to the universe with love
tells me somethings wrong
empty
i'm away lost in my thoughts
tears of ice frozen heart icy drops fall to the ground
now i am crying
i dont know why
i feel drawn towards you cant resist
the time is running
dont live in the past
without reason or rhyme the hands of time
the well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
the answer to the questions within where should i begin
yes i'll be back tomorrow
i have to follow my heart
hearing voices everywhere telling me what to do
you are getting bold growing old skin turns cold
reaching for the morning light
but where are you now
i think it's too late to change the man we are the last
i have seen the southern cross forming in the sky
let's put end to all this while we can
lead us into the better world
the nuclear end is in sight
questions fill my mind once again clearing my thoughts
to reality this cant go on believe me
maybe there is hope still left
will the sun rise tomorrow will i still see the dawn
empty
there would be no borders no laws anykind
oh wont you break
open your eyes and you will see
oh boy
i know you've been inside but what were you in for
now you're taking it time after time
now he has gone
you'll have to find another no one to take the shit like i have
watching all the women shaking slimming
watching all the roads that bend
and they're making eyes at suburban boys
at suburban boys
loved up doved up hung around stoned in a lonely town
la la la la
anything is possible for the bentswood boys
he said
i dont care who's wrong or right
oh if you were the one would i even notice now my mind has gone
and when i start my new life i wont touch the ground
and when i start my new life i wont touch the ground
i feel schizo every so psycho kicking at an old tin can
so give me this and give me that smother me and give me some of that bad stuff
there's a great big crack in the union jack
took the film to no i
with dreams of gasoline drying our eyes
and sorrow breaks the silent day
and the ambulances sigh that you're down
and the audiences cry that you're down
and there's a madness in your smile
and she sits alone by the telephone but they wont call back again
oh li da di da dioh li da di da dioh li da di da dioh oh
we kiss our love with lips like pain
we got a love between us and it's like electricity
it's bigger than the universe
though it's just time they kill
pumped up with valium could you get me some
let's chase the dragon
sadie sadie in the sound of the streets
she walks the streets of summer
a heavy metal stutter that brains me
she got nothing to say
stay together
empty
crawling the walls under electric lights
and this still life is all i ever do
lying in my bed
lying in my bed
as i listen to the band
i know a girl she walks the asphalt world
it's in the blood stream it's in the liver
when you're there in her arms
i watch the skylinefor him to come
this is the way
and maybe were just streatham trash and maybe not
it says oh do you believe in love there
i love that deafening thundering sound
look just like an elephant man
i love that deafening thundering sound
look out all of you fairweather friends
i have to leave
stars in our own car we can drive away from here
give me give me the power
she walks the streets to pass the time
she feels the wheels and needs a line
empty
two silhouettes by the cash machine make a lovers dance
lying in my head watching my mistakes
alone but loaded
all we see and believe is the dj and debts dissolve
a day in the life and dream of sheep
listen to the music in your head
she'rocker hear the audience scream for the death of the king
an we wash it away we wash it away this grey
oh we wash it away we wash it away this grey
i see her by the window waiting every night
i think i'm going to heaven on it
let's get something straight
just think of the life you'll save
when you're on your own
the tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
it's in everything we do
just trash me and you
you wake up with a gun in your mouth
they're sparking up with someone oh
out in the sticks out in the stickiness
where the pigs dont fly i do
we'll jack the politics for premonition and fire
cause when the stylized kick of the filmstar whip
side to side
he gets lovely the more he's ill dont od on him now
so fucking what if he's licking the bag dont od on him now
les says punk isnt dead
insulting everyone picked up your sister kicked your son the young men
oh if you shake your fake tan thru aerosol land you'll know
here they come with their make up on
here they come gone 7am
it's you and me it's you and me you and me
where all the people shake their money in time
modern boys modern boys
so let the decades die
jumping the lights in the silent cars
you thought you'd come and amaze me honey
you thought you'd come on and amaze me with your money
if you can take it i can take it
if you can take it i can take it all of me
in rented gear 2000 years we waited for a man
as the ridiculous world wentoh
oh he is gone
and in this catalogue town she takes me down
can you hear her calling
it's there in the telephone wires
oh but when she is calling here in my head
i was conned by a circus hand
i'm so sorry to hear about your world
just put on your trainers and get out of it with me
in the parked cars and the pretty parks and in every disease
who are left at home when all the kids have grown watching the pretty young girls
cos tonight we'll go dancing we'll go laughing we'll get car sick
we're going out tonight out and about tonight
she shaking obscene like a fucking machine
she walking like a killer
empty
ouh ouh ouh
and if she tells you two is one
empty
if they could say what all of this means
it is incredible how i can
just like just like my elephant fans
it's the same old show he's a killer of a flash boy oh
it's the same old show he's a killer he's a flash boy oh
he said she's not dead she's gone away gone away
through every station through every town
people on the streets do whatever we please
piss our money down the drain
life is just a lullaby
under the jet plane sky
everything will flow
what to believe in when they change your name
graffiti women draw pictures on the wall
graffiti people got nothing got no name
have you ever been this low
i am the one i sing the song
you know oh i wanna do it again
cities die
come on come on and
she walks in the beauty of a magazine
my marilyn come to slum for an hour
cause me and them we like to get out
oh if he is dead
you smile from your window
with the style of a widow
into a song
like the carpenters song
sulking on the subway music in our brain
hi fi in the white city yeah yeah
she called you from across the city you hired a car to crawl
images of violence fill up my mind
and stabbed a cerebellum with a curious quill
introducing the band
a fifty knuckle shuffle heavy metal machine
introducing the band

she's mine
i dont care about the things you do
i dont know about the things you do
or the illegal pictures on the net
two steps back you're in my space
i dont care about the things you do
two steps back you're in my space

bouncing off of the satellite
for some other teasing moans
reach out and touch me will you
bouncing off of the satellite
tell the truth to find another lover x2
empty
we'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
empty
and'll fade away
it was much too soon
you're always right
the words you wanna hear deceive me
where have you been
who's sorry now
who's sorry
got my 1894 with all my friends who pass at my back door
wanna get back i gotta get back to my speed home california x8
i have no idea exactly what i've drawn
i draw and the four winds sigh in the stars
of robbery when nothing is worth taking
throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation
that i'm outta control
walking out walking out
dont it seem absurd
is it me that you're looking for
empty
and she leaves and goes straight for her mothers
dont it seem absurd
she's not so fragile she plays the mercenary
your throwin sticks and stones your breakin my bones man
you gotta get down if you want to hang around x3
a thousand us dollars on a mountain of speed
no time for cuffs tonight gonna wake up to the sun
but now its time for some payback raising up with the weak
tap twist snap x4
are we seeing eye to eye i'm believing all the lies
and making out in the sand
as we grew up under the sun
can you tell me
'cause the words have so much meaning
the summers that lasted so long
but my view from the hollywood roosevelt
kept you waiting
oh yeah all right
if you decide to change your mind
and when it's over
have gone out the window
i know
all the favorite tv shows
when it's over
have gone out the window
all the songs she used to sing
get up
please dont leave me hanging on and on
get up
it aint that easy
get up
empty
she says these words
get up
get up
you seem to me
on the verge of running
you seem to me
could be needing
dont bring it in
at angels door
crowd the day with unrelated histories
notice newfound courtesies
they live on every street
have a life
they seem to x2
and you learn to
behind the curtain
as girls go x5
as girls go x5
floating in the sultry air
but he doesnt dare ask the right question
too much too soon
what price to pay
i will pay for my life with my body
he said you look from your direction
beyond the duty and the discipline
all feeling
i wait to meet my love made real
when it begins at your knees and goes right to your head
empty
there's this black widow spider darling and she's been walking on my hand
you've been to long darling and it looks like rain
but blood makes noise
i think it's really
when blood sees blood
how did this come to pass
and my question to you is
'cause pictures lie
you'll see
empty
i took your urgent whisper
number every page in silver
has taken its toll
might still want me
i am asking you
bitten my soul
let's see how it's been done
smoke from the altar
by waling in a circle
how it's been done
of layers of chiffon
and the look in her eyes
i still love to dance
or otherwise be in the swim
excuse me
if it's the last thing i do
and what's so small to you
but i'll hit my mark
i'll make you see
in a fist
the man on the wall
something's begun like a war
at the end of the town
promised luck and all the rest
whose heads and hands were taken
some things just dont get through
all i know of you
moan the words like water
i was not able
somewhere deep within
salt water
it's really raw
feel like something's in it
i am perfectly round
i am raining down in pieces
i am turning in your hand
bleach it clean to a vinegar shine
mama's a handful of thorns
see if you unwind
like an idiot savant
playing solitaire
i suddenly remember each time we've met
i see how their eyes are gathered into one
i suddenly remember each time we've met
for you to see through
or i could have played your wife
and it's well i know your face
so much more than a long time ago
one piece of coral shone white
did i shadow her young pencil marks on the wall
what song would be in the air now
and the candle that burns
on the wind and the foam
and holding a lyre
it's still the hardest thing to feel
when i go back to ludlow street
when i go back to ludlow street
yes i think you've seen me before
they only hit until you cry
with nothing broken nothing thrown
am i a toy on a tray
and your possible
we match wits but not hearts
observe the blood the rose tattoo
but the only soldier now is me
her mocking smile says it all
still feel that limb
or maybe your vision
if they've lost a limb
not feeling the thing
through the town and back up through the avenues
because this is my ship and i say it's my destiny
we know men will be men and they'll call me the governor
yes and dont look at me i'm not selling today
men will be men and they'll call me the governor
it must be bursting
never noticing
i'll be right here
we had our
neighborhood girl she
that she had had too much to drink because she
she came up and said
because i've got this feeling
mckinsey's bar
you had to go out cruising all the bars
and to her you're just another guy
and to her you're just another guy
soldier of the night
but you cant stop the rising sun
protected by the night
and you'll have no place to run
find the line find the shape
find the outline things will
ante up and dont be shy
i'll see you i'll call you i'll raise you
it will cost you cost you cost you
i said i am too young for this
i said you must be lonely
he took her to a little room
do you think your solitude
we're all in one white place
i cant tell what ive found
now what would you have me do
the desert and the ocean floor
and will you break my will
empty
a march over millions of years
a mark on these miles of fields
a march over months of the year
broken tongue
went and got yourself into another fight
'cause i know you're just a kid
but i guess what you've got to do boy you go ahead and do it
a picture of a boy
he's everywhere
on a day
of the days we were together
hey girl
empty
empty
what he saw so much of
he's dreaming of mystery
out of our reach under this real life
he would have
and passion does begin
i'd say she was very
in this witching hour
of her stockings and her skin
now today
as i sing into the wind
i let him go
the sand will sting my feet
it wont do
what i'd forgive of myself
but i dont know
what hand had set this inner field alight
the seasons yield
but it is not revealed
my footsteps are ticking
and something is cracking
i have been
in the afternoon when the day seems forever
she watches the rain and the birds on the rooftops
with passions and with prudences
in a routine operation
edith whartons lovely figurines
whore the megaphone man
get rid of it soon
get rid of it quick
and it's all part of the show
get rid of it quick
monkey in the middle
monkey in the middle
does she hide the lie
monkey in the middle
your oceans
was all splinters
i had to see
though it was my life
sharpened with dreams
there's a pan on the floor
i sing to you
i touch you
here i am at last i've just jumped off the train
and i know even that's not gonna last me long
i'll go on to the next town and see what i find there
i love you frank and then they drank
they were volatile and all the while
to be in love
and the trembling
and lean against the wall
do you see
empty
naked on the grass
of coffeeshops and morning streets
you are the jester of this courtyard
and that earring in your ear
and a bump upon the head
oh hold me like a baby
i saw you in my mind's eye
the ceiling had a painting on it
that one by one the old and young
what happened in that room he asked
i must have missed that moment
if you were a weapon
you said i'd be a gun
and a big black coat
examine her for motive
white collar at the neck
double breasted pinstriped
and then you cast away
there's the way we may appear
i'll love you first and let you go
to you
he's crazy he's throwing himself
that told the same time
for the last half an hour
on sunday
have now and if he isnt
into your memory
in the eye
i wonder if they'll take a look
she will call my name
institution green
into little triangles and the rails run round
she touches him goodbye
opens her purse
as the wires cut through the sky
they come up through the cracks
she stops at the stall
has hit me in the mouth again
i feel you scolding me
if you are holding me
when you were holding me
'cause we've got nothing to hide
it's no reason for alarm
and we'd end up in confusion
that you really meant to do something else
turns herself into a pawn
one false move
do you love me
i am thinking
do you love many can you love one
do you love many can you love one
turns into a very clear dawn
that flies by and is gone
on little west twelfth
gone gone
it would be rushing in
maybe it's the clothing that's so entertaining
the ones here at home just dont give it their best
you can find me
nothing much not much
and if you want me
left of center
when they ask me
and in the fringes
but give it rain of waiting time
with a blinding bolt of sleeplessness
and a flash of flooding light
of cold metal
the wind has swept them through the apartment
where once were flowers
any more
finally alone
we like to read the newspaper
he is tall
and if he buys you a coffee
have some kind of fame
touches him
we walk along the cobblestone ground
first they laughed and then they ran
i have wished that i could hear
i have wished that i could pour
and i've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
and now will you tell me why
as you are living here alone and you are never revealed
your highness your ways are very strange
i am thinking of my rent
i dont think anybody knows
when you're living in today
it's just so god damn slow
younger than nine or ten
and it echoed far and lonely
her tears how they shone in the sun
but this life is killing me
and he never more came into town
or when i'm walking down these darkened halls
with a date for me
i dont know when it will be
spin intact
and i'm tired of sleeping
oh mom that man he ripped out his lining
it's just that there's so much to do
there'll be no dancing on the gravestone
and time is burning burning burning
and he fills it
says the man
i'm pretending
it was no one
there's a woman
that she's hitching
to the bells
whose roots were bound
watched it as it struggled so
cut the twine and made it mine
both mind and foot
unbound into the ground
like sand against the stone
i would be free then
i would leave only bones and teeth
they go down fast
without the chance
without the chance for last respects
that was drowned
i did see the thing go down
i feel it truly
and wait upon the will
they've gone to get your man
ice within
you're new to me i'm new to you
i'd been holding inside
if you could tell them this
i am afraid i may be killed
if your life were taken from me
how could they weigh the worth
and they'll never know the gold
zephyr and i sort out our
the graffiti goes but the walls retain
well the wind kicks up in the smell of rain
is this the end of all we know innocence lost so long ago woven in dreams the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny decades of greed plague famine and war we cant go on like this anymore living like fools chaos will rule this eternal paradise
where's the answer we've all been looking for
the path you strayed from can only lead to dismay
through your mind
passion and glory fill my heart
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
living a timeless tale
i can hear now what you feel inside
in a winter's dream i'll be there for you
take my last breath as i fall into eternity
i can not wait pray for daybreak
risen to an astral flight i wander through
so falls the night the darkest hour justice lost a travesty we must undo absence of light unbalanced power only then will you know
twisted wings of paranoia
twisted wings of paranoia
twisted wings of paranoia
in twilight and faded time
my final destiny
lonely roses slowly wither and die
no place for forgotten ones
flesh and steel intertwined
rulers of us all forever cursed we live in pain
scream and no one hears my pleas
empty
laugher echoes her name
rendered prince of foolsdire thoughts of her begotten son
arrival dressed to kill it's a tragedy
empty
empty
321music romeo pinnela miller rullo and tyler
savage and notorious
empty
into the morning sun
youthful hope to right the wrong
a heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
save the world
forever cursed by this game he who plays with sin
on the terror it breeds breathing fire and gree
if you dare play the game your descent preordained
cursing your name
tears of woe fall cold as ice
part iii a gathering of angels
part iv the wrath divine
faith and mercy gone astray
part v the prophet's cry
i taste the victory
banish all kings from the face of the land
i feel the power and the majesty again
he opens the door but there's no one there
watch the vultures circle through the pouring rain
my love
a chance to dream fast asleep your nightmare ends
awaken vindication
the hand of fate isnever late to
522music romeo pinnela miller rullo and allen
prisioner waiting out my time
ten years gone by my friend haunting me
scars will fade but never die
tonight can we scape from this hell
spinning webs of timeless confusion
so infamous
seasons ragin sands of time will fall
wiping away the lines carved in your face
carry on into the horizon wielding courage staff in hand
empty
empty
enchanting me defying my love i'm hindered with
she's like thorns of sorrow visions turning red
dream within dream within a dream
alicealicerun alicerun
like knights in the game her next move is so unsure
do you believealls as twisted as one would perceive
the start's where the end's leading you
when all the angels cry
and when you watch over me
whispers from you calling out from above
a way to carry on what we believe
silence fills the shrine giving us the sign
promising charade
like candles in the wind our echoed cries above the din
try to turn back the years living inside smoke and mirrors
the feel of her kiss steals my breath away
my desire echoes from a tale of ancient lore
lady of the snow holding me
your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
458music romeo pinnela miller
desperate cries hail of fire deciding
summon all to heed their cryinnocence fading away
realize that your cries
elusive to me progressions are now violence in disguise
glow silver and white eternal and bright in the sky
ohhthe hunter
ooh mother will you help me
he will not break me down no
chorus x 2
who dares to invade his sacred ground
desecraters of rachorus
the hour of judgement is at hand
scanning eyes turn into stone
through the eyes of time i see
endless dreams are all encased in disarraythrough the eyes of time i see
empty
and heal the hearts that still bleed
while you grow old
you've realized
my heart you thrust a dagger
all adversions still remain
fools who looks for answers in a rhyme seeking out a lie an illusion i am the future the ageless mutation
for i know not what to believe
every reason to fulfill my deed
418music romeo pinnella miller allen
losing faith in who i am
lies lies
feel it eating secrets within
feel it eating secrets within your mind
just bear another day
so the end
and curse you all
love i hope you wont be late
life is more than we can know
believe me believe me
believe me believe me
you can never go home again
you can never act the way that you did back then
you say it's all about the passion
i'm not afraid to lose
it's a casual affair
it's a casual affair
some people will say anything
it was the death of culture
trust i know is not such a dirty word
truth you'll find is the only way to live
honesty is not so far away
i want to fall into your eyes
if you ever need somebody
you can count on me
you can count on me
do you know do you know
cause even though my heart is
will you trust in a better tomorrow
when you live all your life for a moment
you're not my friend and i have no doubt
i did everything i could for you
no one knows you're not there
standing idly by
i dont want be the one who hurts you
i'm keeping my head on straight
i'm thinking of our whole life baby
you can trust me again
and you got your manipulations
seems the road less traveled
if you could only see the way she loves me
if you could only see the way she loves me
i said to me da i said to me da i said to me da
over the seas
far and away from miles of green
far away from my homeland
empty
ooh ooh good time
empty
you can turn me off
round and round you drag them down
crush my heart force me to crawl
cause i need you
make way for my girl
make way for my girl
you can never break me
nobody knows a liar
there's an empty place inside that is hurting me
why you gotta be so mean to me
empty
why you gotta be why you gotta be
i cant run from her but lord i must
like a fire i'm drawn to her lust
then maybe we'll get it straight
holding your tongue
hey mr golden deal
and the captain he is laughing
i know how you feel
i said i gotta get away from here
laid beneath the tortured talls
could have been enough to try
it's all part of the plan my dear
you just need something
did they give you more than your life could keep
when you slowly fade
dont let your mind tell the story here
dont let your mind tell the story here
all barter for the clean
just in time for a knee to hit the ground
and she cried herself to sleep that night
she wears a ring around her finger
give me strength that i can save my relationship
so give me love
it was in the end that i found my way again
if you want to live inside me
then say it
did you think it would last forever baby
it's the way he looks at you
like a dice away
the soldier's daughter
hey little girl
you're looking like you need a rescue
sugar may learn
show me that love is worth the wait
so come on baby get those shoes on
when the wind blows
to bring everything we know to an end
under cover yeah
i never knew his pain
i'm not broken
fear falls like rain
i want to let you know that i'm still learning
my love she dreams
cold water runs deep
he lays down in silence
she said she's gotta have her freedom
to see the shame in everyone
life is good when it's in your hands your hands
always searching for a love that's in bloom
i'm just waiting i'm just waiting
paint your face
tell me something
they say they heard him cry the fools prayer
some say the rope she is hanging
oh my love i've waited here for you
she'll never know
but love is surely better when it's gone
love is loud
i got to pick me up when i am down
love a man
love was overrated
love was overrated
under the pages
not like you
this little light of mine it gives your past unto me
you are the light and the way
tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
burden of proof tossed upon non believers
but surely saved one
you wont do what you'd like to do
let it go in
give in now
some say we'll see armageddon soon
fret for your latte and
here in this hopeless fucking hole we call la
i certainly hope we will cuz
fuck all his clones
with hidden agendas
i wanna watch it go right in
my compassion is broken now
and i feel ugly and dead inside
but my soul must be iron for my fear is naked
they call me dr love
the first step of the cure is a kiss
i am your doctor of love calling dr love
i've got the cure you're thinkin of calling dr love

one of our songs
a comfortable space
from a different angle
that is not only comfortable
managed to push myself away
and your pushing me
you still love me
slipping back into you
if when i say i may fade like a sigh if i stay
terrified of what may come
you still love me and you pushit on me
but i'd trade it all
if when i say i may fade like a sigh if i stay
but it will end no other way
and in my darkest moment feeble and weeping
i must crucify the ego before it's far too late
angels on the sideline
baffled and confused
right in two
fight over the clouds over wind over sky
right in two
or something wet on my birkenstocks
and all i could think was
and after calming me down with some orange slices and some needle spooning
you better
'cause this shit never happens to me
finally it's my lucky day
strapped down my bed feet cold and eyes red
the details of our ending
god damn shit the bed
empty

jesus wont you fucking whistle
i will find a center in you

nothing seems to satisfy
say the word and we'll be
i dont want it
how can it mean anything to me
tell it's me by the clamor now baby
you ran the night that you left me
c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon up
then i crushed your face
wander in and wandering
and sinking
seems like i'm slipping
and staring and thinking
and takes me home
it got a bit messy all over the curtains
clutch it like a cornerstone otherwise it all comes down
unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen
to consume you till you choose to let this go
draining patience drain vitality
this tedious path i've chosen here
and if there were no rewards to reap heal
rob the grave to snow the cradle
'til you pull it out boy
who are you to wave your finger
when you pissed all over my black kettle
what's the difference
your're balls deep in muddy waters
view of reality to think for yourself you must question authority and
on my back and tumbling
i've missed you so much
to pull the pieces from the sand
i've missed you so much
i thought that you were hiding from me
you have turned my blood cold and bitter
take what you want and then go
i've been struck dumb by a voice that
but i'm so comfortabletoo comfortable
and half as clear as reason
i'll die within your undertow

why cant we just admit it
why cant we just admit it
angels in the hearts of men
vicariously i live while the whole world dies
fell at the hands of
well might of told a lie
how we rise to the height of our halo
blinded by choice these hypocrites wont see
other than tremble incessantly
tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
difficult to see you in this light

no matter what i do
i wanna get back with you babe
i hear them calling
and when they say take of his body
feel the word
where are you going
it aint me
aint gonna come near you
what child is this
and your ease
you're so sure you can save
little chapel of love
you can turn dust into champagne
the tide will turn
you're a car girl you're a star girl
you climb on rooftops and you
candle candle
thou little tiny child
'cause devils and gods
will you choose fear
i've seen flaflaflavor flavor love
what does it feel like
this orbital ball
why should i hang around here anymore
and you dropped me lower
we waste so much love on our men
if i have a heart attack at 23
i thought i needed you to be strong
i'm not in love so dont forget it
i keep your picture upon the wall
whenever i'm alone with you
whenever i'm alone with you
all on a bus we were hopin to pass the time
but the bad news he said girl you're a dandelion
dyin today
tomorrow with their donut ox they'll say its sad she's brown bread
dyin fryin rather have a lie in
well still pretty good year
somthimes he's aware that they're drawing him in
so shimmy once and do it again
so shimmy once and do it again
that devils end up like you
you sign price of darkness
save you from that evil faith
strong black vine
all for a dark god
the power of orange knickers
a matter of complication
shame shame you've had your fun
through an open window
but i fear there's only so much time
but only you can fight against this
empty
well you know she's no high climber
do it again
in the land of milk and honey
empty
and it has been done
slip through your hand again and again
is telling me it's not over yet
well you'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole
can grow pretty
and i am sure that i hate you
what the little fish are sayin
knowin where they're goin
sing loud for the sunshine
candy lies
stay awhile
here with me
now it has come to light
stay awhile
a woman did this to you
until the son of god appear
pour on our souls thy healing light
into my little world
vows are spoken
is here in my arms
taken to a land
who saved my life
etienne etienne
hear the west wind
i hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
you came home alone without lili marlene
i'm glad you stood in my way
you strike with dry poison
but your mama aint new york she is pure
you got you a fast horse darlin
dont you dare i said
how's the lizzies
and then he threw away our appleseed
and girls that eat pizza and never gain weight
bread can feed a few
so the desert blooms
if you keep my flesh firm
make it in the city
took my money
how do you keep the romance there
give me
maybe i could start again
i could keep our love together
baby it burns baby it burns baby it burns
that i used to hold
i knew someone had to lose
to be your fire on the side
watching you watching her play this game
with her yellow aston martin
and set the satnav to hell
her fire to your plain
but nothing comes
i hear my voice
where some screams have gone
raining in head
the sky is falling
cause sometimes
hey but i dont care
cause sometimes
i said sometimes
nobody else is slipping the blade in easy
from the woman clothed with the sun
can you feel them
some little sweet stories
if i've got to go
where somebody can get out
'cause she still can sway
for you the acrobat
kiss away night
i'm not like the girls that you've known
and to pretend
with the lights out it's less dangerous
empty
a mosquito
maybe it terrifies me
pip i
pip i
at the bottom of the river
these silken rubber gloves
to wish you harm
this has always been
the moon slipped from night
you know me
he's our commander still
he'll distract her good
deck the halls
so sure those girls
the hair in pairs
she's convinced she could hold back a glacier
but you dont you dont really mean it you dont really mean it
how many fates turn around in the overtime
she's addicted to nicotine patches
certain these clouds go somewhere
waiting on sunday to drown
billowing out luna riviera
some say a star will rise again
from the east frankincense
star of wonder star of night
what what does it take to make it through another day
it may be your turn to shine
black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
for the tree to drop
it didnt take long before she knew she had enough
she survived but she's feeling old
woke up to a world
deeper than i thought i was
i put our snowflake
you call me one more time
sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
through the middle of my soul
in the springtime of his voodoo
warp speed
foxy but
standin on a corner in winslow arizona
got an angry snatch
and right there for a minute
you've got to give something sometimes
drivin with my friends
a virgin portrait
a voice that caressed me
on my knees
make me laugh
stickers licked on lunch boxes
say you know what you want
typical the police came
make me laugh
he says she reminds him of me
beneath your firmaments
are you positive this is a friend
bring your torches
bring your torches
bring your torch to the cradle run
here you're haunting me by
even still you're calling me
what you tinbk you just said
the cowboy is his friend
no angel came
i left the right man
i wronged the right man
dont you want more then my sex
i could just pretend that you love me
hand me my leather
and it's not the weather
i guess i'm an underwater thing so i
calling for my sould at the corners of the world
momma keep your head down
you see her olives are cold pressed
which side your on
yello birk flying
here we go again
black winged roses that safely changed their color
here we go again
a girl from london town
they're all good cooks
london girls are the best in the world
i've got to find one
when it's their turn at the bar
the slip that brought me to my knees
i set it up
thought that i heard you sing
what's in a day
if truly his heart
in all kinds of ways
if he's ok
the best of baltimore
there's so much love in baltimore
with all the people who make it that way
love is what you'll find
it was a slight miscalculation that my friends
before you devour her
we're on the other side of her midnight
and then we tumbled out of control
feel those colors changing
through the bleak of winter
the beauty of speed
in a way i wasnt lovin
but i lie again
keeps perfectly still
you showed me the meadow
sniffing a sharpie pen
empty
dont break easily
keeps perfectly still
and through the life force and there goes her friend
so they went years and years
cant stop what's coming
and i see it coming and it's on its way
and sweet saying
you're right in the middle
place to bathe
then you call me call me in
empty
hard to please
empty
gimme 5 gimme 4 gimme 3
gonna turn that whiskey love into rain
by the woods
on the other side of the galaxy
by the woods
the other side of the galaxy
by the woods
in that tiny kinda scary house
on the other side of the galaxy
in that tiny kinda scary house
and he knew where the pillow goes
friends of the black swan
you know where she's gone
right down
what i taste
right down to you
i said a bliss
blood roses
you gave him you blood
i've thrown away those graces
blood roses
when chickens get a taste of your meat girl
when he sucks you deep
'cause i think you're wrong
seven devils bring them on
come and kneel with me body and soul
paint it in mint ice cream
bouncing off the top of this cloud
we could make this easy
about what you said has it come to this
hey general
why not two
got a pretty pretty garden
dont look away
no i cant hold
on her eyes on her horizon
come in rhythm
me and my alligator pears yeah
keep on drivin
and you're not here i need a big oan
i'm hiding it well sister ernestine
dreamed a little dream
you're right next to me
you say we'll take a holiday
funny how the distance
leave the wood outside
you're already in there
i'm already in
you're already in there
the girls in circles and circles and circles again well
leave them troubled boys all behind
it could be worse than that
leave them troubled boys all behind
just another trick can i
particle by particle she slowly changes
between the 1st and 40th drink
when will you wake up
i'm much stronger than you know
you could tell your secrets
is it cool baby
cool on your island
so then i thought i'd make some plans
this is cooling
and is your place in heaven worth giving up
faster than i can
things are getting kind of gross
with my encyclopedia
and the man with the golden gun thinks he knows so much
down the canyon
so i let crazy
i craved at all
to the light
kicked off my shoes
shut reason out
empty
i've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
i crucify myself
he says will you ever learn
save me
and my heart is sick of being in chains
why cant my balloon stay up in a perfectly windy sky
no cigarettes only peeled havanas for you
i can be cruel
you've gone and blown it
then you ram your hand in your bag for a little protection
ebony beauty passed this shade
knowing they're around the corner
brought me here
falling down falling down
she's a new friend
is there a way out of this
lies go back now to the garden
you have to soldier on
get out of my garden
crinum lily
empty
awabuki viburnum
golden trumpet tree
bleeding heart
empty
i know i need you
by my window at night
tell me are we
take me away
saviors out in space
to your floating city
oh that's all you hear
flying duchman
i know the guy who runs the place
they cant see what you see
and he's out of sight
poppa i know
long ago
you're gonna be bigger than a flea
when the white man came
you'll take me there
is that why
and it's time for you to decide
from the men who have now assumed their name
as good as it gets
a constellation
riding on backs of palominos
a girl disappearing
'cause i can still see you
she's been everybody else's girl
but i've cuts on my knees
one day maybe
the white coats enter her room
i give love
or was it shame
so that i i can live
auditioning for reptiles in their
joan of arcs to the right
orbitiong around
that sings bett davis eyes
gets a little toasty here
god sometimes you just odnt come through
i was here
you raced from langley
i'm freezing that frame
empty
glow in the street
empty
and somewhere alfie
you'll say as we are looking back
like a bull in a china shop
i cried and i washed my teras
here i go again
goodbye to pisces
she's gone but i'm alive
lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
mother superior jump the gun
and i'll go chassin the nuns out in the yard
oo who
i'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin
you found a firl that you could truly love again
will we pay for who we been
pull that lever
i love my job
it's the perfect job
pump the water build the pressure
empty
empty
empty
rolling and unrolling
you know you'll drink her
empty
deep ravine
making themselves pesters and lesters and jesters an dmy
on martha's foolish ginger
through the cliffs
hi surprise
if those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
with mary jane
they only wake to medicate
mary jane who
you and your unborn seed
for now you have hijacked the son
i know it's your day in the sun
from one mother to the other
youll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime
empty
got a full tank and some chips
does that mean i should spread
of fred's seville
and you're pushed flat on your stomach
now i wish that i'd been wrong and then
was another mother of
a wife on loan in a cafe
a mother revolution
be a good soldier
i like the dancing
dripping with blood
i can remember where i come from
empty
'cause the bad man made her cry
on a gendarme
but everyday i know that
cause it's cold cold cold
or a civiliaes syllabub
he found me in a state
and even as i'm climbing up the stairs
if you follow john or paul
the personals are great
sweet sweet
sweet sweet
till i get my own tv show
to take me by the hand
empty
through me again
and though me again
waiting for the phone to ring
i'll come running to you hey baby if you want me
over the bridge we go
it's new age
but i fell this cake just isnt done
i loved his secret places
said if you could see me now
empty
rest you shoulder peaches and cream
just like my daddy selling his baby
china white
'cause you can
into a genital panic
a little mental yoga
for me
for her
so hey do you do judo in your finery
empty
cause boy you still look pretty
cause boy you still look pretty
and now
cause boy you still look pretty
when you're putting the damage on
betrayed by many now ornaments dripping above
in the garden i did no crime
everybody knows
im my heart i did no crim
when all the boys cant be men
she reads simone de beauvoir in her american circumstance
all you need is love is all you need
take your mind back i dont know when
now it's all change it's got to change more
cant you see their leather shine
dont know how to be a man
and so it goes go round again
to chase the sun with ribbons undone
she corrects me and says
it is your time
lay back and relax
my love for you so long i've been saving
there was a time i said to you
it will all find its way in time
blossom riot poof
so you go break the terror
it will all find its way in time
blossom riot proof
i think i understand
thinking i'd find something that we'd lost
i have memorized
sometimes i watch
candy the yams and spice the hams
drippy ends of ice cream cones
glops of gooey bubble gum
that finally it touched the sky
that i cannot right now relate
you had moved in
all debts are off this year
now forgotten
you will want me
jumps at three tears at thirteen
mixed with girl not so peaceful
turn you around
eighteen wheels in a high heel
she's worked here a year longer than 1
i cna't believe this violence in mind
they're too many stars and not enough sky
it's the dog trainer again
and there's something believin
and i said you know that i'm drowning
maybe she's right
burning everything that's sacred in my genes
i'm never here
become of we baby
dont run back inside
oh thunder road oh thunder road
with petticoats out
why all this spare
and you're east of east st louis
and it's time time time
well she said she'd stick around
and splash into the streets
the way the light rose
you always loved the smell of the wood burning
a toast in your honor
on your right standing is
toodles mr jim
the cherry picker
you cherry picker
'cause i'm with you
no matter what tie she's got in her right dresser
but i can see that star
god i love to turn my little blue world
oh i know you love to turn this little blue girl baby
faster than you find your own
even upside down
i found the secret to life
still coming out of your mothers
prophets crying
the true divine creator wants a
wrapped around her skin
covering him all the same
oh virginia
hear this prayer of the wampum
a hair too much to chat of
the way down
we call cajun on a wednesday
and stop for a coffee
so we go you tell me
i think that i'm lost here
perfect heal it
heels on go on
welcome to england he said
you gotta bring your own sun
this is what begins
this is winter's gift
born this day a new nowell
where the drifts get deeper
all the white horses are still in bed
when you gonna make up your mind
on the shelf
you say that things change
bringing out with the december snow
the summer queen
a forest greets the snowy evening
passes the torch as it was intended
ringing out
winter's carol
exotic matter that cells divide arresting time
your petrol emotion
is there any way is there any way forward
make them go
show me the ways to button up buttons
there's something we left on the windowsill
it's kind of a shame cause i did like that dress
we'll see
and i sneeze
to the shores
if you were to get lost behind these locks
of this i know
aint that a good thing cause
you can bring your dog anytime
empty
but i'm a lush for your love
honeybee go home please stay
to you and your friend
me as mine to
straight through the land
and form a ring of rain
does it say pick out your cloud
and soon you were drifting away
some wait and pray and scan the horizon
water cleans the system
pacify your emptiness
acid head
but johnny is no more
in the bloodiest battles of our nations history
known from the dead that washed ashore
escape the sonar the bathyscaphe
then you can enter into grace
i know your defense is to say god said dominate them
forced to take drugs we've made
the truth is they can see but not as good as you and me
this is why i am the way that i am
nobody's fault but yours
please excuse me for yelling
of shrieking sounds that evoke the legions of hell
he said they're simply notes put together in bars
to me it's two hundred beats per minute
you stopped playing father
i'm sorry for annoying you
but i'll get up
you're the only one
no morning cup of coffee
for supremacy
you wear your poker face
the past is just that
its not the wieght of the stone that's holding you down
x marks the spot at 145 a stone dislodged held him fast
the beast that held him was a 10 pound stone
we're being trained
would mute cries fall on deafened ears
feeling numb
if i cant face the consequences of my actions
i crank the knife with another
is it joan of arc revisited
with emotional rigormortis freezing your step
covenant to covenant
sola fide
sinless one received the wrath
is there anyone to help you
i know that she will live
get away from me
somebody said he's getting worse
give to me the dreams my brain and mind will not recall
this fate could be for me or you
take a look at your friends is that what you want
speaking out against idolatry he came to set the captives free
to the one
stinging infusion of chemical
why cats land on their feet
what's wrong with me what's wrong with you
stumble soot foot fumble
burning different flames
for those who have faith to dare
behold the plan
by fire they died
skeezix bloated in petulance from the night's debauch
some call him gilgamesh the man who has never tasted death
and you can win the battle when you pray without fear
the self confidence of young minds
but with insufficient no volition
just think of what it does to wreck
i cut him up this evening
i never knew how heavy
under the law
consigned to neglect
leprosy leprosy
born in a world
you're gonna lose
well i got some really bad news
and turned away
and i cannot fake what i tried to make of myself a god
now i so clearly see how i have murdered me and i cannot fake please heal
and with my burden bury
three daughters and seven sons
give me one more test
i didnt ask you
then god gave his discourse
car for sale what a deal i assure you it's a steal
i thought i knew you pretty well but under stress you fell apart
in our friendship you can trust hey that frame is full of rust
there's a place we take you to
i never see them anyway
i think you know what to do
the very thing that seems to me
walking through a solid wall
the feeling is gone then our soul we will pawn
now i want to follow you
through the drone of a hemodialysis machine
god is ever present
the things you own will not atone
of things that last and things that dont
choose you must choose
this big world will end
forgiveness and grace lord
who shall you blame
oh get on your knees
let us pray
what more could you ask for
you'll lose the floor
we're deaf to all
what you've known
while earthenware pots are shattered and scattered
in sea of coal black sin
my yoke and burden are light
ten commandments become suggestions
peeling back the ludicrous thought patterns of my past
no more my skin dows crawl
let us bow down to his great golden calf
why should we listen to his set of his rules
microscopic view of a telescopic realm
when the tufted footfalls of a jungle beast silently slip past your
as the sunlight sets the clouds aflame do you not wonder of how they
i know you feel confused
never will i turn my back on you
the end of life begins
his name the prince of peace
unravel the surcingle clotted and much
tou've failed the test in column a
you're the chosen i'm the chooser
the notion that we're better than them
half the heat half the burn
civil war casualties
nerves ripped from the spinal cord
the phantom limb will start to haunt you
barnacle ridden psyche mans own demise to demonstrate
a shred of truth is illuminated by miner's light
hearts will stop beating
freedom will end
your tears will be bleeding
the cudgel of forlorn dreams hits me square and final
the cudgel of forlorn dreams hits me square and final
years later in the metal chair
but remember this
a burning desire to burn
will i join the ranks of the photo gallery
i joined the ranks of the photo gallery
empty
collect the skeletal remains
you'll never get that close
it matters not who is guilty who is innocent
bind the ropes set the horses afoot
just another day for me to abhor
anger needs a process for its gravestone
you'll be left alone with all the pain
stealing the joy that you need to live
sow a thought reap an action
ringing the death bell
broken home broken dreams
and dreams of how it could have been
good enough for them is
call to me and i will be the spring
my pet my pet how fun you are
i reach out to touch you i'm getting so brave
of total defeat
but soldiers fall when they proudly stand
cut it up and let it stand the theologic test
his love and his grace they will see you through
now i'm blackmailed not to say
a world that needs a way out
that she followed behind
a world that needs a way out
physic's law number two
by choosing a foolish road to seek
the pride on your lips is sealing your fate you just wait
hateful whores transformed to virgins
secure within the confiness of the stone
the greatest city of all nineveh with a towering city walls
would i even care would i even care
all the blood and the sweat on his brow
so my blind soul could see could see
which one am i
5 days at sea starved to the core lifeboat is leaking a rip in the floor
sitting in a corner admiring the sunbeams
gonna blow the escape hatch
all you got to do is pick up your telephone
but if i'm just a little bit late
now that you're tired of pretending
when i think of you i'll remember
that's a bad way of saying goodbye
i aint been around the world
thought i'd been moved
no there
no other woman
the only stampede that he's ever seen
he aint right for you
all hat and no cattle aint gonna get it done
that's all i ask for any more
let 'em outlive me by a hundred years
trust someone again
and there was you
that it could make up for the lies and wasted years
and i'm proud to be on this peaceful peice of property
and it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels and saluted me
across the lawn up the stairs
i've been away way too long
they'll be burning all night long yeah yeah
oh i couldnt wait to get here
i talked my way
me and my no brain
pretty quick
empty
you and me alone darlin doing what we do best
well they can boogie woogie all night long
big time we're gonna grab some
troubled soul all alone
all your heartache and frustration
but if you need a place to land
maybe love is what we'll find
feels like i'm doin somethin
'cause girl my desire might make you mine
feels like i'm doin something
can i want your love
chrome get her leg up high
her favorite color is chrome
maybe you were right maybe i was wrong
make it better after the fact
come home come home
and left the city limit sign layin in the ditch
it was a boomtown back in '62 'til the coal ran out
drilling oil from the bottom
ive worked through broken drills
and stare at the picture of you
that i go through is
i dont know when to quit
i never needed a fix like this before
you keep me comin back for more
while the kids all play flies and mosquitos stay away
is you miss me and get home in a hurry
a hot homemade apple pie on the passenger seat
go out there and do your family proud son
and if the wind should leave my sail
and that light that's always on
i always know i always know
yeah saturday nights we'd lead the parade
got nothin but memories
and i'm nothin but sorry
it's the hour of ghosts i'm the soul surivior
and say i love you so
what i cant change
knowing what i know now about foolish pride
two windows on the parking lot
reminding me of how good it was
alone for the night
one of them was gonna save me
have you ever had
i always have one of those days
tright to one of those days that leads
one of those smiles on me
right to one of those nights
i thought those old feelings would be long gone by now
promises sealed with kisses straight from our hearts
empty
on a big windshield
somewhere inside me

mudgrips white tip
wranglers skoal ring

but you tracked me down
our love's dead and gone

long legged shadows
on her mama's clothesline in my head
holdin on tight
and the ground is hardened
the grass was wet
i was workin for her daddy
i smell the fragrance of your hair
on the floor beside our bed
i'm still alone you're still not here
then i wake up
i'm still in love
when i rode out of dallas
you're a truly lovely lady
ever sets me free
i've reached the only logical conclusion
self help psychology
there aint no rhyme or reason why
when all i can afford is a two room shack

i took her to the moon and i cant bring her back

traveling through this world of woe
where god's redeemed their vigils keep
that we been living in
the way you're lookin at me

that i do
empty
i've watched him struggle and i've watched him age
blood sweat and tears on every dollar he made
driving me out of your mind
so why's he out there holding you so tight

i'll show 'em my nine point buck on the wall
talkin 'bout lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
but with all of that pain
yeah love you done all you can do to me
and she's lookin at me

i found a sweet young girl to replace all the love we knew
austin cunningham grand
for her it's gettin old

mama thought i never would settle down
bubba junior pitches for his baseball team
we aint rich and wont be for a while

with her on my mind
it's easy to see
oh even though
but i figured id get it come the weekend
ill be there to lift you up again
you and i we got down on our knees and said
if youre not too tired and its not too late
not so long ago
she called them redneck roses
it's the usual end of the day
from a country boy to his girl
i look for a crowd
comparin them to you
you'd think that i'd have learned
i say i'll forget her
for the longest time i didnt know what i was born to do
some can take a brush and make colors and canvas a work of art
guess the lord has a way of blessing us all
when i get home in the evening
and im lyin there with her
i'm not sure they make it anymore
they just dont last long enough
the kind that stays together
is this your way of telling me
i cant wave a magic wand
look around and i'll be gonecuz i aint no magician
have a good one she told me as she walked away
it's over but over and over it echoes all night long
sometimes it seems a man is born to lose no matter how hard he tries
life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my womans eyes
be holdin heaven in my arms tonight
all it takes to keep her tuned up is boots and wrangler jeans
she's a real low maintenance country music beat driven honky tonk dancin machine
somebodys probably worked it out
hey how much does the world weigh
theyre breaking up and he thinks hes to blame
guess i must have hurt you bad
i just want to love you againlet's forgive and forget and start over
i didnt mean to make you sad
i'll miss you i love you that's all
the angel i made you into had to fall
yeah i still love the night life
each time we get the chance
yeah i still love the night life
yeah i still love the night life
i wanna touch you like i did back then
back then there was nothin we couldnt do
i cant believe we let it end
and i cant live like this no more
is gonna take a ride
i cant find me if i stay
they had big plans they had no doubts but then the bottom fell out
somebody's world gone up in smoke
man across the counters thinkin what price tag he'll put on
and never find another you
i will follow you to the end of the earth for my place will be with you i have taken you for better or worse someone to give my love to
well goodness gracious what's that i see
lord have mercy here she comes
i need something to brag about
1st chorus
baseball hot dogs apple pies2nd chorus
you can settle down in mexico
it doesnt really matter if you wanna rock or roll
just take me with you when you go
i walked in the band just stunk
and i revealed to her my two left feet
and after round seven or was it eight
three rounds with jose cuervo
swing me 'round that hardwood floor
i'm here to dance and nothing more
heavens smilin down on me
it takes my breath away
thanks to the keeper of the stars
somethin that i havent learned to do
you said id be fine but you were lyin
since i told her i could not stay
for leavin tucson too soon
undo the right
undo the right
i've done my share of walkin out
i'll be a better man for where i've been
i'm back to stay to the lovin end
i've been called an old tomcat
he'd live to see the day
walkin the line
i'd spend all my time
girl i might as well be
you said you'd always be my cowgirl
i'll be stickin out my thumb
and walkin
rind county watermelon festival ahead
let me show you something that you aint never seen
if you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl
have fun you all
so daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight
as cold as december
when mama aint happy aint nobody happy
and the pony she named wildfire
and on wildfire were both gonna go
you touched my cheek and told me not to cry
and you told me this pain was not the kind to last
a different one for every day
and dream about what i had before
well you never know just how good you've got it
i'm on a white line runnin down the interstate
and you wont see me when i start fallin
and i cried a river cried a mile wide one
she knows every move that a man could make
boy you can bet if a move can be made
you've never seen me cry and carry on
i'm gonna cry out loud
everything she does i somehow justify
like a frightened runaway child i always return
i caught a tear as she slipped off to sleep
empty
i'm about as lonesome as it gets
it would't be enough to numb this hurt i feel
it's a crying shame what fools we've been
empty
i'd give anything if you loved me
and there's alot of good memories in my way
a better man
lose our heads and gamble with our hearts
aw cause we aint perfect yet
i never felt as helpless as i do today
if i could lord knows i would spin back the hands of time
take a second look at what we had
we could walk barefoot
and another woman twenty seconds to have him crawlin again
first he said he loved you he promised you he'd be true
even though he hurt you he's still the one you want
in the middle of those running years she walked into my life
there was nowhere left to turn to but back to my old self
we aint in no hurry
and your doubts about me
give into your desire
as daddy showed me wrong from right
granddaddy was a man i loved
they dont go away and they dont come cheap
it's time to get lazy had enough crazy
this makin a livin is killin me
lay in the snow white sand
i'm dreamin in color livin in black and white
lonely like the way you left me
he has sentenced himself to life
if i was nearin the end
some they are drawn to gold
to see the look that's in your eyes makes the tears well up in mine
eternity cant you see
it ended when she said your second home just became your first
i dont have to mow no lawn
i said dont' worry baby it'll be alright
our california dreams went south
with every stroke he brought to life
for a while she'll be mine again
a little house on the edge of town
put her there in the front yard swing
got new tires and a good cb
but i got a cousin that i want you to meet
i want to show you the riviera
but i got a cousin that i want you to meet
always clinging to some old star
they'll take any wrong direction
but they'll be raising hell till then
yea i'm always runnin i'm always runnin behind
watch the world go by while i unwind
and since you left
to get us back together
of this bottle i'm clinging to
sundays twice weds too i'd take my seat on the front row pew
with a 5 pc band
repeat chorus|repeat chorus
i've been right where you are
cant ease the pain down there inside
it's good to see your face again it's been awhile
empty
i recognized his handsome face
three or four divorces at least that many horses
well so smoke em' when you got em'
she would always give in when we'd fight about religion
i may have won those battles but i still lost the war
now sittin here i'm looking back
just to make your dreams come true like i once did
i'd give anything to be your everything again
cause if the good die young
cause if the good die young
cause if the good die young
it was where my mama sat on that old swing with her crochet
we'd still have our problems but we'd all be friends
treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
with every breath i'll ever take
empty
in a moment of weakness who would have known
wouldnt let me give inrepeat chorus
and she's been doin just fine
i heard more than just her words
so remember this while you're losin me
and i was doin too much time away from home
son think of it like a circus ride
quits his job and starts singing at night
and thats what makes life beautiful
its all how you look at it
the end of my hopes the end of all my dreams
the company was gay we'd turn night into day
a terraced house in a mean street back of town
behind the door where my love reigned as queen
nothing but a broken truck heat and dust
i got a sneakin suspicion love is walkin out the door
when the chorus came around i knew every word every line was written about you
it's got you all over it
i was once a believer till life got the best of me
through the darkness of the dim neon and lonely shade of blue
and she'll be with a different man tonight
and she'll be with a different man tonight
cause it's my heart thats being broken
if that's not where you want to be
said bless his little heart he's an exciteable boy
i get a little carried away
repeat chorus
what a sad affair
you can run from here to kingdom come
i could find you in california
if i was burning my last chance
i never knew that she was leaving
she was breaking from the inside out
but that old cliche' is a given
but all his so called riches
we make a life
she once swore she loved me
and my angel just wont let me in
it may be the fall that brings you to your knees
your heart drops
god made woman on a good day
now there goes the reason that the bills get paid
i've got more regrets than blades of grass that cover up this dirt
that cant be drowned by all the water found on god's green earth
i wont need my keys aint gonna be
i never know when i'm leaving or when i'll be coming back
cause her heart doesnt notice
she always ends up right here in my heart
he's a hard workin easy goin country boy he wouldnt harm a fly
so if you cross his path you better beware been wounded by a woman
cound bring about any man down
these empty miles and her memory
thats how a cowgirl says goodbyecalled up her mam in abilene
if my old truck was a horse
everytime i think i'm off and runnin
everytime i get a leg up
it might as well be timbucktu
i lost my dreams somewhere between the moon and you
empty
she was serving all night coffee
so i throw caution to the wind
and go crashing at the speed of a fool
i want you to know
but dont ever wonder what you mean to me
he's takin steps
empty
for 22 years she stood by a man
somewhere a great grandpa says
but darlin let me say before i leave
now we've acquired all i thought would please you
stones i handed one to you
a tiny velvet box
one by one they mark our passage
years are like the wind
our lives are paved with stones
like a lighthouse standing alone
who calls now and then
she's strong
but when you stepped off that plane i knew i was your fool
but right now i'm in heaven and i cant help myself
yeah me and my old buddy leroy we'd go driving around
tryin to pull down that old water tank sits out on the county line
tryin to pull down that old water tank sits out on the county line
i'm sortin through the memories still searchin for a clue
and he's holding you
we could walk barefoot through the warm wet sand
but i do now and there aint a cloud in my mind
dont take for granted that he chose the cross he bears
empty
since i've worn that smilewhat happened to that smile
i've wasted time here missing you
on the graveyard shift a call comes in
i'm someone you might never need
my throat goes dry at all that i could lose
think of me
brothers wearing beads and he smokes alot of dope
sister calls herself a sexy grandma
life means nothing without you
i've gotta stop your love from dying
at the love that we once knew
i'm today's lonely fool
baby i know i did you wrong
they're all forgiven
now you're wanting me to believe
you left looking fine now you
sunset to sunrise havent slept a wink
you dont wait up like you used to
empty
in a big red folger's can hid behind the pots and pans
i still miss her everyday
some take to drinkin
watched the devil dance
so i walk away 'cause the fire still burns
sometimes i go for days
i pray the lord our hearts to keep
a lotta roads underneath these wheels a lotta wounds that time has healed
rows of houses with manicured lawns sat staring back at me
i tried to save you from yourself i felt every high and low
you never tell me how you feel and your moods they always change
i'm not the one who hurt i'm the only one who cares
i couldnt save you you are who you are
as you drown me with your eyes
i search for the one who bleeds
can you tell
and so does everbody else
does it really even matter that i have my doubts
we're far away
with you
darling darling forgive
if i stray out too far
go break me out
empty
you're so contagious running through my veins
i am burning in your fire there is no cure
your eyes give you away
put the mask back on put the mask back on
not apply you could never be denied you took advantage of a good thing and now the void you
has anyone ever seen your real face
dont you know you're diggin too deep too deep
let me know let me know how far you take it
oh i want to let it go i want my peace of mind
time that called for space
until this echo in my mind
do we know how to get the message across
we've never chosen to keep what we've got
empty
hold onto the calm before the storm came
they will disappear and so will all your fears
well that's over
this is not where you belong
i see your motives inside and decision to hide
the last time you cared about anything
all the time your life passes you by
you must think this is all we have now
i thought i heard y ou say that you were sick of this place i'm tired or hearing you cry no
how do you know just who your friends are
you never know when to begin
when nothings final
are you under
i want this i want this
empty
if it's not this one wont find another
i want let you know that i want you
i'll bring it right back to you
i want you to see all the sides
i want to to surrender
that my canvas is incomplete
my independence is calling my name
why do i rush to slow down
tomorrow comes we start to fade
why do i rush to slow down everything
why do i rush to slow down
why do i rush to slow down
i cant ask these questions that cannot be answered today
will we ever feel this real
i can dig my own graves now
you are the only one in color
i've opened up my mind so tell me how to think
free to choose as long as i live your dreams
i want to know who you're running from me or you
empty
i wonder if it's good enough to make you stay
i know only time can heal scars
i'm ready when you are
anyone forgive
you have my word
i am a repeat offender
i will live with this forever
looks are every thing
with another pretty face
you make your decision
so fill the empty space
skin deep
skin deep
why dont you let me be
i have had enough
you've gone as far as i'll go
after insult 9x
you wanna see a reaction
keep it inside the image portrayed
i found a line and then it grew
our memories so intertwined
i rememberthe way you made me feel when i was with you
you find yourself standing in front of the mirror
so afraid that you'll lose
no one to catch your insecurities
so conversational everytime
your story was always based on fiction
left behind
i commit the crime
i've been here too long and i've spent to much time
and nothing's what it seems
loneliness a ritual
but still you cannot leave
i know that you use me to use you
i've been dying to let you win
i want your eyes on me
it's never easy to forget
i wanna be your new victim
i'm right here
that you wanna go
and i'm waiting for you
anytime i wanted i could show you how i feel
and i've been waiting for you
i'd cross the line if you wanted it
you dont ever ask me why
whats the cost whats the cost
i dont belong
simple mind
it doesnt matter what we say my own wasteland
i'm already gonne
how will this be when all is said and done will i know where i'm from remember me
we have nothing left
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
and when you cant hear a sound will the silence drown you too
so many things you couldnt let me know
it's getting harder to sit here alone
i cant hide the way i feel about you anymore
i've got to take the chance or let it pass by
now i dont deny i was guilty
'cause i gotta run you see i'm under the gun
honey open up and let me in
and i aint never goin back again
said i'd give you the whole world somehow
please tell me you will remember
and if you could read my heart
girl i've had the best of intentions
a notch in the bible belt
well i'll tell ya somethin brother when you're dealin with the devil
i dont know how they're doin but i know that they're screwin up
i dont do garden parties sippin hot tea
dont like caviar we like our soup from a can
i'm a blue collar man
so what i really need to know is can i trust you with my heart
without knowing just one answer can i trust you with my heart
empty
to go bouncin aroundin a beat up truck
dealing with all my emotions
when we fell in love sweetheart
that burns in my mind
did you fall far enough
repeat chorus
we were talking on the line today
you've got double trouble cant you see
she played her game until she found
she had one man in the country
but that's just what you do
that ol moon up in the sky
i believe i'm slowly sinking
i know i'll find you but girl 'til i do
'til you drift off to dream in my arms you might be hundreds or more miles away
last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
as in the ashes passion slowly dies
written by travis tritt bruce ray brown
and you made this empty house into a home
but i can close my eyes and rest
leaning on her is where i make my stand
but you outta see him come runnin when mama calls his name
empty
she was runnin at me tellin me to lay that hammer down cuz theres a man right
me pistol pointed at my side
and when i try to pour my hear out to you
and when i try to pour my hear out to you
hiding ignorance and fear i prayed nobody saw me bluffing
no more lookin over my shoulder
oh but one night sick and tired of being sick and tired
with yesterday's sorrows
that my world could not continue without you
and i can run but i cant hide
so with all these bridges burned
i wish i'd listened to my conscience
'cause there aint nothing short of dying
there aint nothing short of dying
we're all cut from the same mold
where the country legends stood
but i'll cast my vote for hag
but rhythm and blues is in my blood
sing all them old time country songs
put some drive in your country
yeah put some drive in your country
when the music gets you movin
michael henderson
whatever it takes i do what i please
yeah i can hold my own i'm the restless kind
i'm a little rough around the edges but i think i'm exactly what you need
but neither does a diamond when you pick it up
with a heart that's hard and heavy as a sack full of stones
every time i close my eyes at night
with a heart that's cold and heavy as a sack full of stones
well i guess you'd call me trouble
but i compromise on friday nights
and i dont have to be jealous
i found what i'd been looking for
on that you can depend
she's going home with me
the way that i wanted to be
tell me when will i have a love of my own
so the boy got a badge and a suit of blue
between a forty four and a heart of gold
blew all his burdens away
this aint no livin this aint no groove
this aint no livin this aint no groove
the city's rich we're dirt poor somewhere waitin
hoostart the car baby
well i dream someday you'll love me but that dream just dont come true
but now you say all that's binding you is me
i'm just tryin to make a livin watching everybody else havin fun
she told me not to stare cause it was impolite
cause the world aint ready for nothing like y o u
written by travis tritt bruce ray brown
and it was just my imagination telling lies
but nowhere near as full grown
i'm kicking up my shoes
she called me a clown
that hurt me night and day
they knew my name at every bar in town
i've been watchin you a while
well around here baby
honey i'm tougher than the rest
honey i'm tougher than the rest
it was tearin my whole world apart
roger murrah alan springer
staring at his favorite coffee cup
you may change your mind
hard times are real
when you told me you were leaving
'cause it's an awful price i'm paying
but that's just wishful thinking on my part
but just between you and me darling
it was worth every milei know you and i both had our doubts
it was worth every mile
well you gotta love the lord for makin girls like that
make a man cry like a little spoiled brat
cause life's so hard to understand
and see this little man about to drown
cause life's so hard to understand
my mama told me since the day i was born
watermelons are hanging on the vine
baby close that suitcase you've been packin
once our love was strong it can be again
chorus 2 x's
that's the reason she is here
i had to find somebody new
helping me get over youhelping me get over you
i had to find somebody new
here's a quarter call someone who cares
listen close to the guitar man narive sone of a foreign land
someone's lost in yesterday hazy dreams of monterey
i wish i could go back home
turns out her love is what i'm needing most
we had a good thing now it's gone
and love was something i thought i knew well
and i've dropped a million quarters down the jukebox
there's been times i've felt like half a man
chorus 2 x's
i find myself daydreamin
like none i've ever known
i'm all the man i'll ever need to be
i'm gonna be somebody
i'm gonna be somebody someday
empty
and it's a goofy thing but i just gotta say
it's been fifteen years since i left home
there's some hard times in the neighborhood
i know the suns still shinin when i close my eyes
what made you think i'd let you run me down
it's a game that i cant win but i'll be damned if i give in
i could put a down payment on some peace of mind
'cause i'm just livin on borrowed time
her mom said hon cant even see that thing
travis tritt troy seals
i've tried so hard to please
yeah it's time to get this monkey off my shoulder
if that's what you must do
but a lover is forever
but a lover is forever
an act of kindness a tender smile
for each and every bell that rings
another angel it's a wonderful life
an now i'm feelin the wind blow i've never been so high
baby dont you let go now
put your hand to the plow
baby dont you let go baby dont you let go
and if there's any way if there's any way
believe me baby i lied
if you were out of sight and out of mind
that was my wounded pride
and all the tears in the world wont help you now
better your heart than mine
you broke my heart in two
all i want is you tonight
i'd rather have i love you
bring me all your lovin
bring me all your lovin
come back when it aint rainin on you
come back when it aint rainin on you
talk like an angel talk like an angel
walk like an angel
you look like an angel look like an angel
oh yes you are
making you stay
down on my knees
i'd be down on my knees
she knows a nice young man
everybody knows what to do about my misery
but i cant even walk down the street
but it was all
it's some reward for all our time
but in my darkness
but like a compass you were there to point the way
follow the winds into tomorrow tomorrow
i trust where it leads me
why you would turn from love and run
just let the phone ring now isnt that strange
and it makes me happy
late at night i write my own movies
i didnt think about you
it's a start
with nothin else to do but follow me around
can live without me too
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
yesterday i thought that i walked alone
but the nightingale saved a prayer for me
i can hold my tonguei can hold my wine
i was born the restless kind
when i heard that old familiar music start
after i'd forgotten all about us
we were young and were in love
the song remembers when
around corners i have turned
how much she loved him
the sweetest gift
she did not bring to him
daddy told me when i was young
you've gotta listen to the whisper of your heart
and you're deciding in the dark
and when you come to the crossroads
but i can see
when you go a little farther than
sometimes i think
that you have
you must be talking to
till they're all alone and sad
how could i have a love so fine
and it's gonna be a cold hard night
like the sun fallin out of the clear blue sky
we're looking for the king
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
i've been thinkin about you
cant stop thinkin about you
and i still hear the echoes of those bitter words we said
right now i'm like a wounded bird
cause i'll never know what's beyond the mountain
you made me love you so bad
too bad you're no good
too bad you're no good
you made me love you so bad
still i cant keep from wonderin
could you take me back and try me again
'til you say you'll come back again
between the damned and the devout
'til the sun blushed ruby red
maybe you will maybe then you wont
you dont know how much it hurts me
you dont know how much it hurts me
thought about the words you said
but it did
love couldnt lie to me
but it did
i told the wind to sigh like lovers do
then they start to cry
and you would be here soon
maybe it's love
i didnt want to hurt again
i'm tearing down the walls inside
maybe it's love
looking for some piece of mind cant find it anywhere
i went down to austin lots of beautiful people there
is just melancholy blue
when they carried the radio home
the crows in the high tree top
and it's miles at the careless touch
chilled to the bone by the waters you've tread
he said for you he'd change
it's not as far as it might seem
thought my world had come to an end
you can come to me
love was never a friend of mine
come the morning and i will stand
you treat me like my mama raised a fool
but my two feet are strong and it wont take'em long
on a bus to st cloud minnesota
just a face in the crowd
and it's strange but it's true
with the snow falling down around you
why do i keep lovin you
come into my arms
one love
all my life i had never guessed
sent from heaven above
sunday mornin when the paper comes
in a perfect love
it's just you and me
in a perfect love
throw your rope around the runaway freight train
ah ha
i get lost i get lonely
well you wanted trouble now you got a fistful
you are the world to me
for my love is for only you
you want me to act
i fall to pieces
it all comes down to me and you
we made our break right out of high school
through the years
knowin we can live on love alone
so let's jump in
we started out strangers on a two way street
it's a powerful thing
it's a powerful thing
and a diamond ring
but this town has ears and this town has eyes
throw me out a lifeline baby
just needed some room to clear your mind
but i dont believe you believe you can ever get by me
when you count up the odds there's still no guarantee
that television seems to be your life's ambition
do you remember how it used to be
i need that old friend that i once knew
somebody draw the line so i can blow right past
i've gotta set this spirit free
i've got to get out
i want to live again
i want to laugh
i've got to get out
i want to live again
i'd've loved you anyway
i'd've loved you anyway
i would've loved you anyway
i've got chardonnay chillin in the frigidaire
well i've got a little dream about the rest of my life
oh it's like a honeymoon without champagne
ask if this love runs deep in me
as much as you love me
you could think no other love could last as long
and for every kiss
as much as you love me
i'll still love you more
said i'd love you till the day that i die
what took me so long
since i let you go
feat garth brooks
in another's eyes
starin back at me
they dont realize
the girl you swore you'd never leave
you know there aint no doubt i wanna know you inside out
i wanna scream and shout i wanna know you inside out
your deepest fear about growin old
and as he watched him grow
it wasnt his child
but he did all could
but it wasnt his child
well i'm thinkin everything is cool
hey baby what can i say
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright
the lights are turned way down low
when we finally kiss goodnight
you know i wont brake in two
like we never had a broken heart
we've been in love right from the start
but you do the best you can
of the daily 9 to 9 that keeps your family alive
little hercules
you sing a sad song but you're not alone
i know how you feel lonesome dove
lookin back on yesterday
seemed so big back then
i heard the thunder rollin in
by the time we climbed inside
same ol house i grew up in
nothin here's the same except for the georgia rain
hey i'm tired of this hard luck
hey gimme the good stuff
instrumental close
do you know how tight i'm holding to hard promises to keep
i thought you'd want them back someday
i meant every word i said
in your eyes i'm like the rest
you can run you can hide
baby mine was a harmless heart
of the girl she was and the man he seemed to be
oh she's got a heart like a sad song
now my heart tells a different tale
the harder i become
with no idea where she has gone
she figures she'll know where she is when she's there
stared at the phone
when i see you i'm drawn to you
here comes temptation
oh i'm looking at paradise
here comes temptation
need you to hold
baby you would take away everything real in my life
baby you would take away everything
oh how do i live
and i cant understand
if love wasnt meant to be
if that's how the story ends
to get lost in a lover's kiss
and still have no regrets
did you ever want something so bad
i dont fall in love so easy
but i'm fallin in love with you
but what else can i do
who'd of thought it was me
but to sink
the tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
baby i know something's wrong
once you let it out it's done
my head says i must be blind
even though my heart cries
that tell me what i've gotta be
what he'll hold tonight in his hands
i work 9 5 and i cant relate
in love with this man i see lyin here next to me
vixen and blitzen come on here
all the little toys were happy too cause they were so bright and new
i got no business 'round here today
just to feel your cold rejection
well you pull me under
fall into the river
aint gonna move 'till you're good and ready
i know you think you'd never be mine
i guess sad eyes never lie
you're gonna see me comin
santa claus is comin
with no guarantees no safety net
who offers a place warm as the sun
before it slips by
dont you know heartaches are heros when their pockets are full
just say you're looking for something you might have forgot
the girls say god i hope he comes back soon
when it comes to brains he got the short end of the stick
they're too busy holdin on to one another
she's in love with the boy
it wasnt very long ago
what's meant to be will always find a way
some days are better than others
it just means that i cant find no cover
'til you calmed me down
it's such an unusual sight
something goes wrong
some people never say the words i love you
it's apt to confuse me
seems like you're never in
honey trying to figure you out
i try to get you on the phone and i get stuck on hold
honey trying to figure you out
i know time is money
so not like the rest of them
standin out in a crowd standing out
where the spotlight finds you and singles you out
where the spotlight finds you and singles you out
sweet little holy chil
de worl the world treat you mean lawd
i'm puttin on my lipstick my ruby red lipstick
it aint the gettin it's the wishin
it aint the heaven it's the preachin
oh you can leave your hat on baby
i take a walk
but something's missing underneath the tree
come and kneel before the lamb
tryin to love you
broke my heart it's chipped away my pride tryin to love you
i guess i'll always be
we laugh at the way they laugh at you and i
movin as slow as the law allows
only to find a yellow brick road
it took a little time
there were things you couldnt hear
you know it's really gettin to you
all you need's a heart
thus are the dreams of an average jane
she's gonna know it in a matter of time
so she'll ride this ride as far as it can go
and reaches for his arm
i see you waiting in the shadows
cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues
make it sad so sad
no i couldnt taste the tears other people shed
you used to soothe me
but i'll just cut right through
and i still speak my mind
would let forever come to
i believe in miracles
i will follow
if we can love forever
and you cant find your tomorrow
when you've lost sight of your dreams
and made the road for the car that took him away
it was all that time i didnt take
i wanna know who invented the wheel
hear me cry for you baby
hear me cry for you baby
dont bother sittin at my table
yes i'm as good as what you're thinkin
i dont want to stay home waitin
wouldnt any woman
i've tried everything with you even livin on faith
taking me to that nashville sign
calling my name from the opry stage
between love and money
if you get paids
sign her letters with x's and o's
i dont want to be left alone
you know i've seen it before
with the top rolled down
you hit the switch turned out the light
another's arms have held you tight
you dont have to move that mountain
you dont have to move that stumblin block
you say you will
you say you will
you're where i belong
you're my harbour you're my shelter
my baby you're where i belong
my baby you're where i belong
i hear the children crying
sad song sad song
you better call out
how longhow longhow long
how long to sing this song
dance with me
shake shake
and and you can go there too
starting a landslide in my ego
what are the feelings
those cars
more lights
twilight breaking through
uh huh
heartbreak hotel
a primitive love
and you hunger for the time
a high road out from here
oh oh ohon borderland we run
empty
through the rain and fallen snow
you can feel the enemy
and you can dream
yeah i'd break bread and wine
and you can dream
so dream out loud
empty
plowmen dig my earth
because the hour is getting late
there's no reason to get excited
she waits for me to
it was a cold and wet december day
birdland on fifty three
she says it's heartheart and soul
falling to the city in broad daylight
your dreams and on your way
stop shake out
they came my way
i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
we lie
in the freeze frame
to an ordinary guy
babyface babyface
babyface babyface
dont want to dig the dirt
i want to be with you
it doesnt matter to you
it wasnt what you wanted
you put your lips to her lips
her lips say one thing
we are trampled underfoot
some days you're quick but most days you're speedy
some days are better than others
some days you wake up in the army
taking you to another place
wey hey hey here she comes
i'll cross the world for green and gold
you pick me up to put me out on the street
it's been a long hot summer
waves that leave me out of reach
armour plated suits and ties daddy just wont say goodbye
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes
a vampire or a victim
stayand the night would be enough
if i could stay
just the bang
hello hello
stories for boys
stranger in a strange land
and i wish you were here
and i really dont mind
i'm not afraid
you gotta stand up straight
the colors that you bring
and you can never get enough
the water is warm 'til you discover how deep
and if the day wont last
i cant believe the news today
but i wont heed the battle call
torn apart
wipe the tears from your eyes
when fact is fiction and tv reality
with lovers and lies
and the people she meets you know
empty
if i wanna live i gotta
take me to the clouds above
take me to the clouds above
clouds above clouds above
until you're able to
you go in shock
more vague words
i have a brother
gave me the keys to his kingdom coming
for the first time
they say a secret is something you tell one other person
every artist is a cannibal every poet is a thief
lovewe shine like a burning star
look i gotta go yeah i'm running outta change
washed the feet
and a big mac bigger than you think
love come on down
dont know if i can wait that long
but they dont mentionthe pain
she's the refugee
but he dont know what for
and take her by her hand
yeah america
my love throws me like a rubber ball
aint love the sweetest thing
oh oh oh i'm losing you
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
walk on through
walk on by
home again
dont push me too far
under an atomic sky
or freely talk
i went with nothing
looking for one good man
told her i'd be back by noon
soon i will be loved
love song love song
sun shine sunshine on me
dont go to the door
who tore the curtain
cause i want youii want you
to the love of he who made
and you're gonna be there
i just wanna know
t t touching you
by my song
i'll let you go
you sing the same old song
she saw me coming 'round
i was thirsty
no more water water
there's a rain cloud in the desert sky
tryin to throw your arms around the world
you've been trying to throw your arms
through the eye of a needle
and a woman needs a man
woman i will
twilight lost my way
twilightdarkened day
twilightcant find my way
you say i'm not for you
two hearts beat as one
i dont get the answers right
the way i feel
maybe this is our last chance
i said there was no other
to see myself
i was talking
gotta get out of here
if you walkaway walkaway
if you walkaway walkaway
i will follow
and if god will send a sign
the high street never looked so low
well if god will send his angels
well if god will send his angels
last time you scratched at my door
sunlight sunlight fills my room
who'll catch the star when it falls
if i crawl if i come crawling home
with spanish eyes
and follows in the trail
slowly slowly love
sleep comes like a drug
hope faith her vanity
burned by the fire of love
up for air to swim against the tide
so wind blow through to my heart
up toward the sky
so wind go through to my heart
into the heart
singing song that makes me happy
muneno kodoo takameru monono yoni
but why should i try to resist
you never can win
in spite of a warning voice
'cause i've got you under my skin
and hardness
who's to say what it is will break you
i'm a man
i know that this is not goodbye
here she comes
la la la la la la la la la la la
took away my car
lady with the spinning head
she's living like it's the last night on earth
slipping away slip slide
the future is here at last
see through in the sunlight
like i'm holding onto nothing
a man likes to stare
see through in the sunlight
when our work has come assunder
through the light projected
like a song i have to sing
and you know i dont believe
and we fight amongst ourselves
nothing to lose nothing to gain
is there nothing left
leave this heart of clay
into the light
oh no no no
empty
and so fade away
give me two more chances
even better than the real thing
you're the real thing
you take me higher
only to be with you
felt the healing in her fingertips
then all the colors will bleed into one
but i still havent found what i'm looking for
for you a virgin bride
all roads lead to where you are
and they're all painted black
and i want it painted black
into the setting sun
she does it slowdancing
and i dont know a man
she took me slowdancing
and now i cant be sure of anything
where there is only love only love
oh sugar dont you cry
where it cant be found
baby baby babylight my way
when i was all messed up
baby baby baby
dont you forget
everlasting love
just when you needed me so
like the sun it shines
open up your eyes
feel the love you've got
as he cut across the land
healing healing
oh my love oh my love
with a fire
there's a fire in me
but there's a fire inside
when the band plays 'hail to the chief'
it aint me it aint me
it aint me it aint me
empty
but only in you i'm complete
you let me in
but the truth is not the same
wild thoughts escape
dont believe them when they tell me
can really change the world
'til it bleeds daylight
till there's nothing left for you anyway
i'll be up with the sun
then you discover
removes the stain
empty
grace finds beauty
what once was friction
i know i cant wait until
i see the road is rough
i'm going higher higher higher
yeah here she comes
you cant come down
hallelujahhere she comes
like drums in the night
i need your love i need your love
like honey on her tongue
i need your love
like a thought unchained
i need your love
burns bright and violet
heaven knows this is a heartland
death valley waters
empty
well you may be a lover but you aint no dancer
dressing like your sister
you dont know how you got here
they want you to be jesus
hold me thrill me kiss me kill me
to champagne and ice cream
come on come on come on come on be good to me
john i'm getting nowhere
said you were gonna get there someday
you're gonna get better
i fall down
i dont want to see
the knot is slipping
wont you wrap the night
love is drowning
around me
on the road to my regret
said love rescue me
i have cursed thy rod and staff
i said love
i said love rescue me
heyoh my love
heyseems so bright
love wont let you go
she pulls me under
see the sunlight in her soul
dumb bells on a diving board
no big deal we know the score
i took a picture of you miami
is there a time for keeping a distance
here she comes
here she comes
e le terre assetate
finds the way to the sea
and i cannot hope in love anymore
be realized
be realized
been around the back been around the front
lookin for the father of my two little girls
show me mother
we hear their heartbeat
you've been living underground
it's alright it's alright it's alright
she turns the tide
you were heldhow
we move through miracle days
nothing changes on new year's day
though torn in two
and gold is the reason for the wars we wage
voices on a cell phone
hot as a hair dryer in your face
new york new york
happily not like me and you
still i'm staying on to figure out
new york new york
like the tick tick tick of the eye of the clock
whether near to me or far
night and day
under the hide of me
night night night and day
dont grab
dont try and make sense
dont make a will
if you feel you're getting bored
have another grape
dont grind gimme some more
dont lie
dont hoax
empty
dont collar
dont steal
dont fantasize
dont connect
and kingdoms rise
you run like river on like a sea
it runs like a river runs to the sea
run to the sea
raining to your heart
will it make it easier on you now
dont care for it
we get to
you gave me nothing
love is a temple
you got to do what you should
empty
i was of a feeling it was out of control
out of control
i had the opinion it was out of control
to take you out of this place
in the maze of her imagination
teach me
it was a beautiful day
dont need it now
finding all the things
empty
you can take me in your hand
from the firefly a red orange glow
you plant a demon seed
like all the colors of a royal flush
as a man breathes into a saxophone
it's christmas
baby please come home
baby please come home
baby please come home
daddy wont let you weep
nails bitten down to the quick
daddy's a comfort
she is addicted to he
she is sublimation
it makes me come up like some heroine
some strange music drives me on
love will make you mine
green as the leaves
angel i wanna be home tonight
empty
and the fever when i'm beside her
at a traveling show
i was the bad guy who walked out
dirty day
and loveit wont last kissin time
these days days days run away like horses over the hill
you get confused but you know it
it's not a trick you cant learn it
be the song that you hear in your head
take these hands they're good for nothing
take the colours of my imagination
in the belly of a woman
but it feels like the rain
you can tear it up
with my fingers as you want them
in the belly of a woman
and it looks like the sun
if you can
these winds and tides
take my hand
you run and not grow weary
and the day it is breaking
baby dont cry
to love and only love
baby dont cry x3
going down excavation
cant sing but i've got soul
empty
in the sky
empty
having a laugh
flowered and return to the mississippi mud
empty
empty
empty
empty
empty
empty
and it turns its side from you
and your time with me
if i just share it in your heart
but i know that you will be back
drop me down but dont break me
empty
and you care
you're going go join to god
dont you leave
i know she wants more than a party
guitar hero
you know what i mean
i'm sick of all of this
where there was we'd tear them down
to throw a drowning man a line
now he's in the dirt
jesus can you take the time
but hope and history wont rhyme
the gates of that mansion
i wake up she'll come around
then will there be no time for shame
so you never knew love until you crossed the line of grace
please please please get up off your knees
your holy war
shards of glass splinters like rain
one man come in the name of love
one man washed on an empty beach
they could not take your pride
words that build or destroy
i see you stare into space
radio radio radio
and heart of stone
you're all that's left to hold on to
in red hill town
we stoop so low to reach so high
i'm hanging on
you walk away
as you jump to the street below
the heart of the city
love love love love love
i rejoice
empty
lying still
bitter taste in my mouth
ha la la la de day
she will
baby dont bite your lip
well i heard it before
salomeshake it shake it shake it salome
you're spilling me
things like that drive me
soon it will be filled
monday tuesday wednesday friday

'til the end of the world
and tear their hands as they tear the soil

wake up wake up dead man
and if your glass heart should crack
you're packing a suitcase for a place

chorus to fade
i'm goin down down down down to new orleans

barefoot and pregnant all the time
they see your face on every page
the sweetest gift i ever knew
a true companion i will always be
your eyes really see me
for granted not ever
eight seconds is a long long time when you're sitting on dynamite
that's the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo
backslidin barrel ridin rita ballou
aint a cowboy in texas would not ride a bull for you
every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
do you ever think of me
am i out of your lifei still remember our first night
do you ever think of me
i remember the night when i first met you
will always be enough
baby always shoot straight from your heartwere gonna make some mistakes
you're a sight for sore eyes
you're a sight for sore eyes
the street looks different tonight
something aint feeling right
now i see i was only free
she deals the cards awful good to me
red eye gravy and country ham
for you to really know
sparkle there's gotta be a sparkle
that someone is looking in your eyes
you pretend that nothing's changed at all
so i wont have to think about
tell me lover tell me how it's gonna be
that friend of mine wears an old work shirt
shes drawn to me like gravity
so many times through empty fears
i know i've tried
will you come back to me
spent his life doin time
if i should die before tomorrow
just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew
my faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right
if you can walk away the rest is easy
rain rain come on down
leavins cut me to the core
and i aint got much money at all
and i aint got no long limousine
and we'll all join hands and remember this moment
may the new year be blessed with good tidings
'til the season comes 'round again
the only thing that matters
i wish you knew
you said it all when you said goodbye
i've been tryin to get over you
just what's goin on
no one's to blame
and she's never home
you know where we stand
it's 605 on sunday mornin
well i was raised around bar rooms and friday night dances
and starin at the phone
i'm a waitin for your love
and keep the porch light on
a little boy went walkin
they're all alone
wont you help the children find
did you change the world
or play the game
we came so close to love back then
no twist and turn no crasha nd burn
our dancing done
we wont dance no more
we wont sway the band wont play
what would you do if i did what i should have done long ago
what if i say i love you
and dance real close to you
they're gonna drive my little heart insane
i think it's what they all call love
they'll look in each other's eyes
finds somebody new
and though i know it's wrong
your love has ended but mine still remains
oh nobody answers when i call your name
repeat chorusive never known such comfort
there's nothing you can say when love finds you
there's nothing you can say when love finds you
i'm so scared to death
whenever you come around
i knew this was wrong i didnt listen
baby just me and you
with you
oh darlin
i wanna be with you
or a love that just starts dyin
why do you and me have to be worlds apart
i'll do anything you ever ask me to
even if i never see your face again
it's really hard for me to say this
talkin trash about my best friend
you better think twice
jenny dreamed of trains
the very next mornin all that she could find
oh a song about a love that's gone astray
empty
honey just try to understand
let's do something
i'll face your daddy man to man
cause it could change in the blink of an eye
spread all over the bed
ill take the little things with you
me and you and the sunday paper
and live to tell it all
now i've got start livin the way i do
and give my heart back to you
little liza jane
so why dont you call me
how true love should be
they'll all look back and wonder how
were not expecting this
willing to trust
how much longer can we go on
dont you think i know
empty
it's not love that causes the pain
love never broke anyone's heart
you aint got to run that line on me
well you tell me you've known every thrill there is to know
empty
repeat chorus
but that old clock up on the wall
is there someone new
well i still love you
about tellin me we're through
and fight for you like a man
rollin on down the track
cheatins no companion for a real lady's man
ive found somebody that really does love me
im the luckiest guy in the world
on earth was troubled
we gathered round your grave to grieve
i put my heart right on the line
hey god i hope hes in your angel band
the angels have spoken still i wish i could watch you grow old
empty
up all night
'cause girl i get lonely too
somethin makes me turn around and stay
you said you've heard enough of all those little lies
when you said you were leavin
i'm done i'm through that's it
how it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
i'm sorry it took so long to finally realize
i'll think of you each step of the way
and i hope you have all you dream of
if i didnt have you in my world
the first time i looked in your eyes
if i had my way
there'd be no more fussing and fighting
just call and i'll come runnin
you're climbing mountains i'm on a hill
i know that feeling i cant take that chance
and we strolled the river walk in san antone
it's time to pack our bags and hit the highway
and silent night has been sung
if you walk out on me
just take my sympathy and go
now i'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds
i never knew lonely could tear you in two
find the strength to go oni still remember
why cant i admit it
she knows when to hold you
to make a man come home
the little boy inside of the man
empty
i would have never gone
oh there's nobody special in my life
'cause baby i've got nothin but time
'cause that's where i belong
i may be a okie son
i wont be back again
she tears my heart out when she starts to sing
how to do that oklahoma swing
a dnace like you've never seen
but i'd give up everything
with whiskey on your breath
before you say we're throughfirst she hid my glasses
i know i drive you crazy baby
empty
what i see in your eyes
with your pocket full of gold
some jealous guy's gonna show up
you've got the sweetest way
was being held in your embrace
pretty is as pretty does
before you go just let me say
just pretty words
there never seems to be time for me and you
magick speaks with tongues of fire fortune take my hand
take me where the falcon flies a symphony of steele
tragic in splendor in death you are free
the distance leave it behind there is no meaning when the promises are
that they're through there'll be no mourning the skies are alive a whisper of
death i bring to you seven meanings of our love there'll be no warning the

i hear the voices calling i see the king's return
a blazing presence rips you through and through
blinded by such beauty caught so unaware
the shrouded angels meet his gaze
no more tears or dying on his throne he's shining
anxious weary my mind wracked by fears unnatural i scan the horizon
once so great now lost and cold hungry spirits stalk these halls
the god of fire proclaims it so
no no more from me let actions speak awake
like blood and gasoline
another night on the highway blood and dust in the air
with the blood of the salnts
light years flash before my eyes
dare forces conspire against thee
face to face with fear and death and hate
cry another day
one nation one kingdom one child survives
i'll meet you again through the eyes of our son
fatal beauty innocence
chains of fire the night's alive the dark is burning
oaths made in violence punishment in turn
i'm fallin i'm callin
and the dead will taste a deeper treasure than youth or life
sons of cain agonize bring forth then die
your sorrows will multiply and you shall share my fall
bask in the light of my fall
chained to earth my kongdom comes first
in whiteness descending the soul steals a star
she moves so fine
she's seventeen and tight ah yeah look outmakin love under the summer night
of the secrets of your soul
then you hypnotize tantalize and
i feel love babe
get it inside
stand up walk away
be nobody's fool
i cant stand it i cant stand it no
eyes blindly starting skyward gaze fixed on eternity
crying no one to notice
strawgirl is there a lover who's searching
a glimpse of my power my armor is flame gold i sever the sky
above so it shall be below we invoke death with one final prayer
we are descendants of the ancient ones the race beyond the wanderers of night
she walks in starlight
oh take me home
she'll have you on your knees
the evil in her eyesshe's always out there
oooh my love is real
sentenced to die by the sorceress her evil eye
with holy fire the golden pyre death
music and lyrics by david defeis
watch me take her as you die
empty
none can ever tear asunder
when the light of life is over calling from the other side
you must never look back
purgatory awaits
i dont know what you've been told
the godheadi am the master of this world of ours you are a thorn in my side i
humanity through blood and fire promises and lies through blood and fire
look into the eyes of death
through the ring of fire
empty
bright are the signs of the godhead
empty
elders elektra
onward through darkness
empty
in the darkness of our years
heed the voice that is calling
open up your heart
get it on on on
and it makes you wild
cirl show your love'
'cause i feel that's when i'm with you it's alright
it's so lonely so lonely
i'm gonna see you burn
on this mountainside
fell to the fround
cold rain runs from the sky
the dark host marches eternal it's the last great war
a circle of fire loud we sing
bold enough to stay your prayers
unholy water you'rebringing me down to live is to die
unholy water her breasts were full her hair was wet
victory is mine underneath a savage sky
victory in mine noble tears and kingly pride
sworn by the light of the moon
we are coming
and jealous lies
a victim of illusion
music de feis lyrics de feis
your father's eyes watch from afar
i see the scars and the pain
i see the scars of the pain
i cant bear the thought of your leaving
oh yeah
i'll have to accept that you're not coming back
gone and forgotten iike a photograph
who lights the candle
nobody will believe you
i taste your shame
with the darker signs of love
do you know what that means
in the gardens of my soul
child lose control
music de feis lyrics de feis
shattered lightning from the skies
when you blindly lead the blind
ooh what to do now when i rip the smile right from your face rip
i wake up screaming
once we had beauty our sun blazcd in passion
lost clouds of reason false hope burning season
repeat verse one
yeah i'm wild and i'm mean
i'm on fire
i will be gone gone
empty
hunger and hate spirit of impurity ravaged by fire stripped and enslaved torn
to these trees die by my hand die in my heart flung from the heights forever
little child
one child cries to eternity's sky
stone love eye to eye
jet black under the burning sky
empty
empty
no god no light no power this night
your kingdom of lies immortal youth dies
i will be there i will not cower
lost season in shame your people in chains
none can withstand hatred un masked
peter you will deny me judas you will betray
but remember this forever i reign forever i reign
just remember with whom you dine
empty
with fists of fire we can melt the ice
roar roar roar i cant hear ya
in rags of execution freedom is consumned
holier in silence paler than the dead
chorus 2x bare your breast and save this child of pain
wish for you or is blind obedience a proof of your faith take from the
i'll never let you go
you better believe me
winners and losers
keep running till the day we die
we're headed for a life of crime
and the mist still hangs around the gallows
you've hungered far too long
it doesnt have to be this way
i will defy no respite from the challenge of war
crown of glory unscarred
i see with new sight the infinite night
glory unscarred
it's your turn to cry cry babe
wastin your life away
couldnt see
a thousand year darkness
of the way it might have been
the side of the road
open to the wind and rain
be the bastards who die for a love for beauty not gold holy tomorrow see you
answer to none never show mercy i'll never give in to fear force and might
with nothing but a memory to call my own
oh babe dont go dont go
every night i cry for you
the time has come for us to aim for the heart
when will we ever learn learn how to love
dust from the burning fire and water dust from the burning sons and
this is the land of my beginning
is there a life among these ruins
lost like a child she leaves me
a kiss on the wind she leaves me
dark wings of hatred rule the world
beyond the shadows of the skies waiting for the light it's
gather cunning strenght and speed
you better think again
my teeth can rip in two
empty
the victory now here is mine
to the edge of the world
brazen gift of ancient madness
they'll be no tomorrow when the end has begun
flames of the black star burn in hades
shattered dreams a moments betrayal forever will i roam
forever will i roam
what would you say if i told you that
mother i am wronged earth mother i am wronged what comes on the wind
storm of blood
vengeance wrought by the gods forged in sin forged by me
black cloud of slavery oh silver sided death
great sword of flame in the sky great sword of flame
we are the guardians of the flame
we come with swords of fire
sleep well my children
no not tonight
a thousand lips to taste
let me hold communion with your flesh
love and death
you're a servant of the damned
as i turn to go
this time it's over
arms intwined with lies
music de feis lyrics de feis
empty
the face that love could not
hand to hand face to face
we want to take you to the time of your life
endyamon rising like a tower fortune's torch revives slicing every rule
waiting in the skies murder and fire and pain is the sign swollen with power
and i know the mind is a tower the body sublime the soul is the power
that's come and gone
i know the nights are longer now
can we keep our love alive
dignity a conscious thought
blend mind and matter
a voice of reason crying in the dark
never never surrender
ooh do you know i'll never let you go
it burns for you
oh dont you wait go the hours late
ooh you wont need no other
ride on the wings of the night
we ride
my soul is free now to shadow forth and rise
the gods are mighty children of the brave
the white ship is summoning ride the winds of the sky
i have walked the halls of light
on the banquet of my flesh
and what's the lie there in your eyes no mercy
cursed and tried i am the man in god
empty
fire on the wind fire in the sky
titan fists and gods collide
come forth arise twelve golden dreams forge the prize
new heaven and earth set in a golden age forevermore
you're the deliverer king unchained
and your pouting hungry eyes
keep licking your lips
ohh sweet babe we're gonna make love all
the blue you once knew
pow stairways scared
red rainfalls poison the sky
empty
my speculations
acknowledge my statement
the clock is ticking
standard basic design
transmit full time
a new life line
this is bio tv
high pressure inside me
you've lost all your energy
checking my mind it's a brain scan
perceptive entity
disturbing my frequency
the chaosmngers
hit with simplicity
nothing bad happens
see what we passed by
shameaint no glory
frenzy reviving the room
disturbed by darkened thoughts
deep down inside i know they're coming for me
as the end draws near
and soon the whole thing will fall
than a runaway star
my mind's mutation
why do i regret
astral rotation
dont need more you neitherchorus
nothing more to find
last call time to go
what a waste
no escape here i lie
all i need is a new world
putting myself in this project
it really exists
powerful magnets
no way out of it
i'm falling all apart
tell me now
it wont change my plans
a new world waits to be seen
from the ground to out of sight
upset coz there's no way to return
changing to sub rat humans
dressed with a skin tight pressure suit
ultraviolet rays in the galaxy core
though i am weak
i feel so old
i am alone
no more saving glory
where's the second chance
b blown up in flames
forward speed
silent clue
all under one command
mutating whole numbers
too soon for us
the men in the black forces
and the books are burning hard
down down down down
the blackguards control
the ugly underside of the nuclear energy
the china syndrome will die much later than you
lock the doors we're engineers
concrete from far below
a rainbow appears
denying the vibrations we're made ofsomber drama
is what they must do
is this a modern legend
digital neurons
phobos moon
body count rising
countless homicide
empty
until the final day comes
soon will start
then new problems arise
reach out of trance
aint got the same conception
no one can reach him
shell of sub matter
quantum super state
surgical scourge on you
you see the nurse with blood on her clothes
struggling through this
way underground
whispering voice
empty
empty
the eclipse
omniscient fogup on the edge
identity has been commanded
during the night my soul is hearing
is it the same message
and they're going nowhere
i'd rather think
my father remembers
lost machine never fails
down to my own son
she will make it to the islandin the suni will follow in her shadow
wailing wolves at the gate
yes everything's gonna work out
time and again
cutting waves at full speed
gliding in the sky
he is anark
death is your last breath
eyes closed
octogonal seams so much clearer
keep your myths from the embryos
that i am in their league
i must be close
half wits spouting drool
smashed up cars fucked up traffic
caution all alert is on
you stand mute today
no one's gonna say that's a crime
a lifetime in my handi set the counter
i'm getting closer
the tornado is right behind
the deadlist of all thunderheads
and trying to outwit this monster
do it quickly if you see it
lit up like a spark
we've never seenthat before
came from the sky
their convictions
who's the dog
it's too late
empty
dummy says
my souvenirs thrown on the floor
a sorry sightanother fight
it's getting worse most everyday
tunnel seems so long
refracting cells and prismed self
empty
he used to be me
an aura comes towards me
i wont last forever
dark neutrino
empty
every night every morning
i know i know the same old daily grind
throughout time
immobile centre
victims helpless
people from the outside
no need to worry you're in the zone
he knows my name i know his game
you are not safe here in this place
happy in your world and you cant imagine
now focus on my voice will you do it for me
diadem bellatrix mirach izar
so this is the end i'm leaving now farewell my friends
even if they make shit
making a spider web over the atmosphere
how can i destroy the enemy
people are gonna progress
you're gonna pay for this
deep in the woods under the stars
i tell myself everything's fine
what is it he wants me to see
he says there's no more fishing in the lake
you'll hurt my lung
to go on and destroy those cells
as i talk to me listening the voice
hiding hearing inside
as directed reality
no more control
you better shake up your mind
the vote is done another one
empty
spirit of zoth
zoth is free
what do i care have no regret
in front of me
has left a burning ground
winding walk
sound sound
limbo inc amnesiai did i didnt know
empty
to higher ground
ride on
for your many ill gotten gainsand the moonbeam shines on the chrome
were you ever within your world
useless memory transistor

i'm hearing cries in the night
i lose the dream and i go crazy
i'm your doctor
i got tombstones in my eyes
it's called easy living
since you've taken your place in my heartwaiting watching wishing my whole life away
money makes me crazy
seduction of silver and lawless greed
i want a fistful fistful of diamonds
one breath away from heavens light
high in the wind forever free
i'm politcally incorrect

from the throne of your desperation
empty

the crimson idol of a million
long live long live
jonathon to all
but the dream became my nightmare and no one could hear me scream
the crimson idol of a million
and she beckoned me to glimpse my future she'd seen
but the higher he'd fly then the further he'd fall
blackie lawless
cause the children have been
the madness steals the light
the headless children
born again to die the agonies begin
standing on sanities too fragile edge
see in their eyes
and for all of them they're just memories in the wind
and die in vain
ooh being crazy in paradise is easy
and i was there dying in the shadow of him
oh i got the same old reruns horror movies in my head
empty
this is our time we've made our mark

now i cant feel your touch
'cause i'm drifting further from you everyday
oh love

i'll be holding on till then
she is your marrow
but when we wake
that way there's no way
only in dreams
didnt stop until she hit new orleans
where i found that to be smooth
only hope to see
her wedding ring or anything
there's more that i could take
it's in the photograph
if you blew it dont reject it
she would never go with me
but never thought it was a crime
but married in my mind's no good
let me know the truth

glorious wastings of my time

my brain

empty
cause we shared the laughter and the pain
and that's what i've got to face
there's nothing left here to remind me
and that's the chance i've got to take
empty
cause we shared the laughter and the pain
and that's what i've got to face
there's nothing left here to remind me
and that's the chance i've got to take
i kissed her and she kissed me
my life is gonna be bee yoo tee ful
if this is just the beginnin
it's not the way i choose to live
is it all
those times i dont believe it's right i know it know it
with a simple telephone call
or nothing at all
cuz i want it all
with a simple telephone call
empty
and said that i cant hold on
oh what are you thinking of
until you bring back your devotion
i guess i'm holding on to my faith
i couldnt see it
and all the others had me thinking
for a break that would make it okay
in the arms of an angel
there's vultures and thieves at your back
from this dark cold hotel room
the only thing that means everything to me
it's written on angels wings
angels wings like letters in the sky
on angels winds an angelical formation
like an endless summer
yeah we'll find our star
far away from where we are
is there in our reach
this feeling's too strong
that's why i can yeah ye eh yeah
this feeling's too strong
i'll put my hand upon my heart
good things good things
i love how they tease me
nice smile so wild
that makes me want to sweat feel them wet
kuala lumpur and miami got some bad girls
each city day or night
each city day or night
when i lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head
was a stop too late
and put my mind at ease for sure
and put my mind at ease for sure
fear of rejection kept my love inside
tried to fight it but it cannot be denied
what could have been
out my league
so damn my foolish pride
empty
i'll be no worse off
it doesnt matter if it turns out bad
baby that's ok
it doesnt matter if it turns out bad
at least we have a moment before
but there's no sign you hear the lightning baby
i'll say it in a love song
shane westlife
you are my very first thought in the morning
i've crushed on you so long
but you never seem to see
but i know you never will
no i'll be there for you
empty
when it allgets too much
i dont know the things that you're going through put your head on my shoulder
a guiding light
on the wings of love
and when the dreams i have been swept away
higher still with every touch
on the wings of love
baby open your heart
baby i swear that i'll be true
open your heart
and i'll be here forever
let me show you how much i care
you've always been a part of me
on the way when
thank you in advance
i've got these pictures in my head
on the way when
it's the way she fills my senses
every time we touch
and every little piece of her is right
the feeling is too much
so here we stand
do i say goodbye
this memory
queen of my heart
mark all
repeat chorus twice
oh yeah
shut me out of your life
when everything is wrong
so dont hide
i will pull you in
empty
pretty girls are everywhere
wonder how i got along
we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
when all the birds are singing in the sky
but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time
i see this girl walk by
of how we were
where did you go
of how it was
i see shadows
took some time to heal
empty
she'll tear my heart away
believed that she was gone
hide every trace of sadness
if only you could see the tears in the world you left behind
empty
if it could only be the same
why did you leave me
in my heart you were the only
girl it's with you i belong
you must believe me
somebody wants you
dont you turn out the light
never thought that i'd so inspired
so if you need me
and made me understand that
but i dont really care cause
something right
didnt know it would leave this scar
but now i see
learning what it takes to turn this page
tellin me to move on
like how system overload
empty
and hit you with the real thing
electro paradise
like who sure you wanna rock the boat
and hit you with the real thing
empty
well i would send them but
im just to far
it's like i just stepped outside
let me go home
when they've found the one and only
so how does it feel
how does it feel
nothing in the world could make it right
no more wasting time in asking other people
and you're lying next to me
i'm stronger than that
and this space in my heart
i'm stronger than that
now it's slowly tearing me apart
you taught me how to break a heart
i fell from all we had
i once knew
cause i know i'll never breathe your love again
without the feeling
i cry hopelessly
cause i know i'll never breathe your love again
you've gotta stand up for something
to do the best i could
maybe i was crazy
chorus shane
empty
where no one could ever reach these shores
without you
wont let me be apart from you
i cant dream
and this lonelyness that's in my heart
and i want to tell you so
no more
cause i dont wanna fight
least that's the way it seems tonight
girl to live without in my life
let's not leave ourselves with no way out
you can take the future even if you fail
i believe in angels
i believe in angels
you can take the future even if you fail
and my destination destination makes it worth the while
when i know the time is right for me
when i know the time is right for me right for me
es algo increible
sin saber que entraste en mi interior
todo cambio
reaching for my heart
you open up my heart
everytime i breathe i feel brand new
as i lay my love on you
show me all your love and walk right through
the morning fog may chill the air i dont care
why i did those things to you
i'll be true
baby how i wish you could forgive me
cause i need you
i swear to you
empty
yes baby i need you
the way that it should be
i will care for you and love you girl
my feelings are so true
my feelings are so true
so put your best dress on
empty
empty
so put your best dress on
tonight i'm gonna make it up to you
turnaround every now and then i get a little bit terrified and then i see the look in your eyes
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time
once upon a time there was light in my life
and i need you now tonight
i really need you tonight
a total eclipse of the heart
through any kind of weather
when you fall down down
baby you thought it was forever
when you fall down down
try again ooh yeah
stumble and fall
they say
i want you to know
yes i'm ready to be all you're dreaming of
empty
yes i'm ready to be all you're dreaming of
and i found you
you give me a reason
in things that i already knew
empty
to put my faith in you
empty
it's hard
to put my faith in you
held me close
believe that you're mine
this love is unbreakable
i've been blessed by the power of love
each time you whisper my name
and each time i look in your eyes
empty
and i find myself longing to hold you close
and i'll promise i'll be right by your side
'cause i know that if you would be here
i'll give you everything that money cant buy
empty
i'm gonna try for an uptown girl
just because
and then i'll win
as long as anyone with hot blood can
my uptown girl
you and i weve been at it so long
cause it's us against the world
empty
and you make it better
cause it's us against the world tonight
know that we are standing tall
us against the world
you turn the picture on to me and i'll turn over
as i walked down the alleyway it was a sunday
but i was so embarressed when i missed your party
a whisper in a choir stall
time goes by
and all this time
i'll never walk out on you
and now i cant get enough
no matter what you're going through
swearing he's forever true
underneath one sun
all of the fear and all of the lies are
cause sometimes it's necessary
and all of the lies are the lies
if you just believe
we were two we were two
and open up to the ways you made me feel alive
shadows fade into the light
for all my life i am yours
baby before it's too late
who had love that's now departed
i walk in shadows searching for light
empty
i'll be searching everywhere
some kind of peace of mind
a girl like you gets what she wants
but time is running out so damn my foolish pride
baby that's okay
here on the outside lookin in
girl i'm leaving you tomorrow
would anybody put chains on me
i wanna be high so high
easy like sunday morning yeah
well there's one that makes sense
all the world's a waiting room
empty
and i say
empty
there will be good times waiting for you
empty
heaven knows
swearing to surrender ever more
heaven knows
i get lost in you
that in my heart
did you feel it inside
empty
empty
no hesitation only open doors
all bryan lead vocals
and see the story of love
empty
let's make it last forever
empty
this is the story
empty
empty
empty
your game of love was all rained out
i took a chance
what i want is what i've got
what i want is what i've got
and i looked it up
and i looked it up
what i want is what i've got
what i want is what i've got
cuando ries ya no hay marcha atrs
sin saber llegaste a mi interior
te entregaste a m sin condicin
por fn ests en mi interior
hoy un hombre nuevo soy
i wonder why you look at me like that
you're the only girl that i need
what's behind
i'm gonna take this night
cause you're more beautiful than i have ever seen
person that i used to find you're my perfect girl
i look at you and your body of gold
coming down on you from the heavens above
'cos i need somebody to hold me
hey love
that makes me wanna feel this
does it really matter why i love you
it's everything everything you say
so everybody everybody knows
even people in love said i'm a fool
there's no searching anymore
empty
and everybody knows this love's for sure
it's the one thing that's for sure
fill my heart with song
places you never knew it could be
a simple line can make you laugh or cry
empty
i'm flying without wings
one thing that makes it all complete
some in their solitary lives
cos who's to know which one you let go
and it's like flying without wings
empty
i should've read the signs
how was i to know
to show you how much i care
turn back the time
deep inside my heart you'll leave me never
when i'm in need
even if you took my heart
there is no one in this world
empty
deep inside my heart you leave me never
deep inside my heart you leave me never
so how can i break this wall around you
affection i have never felt before
in the morning light
for a telephone call
but still she leaves you wondering
and times you really want to cry
and wake up alone
have you ever tried to find the words
you'd give anything
to look into their eyes
empty
even though you're near me
though you want to
sorrow such a heavy load
for the first time
but it's not you
who can heal me
like a movie that you've seen
if you feel as though
you'd probably want some more
i'll be yours
two sweethearts and the summer wind
who ever told you i was letting go
empty
some people say
there are something's in this life wont be denied
i wanna know
just you and i
empty
sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye
cos i never wanna see you sad
i'm never gonna say goodbye
swear it all over again and i
i swore to share your joy and your pain
just look around
i swore to you my love would remain
even the day must give way to the night
empty
the more i know of you is the more i know i love you
cos i never wanna see you cry
never gonna treat you bad
and i swear it all over again
til the walls shook and the windows break
but we can withdraw
so talk me down
i wanna thank you very much
it's on my lips
empty
i was sleeping and yesterday
comes second to your touch
imagine my surprise
yeah yeah
now everything i do
cant you see it got me oh yeah
good god
then you came
i said that's life that's life and as funny as it may seem
and if i didnt think it was worth one single try
my my
never satisfied
i know that you've got your doubts yeah
oh listen learn blame it all on me
that's what it's all it's all about
that's what it's all about
that's what it's all it's all about
i know that you've got your doubts yeah
ooh and maybe i made some mistakes before
that's what it's all it's all about
working it out yeah
chorus to fade
it's in a place i've never been that feels like home
empty
it's in the place and everything that feels like home
and now i'm glad i didnt know
the way it all would end the way it all would go
only half 'til you have to fall
you showed me the difference
in scattered pieces when you found me
see im not into buying your affections
been there done that before
i never treat you bad
with a diamond on a necklace
i love you i love you
an endless aching need
that never learns to live
when the world is cold
it touches my foolish heart
that's how it feels
it's only 'cause it shows
and you take it all in your stride
to be loved by you
i wanna grow old with you
it makes our risk right all along
things can come and go i know but
i wanna grow old with you
shane echo
mark echo
empty
shane echo
i'd sing you a morning golden and new
the courage to show to let you know
why dont this feeling just fade away
what my life would be holding you close to me
time passed away
empty
you speak to my heart speak to my heart
will i ever see you smiling back at me oh yeah
empty
will i ever see you smiling back at me
would she ever doubt the way i feel
gonna be enough to last
to tell her how i feel
if tomorrow never comes
but if your heart's not in it for real
but baby sometimes
it's not fair to lead me on
but if your heart's not in it for real
you and i must make a pact
woh oh yeah
well that's all i'm after
i'll build my world of dreams around you
i'll be there
i'll be there
i'll be there
empty
never thought i'd live to see the day
i'll never forget you
but when he heard the sound

and ill gently kiss your lips
oh im already there

to light up my life
to light up my life
just for showing me the truth
have we broken in two
i wish i could stop you
and hold you once more even though
under the sea
a lark and a dove
empty
right from the start you were there

empty
the stars shine so bright

better take a look inside
empty
it's not a fantasy
if i ever break your heart if i ever do you wrong
some people let it show some people wait too long
dont let it play on your mind
between your heart and mine
the first step is to realize
anything anything
acting like i dont care
it's a love crime to me
to be here without me by your side
why you act so surprised
empty
but the best you can do for yourself
when your words could disguise what you're going through
cos baby i need you
empty

one more time
i realise without you
maybe we could give it
in this heart of mine
empty
for the lord will take it all
and the lord will take it all on judgement dayhear me crying out for love
only my soul
heading out for trouble
when they're living in the bright lights of the big city
man on the run will always take chances for fun
then you came along
i'm gonna tell you holy roller
you could be wrong
but i got the queen of hearts
you gave me the answer
to reach for the sun
roll me over make be bleed
can you feel it baby
it's driving me out of my mind
when everything i touch
i've had enough
my precious timeoh so tired
restless heart
he is a child of babylon
i sail my ship through muddy waters
i'm prepared to meet my maker
nowhere to hide got no place to run
make it loud and proud
you got the power
just let the music take you highernow are you ready to rock
cos' now the boys are back in town
to take a man like me
i'll leave it up to you
if you want it come an get it
i dont go looking for trouble
i never needed love so badly beforehear me singing come on come on
come on and get some sweet rock 'n roll
but a man starts weeping
but it's raining in my heart
i keep coming back for more
when you're crying in the rain
when you're crying in the rain
this cant be love anymore
bitter tears falling like rain
bitter tears falling like rain
i dont need a doctor i dont need a priest
you can dance dance
c'mon bring on the dancing girls
bring on the dancing girls
she took me half the way there
got a good reason
before i turn and walk away
make no mistake it could be your last
and they all keep coming back to you time and again i sing your song
as i stand at the crossroad
but i still pray for tomorrow
all my hopes my dreams
with my cross of indecision
a case of hit 'n run
i've only just begun
treat me baby like i
dont mess with me
as you surrender
dont turn away
a lonely portrait
so dont turn away
dont turn away from what you
so dont turn away
a hard loving woman like you just makes a hard loving man
across the county line
it'll go on forever
free flight free flight free flight
free flight come tomorrow dawn you'll find me gone
i stand on the outside
but a loser in love
looking in
i stand on the outside
you treat me like a dog
but if i'm good and give you love
with all your high class schooling
there aint no one to beat you
pretty little crazy white girl
empty
it wont happen anymore
packed with broken dreams
wont you take me back again but baby all the same
i beggin you please uh
i go looking for a lover where the bad girls go
i love to hear'em moan and cry
i wanna kiss a little better so i get stoned
on everything i've done
an the deeper the love
so when the sun goes down
when the sun goes down
an the stronger the love
i wondered what your name was
remember all my love songs
'cos the time is right for love
when it's more than i can bear
to drift upon the waters
till the day i die
to show i'm down
give me love
did everything you wanted me to
thinking how it used to be
so wont you tell me
so tell me baby
believing it would last forever
on the run again
but i fooled around plenty enough
trouble always coming my way
with a heart stone cold as ice
dont bother me
i'm down on love
to drown in misery
dont bother me
if you dont feel it you can never understand
i've been the black sheep of the family all along
he said what you gonna do
'cos i've been branded with the devil mark of cain
remember this on your journey home
it's just the simple things in life
'cos i got a juke box heart
wine women an song
aint nothing you can do you can tell me it's wrong
wine women an song
holding on trying to walk the line with sweet temptation running close behind
empty
when the angel on my shoulder
with a girl like you
and drowned my dreams in the wishing welli've got woman trouble blues
thro' the lying things she said
hey girl if you want me
but would i lie to you
i promise i wont do anything
i've spent the whole night searching
empty
i know those page three girls
tell the truth
i'm gonna do it to you
just you 'n me
an your eyes see lightning strike
'cos i got what you need
the devil has got your number
dont try to hold on to what you got
and your sweet embrace
that's all i need
written in tears
i'm coming home to you baby
bring it baby baby that's all i want
i've seen that look
you're gonna break my heart again
you told me once
yes you are you talk of how our love
that's for surebreak my heart
to pay the price
i want you so bad
everything i need
the girls dont like it
i'm gonna make you
everything i need
the ashtray says
in the key of c
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
the ashtray says
what you once were isnt what you want to be any more
the fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering
i know i would die if i could come back new
at least that's what you said
and if you dont let it show
without your blue eyed soul
i just cant find the time
'cause that's the way it should be
the way i want it to read
candyfloss and shes a safecracker
she's in the way
i'm the boy that looks excited
you get so low
our prayers will never be answered again
you get so high
as god's love
it's all beginning
your prayers will never be answered again
and the dealer keeps on joking as he takes my last token
and i've been puking
i move so slow a steady crushing hand
i will always die
jets hum
because i've found the way those engines sound
with songs about things we all know
and after awhile
with a light shining off the lake
and his young one is gonna take it all away
the clouds will blow away
either way
oh what have i been missing
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing it's gonna
it's gonna
oh i know it's right
some songs we cant afford to play
and i've always told lies for love
i've got reservations
i've been sleepin alone out on my own
you been takin it hard i know it's hard
sunlight angles on
of the ice melting in my glass
somewhere there's a war
beast with many souls
with a heavy lid
and a day off
and my face gets sick
before there were water skies
oh i believe it's all because
a sleepy kisser
just shouldnt ever have to be this hard
but they do
and you're too busy thinking to stop
we should've been in love
the treetops nod
when the sun comes back
the drunks were ricocheting
i survived
on that hill where we used to climb
someday soon
it sounds like someone else's song from along time ago
his black shirt cries
his black shirt cries
it's just a dream he keeps having
and i leave it on the shore i'd leave it for somebody
i'll tell you mine before you go
that's not the issue
you were the lonely one
you you're the lonely one
inlitterati lumen fidei
oh in so many ways
a ghost is born
so long
i couldnt be any closer to you now
you cold hot blood ran away from me
i know i'll make it back
they make me think
via chicago
what am i going to do
you're just right
honey i think you're just right
you're gonna lose
if you want to want to be alive okay
i say that were just friends
i try to make amends
and you want other people to sing along
when there's a light what light
just remember what was yours is everyone's from now on
there's a light what light
you been tryin hard not to think i'm a liar
what's the world got in store
stuffed nervous with gold
and i blend with kings
can you be
why would you wanna live in this world x2
fill up your mind with all it can know
the turntable sizzles
open your arms as far as they will go
what would we be without wishful thinking
why is there no breeze
i have no idea how this happens
our faces stitched and sewing
which lies i have been hiding
i wanna know why
and no it's not ok
i caught the flu and away i flew
you cant hear it anywhere you go
the greatest lost track of all time
you might be lonely too
where you sit when i'm not home
it's never been still and its will
for yourself
your spine starts to shine
when you're back in your old neighborhood
do you still love rock and roll
there's a fortune inside your head
so misunderstood x4
a world record players on a tour of japan charlie fixin his van with the
hidin from the snow
man i've been listen to creedence clearwater rivival
and the sun gets passed from tree to tree
silently and back to me
breathe now think sweet things
and be sure darlin
on and on and on we'll be together yeah
please dont cry we're designed to die
deep inside
you're gonna make me spill my beer
should've been the driver could've been the one
if you wanna call me darling that's just fine that's just fine
but if my mind starts wandering it wont be gone long
aw honey help me pick up the change
and i still love you
oh there's nothing i can do
it doesnt mean that i dont care
and i really want to see you tonight
in my backyard to show me love
i'm not going outside
i am hoping for a re arrival of my health
every song's a comeback
calling a pot kettle black
me the bill
dont forget the flowers someday i know i will
strung down your cheeks
tuned to chords
my mind is filled with silvery stars
there is something wrong with me
i was chewin gum for something to do
i looked like someone i used to know
what you want from me
the taxicabs were driving me around
they were translating poorly
even though i know you're not coming home
i hate it here
i hate it here
i used to go see on the landing in the summer
playing kiss covers beautiful and stoned
playing kiss covers beautiful and stoned
so precise and towering
come with me
even if i make it through
one more worried whisper right in my ear
fill your heart with smoke
a fixed bayonet through the great southwest to forget her
the type of sound that floats around and then back down
die alone
i assassin down the avenue
what was i thinking when i said good night
i am trying to break your heart
to do what you always wanted to do
bye bye bye
i dont think you even understand
oh hold on
turn on you
i will
i'm gonna turn on you turn on you turn on you
like a bird in a cage
on a big wheeled wagon
i'm always in love
i'm the man who loves you
all i can see is black and white
just hold your hand and you'd understand
i'll do what i can
impossible germany
now i know
some trees will bend
and barking dogs
last week i was thinking about traveling by land
she begged and she pleaded 'till dad finally listened
girls with guitars
she wasnt any debutante
now there's an old chevy van just sitting in the driveway
there ought to be a song about
a girl in the front and his friends in the back
and look at it now its just like newand my my what a beautiful machine
he bought his folks a cadillac too
things are tough all over
up on easy street
this hat in my hand
up on easy street
a little bit of love
i'm a girl about the town and i'm walking on air
i can still feel all of that love from here
i was raised on love's foundation
whatever you see aint never gonna stay the same
just like your love i see it every day
it's burning through to my soul
i feel my temperature rising
with burning love
like the sweet song of a choir
we have could last forever
cant nobody love you like i do
something in the still night air is telling me now is the time to try
and blow it sky high sky high
chain chain reaction
you would think my love was somethingood
on a summer afternoon
first time i saw you
come some rainy day
repeat chorus
come on everybody lets turn his praises out
but when i see his face that's when i will know
dont look back into his eyes
youre far enough to let your feelings show
with that law you're layin down
under your lock and your key
yeah it might come back to haunt you
empty
please dont forget me father sun father sun
old tin roof leaves in the gutter
it doesnt seem like it was all that long ago
it can take you back to the place but it cant take you back in time
things just couldnt be the same
and if i stay here with you boy
billy was a small town loner
a few movies and a few months latter
but he loves her and he just kept going overboard
the babies grew up and moved away
when it's strong enough to keep a man goinp repeat chorus
you need a job so you can make some money
empty
be sure you got a place to run for cover
before the money and the lawyers and the lies and the chains
i took for granted that just because of who i was
sometimes i feel like i'm on stage
you really had a hold on me
wont you tell me why
wont you tell me why
today i feel different
but ya threw it away
well honey you got some nerve
who cant see the truth at all
some silver lining to be found
in spite of everything i know
i'm just the kind of fool love makes
that you still aint built
you'll find your way over this
and make them sit up and beg
i'm just a good hearted down home country girl
and you sure dont wanna mess with me
i'll show you somethin that
repeat chorus
when my body's weak i will not fall
it cannot be denied
life's too short aint got the time
so long daddy i'm outta here
aint that tuff enuff
lay in a pile of buring money that i've earned
before god and family we made the perfect start
we promised love would last
i wanna walk
i wanna sail the ship
i wanna be the first to say
dont wanna change my mind
rich poor dont matter we're all the same
spread it all around
empty
and i will turn and look inside me
we have tears to heal the pain
your love started talkin
open the door
then love started talkin
only memories keeping me alive
nobody stands in your place
couldnt go on and last forever
i can live this life without you
when i feel so weak
i cant do this anymore
like a memory
why now
just to look in your eyes and hold you again
waiting for you for an eternity
it's in the way you love
pressed on my soul
bury the past
know that at the right time
just listen to you
love is gonna come around
send them away
true love is a funny thing
but without your lovei'm going nowhere
oh baby you got my head spinning 'round
he rocks he kicks
he'll take you 'cross the floor
in my struggle to believe
it cut me to the bone
heaven help me
if i ever lose your love
i'm wonderin when this all will end
so i put my faith in you
and a gambler
hot hot blazes
didnt it feel good
i tried to live without you
love the life i'm livin though
lookin out for you and irepeat chorus
oh my lord i cant wait to meet you
and the life we had might have been
it's good to know some things remain
and turned to go
'cause i aint wearin
i gotta take a little time
i cant stop now i've traveled so far
it looks like love has finally found me
i found no comfort in placing blame
i will be brave
repeat chorus
a taxi's waiting in the driveway for you
but i'm not up to being strong
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh it all comes down to love
oh oh oh oh oh oh it all comes down to love
empty
they've been called on down the line
and love was just a lesson
it is what it is
it's never quite enough
so bite your lip
i know what your future holds
to keep the magic goin strong
repeat chorus
empty
i dont want to live in the past
and that's when mary started crying
and john said let's get ready
we need a new direction
i walk a tightrope i follow my heart
i've got dreams that i'm chasing and places to go
repeat chorus
i didnt come here believinbr i would ever be away from you
and the moment when we lay back down
of bread i had to eat
every heart would understand
dont you think it's time
you might tell me to mind my business
if i had a love like that
but i see you flirtin
there's no king when love is the thing
no matter who you are
if it's meant to be
cuz every time you walk in the room
my wounds are healed and my spirit is clear
every time i hear my heart speak
how could i be so blind
he was my strongest weakness
end of the night and my money's spent
i've seen the time when you could not stop the rain
my life without you
i shivered once you broke into my soul
you're burninme alive
road blocks red lights
hey nothins gonna break me down
oh oh
heaven help me i cant say no
the only trouble is
its gonna be all right be all right
out of all the flags i've flown
when all of your feelings just seem to collide
i love thee
then you realize that you're calling out loud
when you said we were
now i'm crawling the wallpaper
and just when i thought that my vista was golden in hue
so with a mop and a bucket
if you let the sunshine come through
each watch i smash apart
will halt the flowing sands
of 25 o'clock
quiet or witty girls by the quayside
down in pearly tears upon your cheeks
i'm happy standing on my feet of clay
dont need another satellite
dont need another satellite
i flick on the video to soothe me
as scenery sunlight shifts away
silent film of melting miracle play
apples and cherries
battery brides ha ha have you ever tried
every morning from your bed
powered on the the beating of hearts
and a tune to which no one is listening
empty
i said they thought it was hunchtime
it's your big day your big day
statistics they dont say a lot
like on the big day
and we'll bring back cheese for my auntie jane
to protect you from the man in the moon
brainiacs daughter
so i reach to hold her frozen hand in flight
and i love the lights that blink on and off
in the sea air
in the gorse
from her head it's growing
all you do is smile you banish the night
i cant stop this grinning
i'm turning night into day
talking to me
where they bake beautiful girls
love to watch her
spent with her
and made our purses from the flailed skins of
the real slaves
brighter than all of the others on the window sill
i'll lay upon you 'till somebody else will
to the ones selected as the audience
no longer be silent
all he would say
or on the back of this record sleeve
is ``i can make you famous''
i gave away a liarbird
when i remember distant days
i remember many things but
i drop a little note through my sympathetics door
but where there was a dozen there are now a hundred more
forgotten not lost
together surrounded by nature
all aboard for sodom
empty
o ladybird
love was hanged and treason became
mud hut or igloo
life is good in the greenhouse
and it's away from you
with myself
'til we're wading waist deep in her brilliant love
she's a little lighthouse when she
if you ever want to dock your dream
down there kiss your arse goodbye
if they're not careful your watch wont be the
love at first sight
mouse takes the bait
it's so warm that you could bake by it
and it's ugly underneath
i wouldnt have suspicions
go ahead it's okay to cry
then she appeared as the giggling crew of marie celeste
then she appeared brittle shooting star that dropped in my lap
then she appeared
this is
we come the wrong way
as you dry odd numbered limbs
that's this world over
so we can stand right up and say we did it in his name
when they had built you
in the direction of dublin
they shouldnt do that
for the older engines
he's just a nut and he's cracking
there's no youth culture
dance goes full circle
for the
she's giving him the runaround
not and it's all forgotten
has passed you by
the radio is blaring out
the blood is running down the gutter
there's an epidemic
a patriotic romance
the jingoistic cake
back in the first world war
if daddy could see today
doing the chores
what in the world
now i'm feeling like a jellyfish
so i'm warning all you cool cool icemen
can make you grow up
of late night parties
empty
your heart is the big box of paints
but dont let the loveless ones sell you
parrots and lemurs
not the hairwaves on your head
brings a nation to its feet
and everything's all right
and dripping slowly down
well you're a good man albert brown
and then along came dad
you take me to heaven from deeper than hell ever dug
well you bring me colour where once i had just black and white
well you can spill me down and lick me up
you're the wish that i had
you're the wish you are i had
but if you take my wish away
like the cells that dissolve when a brainwave is sent
oh heli oh heli
when she's up there twirling round
she a laughing giggly whirlybird
shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
people think that i'm no good
there's a message up in china
radios in motion
i'm like a spinning top
pouring down like honey from above
since swinging about in the trees
civilisation agrees
we're the smartest monkeys
we're only making plans for nigel
me and the wind are celebrating your loss
have i been such a fool
have i been such a fool
woolworth beauty
and dance with me
borne on foaming seahorse herd
the young boy woken in me
we smelled your soup on the fire cooking
he make you glowing
but my world shakes for me
the drama stage and the high brow prose
and you keep saying what you got
my love explodes
waiting here for bliss
and i dont know what she done wrong but i want to hurt her
lying beside me like a parcel of fat
just like one of the girls
or some electricky weather
neon shuffle with a stick of bamboo
to tell the world just how we feel
there is no muscle in our tongues
but the words got in the way
put your foot upon the laughing gas
omnibus take all of us
dont waste time go on and taste them all
aint nothing in the world like a green skinned girl
selling guns to simpletons
in the outside world
you can keep your animals
if all of the tears she cried flowed into a brook
well then her garden would always be green
and the sea in her hair
i take home my notes and coins every week
but the church says to remain this meek
la la lo it's iron
you will see fishes that drown in the sea
then dreams turn to nightmares
all the world's colours will crash into one
a little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the left no
and it's always been the same
someone will come along and move it
but i'll swallow up my fate
no you wont make me jealous
but there's one emotion i'm controlling
across a crowded room
i felt the punch of a punch
wish you were here
hope you got the letter and
i cant believe in you
letting us humans down the wars you bring the babes you
i guess by now they know
my heart torn and broken
strike up the band love
food enough to fill a table
some so hot no man could bear
would not our world turn cold
and my heart beats faster when i think of all the signs
but i dont want to die like you
found a house that wont repair itself
i've been praying i can keep you
i can earn enough for us
i can earn enough for us
they can fix you rabbits up
the music business is a hammer to keep
till once again victorious
they're never too far
'cause you're teacher's pet
shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
you never spoke but i understood
i'm animal and panicking
mister fireman bet you couldnt put me out if you tried
she's a strange strange strange little boy
he's an odd odd odd little fish
hey she's not on the phone at all these days
they can tape every laugh
rehearsing for crimes in government cinemascope
you better watch your tape boys
iron turns when it rains
under the weight of the crown
and iron maidens will slam
remember violence is only a vote for the
'cos he realise this is respectable street
that never move from their front gardens
they're perfect
roads girdle the globe
birds beware expect me up there
i'm a rocket from a bottle shot free
read from your book
soar up high see the semaphore from the washing lines
on the wings of night i fly too above field and stream
fire they cried
ring in the new
reign over good
you may find the wounds will never heal
you may find important pieces gone
spell why on earth do you want
take her by the hand if you hesitate
it's growing green
bring a harvest or a man his wife
round and round and round and round
darling dont you ever stop to wonder
all this life stuff's closely linked
nice to eat
ha ha ha
i'm enlisting overseas aid
sgt rock is going to help me
a no mans land
she really make you donkey up
tan your hide in
the thought of it's causing me pain
we'll do the town tonight
you've been the subject of so many dreams
a little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt
when miss moon lays down
copper chord of august's organ
in the car park
in the corner
but also tender
there's something in the make
go and speak to your niece do this do that
use your fork in the left
to perplex the young diver
that wave
that wave
if you want to fly
that's really super supergirl
now i realise you could be on a mission
well i might be an ape
how you stopped the universe from dying
had his own tankard
made him see
fed the starving and housed the poor
peter pumpkinhead told the truth
he died grinning on live tv
all shuffle round in circles
for those destroyed and thrown away by love
the disappointed
smalltown snoring under blankets
we're standing in poplar lines
if it's all the same to you
and as payment they make love in me
it's just the milkmans dawn round
empty
and the sirens that sing
the man who sailed around his soul
even angels with wings
whistle will blow whistle will blow
smoke on your breath smoke on your breath
holes appearing on your lawn
i'm the bad thoughts inside your head
moving facts and figures all around
where he gets his only ace
we kill the beast
much to my surprise
all the happiness that i could find
repeat chorus
and we'll do it again just because
london paris rome
reminds of us a place
no matter where we go
anywhere is home when you got what we've got
boston dc la and philly bombay
anywhere usa
it feels like
put our service to the test
dont believe me ask the dishes
beef ragout
while the flatware's entertaining
if you're stressed
dont belive me ask the china
be our guest
i'll get warm piping hot
mrs potts
suddenly those good old days are gone
it's been years since we've had anybody here
but for now let's eat up
memories in each and every line each and every line
and i'll always have you in my

he told all his sons of all the antics of adventure
asking for the level where a world devides its answers
live for the breaking free
i've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied i'm on my way
watching for the signals that some easily
waiting for the waiting to be free
when you see you get it
for a sign from god
please organize our spiritual evolution
caught in a total nuclear greed
to be free
it's almost like
it's almost like
empty
all complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
to turn one another to the sign hide hold they wont
as a movement regained and regarded both the same
i listened hard but could not see
a clearer future morning evening nights with you
starpoint to signal our endlessness
jon anderson howe wakeman
it all comes flooding back
you say there's no reason to conjure
empty
wond'ring where lives go
wond'ring where lives go
here we can be
reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
all is left for you
all impenetrable youth over all of our lands
wish the sun to stand still
and you were standing close to me
the summer's too long and it seems like the end of my life
speaking happy words of promise
moving through the night
like the black and white of love
we exist through this strange devicemoving to the left
moving through the night
in the flowers
counting out the statesmen
they the savage innocent
this place this place
of recent changes
empty
if they dont give us the keys
cover me up get closer to the power
how are they to devine
if you dont give them the keys
ah ah
now that it's all over and done
but you're going back inside of the light
the one you want is there
so in answer to the prayer
in the blue sedan we didnt get much further
aim high shoot low
have we found the place that we're looking for
shoot high let go
shoot high aim low
as they regard the summit
cold reigning king
bluetail tailfly
shelter the women that sing
as one changes
so unreal is the future life along the way
so the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
empty
empty
empty
we walk through the country and feel so at ease
my daughter my son
we've waited so now
teakbois is everywhere
the fish to catch
bobby dread and the kool running
bobby dread and the kool running
our reason to be here
our reason to be here
as we accelerate our days
cha cha cha cha cha
in deeper to somewhere we could lie
the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
though you've seen them please dont say a word
in the knowledge of the land spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
take what i say in a diff'rent way and it's easy to see
you can hear the siren screaming
this is the revolution coming
reaching to god love
they see the flags are flying
are you looking at it
the world outside would take it when it came
the crawling bird begins to scream and shout
yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you
empty
come on and write your letter
you know it will be better anyhow
who ya gonna call for the secret of stealing the world
talk talk talk will always get you someplace
fastening your seatbelt tonight it could get jumpy
eya he say touch it together
take take take and dance me thru the lightning
i still remember the time you said goodbye
looking for the sunshine
take so much time to get around to you
just list'ning around ev'rywhere
then i saw you in your place
satisfy me with your words that can be
here is my heart
love will find a way
waiting for you
love will find a way
where the glass shows
to the cities we build
part ii
machine messiah
claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance
machine machine messiah
and if that firelight i could match the inner flame
set in the homes of the universe we have yet to go
wandering through the heavens above
round and round and round i go
i am the man
it's that old devil moon
just as long as you can control
just as long as you hold the key
to the eyes of child
with the wings of flight
empty
from a distant star
dancing for the moon
it will transfer you
to the eyes of child through the eyes
so close and let yourself lose control
empty
they will bring the rain
looking for the sign
actions speak much louder the words than words
you get the heaven you need
sing when open hearts are calling
sing when open hearts are calling
to reach all feelings
i really ought to know
only weakness can stop you from hearing
and i cant help but want to know
this living is a gift i should know
people embracing these feelings of limbo
i'm supposed to see
speak to me
is there something that
i'm supposed to teach
are you ready for this dont mistake the chance focus your eyes
to a new perspective a new state of mind
waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time
nine tribesmen stand alone
singing as one
with forces that surround them
this dialogue
it's time to make a resolution
shaping everything to our design
we can all find a way
ready or not
or where we go
do you hunger for love midst the torture of being one
we only know we go around and around
revealing corridors of time provoking memories disjointed but with
talk tothe sunlight caller
i must have waited all my life for this
we must have waited all our lives for this
amidthe challenge we look around in unison with you
but i just cant believe they really mean to
young christians see it from the beginning
getting over wars we do not mean
moment moment
and rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
not right away not right away
i get up i get down
deep inside
voices are calling echoes unknown
do the best that you can do
over and under and down we go
the solution
giving in giving out
power play machine
for too long i have danced
pattern of nature
hearts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then
only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day
spread the news and help the world go 'round
have you heard of a time that will help get it together again
it's right for me and the time is now
and everybody wants some
everybody wants some
you feel the sacred ground
they love to hear us sing
never underestimate
drifting endlessly by the bridge
childlike soul dreamer one journey
my eyes convinced eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
down at the edge round by the river
i get up i get down
i have time oh let clay transform thee so
as winter calls he will starve
he would touch her
remembered all those many years ago
as a pearl deep in your eyes
all those many years ago
wanting to know where it begins
our existence caught in the blink of an eye
wanting to know where it begins
religion man made
beyond the sun
all the fear i feel from doubt
the more we feel alone
tell the moon dont tell the marcher
we have heaven
all the life
every life
you are my soul and this you are
it's coming clear i've noticed
fire burning wild burning in the night chasing in the wind
shake it off passion is the flame that fired
sweet suffering love protection need it you need come to me
i could be chasing my mind
open your heart
can i make you see
empty
you are my destiny
you're the world to me
drifting i turned on upstream
where reason captured his time
imagine everything
empty
leaving no trace
had to hear your wonderous stories
as he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky
empty
i think of you ev'ry way yesterday and today
use me any time you want
'cause it's time it's time in time with your time and its news is captured
send an instant comment to me
'cause it's time it's time in time with your time and its news is captured
yesterday a morning came a smile upon your face
caesar's palace morning glory silly human silly human race
aint no doubt there's a method to madness here
promise is made promise is made
we began at the first real spring
we began at the first real spring
sing me a story to reach me
like a river without a stream
and i know that i've got something
night time without dreaming
if ever i needed someone
you were there when i needed you
music be the master planner
empty
we can chase the storm
i can sing the rain
i can feel the earth moving
riches silver and gold
disappear it's gone
disappear on high
this is how nature controls
let the fire run
my eyes see the glory of the world
dancing with the teacher in the circle
only when you stop to listen
never let the grass grow over your soul
forgiving is what you see
the forces come the force has come
forgiving is what you have
my eyes see the coming revolution
empty
empty
and where that river ends nobody knows
only you know
empty
giving into the magic of the ride
they say that time is like a river that flows
if you know my spirit
looking down on you
in the fountains of the universe set time in accord
see it all
one the word will enter all our hearts
getting the feel as a river flows
that you really surely really mean to finish
listen to life
in my cosmic mind
taken so high
rocking rolling
turnstile to one
talk about sending love
what disappointing sights he'd seen instead of ones so dear
harold land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage
lose one on to the heart of the sunrise
counting the broken ties they decide
i feel lost in the citylost in their eyes as you hurry by
love comes to you and then after
look around you as you drift downstream
love me
like rivers our hearts entwine
empty
i believe in it
two hearts are better hearts
you sing the answers question time
one heart's for love
i living it
all angels of the magic constellation
jigsaw puzzle traitors
looking for you
talk the simple smile
when we reach
is looking for you
sunshine shine on through
did you find what we had lost
stop that reasoning you've got the answer
holding on was it ever like this
so giving all the love you have
in the big sky
we have walked the path
all the dreams of the world
i cant believe we're running to
run another
just hear the voice
never be afraid to show your heart
long lost brother of mine
long lost brother of mine
realising it all of the time
seeing the fathers of wisdom
see the world we stamped
see the laws of nature keep telling us like a friend
to see and show
empty
lead me on into the dawn
i want to turn my life around
displayed in all the things i see
empty
i believe that you knew our faith was secure
she watches for my moods never brings me down
tell me how would you feel with no world of your own and nobody to
i know she'll never go doo doo doo doot n doo
as the silence of the seasons on we relive abridge sails afloat
the strength regains us in between our time
there's someone rainbow
alternate ways
the strength of the meeting lies with you
the strength of the moment lies with you
other skylines to hold you
things are all in colours and the size of other's shall send you forward
sail the futile wars they suffer
out tender outward lights of you
empty
alternate view
take the water to the mountain
holy river holy tree
more in the mind
it would shock your fall into landing light
if you could see all the roads i have travelled
yes yes and the feeling you give me
the pleasure of the giving things within
until you reach and touch your own redemption
they marched as one with earth
empty
and i heard a million voices singing
and i heard a million voices singing
how the stories can be heard
head into the headlight
see the dancers of the nile
chris squire
and ride there
kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow
words cause our banner victorious our day
help us now
our cries will shrill the air will moan and crash into the dawn
our reason to be here
that talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
dividing all my energy
there's something
judging by the voice
more than that i do not not know
to keep the message alive
that our children sing to us
you got to stand stand to to together
from the beginning
the more we see the more we try the more we show
for each of us the road is clear and life has just begun
together you and i we hold the key to all the answers
when you're talking be the children
the gift of love will surely be
be the one giving in to love
giving in giving in to love
reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
as a moment regained and regarded both the same
words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life
brahms by rick wakemaninstrumental
root yourself to the ground
you've left me here believing
empty
who could believe when love has gone
one road to loneliness
empty
this disregard for love's equality
questions answers blessed forgivers plus forgive us
children of light havent you heard
someday will it be our turn
jon anderson
seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
from historical or mythical scenes
angels high in starlight dancing streets
cand floss toffee apples no clowns
beckoning the good guy
we'll be waiting for the night to come
we'll be waiting for the night to come
once bitten twice shy
of all the times i treasure this
i the solid time of change
down at the edge round by the corner
down at the end round by the corner
i crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
all in all the journey takes you all the way
empty
how many millions do we deceive each day
iv seasons of man
on the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
i get up i get down
changed only for a sight of sound the space agreed
all left dying rediscovered
their fruitless worth
and you and i reached out for reasons to call
just to get high breking out from this life gotta get them a drug to get
fear the only law fear is all we hear about
hoping for love all of the moves
hands to the sun dont show your body
look in the light through the night
take what you have into the arms of wanting to the arms of love
that's what you say
heritage for sun and daughter
you walk the way
repeat chorus
rejoice they sing
emotion revealed as the ocean maid
side tracked by some indiscretion
now life tell me now in your arms
first calling in a silent spring
like the first words ever to reach out to you
and this endless dream giving ourselves everything
i've waited so long
that touches me
so many displaced among the future dreamers
to the westward light
our home
right enough to let you begin
just what keeps us so alive
living within the vision
our home is our world our life
nothing can ever change us now
a place for us all to reach
should the famine of change to diguise everyone
so all this necessary changes now as the will to help all man
i can see and feel the truth every minute
i wanna be inside your heart
your life i am waiting
are you ready
say you need me just because
i am waiting can you hear me
the eyes of honesty can achieve
i get up i get down
so it will be then
i would have waited forever there's no question about it at all
i would have waited forever to give you everything i had
put them in your arms for you my love
yes you caught me when i was falling fast
ever wishing you this love and more
yes you caught me when i was falling fast
and only you knew
empty
the challenge is to chase the sounds
empty
there can be no denying
waste another day
part of a back door
there stands our childrens lives
take this coice
seen as a godsend to us
as one together
and you always let the feeling show
by the sea
you can cut your heart
you're pushing the needle to the red
there's a crazy world outside
we architects of life
it can happen to you
look up look down
you can cheat until you're blind
as it happens
it can happen today
setting me free again leading the way
making me see again
giving me good reason
time feels so much closer now
make me believe again
making me free again
come tomorrow
take a straight and stronger course to the corner of your life
move on back two squares
dont surround yourself with yourself dont surround yourself
'cause it's time it's time in time with your time and its news is captured
i've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied i'm on my way
another town and one more show
mcarthur park in the driving snow
ah leave it
ah leave it
goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
shall we light the heavens
countenance of love
let's get our hearts together
empty
what you cant see cant be very whole
you've got a great imagination
knowing what could be true
you've got a great imagination
questioning the powers that be
when the change is gonna come
i've received it
in disguise
you've got a sweet imagination
show it
everything about you inside your eyes
for there's something inside you they call it
iii it's so hard to grow
sick feeling sick reasoning sick challenge you la la la la
you dont need anybody in the complicated life
and hit me sending me sideways
our song
so this is where we really start
treat it good
you always live your life
so the story goes
how he dancin one and only
owner of a lonely heart
owner of a lonely heart
it will excite it will delight
when you come to realize you've been playing with fire
now without a trce of doubt i feel it every hour
display our rights and wrongs and always keep it strong
making love towards perfection
and there you are
as truth is gathered i rearrange
deep inside the world's controlling you and meyou'll see perpetual change
as mist and sun are both the same
and all of the dreams that come true
i wanna learn more about you
long distance runaround
when i was losing fast
is never so far away
so wonderful true believer
i'll walk with you to the end of the earthi wanna learn more about you
no need to change my mind
how we hurt and never show it
we will love forever this eternity
how you helped me with your light
get the wind as it slowly turns
call this free love
far away in the depths of hawking's mind
call this free love
until we pick it up again
let our hour of passion
power defy our needs lift us up show us now
power at first to the needs of each others' days
straight jacket freedom's march is it all far beyond
power at first to the needs of each others' days
innocence no answer
the rhythm of love
night time fever burning till you're higher
in this situation i have found you
present and relay the struggle out of which comes a positive source nous
constant doors will open eyes
till we're coming home again
constant to the soul
we receive all we venture to give
move around surely sing
going home
jon anderson howe

i asked my love to give me shelter
and all the pieces fit forever

there's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
when you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head
empty
cherry red cherry red
cherry red cherry red
in a flat forty one with my strat on the door
hallelujah hallelujah
billy gibbons
hard as ice it's like tumblin dice
you best be confessin hey dont be cruel
take out some insurance and cover your rig
be steppin softly when you know the deal is goin down
down down
if she'd place an order i'd drink her bath water and
they seemed a little bit mysterious
things were looking kind of furious
dippin low in the lap of luxury
hey baby watcha gonna do
you made me feel like there aint nothin wrong
your problems cured with a dollar bill
it wasnt the same now it goes to show
lookin high and low dont know where to go
lookin high and low dont know where to go
i had the blues and my baby she knew
i'm kind of sad but i feel alright

i just wanna please her
i just want to meet her
oh i'm bad i'm nationwide
with my new york brim and my gold tooth displayed
baby what you tryin to do
dont let it get you down it aint nothin new
took a jump through mississippi muddy water turned to wine
we been rollin al night long
i'm not the only man she sees
got me a pocket full of change
got me a pocket full of change
you know i'd try to please her
if i could get to see her
ask him and he'll testify
and you know what i'm talkin about
and i hear it's tight most ev'ry night
she's got hair down to her fanny
oh i want her said i got to have her
livin for the lizard life
livin for the lizard life
and waitin for a three point landin
it could have been the thing that she told me
that's when i jumped out of her window
it's a fiend scene and it happens 'bout once a week
they'll make you loose they'll make you crazy
but i'll be back for you jack
just gettin right on saturday night
how fine they cried now with you inside
the speed was too so out i flew
if you're down in acuna and you aint up to being alone
oh this is gonna be so good
the feelin sure is fine
and the diesel drivers keep them engines burnin
musiclyrics schaffer
just pawns in your twisted game
would i not suffer enough
is so hard to understand
rising to the heavens light
he didnt think yesterday of the end of his life
for the last time i've been betrayed
oh the past it haunts her
she wants to laugh
her quest for inner peace
she wants so love
empty
free from a life of despair
empty
empty
the elder men of the watch professed this day
pure ambition burns in me
blessed are you
standing tall side by side
music schaffer shawver lyrics schaffer
the almighty crutch
master of the ignorant
it seems very odd to me
you abuse the words you preach
do it now or burn in hell
take the fruit
burning eden
priests of the fire release thee
repent your sins to me
empty
burn them in my name
of all these things
that twists and turns inside
make the sacrifice the hours close at hand
walk carefully my friends stab my back again
burn your soul
trapped by flesh turned to stone set free by the night
is where we choose to live
walking in the subway
you feel a thousand cries
your life is wasted
we watch you grieving
genocide and the chains that bind
oh you ought to know
let the reign begin
purity innocence encourage death
your son the bastard
the serpent gods apocalyptic smile
and someone in my mind saying
this evil synthesis
if you're able to take control
as we take the final step
our lives together planned
last december
last december
as i grow the pain sustains
soul sucking pious man
the cycle's spun once more
an ungrateful troubled place
make the sadness go away
devoid of all the passion
thrown past life not afraid
the voices are calling
a murmured cry was heard
the burning sun is turning black falling from the sky
at once the sun turns back
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
hell is coming down your fate has turned around
alien to us the species known as man
so there is hope you see but we must act with great speed
disciples of the watch prepare the coming curse
good and evil light the sky
the end of the storm is near
axes yield and daggers fly
what have i done
lost souls should never look upon
i'm your reaping stone
i'm your reaping stone
scarring me for eternal life
he lied
ask and i received damnation was the price
and so i must repent or will i be destroyed
everything about you is wrong
empty
hear what i say
riders ride on dismal clouds
the trumpets sound as i break free
my scream no one hears
baptized in fire for my ancient land
savior to my own devil to some
mankind falls something wicked comes
the coming curse the anti christ i am the watcher's eye
sent through time to destroy
the hunter the thunder
yes dear friend listen up well
deception in my eyes
your souls been sold
this is the path that i choose
temptation befell me
it's dark and peaceful but my face you'll never see no
m breathe deep the darkness breathe deep the sadness
y i have to see
gaze upon me now
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
the hot winds of hell breathe your name
and that's when it planted the evil seed
no remorse it's too late
riding on the hot winds of hell
profane to humanity menaced by flesh and bone
vengeance is mine
born of hell and in disease
there's nothing i cant do
one tragic night he died
his spirit's like the wind
it still hurts me to this day
oh i know oh i know
the night comes shining through
till death
into the burning lake of fire
these frozen times
then it's time a state of mind
from the bowels of hell
freezing veins of ice
written down so long ago
forgiveness for your soul you pray
cursing heaven and hell
tell me why
tell me why
ii scream out to you
i've seen the rain wash over you a thousand times
i cut you once i cut you twice
know the number of the beast
the nazarene i'll crucify
from the eternal sea he rises
or spend all eternity
entrance me to limbo i'm not
forever being stung by wasps and demons breath
the vicious beast cerebus three heads blooded eyes
damned the wrathful and the vain
belching forth in agony invoking her to rise
the twisted beast he laughs he draws his arrow back
praying all the while for a quick painless death
this place is dark and grey
realizing i am not alone
fill our heads with false identity
endangered theyll fade away
images flash memories jaded
i've lost it all
repeat chorus
from the depths of hell
the sympathy in my mind is growing cold
it's called on me to rise
music schaffer shawver abell lyrics barlow
that of a dead profit
rise of the sun my test of time
not like the others so incomplete
when shadows fall on unholy ground
i live my life among the damned
a life of hell you put me through
the blackness inside overwhelms me
do you believe in destiny
is this my reward for serving god's own war
the human race will bleed they will serve my need
music jon schaffer lyrics matthew barlow
the creature has come to take you away
will bring you so much pain
micro chipped like dogs
you'll find me inhumane
a spirit born free
arrested development
we'll always keep you safe
music jon schaffer lyrics jon schaffer
creating life with his own hands
i've got to know the meaning of life
jon schaffer matthew barlow
here i'll walk through the field where i died
here i'll stand on the firing line
he's in our minds
you died to keep us free
no matter what the cost
i gave up everything
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
lain to waste
watching them crawl
we have come to save
live can transcend the mortal coil
and utilize the scroll to save this one
scarred from the millennia
you keep on running been lonely for too long
do you remember the power of the flame
empty
breakaway the chains he will set you free
i didnt know i was the one to blame
i didnt know i was your ball and chain
and it cuts through your heart like a razor
they will stand the test of time
you bleed in silence
they will stand the test of time
shadows in my mind
finding the rainbow's end
lifting me higher
selling dreams in the city lights
the city's on fire
that's when the night rages on
you know you've lost control
when i survey all the madness on the face of the earth
countdown to the revolution
countdown to the revolution
to break the chains to set you free
everyone's got their cross to bear
the cards were dealt and life's unfair
gonna cruise the boulevard
we've got the action no standing still
since you came into my life
every single thing is you
everything i need is you
the shadow of your loving wings forever i will stay
since you came into my life
into the eye eye of the hurricane
inside the eye of the hurricane
inside the eye
i dont know i dont know where you're going
father forgive them they know not what they do
the sun will rise and the sun will set
it comes down to time and chance
away from the dark and the night
i was crossing the line one too many times
life was taking it's toll i was losing control
now that i finally found my way back to your heart
you know i've been lonely for your love
you hear the call of the prophet
your demons are calling it's your turn to do or die
your castles are falling the flames burning high
you've got to grin and bear it
let nothing move your soul
when you're chasing down the star
just hold the line hold the line
life's a journey til the end of time hold the line
because i'll always know the truth
i hear the sweet voice of the love i cant deny
so i ask you now wont you be my guide
i'll wait for you
and if it takes forever
i'll wait for you tonight
in the shadows of the night
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
another time another place and we'll be standing face to face
the kingdom of light
hebridian winds blow
legends are reality
the nightmare that runs through your day
when will you learn
there she was eve in paradise and willing to give me a
master master of disguise
master master of disguise
master master of disguise
left a bitter taste a heart of stone
i'll wait for you
take my hand we'll start again
to turn the hand of fate
cant you see our love is so right
i've tried everything i could find
i'm walking in paradise
i'm walking in paradise
forever i'll share life with you
knowing what's on the line
open up your eyes
now turn away
there's still time to turn away
never surrender no take the power of love
and never surrender
what really matters when i cross the finish line
caught up in a rat race playing in the devils game
living in the fast lane and i'm burning the flame
she always was a winner
secret lover comfort me
speak the silence talk to me
i've finally found my home with you by my side
now i realize cant live without you
so i get out of bed
but since you've been gone
your telegram
i'm out of my head
and his spirit's dying on the way
stealing everywhere and no one seems to care
where's the peace where has it gone
reflecting like a mirror
heading from the east into west la
that perfect stranger stand in line
together we can have it all
together we'll share in the harmony there without treason
stand or fall
tears in the eyes of the world
dying traditions selfish ambitions
in the silence of the night can you hear the cries
into the valley of sorrow
into the night they will ride
empty
there's no turning back
when he's running with the pack
another mindless crime
papers signed at immigration
into the air to fly gracefully
when you're under the gun it's a cold sensation
when you're under the gun it's a blue damnation
freezing by the fire while you're chilling to the bone
victim of the system living in the city
deadly stare into the monitor screen
my remote controller's in my hand
visual decline etched upon my mind
i've got a brand new band
and you walk inside my shoes
but momma i aint now painted clown
'cause life aint no crime
i hope someday you see what i see
walk away you're a prisoner of lies
it's only fear itself that keeps you chained alive
am i wrong or right
but i could feel him
am i wrong or right
sick and tired of being pushed around
cant hear the river run without a sound
double chorus
shine brightly while you can
i feel the warming one
all around
all around
see the rising sun
i wanna tell you
all the people
hear the voices
hear the voices
nothing seems right
but you wont get far
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
never givin up on the wrong
respect the sacrifice
when you're looking out of control
trying to take another ride
all my troubles soon be leaving
empty
turns them into real things
closing all the doors
with some cat inside
with the neon ghosts in the city
beautiful girl stay with me
well i do hope it's not too free
uneasy with your morons smile
for all who never began
in the shadow of death
of my endless search
when the love around
of your needs
and you cant find love
push away those bitter tears
one day i think i know myself
my mind is a planet
body language
body language
where has our innocence gone
are you comfortable in your skin
some days i am everything i hate
it's no use pretending
i love the day in the life
dont stop it
cause i understand
in the dark of night
here comes the clown
i wish you were
read the late paper it was full of bad news
take the chains from your mind
green fields grass and earth
carpet lining
they will put your feet in very hot water
i've come to see your honesty
at what they're giving me
sometimes you kick
nothing more i could ask of you
your face
kill the pain you feel
eden let's me in
and we scream like alleycats
sweet perfume trails behind
cause i know you'll be wanting more
for the moments we could make
enough was enough
your wondering what you seeing
you're wondering what your doing
i would never have counted on this
you're wondering what your doing
up and down inside your yourself
you can try to make me mad
rehearsed travel
we're looking out to you
there's a buzzing in the station
is fucking up my poetry
caught in between
is fucking up my overdrive
everybody's down on their knees
you are all you need
empty
by the fire
this is
i dont think we know each other
dont you test my concience
that's what you asked for
that's what you asked for
loosing sympathy
you'll see
try not to hate
a heavy weight
the animal we ate
to moderate
food on plate
love your mate
or just too late
guilt debate
empty
and the winner
and the winner
great expectations take a look around you
but my mouth my mouth is shut
i dont see
men and women
well you know just what you do to me
it's the one thing
it's the one thing
storey to storey
repeated in the corridors
climbing as we fall
we share the same spaces
hoping that your gonna come yeah
yeah some
what are we hating for
what are we hating for waiting for
that scratched and crawled up the wall
that scratched and crawled up the wall
into my destiny
word spoken
you know that we are always wasting
but can you keep it on
it's only time that makes you
all you ever wanted
well it's only time
do you lose sleep at night
i should not judge
i should not judge
for a different kind of girl
past money and colours and make believe
what is the name to call
all red with its message
if this was easy
but everybody's
walking hand in hand
'cause i've not seen the miracle
it's called the end of rock and roll
some music is playing by metal gazers
learning bikes and ditto vices
what could be found
in this sweet damaged smile
you turn around
sucks you in and spits you out again
the bridges too far
closed eyes and no more breathing
hey here is the story
aint no sense in all your crying
and you cry in the daylight
quiet desperation of a million lives
who pays the price
everytime you find a key you find more
off in the distance
like animals
empty
i said woman gonna take you
gonna show the way
living it all for the life
if you ever gonna taste it
gotta keep yourself
an she smiles when she tells me
write poetry and feel safe
by the way it is
innocence is what we want
i just landed
girl on fire
girl on fire
from new york to london
girl on fire
beating the drum of pain and pleasure
we go making friends
and all the tricks
yes i know all about it
all along you must have known
it crashes in all around
but it could be good
wanna change forgot the joke
guns in the sky guns in the sky guns in the sky
empty
coming into view
use your imagination
heaven sent
dressed in black if she comes back
heaven sent
heaven sent
of romances
here comes god's top ten
want to want to sail a boat across the sea
so long so long i must say goodbye now
i miss the people
your my apparition
she's my only one
my father left town
he's killed some pain
until that right man came along
my mother left town
what do i hear
limits of love
i've cut a new life slice
you got a pretty face
reasons are with gods
you can fuck your own mane
she puts her hat on
provides a steady beat
her friends dont care
from a small aeroplane you can see the fields
a place to work and grow
ah ah ah ah
a place to work and grow
heart shaped hedges
so entertaining
you should see the light
gonna keep up the lies
there's a war out here
the door
i need a new way
look to your left
way baybee
used to be in another world
she said ``i had enough of your lies
move on
there are no words that could explain
used to be alone
had enough
the strongest love in vain
believe it you can see it
it changes my world everyday
everything we took
dont you put the blame on the messenger
was it from each other
hold on hold on
streets of blue
i need perfection
all those stars that shine upon you
you're eternally wild with the power
and give me a moment
i'm lonely
i was standing
'cause we all have wings
in perfect moments
right now
cry baby cry
a new sensation
than live forever
no questions no answers
i dont mind if it's something new
once you give in you are through
and i was lost for words
and every touch and all the nights
i wanna be inside you
not enough time for all
natives wearing turquoise and silver
old world new world
ooooh dancing and shaking hands
i'll keep listening
empty
serve me well yeah
on a bus moving fast
and you'll never be sad again
i'm on my way
i'm on my way
i will still be there
and come with me
and you might know how to play with fire
there is a dream and it's held by many
in the name of love yeah
dream on white girl
you thought what a pity
if you got the time i'll show you how to turn it on
how can you go back when you dont know why you're here
how can you heal someone that doesnt want to heal
there's a girl far away
i dont know her
all i want to do
all they've got is bones and blood
all they've got is bones and blood
all they've got is bones and blood
peace and happiness
argue with themselves
another war in a holy land
watch the world argue
rag clothing
dirty money
counted out in loss
got the new deal
counted out in loss
the take down
i dont believe i know your name
please tell me the rules of the game
gimme more gimme more
gimme more of the same
here come the man
the devil inside
i'm looking at what's on tv
all the problems all the fears
sweet anticipation
lose my mind
am i looking at salvation
and the world seems to disappear
and the world seems to disappear
i could've been a scientist
there's a planet where it's right
dont change a thing for me
see no evil in all directions
with a starfuck for a friend
and that's buried deep inside
you act like you got the answer
all you seem to care about
can you pay the price
who's scared to have a heart
is from hiding from the pain
the heart you're building out of rock
i'll stab at you in the darkness
can you pay the price
you cant pay the price
the good life
we run
baby's down on the world and she knows it
ah elegantly wasted
yeah we're not the only ones
fall into the arms of god
the way you see the world
the simple things that mean a lot
change the face of a magazine
stare in shock at what you saw
turns ice to snow
there's this place full of mountain heads
they got all the promotions
in this world
i gotta tell you
you better make them good
i gotta tell you
says she sees it straight
you always need something
have we lost direction
it would be clear tomorrow
have we lost direction
i am searching
is never gonna change this killer town
in perfect time
high high high
she gives me reason
shake the tree you find
all she wants is to begin
he is heading for an open door
all she wants is to begin
he is rising
since time began
and if you're looking
looking for that light
but your oh so weak
silhouette i'm seeing in the shape of you
the silhouette i'm seeing in the shape of you
make you feel like you got feet of glue
joy in mind cheat your heart
take my soul take my soul take my soul
give me your money honey
oh cherry
always trying happy lying
oh cherry baby
i tried to tell her
oh cherry
show me how
camp on love sign people i talk about
johnny knows love song people i talk about
camp on love sign people i talk about
he walks down crowded streets and doesnt feel alone oh never alone
promises are carved out of lust
and ring to let you know
but the gold is hard to find
she said this was a love to end all loves
a dirty trick to catch me out
and stand in shadows protecting you
listening to all i say
know what i mean
that's what i want
another dream
do you really think you're cared for
some paradise
promises to break your heart
why do we lose our self control
offer me to the all above
before it began
suicide blonde
take me there
i am the one
it seems a crime
without a scream
a need to quench
this realization
these are the words she speaks
oh so fine
all the tracks that
but i know what's mine
all we ever try
do do do do do
all the truth you see
but i know what's mine
i need you now
she's walking away
and then i wonder why i'm here
what there is for me
and try to take the hurt
kill for gain or shoot to maim
go to war again blood is freedom's stain
as the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
dance to their song
so if you're looking for a good time
you can take my honest word for it
everybody stops and turns to stare at you
what you want
it's no life for you stop all that screwing
there's no time to waste
roll over spin round to come in behind them
run live to fly fly to live do or die
was born a son
alexander the great
he met king darius again
a phrygian king had bound a chariot yoke
they wouldnt follow him to india
empty
the macedonian learned mind their culture was a western way of life
he died of fever in babylon
repeat 1 2
empty
shellshock in the kitchen
tables start to burn
in the village
just for a second a glimpse of my father i see
we're blood brothers we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers we're blood brothers
and if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
blood on the worlds hands
it's out of control
and one day it could be happening to us
beauty not needed here
messiah before his fall
where is salvation now
in a brave new world
if i said i'd take you there
charlotte you've got your legs in the air dont you hear all the laughter
dont you care who you let in
'cause you're making love all day
god knows he wants to go home
smiles as the flames sear his flesh
you'll burn again tonight
and you know that this moment in time is for real
have you ever talked to someone
leaving you to count the cost
'cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
pour from the eastern sands
come to wash my sins away
even when i dont deserve it
they'll be coming to claim take your soul away
the sign of the cross
buti'm not going insane
and i feel that i'm weaker every day
cant you see not just me they want you too
here i am i'm not really there
all my feelings cannot be held
my spirit wanders endlessly
one hundred years have gone and men again they came that way
empty
death in life is your ideal
silently to silence fall
is it worth the pain
each moments like a year
questions that come again
the choice of weapons is done
a lunge and a feint a parry too late
meanwhile the reaper looks on
when you've faced the heart of darkness
they brought it up just like room service
in this war things get so confused
with his blood upon my hands
watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
beaten fallen angel but i've risen again
nothing left but to face this all on my own
sound is ringing in your head
not getting anywhere
run over stiles across fields
empty
you've got to kill to stay alive
watch the jungle burning bright
show them no fear show them no pain
nomad where you come from no one knows
no one dares to even look or glance your way
you send before you a mystique that's all your own
nomad you're the rider so mysterious
just what i saw in my old dreams
was all this for real or some kind of hell
can this still be real or some crazy dream
i've been looking so long for you now
knowing the terror and holding
come what may
smith harris
dont care where the past was
i'll live my life how i want to
fighter spirit a will to win
but what kind of good or bad
my soul will fly
there's a thin line between love and hate
there's a thin line between love and hate
the mighty roar of the russian guns
a burst of rounds take my horse below
or really think you could be someone else
all my life i've tried to hide away
forgive yourself a few immortal sins
hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
the ferryman wants his money you aint going to give it back
he is the king of all the land
and without it you would die
and will take the gom jabbar
messiah supreme
empty
a shadow cast upon them all
those who survive must weather the storm
it's been three long years since i've been gone
i feel so lonely it's a long time since i died
and all the things i sometimes do it isnt me but someone else
i got you on my mind
the blizzard goes on but still they must fly
the cable car's the only way in
empty
to be found
ooh yeah yeah
to be found
mother russia how are you sleeping
now it has come freedom at last
it was cold it was starting to rain
there's some people coming down the street
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
murders in the rue morgue
should i return to the scene of the crime
gers dickinson
i accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
you're the phantom of the opera you're the devil you're just out to scare
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
so bring me the blood and red wine
but open the gates of my hell
slave to the power of death
i'll die oh please
oh help me please
and it's driving me mad
the bushes with it open wide
empty
memories rising from the past
take me away
to save the power of warmth and light
and they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
o god of earth and altar
no reason for a place like this
moonlight catches silver tears i cry
will rock the boat you'll see
stay here and listen to the nightmares
and the ship sails on back to the north
his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
samuel taylor coleridge 1798 1834
they throw their dice for the crew
and cursed me with his eye
and by the light of the moon
bodies lifted by good spirits
and then a boat came sailing towards him
and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
oh will we ever be set free
hunting and killing for game
i've got no place to call my own
i'm running free yeh i'm running free
out of winter came a warhorse of steel
to survive
and i'll be alright
just give me sanctuary from the law
have i dreamt this time this place
the dream is true the dream is true
that i cant see for sure
the dream is true the dream is true
saving me from myself
lost in a paradox
to save me from myself
the dream is true the dream is true
is someone in heaven are they looking down
once he built missiles a nations defence
maybe tonight somebody's crying
when all you do can only bring you sadness
the sun dont shine
oh my heart is heavy as i turn my back and leave
listen child dont you see there's a cure
feels so good think it's gonna be a new day
empty
in a flash of a blade
to fear no mortal man
see the madman in his gaze
as he flies on the wings of a dream
no one can see
people say 'dont worry'
when you laugh are you really crying
i feel that my spirit's broken
in gangland where the jailbirds die
a contract to keep and it's service with a smile
on the bow i stand west is where i go
carried forward by the waves
for eternity i follow on there is no other way
of a world that has gone very wrong for me
as the guards march me out to the courtyard
maybe then you'll begin to understand
i dont feel ready there's so much left undone
i see a tunnel i stand amazed
my body tingles i feel so strange
empty
nothing to live for
and i just dont know
their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
empty
they've come to attack
the battle weary fight to the end
wont you come into my room
iron maidens
it's hard to remember when i was happy
and tell me of my fate tell me of my place
that the right you thought was wrong
his eyes burn a hole in your back
that burns in the night
all my dark dreams drift
i am falling down to meet with them
this dagger in my mind will tell
deepest cut of all from you
it's reality
i like all the mixed emotion and anger
empty
i fought for liberty and faith
be with you after this war
the iron will survive
into the unknown
ghostlike appeared in the sky
assailant lash of the world
a heep of debries
enslave us and chain us
broke all the dreams of unification
all you do is to back at the moon
in her cold embrace we will find our graves
atlantic will fall life it will finally decent
brought us to the lair
the stars are black beyond the gate
lost in the void
the stars are black beyond the gate
out of the black abyss
just like a machine programmed and build to obey
where the perfect people life perfect lifes
escape the nightmare you cant even dream
of biogenetic design
empty
it this you like thunder draging you ander
you're plaing with fire
gonna wrack you up please break in up
the sleeper is trying to get in contact with the bio unit of the savior they are the last ancient atlantian beings which makes them brothers of the past
brother before it's too late
together we're facing our destiny
this is our legacy
empty
that is might be related to the lost
be the guardian to guide us
let us life or let us end
be the leader to lead us
lost in the dark millenniums ago
distant voices sources unknown
is it for real will we fall
empty
my future is calling i know
out future is calling i know
save me before i will drown
come and and take me home
my life's redefined
i've been the dragon and once i've been strong
my own peace of mind
they haunt me no more
music and lyrics by excelsis
so dont come to grief
your ancient land
seems now the tables will turn
eye of the world
infuriated electrified
ready to course with no remorse
the world's under fire
fighting in this dreadful war what is it all good for
we're the defenders we are the ones
awake wake from your dream and redem
for the freedom
return and let your soul take control
for the freedom
for the freedom
for the freedom
but yet we're alive unbroken we stand
savior watch out beware
we'll rise from the ashes again and again
we'll be a thorn in your unhuman flesh
from beyond our space and time
this is our promised land
far all eternity we hold the flame
the ancient machine runs an analysis and draws a fatal conclusion
we cant hide from your cold staring eye
iron iron savior godness in the sky
will he ever understand
devastation and termination
oh i saw hell
i've been to hell
i must redeem
you've been calling me
to keep man alive
i am the one you are the ones
the time for reprisal is here
empty
written on memory blocks
mind over matter at last
give me guidance in torrents of time
solo piet
original version to be found on the
decisions have to be made
dragons of light
oh i dont know
never say die
they came to please and satisfy
it's time to understand
empty
unlock the gate to reality
obey and release me
to destroy it anymore
eternal slave
on earth only few people managed to hide from the bloodhounds of the savior in the former earth defense headquarters edh underneath the everlasting ice of greenland the machine from the very first moment of it's arrivalwas transmitting signals directly to the atlantic ocean north africa south america and the easter islands this behavior led some people to the theory of atlantis and in fact after a major search for anything related to the old myth some artifacts were found on the azores and on the easter islands the dig on the easter islands uncovered something like the entrance to an ancient structure of unknown purpose shielded and protected by force fields of unknown sources the station couldnt be entered by anybody yet but all of a sudden another transmission similar to the savior's transmission but yet different was detected sensors indicated that the source must be located right in the heart of the ancient structure
my creators have vanished lost in space and in time
your resistance is futile if you fight me you'll fall
justice i'll defend guardian of the land
will you dream come true and what will you find
up to the stars to escape this living hell
reflections of thousand lightyears ago
riding on fire and your heart it dies
no light in the black
riding side by side
die until the final breath
empty
i'm high i ride on solar wings
i'm waiting for my sanctuary
i'm riding ohoo
outcast and homeless
faster than light we cruise the unknown
atlantis will be lost in war and will decay
in deep space we're gilding
were are we going
so let the battle let the battle begin
tonight is the night
so let the battle let the battle begin
saw a falling star burnin
cant talk to you babe
turn this crazy bird around
uhh love is blind
this fight tonight
the heavens are shining golden and blue enlightening the dawn
the throne in the sky now is
so many tears
we have outlasted the war
both out in the vast
the shadows of war
we have returned returned to the light
i've seen empires rise and blown away
i am trapped in this nightmare
i'm here and lost in time
solo piet kai
i am here and lost in time
hell is waiting there is no turning back
dont look straight ahead
burning high burning the sky
you closed his eyes
cant stand the pain pain
eye to eye facing the enemy
forever he'll rest
and victory is on your side
well they let me out of pontiac
where a rail has been has been
you cannot buy protection
walking in the streets your mainline connection
no time
if you want me to i'll cook and sew
a desert road from vegas to nowhere
coming closer sweet release
the falcon hath bourne my mate away
and she weepeth both night and day
moving on again
oh he's movingmoving on again
ask yourself why he's off when others surround you
and bliss face down defended
gonna take him with you when you go
you couldnt say that you had been juiced
please dont get too close to me
take him with you when you go
i remember one night a drizzling rain
you pass my door and you wont come in
the love you lost with her skin so fair
i feel afraid and i call your name
while all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
all i want to do is love everyone
and tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said
i'm only here for this moment
i know everybody here wants you
and i'll rise like an ember in your name
i know everybody here thinks he needs you
her love is a rose pale and dying
all of my pain when i think back to when
cause i know you're somewhere out there right now
oh my love
the parting was mutual
feminine smiles the right side is wise more than i
there's room for both of us to fly
true love has come to us all
l cohen
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
i've seen your flag on the marble arch
but all i've ever learned from love
oh baby say it
i wanna inject you in my blood
i wish i was your 5 dollar bill
i dont mean trouble please dont put me down dont get upset
i'm just whispering to myself so i can pretend that i dont know
first the photographs take you to the right hands
take you down on the ground
empty
havent you heard
two cripples dancing to the end we lie
some other love becomes you
i'm not with you but of you
i know we could be so happy baby
from the west unto the east
i shall be released
got a girl here tonight
now i want someone badly
to burn in here with me
that someone is you ooooo
my mind a blur and some blood on my chin
on his brand new stereo
for my last chance crashing to freedom
best intentions become facts again
in a glass of champagne
i always have respected her for busting out and gettin free
if she's passin back this way i'm not that hard to find
ah mon amour
even pepi from napoli
and people came there from so far away
i cant forget my little square
dans tes grands yeux
like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end
i think i ought to know
that baby's got new clothes
that baby cant be blessed
and your long time curse hurts
i was hungry and it was your world
breathing oh
as we were leaving
'cause we all got in tune
you know my shirt's all wet
yes kick out the jams got to kick 'em out
and let me kick out the jams
this is our last embrace
did you say no this cant happen to me
i lost myself on a cool damp night
i drink much more that i ought to drink
lilac wine i feel unready for my love
neither good nor bad just a kid like you
i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
child you know how much i need it
oh will i ever learn
my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
'cause it's not too late
i'm lying in my bed
the memories fire the rhythms fall slow
it's you i've searched so hard for
spring water on the floor of this
bliss the abyss
she cheated and she lied and you stole her
can you hear my love again x4
all for the law of gravity
and the price of admission
i had to send it away to bring us back again
what am i still to you
i have no right to wonder just how or when
your whole family's splintered
no stars to revolve around
there is no single entrance
feel no shame for what you are
fall in light fall in light
leave your home car leave your pulpit
fall in light fall in light
all young lovers know why
dont know what you asked for
so new to your bedroom floor
so new to your bedroom floor
it's overflowing now inside you
how many times have you heard someone say
but one thing's gone for certain when it comes my time
take away these thoughts of mine
dig the holes for me to sleep inside
dig the holes for me to sleep inside
she is free
i thought i'd hurt my mother
back when i was a baby a baby saying his prayers
lauraknow this song for always
although the door was open there's nothing left for you now
strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
and jump the hedges first
oh oh sweet thing sweet thing
my my my my my sweet thing
oh sweet thing sweet thing
nevermind now with your heart how much he's all
and i'll keep you happy for the rest of your natural born days
gone astray
good riddance goodbye
there is nothing sadder than
and when her baby comes to call
watch the evil black the sky
to the people that the public can ignore
let's see you take another drag
that will now black the sky
i have no fear of this machine
love that's the right time
do do do do
and turned to each other saying 'i love you baby i love you'
good night
come and call the question
please let me bring back this gifts of mine to the woman
i'm your loan shark of bliss
when you see my face
mother dear the world's gone cold
what will you say
what will you say
empty
he's out there somewhere still
we're all lying natural
i cant help from looking outside for a guarantee
through the yard through the yard of blonde girls
so run run run run run run run
so run run run run run run run
fear we may come
if we had only known in a way
i adore you
you and i you and i you and i
kitty your flesh is so nice
come on and let me give you that o
your flesh is so
like love and destruction to name but two
with such a price on what we say
but i'm so pleased for you
if you want me to
when the time's gone by
but as soon as i touch
will it go with you when you die
i think i'll stay here anyway
when i'm going nowhere going somewhere
when i'm going somewhere going nowhere
like all the best things always should
bring bring bring
nothing's going to seem the way it seems to you
that makes you feel lost when it starts to rain
the sneak up behind jump start your mind for free
isnt it fun
i dont believe it
i i i dont believe it
i dont believe it
more lost that i am found
should i see right through you
leaving us nowhere to go
and love no one at all
but i'd rather be damned than let you go
you've gotta get a good thing when you see it
i cant feel i cant speak i cant think
where were you
turn away
and you say i'm soft
i'm burning
i'm burning
i never let a headline by
there's what you feel
and you know there's nothing that you can do
make it swing
make it swing
spelling it out to me
jealous words wont spoil this dream
i believe in the unknown
and the problem with success is you become what you detest
just as long as it's not dope
you can try as hard as you like
you can try as hard as you like
he knows it's true that they're our there
there's something that we need always coming from the sky
show me how we'll be
that you're going to save me in the end
nothing wrong with you that a little bit of truth wouldnt cure
too much to learn
where the canyons fall below
and the silence fills your head
i'm not there yet
show you things that are brighter darker sharper softer
tounge tied
trust me
i know what i'm doing
trust me
and you know the sun will always shine
the meek shall inherit the earth that's ubsurd
and life is simple when you're sure
welcome back victoria
we'll be no threat when we're deaf dumb and blind
i trust your piano legs are covered up again
and mostly that's okay
but maybe i should thank you
what would you know
give me the gospel according to you
you know what's going on
who am i
where am i
hell bent getting there seeing nothing on the way
with these very hands i'll pull it all apart
but a colour now spells our end
yellow brown
you build your own walls
'cos i dont expect that what you see has anything to do with me
you'll know it as you do it
this time we've split the world once more
empty
from the absurd to the obscene
when i thought i saw the light
but i look at the stars and know their lights already faded
i have to have motion i get release in motion
you can twist and turn and bend it
looking for big answers getting nowhere
so you want to be happy
i hope my feet stay on the ground yeow stop it now
all of the things i say now now
well i dont know about you
so you can look around and see you're not alone
you live your life like it's on rails
but with leaves on the track you tell me
and if so i'd like to know
real real real
do you real
why dont we all go away
a woman on the radio talked about revolution
i saw the decade in when it seemed
there is no other place i want to be
watching the world wake up
that you're wearing lead boots growing tree routes caught in quicksand
we just need someone to blame
so say hello to the desperation girl
there is order
i may believe in luck
everything aches and i cant cure it
stripped oh
everyone needs to know stripped oh
is time too fast for us to grasp something of our own
stand back look out tomorrow
good thing looks are deceiving
the next big thing
i couldnt tell you if it's gonna change the world
round and round the world we go
cash to jim i took it home
my first and last time with you
my luck should be so bad now
a little flat tin case is all you need
i know my clothes seem shabby
in the haze of smoking pleasure
has changed his world my friend
wont be what i dont want to be
ages passed i knew at last
in all good places
through far marches of acres wild
with cement fingers
giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be
will you still be there further on
will you still be there further on
eats but one in every ten
no the mouse police never sleeps
hope everybody's dancing to their own drum this fine morning
so take a minute to remember the part of you
well there has to be some better way
apogee through the night
tight lipped soldier on
i'm gonna get some
pink cotton undies and blue telephones
watching as the frilly panties run
and warms his feet
when the ice that
stand naked with a telescope
under a big sky
you to yours and me to mine
empty
so why are you holding my hand tonight
so why are you holding my hand tonight
the script is blowing out to sea
but the rock and roll star knows his glory is really nothing
but god is laughing up his sleeve
in grey raincoats peek
blown through the eye of the hurricane
at my ever open book
one brown mouse sitting in a cage
and low
if i'm so patently unrewarding
because i'm up to my deaf ears in cold breakfast trays
to assume an air of dignity
orion light your lights
sweet waiters link their arms and patter down the street
for lost virginity a thousand miles away
lives down in some cool cool basement
wrong side of a table for two
on a magic eiderdown
in the paradise steakhouse
i will carve your name with care
repeat first and second stanzas
candle lit table for two has been laid
tell me ``all right''
tell me ``all right''
riding down the queens highway
will pick you up when your last class ends
you can touch it if your hands are clean
overdrafted and still counting
international assistance flowing generous and full
so we'll all sit down and try to play in time
one two three two
and our milk man didnt call
to mend your body or your soul
and across her face dancing the first shadows fly
pussy willow down fur lined avenue
runs from the train hear her typewriter humming
make presents to the government
and it's been this way for five long years
and i'm turning again
wearing gold tipped boots black jacket and tie
well i'm turning again
never feel a thing
but i keep on drinking
hard liner
when the rats are running
better run while you can
take your passport from the drawer
grab your credit cards
an october's day towards evening
to bed on a warm straw coating
to hide you from eyes that mock at your girth
in stiff battle harness chained to the world
in these dark towns folk lie sleeping
and it was hot down there in the crowd
i watched the little black specks running down her leg
chatter in the air like a telegraph line
and let your first smile take me home
all elements agree
sat high upon a throne of finest english leather
my lady be discrete
and the unsung western hero killed an indian or three
oh jesus save me
i was declared the belle of the ball
now there's nothing left in the cupboard
and be glad that i've got me some time
get someone to bring our friends here
to make the time go
scattered all around
you're breaking me down
signals the snowdrops it's time to grow
well i dont think so
walking down leicester square everyday
you may be someone's but you wont be mine
double locked black briefcase on the floor
as the wheels turn biting on the midnight frost
law and order in darkest knightsbridge crime and punishment at play
or should i blame the poor foot soldier
winds howled rains spit down
sunburst images of summers gone
ooze from that concrete honeycomb
it's been a long time
to cry you a song
to cry you a song
counted his friends in burned out spark plugs
now they're too old to rock'nroll and they're too young to die
no you're never too old to rock'nroll if you're too young to die
i can tell you've got a lions heart
a ladder in my stocking you can climb
she says
long time counting hot miles
truck stop runner
no simple message scrawled
but i'm a little thin upon the ground
and i'm the only player
on your hard pressed next of kin
he'll thank you all for that''
you'd better leave your underpants
wrapped in the warmth of you
under wraps i've got you under wraps
paparazzi cant break the man
steal a camel for a day
to colour in the book
now someone's cut the lines
break the story in heavy type
wont let it move me but i cant sit still
she could have been sweet seventeen there again well so could i
she walks out with recognition in her eyes i look away
prance to the politicians' beat
the teeming millions of the future fly
the politicians there who've come to take the air
the candy floss salesman watches ladies in the sand
and leave you in a wimpy bar
well it was up to me
the day glo pirate sinks at last
in the long red red valley they only sing the valley song
but we hate those people down the valley
stream rushing by on a bed of stone
walking on velvet green
where the scent of wild roses turns the milk to cream
that washes out the wild oat seed on velvet green
walking on velvet green
let me dance in your tea cup and you shall swim in mine
and the way he stares feel like locking my door
and they move so smooth without even trying
i'm watching you watching him watching me
whenever i get to feel this way
then to revisit stony grounds
each to his own way i'll go mine
put us in touch with fair winds
point the way to better days we can share with you
oh yeah when jesus came to play
but his hair could have used a comb
see how she moves just like two angels in white innocence
i could have moved among her waterfalls
let her hand trail in the slipstream of the night
played it right down for what it was worth
and taught me how not to play the game
before i'm through i'd like to say my prayers
in your pomp and all your glory you're a poorer man than me
leaves falling red yellow brown all are the same
you're waiting for more but you've already had your share
and not give in and lose the fight
i'm going back to the ones that i know
supporting their far flung illusion the national curse
and those with no homes to go to please dig yourself holes
to share in our infancy
into each other
when i was a young man as all good tales begin
and i'm loyal to the unions
now i'm equal to the best of you
two ulcers and a heart disease
heaven express on my credit card
ghosts of fathers pushing moonbeams round
old crows cawing as the straight crows fly
the complete appliance
now we're up the creek
take a trip
head when he was very small we occasionally cut his fingernails off
like dogs in the midwinter
though the fox and the rabbit are at peace
we're all running on a tightrope wearing slippers in the snow
button out button in
rough wheels meshing
flies by the seat of history
from holding up to the pressures
he's gone to be a generalski
the minstrel in the gallery looked down upon the
still rubbing on the parts they never mention
and threw away his looking glass saw his face in
we're gonna leave your stereo but we'll have your soul for tea
`cos we're all kinds of animals coming here
it's a free trip down to london for a weekend of high life
as the clock ticks away a lifetime
and most of all we pray that you may come back next week
i'll give you a steady push on a six knot simmering
his side
with some friends from the mall
little sparrow on the schoolyard wall
feel a little sensation and know when it's time to join in
she can almost remember my name
it's been a long time coming babe
long time loose amongst foreign hills
well i've tried my best to love you all
to be careful as you go
when the pressure pains are building
have they ever taken time to see
is makin me dead
down by dun ringill
empty
people moving on an ocean groundswell of humanity
take by stealth or take by storm
there's a coast road that winds to heavens door
from beyond the eastern sea shore
the faint reminders stand
the sea birds roll and tumble as they fly
it's really up to her
oh mr president you've been put to the test
somebody wake me i've been sleeping too long
now all i have got is a cheque and a pickup truck
they forgot they told us what this old land was for
just good fun
wont waste my time feeling sorry for him
too much hurry ruins the body
i for one would rather follow softer options
once again we're flying colours
and again we're flying colours
once again we're flying colours
and be there when the dutchman comes
seagull pilots flown from nowhere try and touch one
in a misty misery
come back and tell you the things he's seen
did you hear father
and the blind and lusty lovers
from your trip made for two
on their rare and wondrous deed
of dummies with no mummies or daddies to reject them
to a dead beat from an old greaser
for a second or so we were running scared
my friend cecil is damp and smooth
cecil is a sea lion
the ice cream castles are refrigerated
you flip and you flop under the big white top
the same performance in the same old way
but it's true silver river turning blue
like a million other heroes drinking poor mans beer
looked through the crowds for a glimpse of her hair
singing all day singing `bout nothing
meanwhile back in the year one when you belonged to no one
wont you turn your head once more and make your peace with everyone
you're a rabbit on the run
sometimes i do
to make a broken spirit whole
and you press on god's waiter your last dime
and join together in the passing
you paid the piper and called the tune
and really not an awful lot of fun
but you're wrong steve you see it's only solitaire
in the morning i'll be leaving
with chill mists swirling
the white queen rolls
thin spreading fingers seek
oh i feel sympathy be grateful my son for what you get
who has the right
i'd take you along with me
everyday i see the mornin come on in the same old way
poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
i am the cross to take your nail
sent me out to work for my score
sossity you're a woman
society you're a woman
rubbing his hands with glee he said ``oh mother england
for a better one
windy bus stop click shop window heel
as i did walk by hampstead fair
i dont believe they knew
four and twenty labourers were labouring
suicidal came
in a magic lantern slide
before the candle's dead
throw soft shadows on the water in the night
as the ship moves sadly from the pier
died in the falklands on tv
there's a child and a woman praying for an end to the mystery
where the real mountain men are kings
got nothing but sit in the sun
him resurrected from the grave
in chains of history
you'll be praying till next thursday to
i really dont remember
i could he sitting on the left of you
who's got the cheque on this hot dinner
i go weak kneed at the suggestion of you
to snatch you if you fall
and swing your big bear down
well there is no rehearsal
but the safety curtain falls
and the prompter in his corner is sorry that he came
the first violinist's hands are chilled
i looked out of my window saw a stencil black
no step no step
no step no step
wet pavements thin apartments
are you on routine assignment
feel my steps quick in the headlights
black and viscous bound to cure blue lethargy
prices boom in aberdeen and london town
be happy my way
there's good times to be had
no i say i have the answer
ceilings crash the walls collapse
paint your own deceiving sign
nothing to say
lock on to the ether
pleading sympathy
i'm getting up some steam
i'm raising steam
raising steam
raising steam
do i have to tell you tell you once again
thin diamond glistening glistening around your neck
under red lights on soft nights it all comes back to you
what a day for laughter
while the dimming light brings the end to a night of loving
i looked aside and walked away along the strand
away along the strand
seven druids dance in seven time
ring out ring solstice bells
i've gone back to paris london and even riding on a
and just as you're drowning well the tide goes down
playing to your empty room empty guitar tune no use waiting
push back the stool take that elevator ride
shower runs hot runs cold playing with me
now how about a little light music
and if you dont get enough of that electric love
old meanings move in the drift of time
roots down in the wet clay branches glistening
she works from early am they work her to the bone
we're two different animals we live jungles apart
the long road is a rainbow and the pot of gold lies there
holding on a windward course
walking on cold corners of the maze
as i cut into your life
to take the horns by the bull
next to the bar we hit the samovar she almost slipped right through my fingers
it would probably be hard for me to make it scan
you've seen me in your magazines or maybe on state television
born in the sun kissed flame
of some sweet lady singing in his ear
so take the stage
their hair was a golden brown
and call it the name they choose
so i think i'll go back to the family
and here am i thinking to myself
everything i do is wrong
she's a warm fart at christmas
symphony match seller breath out of time
like to take her but i'm just a baker street muse
six o'clock in the morning
fresh silicon chips to enjoy
how i like him
included in this little boy
behind your shoulder as you feel his eyes to feast you
oozing from his stack and he moves beneath the
but you dont fool me `cos i know what you feel
when you run to me going to turn away
indeed why should they
to carry you to school bring you home again
out in the middle distance still more tragedies are playing
out in the middle distance several tragedies are playing
we'll give the local lads a hiding
i may stay over for a week or two
big riff rough boy wants to be a singer in a band
i'll make the sing song you can make the background noise
yeah help him on the stage now put that microphone in his hand
bending the minutes the hours ever turning on that
black sunday falls one day too soon
connections broken and special branch waiting
milk bottles piling on door steps a crumbling
spend a shilling now
and it's ``all come willing now
and up on the hill there's an old sheep that's dying
bring me my broadsword and clear understanding
i think she was a middle distance runner
dusting off the mandolins and checking on the gear
if not the money
it was a hot night in budapest
yes and her legs went on forever
lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
this game that we animals play is a winner
the monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune
what a laugh
you're missing the point i'm sure does not need making
empty
the old valhalla
empty handed on the cold wind to valhalla
furious did cry
as the party firmly admit a fight
in the midnight echo of the shop that sells cheap
his romeo to her juliet
just a little 3 chord trick embedded in your platform soul
awaiting someone else to pull the chain
the locker rooms are empty but the strobo tickers strobe boats
the lighting mans already improvised a bar
his polaroid is snapping
it's your first night
shoulder of a young horse named george who stole surreptitiously
but she always plays the game
and she'll do it for a song
like spiders down ropes to free fall
as befitting the job that i do
cocked and locked one up the spout
pass the wit of ancient wisdom pass the cup of crimson wonder
lie in august's welcome corn
sister silent to the likes of me
name of the father ringing in her head
sister silent to the likes of me
cried the drunkard in his sleep
where slick tycoons and rich buffoons
through corridors of power on tip toe creep
take their pick
cold rages
dharma each to his own we say
now i can see it all coming again
hand me the bullet i must bite
well you can wind me up yeah you can slow me down
right back to being a child
all looking for strangers to whom they extend welcomes
rent man called twice today
dangling in the lap of luxury
later that same evening she ran
later that same evening
it was later
lobstermen thought they saw
bowler hatted summer briefs
in places least expected
evidence of his dastardly misdeeds
who's on the stage door
to the pagan celebration
and you hear your voice croak as you choke on what you need to say
well dont you sigh dont you cry
life's a long song
but what the hell does he know
at night come out to play
my teddy bear's the only friend i can feel
when i saw her framed in the kitchen door
she was a tall thin girl
if you know just what i mean
walk a mile to drink your water
what they're fighting
steam breaking on his brow
old charlie stole the handle and
the train wont stop going
kangaroos arent usually dangerous for that would never do
this kangaroo's a lunatic and his pouch is very full
took a sad song of one sweet evening
the only change that came was over me
it's not easy singing sad songs
look into the sun
she could be painting the roof
from the other school
in the evening light with a fair ground girl
as the moon slips up and the sun sets down
and some go running before you blink
i work on women if they want me to
you to know
too much of a good thing can make you crazy
and it might not take a lot to be alone just like you
we're all battened down only us here
stuck out in the cloudburst once again
to be mine again
you'll hear my voice is calling
evacuating london town
flag down uptown no sweat
but i must insist it's true
hey man what's the plan what was that you said
i try to socialize but i cant seem to find
the sunlight streaks through the curtain cracks
the deaf composer completes his final score
meeting as the tall ships do passing in the channel
talk in confidential terms share a dark unspoken fear
oh gladys
went down into the local disco
i want no one to touch me
that day he programmed me
going to come out from the night got my second sight
i'm going for the kill i'm going tooth and nail
i'm going for the kill i'm going tooth and nail
dance with the warchild hoorah
as i wake up in a room somewhere
catch the waking edge
well you know i felt her in my dream last night
and behind stand generations of hard hunting men
can you forgive me
all kinds of sadness i've left behind me
black are the nights on summer day sands
pretty girl with neon eyes best man between white thighs
thinking round corners think round corners i say
draw strength from machinery it's all the same
the sun shines golden and i feel like my car
daddy says girl dont stay out so late
your mind says girl you gotta stick around
we'll never find the same thing
empty
empty
empty
i've seen pain cloud your eyes
promise me now
empty
it's a long slow slide
is for the mystery to be named
it's waiting for you
i make myself translucent
they will lay you out in moonlight
oh adrian come out and play
oh adrian come out and play
yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
he's like an unused toy
that we'd give up
try to let it show us the way
the passing steady streams
'cause if you will i will
there is no giving up in love
and if you will i will
there is no giving up in love
nibbles at your veins
screams at the sky
where's my hope
all right
everywhere i go seems like bush is on tv
getting high in america
take the bad with the good
have u heard in america
so dont you worry
sancta maria
ora pro nobis
i'm afraid i am alone
god wont you please hold me release me
show me the meaning of mercy
i reach beyond myself 2 see
oh i am not yet born
i will let you undress me
and there's no
feel your love again
break me
feel your arms again
hearts helplessly fall to the ground
stewardesses like cosmo magazine
there's not much i can say
from the air things look so ridiculous
there's not much i can say
over the hills and ev'rywhere
that jesus christ is born
over the hills and ev'rywhere
i've heard your anguish
which you wish to be free from
with sounds of freedom
to that which you wish to be free from
god is watching us god is watching us
leave the dishes in the sink
you can be henry miler and i'll be anais nin
those words touch me much too deeply
it just makes me want to make you near me always
so be gentle if you please 'cause
long lay the world
o night divine
yet in thy dark streets shineth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
i want the whole thing
i just cant make you understand
it's gotta change
they remind her of her lover how he left her and of times long ago
i want to give you everything as beautiful as you are to me
until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil
he said 'love i leave but only a little try to understand
'cause they were painters and they were painting themselves
she's an ugly girl does it make you want to kill her
pretty girl pretty girl do you hate her
you say he's a jew he'll never wear that funny hat again
they never let poor rudolph
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
rudolph with your nose so bright
'cause the night is long and i hunt for u
i need u for dark reasons dear
empty
with seaweed and sushi and carrot juice and wheat germ
and everybody's got a great body but mine
mistakes are allowed when you're a
half skinned gypsies
we're still growing
i'll dance for you
get on your hands and knees
what turns me on
underneath the disco light
sleep in heavenly peace
love's pure light
attempts to speak
and i swear to god
jewel i dont think
and i'm sorry
i was bound to find out
i used it to mail
your name in vain
sleeping like a baby
sometimes it be that way
and shadow's long fingers
st petersburg is
night has many hands
that could start
see the old lady with a gun
empty
while in the corner king's dream dies
dont go away
and tails i'm lost
i feel your tongue
a strange continent
and barbed wire carnival
and i'm flattered by
i will gather myself around my faith
we'll fight not out of spite
i will get down on my knees and i will pray
and i am never broken
god's eyes
christ is born in bethlehem
jesus our immanuel
born that man no more may die
and u will understand
you'll understand
but the melody's all wrong
2 come between us now
out under the sky
i'm out on the street walking home
walk away
harsh world be damned
harsh world be damned
your words can crush things that are unseen
if we robbed the cynics and took all their food
it's harder yet to disregard it
his heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame
a small town in ohio
for without fear
it's time we made a place
they say you're only half alive
well i wanna see i wanna see
it's not what i can do for anybody
let earth receive her king
repeat the sounding joy
joy to the world
understood the nature of love very well
let my skin feel the night
oh oh be still my little heart
swallow the moon
of all these unbelievers
embrace the faceless the unnamed
kiss the flame
red lips and a screwdriver
the air is thick and velvety
that's all
you listen to the soul
'cause you know
so search all you miners
or someone to keep you
'cause you know
there's something u need 2 hear
u can leave the lights on
just look at me sacredly religiously hungrily
and you shall lead a live uncommon
and we shall lead a life uncommon
to live
again last night said you needed it bad
not our addiction or afflictions of pain
to god and he only knows that drugs
hey little sister i heard you went to mr so and so's
and the sand has turned to stone on the starmaking machine
it didnt make me feel that great as if to demonstrate
i'm trying to listen to the leaves speak
and the mindlessness on tv or in the magazines
that aint the end but it sure aint where i began
a southern man dont need him around anyhow
sweet home alabama
sweet home alabama
running fast through a fairy tale
it feels so sweet like dreaming
your absence is a thorn
softly calling
way out of reach of human eyes
is when that little bird dies
who worship their gapettos
each man for himself
wars have been fought with bibles and tears
i've been petty and unkind
we'll fight with whispers and blades
say that you'll stay
we'll stay
dont breathe
it's leaving time again
office building tall
leaving again
those were the best time
i guess we'll just go
the calls
where are we been
or we run out of road
u and m e spells l o v e 2 me
e mail is cool
pale on the horizon
mend me to your side and never let go
old man winter be our friend
said you were tired of feeling so up tight
in the darkness you cannot always find your way
choose me
another burger another hot dog some fries
another day another dollar another war another tower
some are walking some are talking some are stalking their kill
who will save your soul if you wont save you own
walkin in a winter wonderland
walkin in a winter wonderland
walkin in a winter wonderland
walkin in a winter wonderland
empty
and let's go back to bed
u feel a thrill when your eyes meet
where the girls are naughty and always saying
the girls are soft as nails
i kinda like it in my brand new place
called my momma she was out for a walk
i know you love me
i pick a book up turn the sheets down
you were meant for me
sometimes i want to rip out your throat daddy
well last night i saw you sneak out your window
my youth scattered along the highway
so goodbye alice in wonderland
i thought you had to love me
chorus 2
and the ones that you've been sold
ohh so goodbye alice in wonderland
through your hair
you were a wise man
does your love need a home
whats the matter
it's not your little boys smile
what's the matter
there's a dead end to my left
or am i standing still
i roll the window down
or am i standing still
do you love me
passing me by
are you passing me by
when you're standing in deep water
when you're standing in deep water
not of each other
met her on a friday afternoon
with pictures of randy newman
dont think too hard
take it back
to you it's all voices its a lavender haze
'cause the gypsy on the corner said
come on all you merry men
that god kills children with our very own hands
we are young
let's breathe stardust into our lungs
empty
dont talk so sweet
please dont let me fall in love with you again
my pocketbook and my heart both just got stolen
i look to everybody but me to answer my prayers
and then a man takes my money
oh the end
you're heart will never be the same
i've made love without love being shown
the clouds in the sky are blue
i could not leave you even if i tried
he caught my eye
it hurt me with its second hand
i must have you all to myself
so she called up jack from a few years back
that he could walk by
and if you shake real cute
until tonight
for i have seen the face of love
for i have seen the face of love
and i like me this way
or outrun my skin and just be pure wind
but too cool to care
and your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
you'd teach me of honest things
empty
has been hurt a lot
we ate dinner at your parents' place
'cause everything changes
empty
laudamus te
dona nobis pacem
i say to myself as i smile at the wall let myself fall
can you love me like a father
as long as we laugh out loud
somethin 'bout the season
send it racin through the cool starlight starlight
but i still remember getting caught in the thrill
ohhh make a joyful noise
hangin out with the wrong crowd
angelene is sure that he's the cure
oh angelene you're bein used
empty
there are times when i wake and my knees will tremble and shake
there's nothing like the feel of another shoulder at the wheel
because you love me
because you love me
because you love me
a couple drops and they all start coming down
do you want to be a poet and write
i want you to burn
i aint never lookin back and that's a fact
and i know it sounds trite
i did my best to win the part
bye bye
empty
empty
one little magic kiss
baby dont you wanna get
one thing is true you wont let me down
cover me

to solidify our plans
i'll sell my paintings down by the boardwalk
empty
and if i was a movie star

until i've had enough
you wanna make something of it
run wild like a vine if you only took the time
i love you yes i do
well i'm waiting for you tell me what you wanna do
i tell myself that everything will be just fine
time is meant to play the part
that even god must get the blues
like she's the one to blame
aint your daddy still in des moines
couple modern day moses' searchin for the promised land
boy we're bound to outrun the bad luck that's tailin us
he was stallion who had thrown every rider
leave her somewhere down the line
and wipe away the tears
oh one that's just to rough to ride
the one who left your heart abandoned her
i didnt have to leave you to love you
and what's worse
i loved you from the start
it isnt easy to tell
it isnt easy to tell
it isnt easy to tell
that new england breeze blowin through my hair

billy joe had a bumper sticker on the back of his beatup chevrolet
no tellin what they're talkin about

sometimes you've got to talk into the dark
and remember remember to keep the faith
but when i feel like givin up
and remember remember to keep the faith

if we dont let it go

we're soon to be strangers
if we dont let it go
but the fire is so delightful
all the way home i'll be warm
well the fire is slowly dying
and then we're missing all the things that really matter
or i can stay home on the couch and watch tv
let your heart be light
through the years we all will be together
everything's a memory
but sometimes life gets in the way
a part of me is dying
stand out in the yard and cry all night long
it's all your parents' fault i mean after all you didnt pick em
let me dig a little deeper
let me dig a little deeper
you're just too hard to hold
oh no

no time for tears

'cause i'm not going down
repeat chorus
and just call it done
when it comes to lovin you
i got a heart like a rocket
i just gotta ride it
fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
she sits in the dark
on a wing and a prayer
holding her heart in her hands
so i put myself together
when i look back and say
and a smile who lights the way
five days out of seven slavin
round yon virgin mother and child

in a silver thunderbird

i had my dreams in view when the money ran out and the engine blew
you crash you burn

he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
window and the passin sound of a homeless man
but baby dont wait till its too late

when i was coming unglued

so dream on texas ladies
about how love everlasting
about sunshine and daisies
where it leads you tonight
let me tell you 'bout a lady that i know
and if i laid the whole world at her feet
now let me tell you about the million silent tears
i've known it from the start
but i'll party it out of my mind
till sunday at closing time
the furthest thing from my mind
from friday at five
a season full of rain

john e mccollum doolin

with that some ol high school heart
you can show me your weakness
with you right here by my side
hold on to me when there's no middle ground
tom shapiro mchugh
i gotta think againi'm
felling kinda lonely
i fall a little harder every time i drop
another guy in line on highway 9 in a rush
for the weight of the world rolls off my shoulders
i get up and battle the day
you are my best friend
empty
you walked right up to me and smiled tenderly
how was i to know
how could i have seen
how was i to know
you never will forget
if you give me a chance
move heaven and earth if you were my girl
i can love you
move heaven and earth if you were my girl
give me the chace i'll find the pieces
when you're right here with me
a broken heart takes time to heal
you wont even know he's gone
as you softly breathe lyin here with me
i couldnt dream a love better than this
old mister sandman i'll resist
i couldnt dream
if it were left up to me i would never let go
in perfect time you will always be mine
i dont want this song to end
but i love the way you love me
but i love the way you love me
i love the way you love me
when i pick up my old guitar
when i go by our old house
a little too much a little too often
paper or plastic cant you see man i dont really care
i remember where you got that sweatshirt you're wearin
i guess we're overdue
i'll never break your heart
i swear
i'll be there
i'll be there
if you've got faith
now there's nothing like a real good friend
if you've got love you can move a mountain
john calvert sain
country aint what i sing it's what i am
he said work hard and let the good lord do the rest
this hat aint something i wear for style
somedays i'm in the saddle
somedays i hold on for dear life
just like a rodeo
play it hot 'cause i came in here to dance
leave 'em at the door
when the boss man gets you down
give that country girl a whirl
allen shamblin seskin
sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
picked myself up and came back for more
sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
packed an old cane pole
always believe in the good lord's way
full of girls and teenage dreams
once you get a line on love
and i promise to be good this time
but her heart breaks as her little cowboy cries
as his cowboy cries
an when it stops it's out of my hands
no matter if there's mountains you cant move
i'm yours long as i live
'til the lord says it's time to go with him
who dared to climb
it's a brand new day
that's just the love working
love working on you
jb rudd vipperman
sure is making good off my mistakes
the way he's smiling i can tell he knows
johnny macrae clark
and that old weekly paycheck
of nickels and dimes and love
and when i get to thinking times are tough
got three little kids and no one to help
every now and then late at night
she's gonna be ok gonna find a way
you sell a war then we sell the truth
i havent seen that for a while
you wouldnt like the way our conversation
oh how she shines
shines a light on you
all my blue collar blues away
we can get there early
too loose with a two step
still she's always telling me
when i look at the sky
when i think it's out of reach
she's steady as a rock
it's still gonna be alright
stacked against the bills
it's still gonna be alright
fallin for you was so slow and steady
you're mine
where i saw something i just had to have
she's an eight she's a nine she's a ten i know
yeah i never seen anyone lookin so fine
the way we met that day
an i'm about to bid my heart good bye
now there's a little gal i know
and i've been up a creek
she knows how to
just south of tupelo
and walked away without a scratch
i could just shake it off
this one's gonna leave a mark
with a heart of stone and i couldnt feel
i know deep down in my heart
is to bring you happiness
where his true talents lie
my that dog is restless
that's all my body's got a mind to do
and nights get longer all the time
if you wanna know the truth
now that my baby aint around
rolling down a two lane road
roll the dice when i need a seven
i wanna be a red corvette
headin down to key biscayne
i'm so afraid
a vision of fire
in the night
you're possessing me
and powerless begin to explore you
you better hope your memory fails you
they send you back and disorientate you
twisting the strangle grip
drawn out of anger
blade of destruction
it's the way you stand
you take the lead
you rule the roost
it's been a lifetime since i found someone
you cant hide away to ease my passion
tell the world how much we living for
lies forming
empty
they prey on grief
but there's no fear
no sign of life woodpecker on his space
keep the world with love and sin
but i'll go down fighting
you wont make me
automatic sniper
you wont take me
you wont break me
hands of justice
blood stained hands
blood stained hands
turn blind eyes
for life
and while such predators
it's sending me
bloodstone bloodstone
for the world to see
pull the plug
empty
extricate me
condescending words are said
empty
drip fed
so much for the golden future i cant even start
breaking the law breaking the law
fast devastating and desolisating the curse
pounding the world like a battering ram
look out i'm blastin through the lines alive and kickin
radio active i'm shootin through the atmosphere
blinding all in sight
i smack a bottle open
my skin begins to tingle
i cant stop talkin about
with this beat of a heavy kind
rock hard ride free all your life
goes crazy to the beat of rock'nroll
we're gonna lose control
imitation sapphire shine
wrong side of the law
rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
but they improved and i'd have thought that you could
i cant go on
dead or alive there's nothing
i never hear society
cause when they see me coming
you would it a jungle to me it's a kingdom
your present nobody but sadness and suffering
till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
spin you round in the torture before the dread
the world is defiled in disgrace
the world is a manacled place
black sun rising time is running out
he roams the starways
wont you help them pray
cant you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight
diamond visions softly breathing fire
when the enemy comes he will never be heard
ruling the earth
empty
you're gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop
and if you wanna keep going just shout out for more
and together we will take on all the world
leave me be
why dont you get out of my life
dont go in the mornin
dont go in the mornin
everyone was in peace of mind
floating way up high
one or two crack up and start to cry
rape and pillage squander all and rob
cling to my body
gut wrenching frenzy
you're well equipped to take it all
i'm made of metal
i take a pride in probing all your secret moves
every now and then he'll take a look around
a lonely grave and soon forgot
i saw the evening star rise up
then something helped me penetrate the haze
i'm home once more much better for
we turn and face each other
come on and live my fantasies
you give me evil fantasies
it must to heaven stranding through the door
who is distance where is the love
it's running myself nothing into world
losing all control
fever you fill me with desire
never dreamed of this
that slices every curve in sight
freewheel burning
our road is free
are poised to strike us down
before the grand rebirth
waiting for the sign
help me no question of pride
to greet death friends extinction is a must
looking for meat
capped everywhere
on which my name
empty
dont mess with me i'm danger
sharp as steel
and nothing stands before me
forever i'll remain
and find later on that your say aint allowed
now wherever you turn wherever you go
oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
love to writhe and sweat
rule with an iron hand
standing on trial scrutinize me
breathing exhaust as we distort
ever reach the ground again
piercing through my brain
stab bawl punch crawl
when the power chords come crashing down go
and it electrifies
ten thousand lights come blazing down
and it electrifies
you get me up then we both get down
'cause i'm gonna love ya' to death
why dont you save your breath
why dont you save your breath
to ram it down ram it down
screaming with power in the air
thousand of cars and a million guitars
and the night is so black that the darkness cooks
never knowing when he'll appear
fools self destruct cannot take that crown
hell bent hell bent for leather
the hell patrol
neutralize you
soul stealers
all alone no one care
i cant shake you off you're a wolf on the prowl
i wanna go some place where i can scream and shout
somehow i feel that tonight is the right night
i wanna go i wanna go i wanna go hot rockin
do as i feel as i say
i never look back
it's something in my blood
brutality in arms doth seek to destroy
now we are taken unto the island of domination
now we are taken unto the island of domination
crouching in the coner
that never ever learned to read and write so well
go go go johnny go
now let's see what you're made of
predit hater
iron claws and fangs of steel
rib cage break
so i'm never ever gonna lose
i got a contract on you
i kept the population down if you know what i mean
to know the shadow begin to grow much grow
till what day not so very far from now
all alone i walk through fire
with a burning heart
wrightings on the wall
living after midnight rockin to the dawn
my body's coming
you drive me crazy with that walk
i cant take it when you touch me
into your room where in deep sleep
love bites you invites you
i will return to trap and devour
do you remember well
to see you again
have my sacrifice
you're going to burn in hell
i can hear you whisper
you are going to blister
we've got to make love tonight
i know you feel the flame
so i string you up to keep you hanging around
as we spiral down into oblivion
corrosion eating us
can save us
in cathedral spires
offers no sanctuary
time that we retire
oh we're so tired
i reached the dressing table kicked away the door
if you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
let me hear you roar
do you want it
turn it up
come and get it
no firing squad will make me
cut us watch us bleed
not while i'm living
no prison cell contains me
no surrender
they're seriously mistaken
oh ok i'll tell him
electric chair
shake with fear
shake with fear
take it like a man
death row
empty
you've lost your head sir
empty
oh let me tell you dont you worry
we're heading your way like dynamite
yeah delivering the goods
you do gotta learn your lesson
we're heading your way like dynamite
from desert plains i bring you love
i see you stand
light my fire
you never let me go
fit to snap my soul
you cut my flesh
scratched and bruised so abused
it's just that the moon is full
now i see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
and if you're offering me diamonds and rust i've already paid
i need a steel blue heart walkin down the street
i'm behind the wheel throttle open wide
wo oh love zone
wo oh love zone
we've taken too much for granted
in secrecy this infection
in time they'd like to discover
heat is rising
no one survives
about to explode
imminent collision
from the concrete jungle
took the sound across the seas the people stood in awe
monster monster of rock
monster monster of rock
life is so very strange
in the last rays of the setting sun
call me and i'll wait till the summer
oh cant you see my heart is broken in two
beware the beast in black
stalking his victim
their last rites echo on the wind
as it now descend the stairs
go for it today
go for it today
to have us some fun with the boys
let me hear the battle cry
courage and victory
one shot at glory
solo kk glenn both
takin good care of me
so much to forgive and forget
shut me out
just for one more chance baby
where are you now
where are you now
where are you now
do what you wanna do
you've got me tied up dog upon a leash
closing in with vengeance soaring high
he is the painkiller
with mankind ressurrected
you're just mister dull
every day you scream at me
we dont need no
we dont need no
no no no
you think you've got it all sewn up
so keep your hands off
do you think you can relate
private property
it aint there
oh oh
empty
is pain better than the grave
when you least expect me
you'll soon shake with fear
where the air's cold and damp
the figures primed and ready
the challengers await
as the bell ceases its chime
impassive and alone
you're gettin new life to me
you really got what it takes
your cant retreat i spy like no other
we move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
i'm your turbo lover
go back see what you're doin
rushin around
tyrant every man shall fall
chained and shackled we are bound
tyrant every man shall fall
tyrant conqueror of all
united we never get fall

wild nights
my heart will no longer race

i'm lookin at the bottle
i'm on top as long as the music's loud
if you think i'll sit around while you chip away my brain
hey i'm a big smash i'm goin for infinity yeah
if you think i'll sit around as the world goes by
listen i aint foolin and you'd better think again
girl dont you know it's all i can do
to tell you how i feel about you
at least i've been close enough i could taste
a chance
and i'd a went skinny dipping with jenny carson that time she dared me to
but i wouldnt
and if i'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
there's no matchbook in his pocket with a number and a name
'cause a woman knows when there's another woman
the special way you held me is the way you hold me still
my grandpa and my grandma
just like you and me
and i'll keep my every promise to you with this band of gold
aint tha't love
but in your arms i feel like i am
that's all i need to know
she took me to heaven oh my lord what a ride
i was hellbound on my way down then i found what i need
when ole bobby does elvis
by the end of the week
but we dont let that
walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
so tonight i hope that i will do just fine
and in the morning i'm leaving making my way back to cleveland
so tonight i hope that i will do just fine
i'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
i'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
the clock ticks and the cattle graze
back where i come from
where i'll be when it's said and done
that's where i come from
daddy in his good hat mama in her sunday dress
and my sins went for many were washed away and gone
down with the old man up with the new
i've had it up to here with this rat race
in this palm tree paradise
where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star
do you know just where you take me
anywhere i ever go
whether you're right by my side
because of your love
so many thoughts to sit and ponder
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
so i just
sit right here have another beer in mexico
sometimes i still cant quite believe she's holdin me cause
that someone to love like this
i could give someone such devotion
she's got it all
eleven to seven
a big ol pile of shift work
we partied
talking about a bunch of shift work
hate on the road to no where fast till the grace of god got in the way then he saw the light n
empty
same ol empty sheets
cant somebody take me home
cant somebody take me
i dont wanna go out tonight
somebody's callin my little darlin darlin tonight
well she used to always be there whenever i would call
i ought to be a crawlin back to make things right
bump on a golden log
well i'm livin high on someone else's hog
gotta long black cadillac limousine
sipping on some foxy's firewater rum
sipping on some foxy's firewater rum
or kickin back with ivan
the only time i feel alive is
the only time i feel alive is
all systems on overload
with good intent
and it starts all over again
steamy windows
and cant help but smile
temperature says 93
cheap shades and a tattoo
when you know what i'm talkin 'bout
sweet summertime
she'll be there waiting
boys the next round's on me
she'll be there waiting
they started talkin about steps you take
like the kids at home and a lovin wife
i couldnt believe what i heard
that's why i'm here
yeah i've been there
the bigger the fool the harder the fall
the more bitter the end
i said a woman to keep
so i pulled up
momma's all worried when you get home late
like old friends
the way she adored that string of pearls
an drink it up
but in my mind there's something more
happiness is a destination that's hard to find
and i'll get there leanin on some friends i know
he could tell by the moon when the fish would bite
there'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
and i live by those words 'cause grandpa told me so
i still believe
when enough is enough
sixth gear with nowhere to steer
last night i think i put that homefire out
yeah that woman left me high
and tears to cry
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand by me
and smile right on when times got lean
toes in the sand couldnt get much hotter
done almost everything a boy can do
i've done some livin yeah i've had fun
just the windthe rocks the waves and you and me
our reflection in the window of that store
still feel as empty as our bed
its somethin i cant do
i cant go there
like you got no mind all
or somebody pullin on a puppet string
i finally found somebody
a blanket a girl some raspberry wine
and i go back to watchin summer fade to fall
and the sixteen summers i shared with him
to the loss of a real good friend
then she smiled at me
well the honeymoon ended and life began
make me laugh
no one can make me cry
well i opened my heart and i let you in
i know that what i have to do
i know that what i have to do
i'm sittin here alone
all i want right now is to forget
back when our love was strong and real
and i remember tears in your eyes
and the first thing she did
oh lord i think i want my rib back
she's never satisfied although i try to do the best that i can
if our love dont stand the test of time
deep in your heart is where i'm bound
and you'll be the only one
honey i'd love to change your name
aint nothin else about you i'd ever want to change
honey i'd love to change your name
just trying to be a rebel
from a small town from a small town
but i knew i'd come back some day
when the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell now i know about drinkin so i know one
being drunk's a lot like lovin you
from the looks of things it looks like
are these your shoes that i have on
it couldnt get more out of sight
thought i'd picture every vision that a man could dream about
what's an angel like you doin in my wildest dreams
what's an angel like you doin in my wildest dreams
i wonder just how many times a broken heart can mend
has leaving down to an art
i said lord have a little bit of pity on my poor old heart
is different now and dead
she wears a red sox cap
to hide her baby dreads
saw a man in the movies that didnt have a heart
i couldnt see your leavin comin
i'd give anything just to be the tin man
set out for a brand new start
too much sun burned on their face
he's finally found his piece of serenity
a stone's throw from st croix
has found her wings and it's time to fly
somewhere up above
lettin go of the ones you love
it aint easy
she played third base on a softball team
were guna have to grow up
lay on our backs
repeat chorus
we were going we didnt really care we had all we ever wanted in that keg in the closet
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor left over from the night before where
her key lime pie
with my my my my key lime pie
and my my my my key lime pie
i said i dont know just what it is you want from me
i got down on my knees right there and promised her i'd change
she said show me show me
life is good the grass is green
them old blues are long gone
life is good the grass is green
life is good
charlie runs the produce shack
'cause that's where i was born to be
and every six string wannabe
i pray for every wannabe
about the tour he did and the deal he got
saw him workin the counter at walgreens
i'd be wastin away on the dock of the bay
watchin the tide roll in
my friends all grew up they settled down
i've had a good time it's true
a hillbilly rock star out of control
she's got that needin somebody wantin somebody who
and it's so hard to cover up
that love can still be found
well i've been lonesome
and lock the world outside the door
put on some music
and love me tonight
if i could be somewhere else i'd tell you where i'd be
talkin to himself about his raw deal
he said what i wouldnt give just to live those songs again
i believe there's magic here in these sails
it's lazy days with hemingway
'cause i believe there's magic in those beachside dives
i believe there is magic here
suited perfectly
thank the stars above
ever make it last
laugh as your stories ramble on
always sure until i doubt
cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
better as a memory than as your man
from my observations as a fly on the wall
so she belted it
and in the aftermath that small time town was hers
man that could be us
she said
she said
i'm goin to california
five miles away it's almost time for bed
that she's already spent
the music loud the drinks are mostly water
so her kids can a perfect smile someday
sometimes they're in a bottle
they hide out in pictures
then try to run away
when i'm not chasing demons
when i'm not chasing demons
just like that you're six years old and you're taking naps and you
best start putting first things first
of fifty years is there in bed
dont blink
you didnt think that i would remember
how i prayed it wouldnt end
one bottle of wine and two dixie cups
yeah we fell in love
empty
is now dependent dirty and promises
someone really there to love and care and share
that look on our face says all you need to know
we spend it all on you and me
every road we take darlin love takes
just married written on a blue chevrolet
still holdin hands like they were sixteen
dont that make you want to fall in love
we were loved and we were scared
you're a sunday school teacher
for the first
for the first time
said i used to be wall street but this is much finer
to the irs a long haul trucker
then a steel horse harley came roarin on past
empty
still this feels like home
sailing out on the sea
a poor boy found heaven
and hillbilly heaven
somewhere in hazzard
and a heartache in hazzard
and an angel is crying
4 quarters win or lose
never be as young as i was then
another season of my life is done
and i couldnt take it lightly
times rushin by me like the wind
just a fool tryin to play it cool hopin she'd let me cross the line
but i told them that i'd thought it through
never wanted nothin more
no problems
babe lets get packedtank tops and flip flops if u got them
and with all they're going through
and they do what they can
sittin in the sand
to the way that i see it when i sit in that old blue chair
to the way that i see it when i sit in
knew i could never hold that girl
dont know how i'm goin to find her
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
but we arent learnin
its the same thing night all night
we well honey i pretended
one step up and two steps back
there aint no time like the present day sail lets cruise all the way down a1a put the top
as long as we're outta here baby lets get outta here
'cause we're goin all the way to paris tennessee
he can pick the wildwood flower
you can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
i'm the number one fan

say good bye and dont look back
you never felt this before it's all brand new to me never known anyone scare me
not a day goes by that i dont tell her
i always tell her i love her
well i always tell her i love her
it's not her fault
and i cant stand to think of her home all alone
so i really dont mind if she paints the town red
plowin these fields in the hot summer sun
she likes the way it's pullin while we're tillin up the land
she thinks my tractor's sexy
she thinks my tractor's
she thinks my tractor's sexy
but she's still in the sun and this laid back life
had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
so it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
she said the girl i was with the business degree probally wouldnt recognize me
anymore there aint nothin i swear man that
dancing backwards in high heels
so much for ditchin this town and hangin out on the coast
oh yeahhe loves that little girl
there goes my life
baby good bye
she taught me how and showed me why
but my heart wont ever be the same
she followed me back to the city
she taught me how and showed me why
temptation waits
like the back of my hand
right was wrong
and this old highway seems to understand
there's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that i can do
yes i drive on and on and on
like a busy ol bee savin up it's honey
makin my wishes i'm hopin they're countin for love's sake
i hire me an airplane have it paint your name up in the sky above
i want you to know
in the dark of night
i'm still holdin you
in the dark of night
when i think about leaving i think about me
i never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad how he walked out on her
how we build this love we share on faith and trust honest way we talk tender way we touch
she'll call me honey when she needs a helpin hand
when she calls me baby i just reach for the light
cause when the sun goes down we'll be groovin
when the sun goes downwe'll be feeling alright
i feel you everywhere i go
an sometimes i wonder
but death tore the pages all away
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
but at the end of the day i go home alone
play football in the backyard
maybe i'll have a wife and kids
and said kid are you ready for the wild ride
out on the highway i saw my mind
when i felt something tugging what was left of my sleeve
we just might break it on the wild ride wild ride
it was over from the start you completely stole my heart
but you had me from hello
you had me from hello
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
when i'm a fugitive ready to run all wild eyed and crazy
sometimes love dont work out

maybe i'll put a hole in your head
me and my fucking gun
something inside of me
with all your lies bumped up around you
i never was a part of you
i still recall
you make this all go away
back then
it seems like such a shame
i just want something
but now i've found the velvet sun
and let me beat it but you know
i dont mind we're on top
and we dont mean to satisfy tonight
back in baby's arms
'til he took it away
baby get something
outside of society
baby baby baby

and measure for measure
jackson pollock was a nigger
outside of society
when i'm all alone at night
before it tears me apart
object of my desrire
that bring out the lust in me
laying everybody low with a love song that he made
and i forget i forget the movie song
i used to have a scene with him
all i do is keep the beat the bad company
he says something like you and me babe how about it
it's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
but i dont really mind that it's starting to get to me
so scared of what they'll find
i've never really known anybody to die before
every now and then
this town is our town
discarded scars like worn out cars
and be one of us
this town is our town
to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you
to the centre of the city in the night waiting for you
i know i'll make it home
i said i want it but i never alone
oh girl he'll help you understand
from the back of the restaurant
oh no oh no no no
never thought i'd let a rumour ruin my moonlight
never thought i'd let a rumour ruin my moonlight
who looked like a girlfriend
i've carried it well
this troublesome mind
i carry it well
top a tower and sleep walk
let his resonance light my way
but they cant do it you know
like a hollow point headed for your dome
dat nigga daz
now what would you do
there's no escape give me the papes and the tape case
do you wanna rap scrap or blast to that nigga daz
who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
and if i was in your shoes would i survive
can you feel yourself in the room with everlast
what would you do what would you do
what would you do what would you do
what would you do
in the night while i try
all know my name
with your new suit and your black tie
and i will not lie when i say i aint cold no more
as i stood there watching the train go by
in the water seemed to shine
live it down baby dont talk that much
i dont need political process
i still hear the children playing
heaven knows everything
but tonight this engine's failing
a re tranquilized
my life is oblivious to youand
i am nothing to you
but she's an angel for sure
and then he says to me
but that remains to be seen
without her it's not the same
you sit there in your heartache
can we climb this mountain
when you were young
you sit there in your heartache
talks like a gentleman
they hug in silence
take me to the place where the white boys dance
you're talking crazy
and the friendships from the whiskey to the keys
and i just cant hide things that i know
you're missing what i'm trying to say
who let you go who let you go
i stay at home with my disease
beside the green apple sea
gonna get me a little oblivion
try to keep myself away from me
gotta gotta be down
and my stomach is sick
but it's just the price i pay
it was only a kiss it was only a kiss
now let me go

but it wasnt love oh no
oh and here comes the summer

one wolf grown to a dozen and here i was alone

this is rotten to the core
in the dungeon blood is everywhere
surely be put to death
but they did not turn her loose
is someone else beside her
i'm caught within a dream
at the end of this starless nightmare
the doctor is the devil
now everything turns to darkness
is fading slowly
i dont want to but i have toi have to know who you are
or could it be that we've kept him safe from you
live this life the best you can and leave the rest to us
oh you meaningless little god and so i choose death over you
so they took his bones and skin to the morgue in the west wing
to the morgue we must all go to the morgue
spiders here spiders everywhere
had become the home of spiders instead
i think that i will call it
now you decide which ones are trick or treat
you blindfolded creep
the only light inside this graveyard
i'm dragging him back back to the tomb
nobody found a trace of missy
they would blame it all on me
the boy has lost his mind
and i must leave for the old house
they seem to play an evil game
cried out loud now let me have it
father malone holy lord almighty father
it is he who commands you
i kind of like thati must go

i've gone the ways they said that i should go
should i should i
so many times when i was gone
once i look back on what i've done

where did you go
reality is lost and found
when love has caught you with a smile
it's no surprise they dont like my type of style
just somehow
when you're down
it's her blood
compromising love
nothing's clear when you're near
hey man what have you done
stealer take all you can
there are those lonely times and then there's happiness
something has come to life between us too
's pretty hard at times
just a bit time
thriving on what others do
once you have left your hole
and still you feeling down
cant get enough
approaching me so gentle my senses all aware
such grace so rare to find
i never will forget

i used to follow you
i've come to realize
ladybugs tickleling my face
open land everlasting green
inhaling the silence of our nature's room
but in my dreams there is a place where the sun last always
we'll all be free someday
now we have another chance
broken hearts will mend again
and my hopes and dreams nowhere to be found
so if you can lift your hands
empty
staring at the sky
ooh just to know where we
empty
for the rich and poor

taking orders and obey

cant throw a stone

why cant you see someday you will know

empty
but nothing i could give
lot of times been a fool

madness in disguise i feel it
on the surface i can see
clear the air

i travel high with closed eyes
leaving all behind

baseball bats i got somethin for that
ooh baby you want me
built denim spiked wrists and
so let's part baby
ooh baby you want me
who bake on the beaches
and grease in my barnyard
and you're aching to move
splitting the shit with me half and half
making a circle to play a game
over the wall
solo existe la alegriaes
si pueden verlos bailando mis hermanos
yet this hostility felt between you and me stops
thanks to julie james for submitting the lyrics
but it's all right yes it's all right
who says i have to pay i didnt want this anyway
cold inside anesthetized 'cause life has got me paralyzed
i'm paralyzed
i didnt wanna have to get away
lips are waiting pain will cease
we have our ways
a little bit
a little bit of ecstasy
do do do do do yeah
tell me that you want me
i'll be your dream you be my fantasy

ooh yeah right here right now
jacob walked a limp to remind him
mark me with ash until i'm clean again
la mer
ces oiseaux blancs

wicked queen night machine she'll make you walk through fire

there aint nobody gonna tell him what to do
well he wants it bad but he wants no charity
you put my back against the wall
so baby you can kiss my heart bye bye
no i'm not gonna die cross my heart and hope to cry
everybody thinks there's always a reason
friends sing to clear your mind
you kiss the hand of the man for all seasons
when you're in the room you're home too soon
see you see you feel you in your dreams tonight dreams tonight
with the only one who can make me cry
beckoned on by the mirage of an oasis
never you mind
she wears satin
a perfume by lanvin
milky lotions scented creams
i'm yours 'til i die
crossing the seas looking for that someone
love it dont leave it dont leave it behind
love is an innocent innocent journey

geboren um zu verlieren
und jetzt verliere ich dich
just enough to catch my breath
you can break me down if you want to break me down
you can break me down if you want to break me down
i will lay me down
your time has come to shine all their dreams are on their way
vor dem winter sind sie auf ihre reise gegangen
deswegen bleibt sie an seiner seite
er auf dem boden
er wird nicht aufgeben
as long as we're together boy
aint no one luckier than you and i
as long as we're together boy
i know he needs me
it's another kind of trouble trying to hang on to who you are
we're all at the mercy of the will of love
repeat chorus
and i swear the truth
that gets better and better and better
that keeps making this better and better and better
something i can feel deep down
thought by now she'd have a man
something's gotta give me butterflies
she's had all that she can take
she thought by now she'd have a man
all these tears wont be here
soon as the sea turns into sand
soon as the sea turns into sand
soon oh yea
to make a big mistake now i've run away
i wanna love outside the lines
ich hab die angst in mir verloren
mit einem koffer auf den boden
die nacht ist die hrteste zeit
wenn die zweifel in deinem kopf sind
cause i've got no choice
cause suddenly you find your
i just need time to breathe
empty
she changes guys with the mood of the day
no way your heart can lose
sure thing
sure thing
there is a white flag rising
empty
and isnt it surprising
crossing over the line for your love
all i've got to do
what you're not saying
ready to hear
c'mon and talk to me
well i can just imagine ten thousand angels cried
god turned his head away
as they stood by
and i started reliving the past
a face on a crowded street
you can find someone
but the heart never forgets
life resembles one big compromise
when the angels look at youwhat will you say
dont ever lose that light in your eyes
and the rest is history
when you pressed your hand to mine
we'll fill up the pages
there for the world to see
there was no doubt
before we spoke a word
the record will show
romance for the ages
empty
just say we stand a chance
cause i can see
wenn ich ohne dich leben msste
wie knnte ich ohne dich atmen knnen
wenn du mich jemals verlassen wrdest
wie sollte ich ohne dich leben baby
how do i live without you
and i baby i dont know what i would do
please tell me baby how do i go on
how do i how do i oh how do i live
just when i thought it was safe to come in
cant you imagine how i'm feeling now
you feel the way you do
for all that i have seen it's easier for me
i believe in you
for all that i have
the reason that i need
i dont need noone to prove your love
oh i believe
or touch a leaf
here in the dark in these lonely hours
here in the dark in these lonely hours
i dare you to need me
oh but some things are worth a try
tell me i'm the one who deserves you
each time i see you again
i fall to peices
life gets boring in a hurry
i'm addicted to the fast life
bad for jumpin off the edge
there are things about tomorrow
and the ending of the rainbow
ich habe immer etwas gebraucht
der mich hlt
oh ja ich will
like breath like rain
and it's so amazing
i need you
i want to with you
i'd run just like that
every long night i live through
surely there must be something wrong
they're just like you and me
him on the ground
they wont give up
den nchsten tag ist es kalt
deine lieblichen gedanken
right down santa claus lane
for boys and girls again
that makes everything right
'cause santa claus comes tonight
i want you to see all that i see
by the lines on my face
just close your eyes
and suddenly i know
we cant stop what we have begun
empty
pretending that you came
ever since you've been gone
i'll find somebody who'll love your memories away some way
one of these days one of these days
to be so confused
every breath
where you have to choose
break down
every time that i'm with you ah
ya baby you're the right kind of wrong
all the pleasure is worth all the pain
i know all about
lovin you yeah isnt really something i should do
there's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
because i can
i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
see how far i can go
ich werde an dich denken und lcheln
bitte erinnere dich
wir haben ein leben und die zeit zurckgelassen
wir sind so schnell und frei gerannt
i wont forget so dont forget
and it's sad to walk away
i was there for you
we took each day and made it shine
a ferry tale princess
and gracefully i'll learn
my pretty thing
what lived inside of you still shines
i probably wouldnt be this way
mama says that i just shouldnt speak to you
oh you left so fast
guess i'll have to see
i only wanted to be some kind of friend
you say you want a leader
only want to see you
and if you wanna join in a little harmony
give you a song that you can sing
it'll put a little shuffle in your step
call me at night
cant take much more
so you wont forget that you are mine
that only you should know
i want to reveal my secrets
everytime that i'm where you are
might be a mistake
loving you isnt really something i should do
konw all about
but baby you're the right kind of wrong
this feelin here inside
my destination is right where i am
on the river of love
you dont have to try and save me
yeah i'm crazy for the one who wants to rock me
headlines to spare in our pockets in our pockets
rumor bout a revolution
rumor bout a revolution
tell me will i ever be the one
looking for light on rainy days
what do i gotta do
what is it like on a peaceful day
i want to shed my skin if i feel the urge to fly
save myself i dont want to save myself
no walls will bind around us
our love will shine forever
that you gave to me
as when you were here
as when you gave it dear
that proved you cared
it's all over now
oh oh love kiss me one time
then when i tell some heart
i'll manage somehow
dont worry 'bout me
one heart is free
you feel so ordinary
remember you are not alone
from a king to a comman man
empty
knew every line by heart
once the feelings starts to fade to blue
i remember our faded love
and i remember our faded love
my sister held my hand when that bad boy broke my heart
aint it funny how some things never change
here i stand on roots that deep
jetzt ist mein traum neben mir
all die zeit gab es nicht viel an das man glauben konnte
oder was ich durchgemacht habe
fhlt sich wie zu hause an
in your arms i know where i belong
i searched this world
in your eyes i know what i can be
but it feels like home
break break we're allowed to have our moments
i dont want to fight anymore
i dont want to fight
i hurt i hurt i hurt so good inside i swear i could die
i see i see i see for the first time
mein zuhause mein ssses zuhause
through the night with the light from above
god bless america
a good friend and a glass of wine
when i'm tired and i'm fried it gets me right back on my feet
every girl needs a good friend and a glass of wine
i wanna know first hand
you try not to show
and it's a good lookin man
strong as a woman can
just when i think i've got you figured out
under your skin i'm playing in your head
empty
if i could only stretch my arms around you
heal the wars i remember
empty
i dont know what comes over me
well i've been in love and lost
love must be tellin me somethin
givin me some kind of sign
i'd dont what i'm gonna do
such a beautiful dream
that's what's the matter with me
oh lord
when he calls me sweet ba'a'aby
i've got the lovesick blues
freedom's just another word
through all kinds of weather through everything we done
but it aint free
cause i love longer and wider
deeper and higher
i've been loved
my baby is a full grown man
my baby is a southbound train
what so proudly we hailed
oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave
i'm bound there's no way out
it's like a dream you cant wake up from
couple of lookers new best friends
that slim jim bag boy hadnt a prayer
devils handy work
yeah yeah yeah yeah
nothin 'bout love is less than confusin
that big italian tower
oh nothin 'bout love makes sense
same old dance same old tune
i cant believe i used to believe
there was nothin new under the moon 'til you
glad you finally said something
for me it aint much that fun
but it's getting awfully hard to believe
i've never been sure
dont be afraid to fall
we're on the side of angels after all
on the side of angels
the close and distant calls
after all the try agains
dont be afraid to fall
i dont mind giving you a little room to breathe
one day too long
to be soothed by you
some say love it is a river
it's the dream afraid of waking
just remember in the winter
i had nightmares i was so scared
it feels so real
but i believe that you've got a hero's face
right here in your arms is safest place
empty
it was an angel in the night
like they did long ago
it's twisted and tangled and hard to define
but it keeps getting better the longer you're here
that's the way you can start by
time to make my body rock
you opened up my world to
the plot thickens time's tick'n
a little to the right
in the middle of the night
its time you let me in
back to where we thought it was before
just hold me baby
so lets get down to it baby
we're not strangers anymore
but the memories keep lingering on
we're together forever always
aint we
sayonara adios
just a little heartbreak
yeah they take it so casually
ever since i was a little child
flying wild and free
look's like everything
my darling
lonely rivers flow
my darling
empty
empty
that's the life i love the best
to make love
you can change direction
your love is undeniable
it's undeniable
you got what he wants
let him long to be your slave
girl your gonna see how much he really loves you
i face the day and pray to god i wont make the same mistakes
the pain is self inflicted
i have enough hurt of my own to he
no one's ever gonna stop fun will have
let them stop and stare they must think we care
we can do it if we wanna gonna do
soon you'll wake me and you'll
someday i may love again but
you need to find a place to mend
to build you up and be your friend
repeat chorus 2x
what's wrong with me
with all your heart and soul it's so hard to let it go
he'll do the same to someone else it aint about you
the kind you see from airplanes baby that's the deal that's the deal
everybody's got a weakness some kind of kryptonite
maybe it's an old love song playing up louad on the radio
but what dont break me will make me strong
just dont waste one more minute of mine
i'd be lying sayin i aint afraid
she was always perfect
to drown out all the pain
if they only knew all the lies she's told them
simple really isnt it
and i need not reply
is this god's experiment
sometimes in my darkest thoughts
in which we are given paradise
oh yesterday came suddenly
i said i must've said something wrong
i believe
you are turning all the tide under me
you are my strongest link
you are
you give me hope to carry on
and fill my nights with song
i used to need you
i'd be the perfect one for you
you made me find my love
you take me to front porch swings
took awhile to finally come around
and all the things i loved i thought were gone
your cheatin heart
your cheatin heart
you'll toss around
und ich mag es nicht wenn der regen auf meine schuhe tropft
und ich liebe es dich im regen zu kssen
ich liebe alles was du tust oh das tue ich
i dont like to see the sky painted grey
and i dont like to be the lasting news
unter dem himmel der liebenden
nicht gegen den mondschein ankmpfen kannst
bis du in meinen armen liegst
es wird dir heute nacht dein herz stehlen
you can try to resist
there's no escape from love
try to hide from my kiss
dont try then
you'll surrender your heart
but you know
he rides in the sun
he's browned as a fairy
so that when i take my last breath of life
i'll be clinging to a saving hand
someone who'll go the distance
and be my flame in the night
and everything that goes with it
and everything that goes with it
who's playin for keeps
moce it at a run
i'm crazycrazy for feelin so blue
and i'm crazy for lovin you
if i live to be a hundred years old
oh it's cryin time again
i began to sweat
you kill when you hold me
'til finally i give in
and damn
i toss and twist
you kill when you hold me
baby i give in
i want to bitch the world out
trash everything in site
i want to be destructive
du hast mich mit deinen kssen betrogen
you look like an angel
you're not the way you seemed
heaven help me i didnt see
oh yes you are
when it all comes down
you may be a stubborn doctor
why isnt that enough
ist alles was ich mitnehme
ich werde dich immer lieben
ich werde bei jedem schritt an dich denken
ich hoffe das leben behandelt dich gut
du liebling ich liebe dich
bittersweet memories
and i wish you joy and happiness
when i was giving up
for the rest of my life
i'll give it back to you
the midnight train is whining low
the silence of a falling star
how do you block the sound of a voice
how do you numb your skin
i'm one of the chosen few
by the chill in your embrace
also will ich dir sagen dass es mir leid tut
starre zurck als der mann der ich sein sollte
but looking back i'm sure you tried to talk it through
were the last thing on my mind
guess i had it all right there before my eyes
girl i'm sorry now you
dont leave me here
sometimes the time comes along
part of my hear from time
i'll remember you
i'll hold on to the memory
even if it's just in my mind
not leaving you
sagen musst du kannst nicht zurck gehen
empty
das leben geht weiter und weiter und weiter
da wo ich jetzt bin ist mein leben wieder so wie vorher ich habe das gefhl dass

lenny kravitz cree summer
had to shut down half my mind
how could the need deceive us into thinking things might change
lenny kravitz cree summer
lenny kravitz cree summer
i grew up were it was a difficult drive to the airport
how sad do you have to be to be sad
so what is this weather and what is this darkness
and why do i feel so alone
and when i'm left at home i'm all alone
we fly in flock sometimes
they grow in a garden or a wild field
and i cant play you my old songs you said
ran from the water
we've shared humility and orange roses
were wrapped around you tight we stopped at smokey's
you said it's worth everything and baby take a look
bring me home
it's crumbled to the land of nowhere
and you put on your crown
you know that i've been there and
and it wipes you off your feet like the world around you does
it's crumbled to the land of nowhere
put on your crown
and you can sing with me
i float in skies in your eyes in your eyes
days were different when you counted them in hours
and the days that have passed so fast that you might
do you want to be the woman
do you fall gracefully into bed anymore
do you sleep do you keep me anymore
you cant give yourself absolutely to someone else
do you sleep do you count sheep anymore
and it drops me drops me down
and i'm not feeling so good again
draw the shades down dim
i can feel you stop breathing when i come around
goodbye my love i'm going away
everyday everyday everyday everyday
the time between meeting and finally leaving is
well it's 530 here and it's 230 there
the grey sky was romantic cause he was holding her hand
you want to suffer and show me you're angry
you change your shoelaces
i couldnt look at it it made me think of you
it's not right but it's not wrong
you want to suffer and show me you're angry
your languorous hum that tone of surprise
i'm lying there dead but i'm breathing
youre not running are you
and i i turn away
i do to you
i said goodbye to romance yeah
to love in vain
goodbye to friends and to romance
and i think the sun will shine again
it's like how does your heart beat and why do you breathe
like you and your letters that go on forever
she will heal your heart up she is hurrying
and my image was muddled
dont you see my mind slow down for you
when i'm done with crying then i'm done with you
and i do
i'm starting to ignore you i've doubted you so long
and my friends can be my family
i wish for a place that i could go
it was what i'd heard of
too many things held dear
are we still solemn and bleeding
what do i wish for you what do i wish
dont stultify dont hold me high
your life is built on accidents like meeting me
and the fumes are dangerous
we sit on our couch
we need a next step
dont let this decision drag on
if we're really going
yeah you love to circle round and round you know that we should
from the molehill where we spilt the milk
who'd made them believe make believe
a sweet man will sing a seafaring song
lisa wont you listen
bitch and moan
come on dont lie
tell the truth
but i leech on to you
and your smile wraps around me like a snake a rattler
if i could let it rain but move the clouds away
but if you talk to me then maybe you would be learning
you cant feel safe about where do i start
while the heavy drops rain on the pavement outside
you got that you got that
rusty the screen door she opened it
those were rose colored times on rides with your eyes open wide
but i'll be the one i will have chosen
burns a hole in
she's falling apart
she looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves
she's falling apart
the beads the records
it s a bad day
when d you get down to my bones
you're not too tired for this life
of your heart that's singing out
what you need just happens to be
if you'd stand up one day
you might find you had it all the time
what you've got is what you wanted
when you want to get out
and now that i am leaving
and this woman was singing my song
you said that i was naive
my smile it parts when i hear you talking to me
'cause i need to know the same of you and you the same of me
you want to know how much i love you
actually bottom line you tell the truth sometimes
my friend's got a bruise on his ribs his rib cage is now numb
you're crazy why do you keep doing this
maybe what if it could be
i'm crazy
lazy sun shining and so i run outside
maybe i dont want to see it
this is where i meet my muse and it feeds me
this is where i meet my muse and it feeds me
of all the rooms i've loved before it's you i love inside this room
and too fast driving
am i in it
and too fast driving
and you gave wonderful hugs when i was with you
that's the end of your lies
but i know that i believe that i've found what's true
surprise cause now i'm smiling again
truthfully i really cant explain i'm floating i'm smiling again
and truthfully i am finding out what's you
i wouldnt know 'cause i am the underdog
i am the underdog i am the last in line
show you good bye
but that you do it a lot
you're back from out of town
just for the afternoon
oh wow
yes i complicated i know
they fell from above
i fell down
like water it rushes
i was restless
that's not what i want no that's not where i will start
i never kissed somebody so that they would break my heart
when they're walking through the door
you dont know me
empty
i could tell a half truth but i cannot tell a lie
i could be listening but this is not a guessing game

sails of oblivion at my head
she cries groundless and free
used steel am i
this is not helping me at all
this is not helping me at all where did we get this plan
bow everybody in the motel dont knock if the door to my suite is closed

there are the picadors and the mobs revenge
the moment of triumph when the girls scream and shout
when all that's left to do is
deep enough to dive
down forgotten streets
and if love calls again
they walk without a sound
let he who threw the stone at them
let him put it in his pocket and shake it all around
oh let's hold out for somethin sweeter
oh are we locked into these bodies
reminds me of that night
love will lead us alright
this crazy fog surrounds me

i cant feel any more but i can fake it forever
send it up on fire
death before dawn
'cause my real life aint fucking funny
ooooh lord why have you forsaken me
ooooh lord why have you forsaken me
i told him that i was good to sixes
we wouldnt have known beautiful flow
thinking you thought of me as something to hold
we might live to regret it
you only have to ask
and you'll never be rejected
you can count on my love
and oh all the tears in four tiny years
you better roll me home
i only ask because i'm a real cunt in spring
i know all about the ugly pilgrim thing
that it's harder to be friends than lovers
and boxed it up and buried it in the ground
so take a deep breath and count back from ten
and i raced you to the top the camera gets a stuttered shot
young abe vigoda plays frankenstein
watching me work so hard to reach you
backroads and shortcuts i know them well
nobody talks no one is here
i bet it makes you laugh
how you believe
you're in love with me
you're in love with me
but it's here on the pages i'm reading
what a good idea
it's all i can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy
i cant believe you had a life before me
and i never met a man who was so pretty inside
and who the fuck am i to criticize him 'cause i really need him now
when he knocks me down
i liked it
johnny sunshine
johnny sunshine
we had so many dreams me and you
while i'm thinking of the things you do
i wanna make a leap of innocence to you
my mistake is thinking you and i can change it
i got it from my dad
i hope you can
my mother is mine
and i thought
he's an off and on friend of mine

straight to my face boy
with all of the time in the world to spend it
but i cant imagine it in better terms
i wont decorate my love
dont know who's spreadin it 'round
i didnt let the cat out
no not to anyone
my mother's heart out believe me
so goodbye so long i'm gone already
who's gonna know which are torn
i think i'm losing my soul
i would have it all if i'd only had this much
i want to be cool tall vulnerable and luscious
be involved
you're lucky to be drinking here for free
why it is that there are those kind of men
do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here
do you want to be a polyester bride
lying wide awake in the dark
scared the lights will turn green
and you only to forget
you're always listenin
and somewhere's a place in your heart
you'll be like anybody else
the flies of august swarming me
i need a ride from you
i get a ride
the flies of august swarming me
what's give or take nine years anyway
baby baby if it's all right
your record collection dont exist
yeah rock me all night
i'm starting to think that young guys rule
take off my clothes turn out the lights
empty
i am extraordinary if you'd ever get to know me
who the hell are you
empty
thinking about you i fantasize
dont look sexy but it just feels right
oh baby know what your like

you feel like my favorite underwear
you feel you feel
in spite of all you know
you might not recognize me tomorrow
you might not recognize me tomorrow
i'll take you home and make you like it
everything you say is so obnoxious funny true and mean
everything you ever thought of
and i wasted your time didnt i and
one more false start in life
it seems like i dreamed and now i'm waking up to daylight
just that i didnt think this would happen again
you got up out of bed
i want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas
even when i was seventeen
without or without your best intentions
letters and sodas
i get away almost every day
my best friend tiffany
but she ought to learn to shave her bikini line better
they can say what they want
and i know that there's one thing
and i reach out trusting you there
but i see through them eventually
and i know that there's one thing
cant stop thinking about
you are you are shining some glory
i believe in myself and i believe in you
i'm no ordinary lover or friend
we hurt but we smile
safe on the interstate
i've got to tear my life apart
says take it from someone who's been there before
i've got my own thing
ooh boy i'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
they say that we would get along so let's get along
i dont have to wait for a miracle
ooh boy i'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
see monkeys do monkeys
on one side of me lies the enemy the other half is dead
i'm a psychosomatic sister
running around without a leash
they play me like a pit bull in a basement and for that
temper my hatred with peace
fast enough to get to where you are
louis is probably thirty years old but he looks like a solid 45
dont really see it that way
but it's better by far to get paid
it looks like shit and must be america
i would surely include lots of money
but i look at myself
i wish it could happen to me
walking down the street
baby there goes somebody's miracle
oh my look at you
stars fall
who are you
and from big to small
blinded by the flash
there the planets just like us
we all shine
we all shine shine shine
you havent seen me for weeks now
the sun was setting to the left of the plane
it took an hour maybe a day
it took an hour maybe a day
a flying giant friction blast
'cause you're a human supernova
i know the gossip flies around at breakfast
why dont you throw me in the panther cage
why dont you stub it in the carborateur
i'm leaning on the washing machine
watching helplessly will always forgive me
there will always be some kind of crisis for me
i still see that guy in my memory
wanna take a look take a look
wanna take a look take a look
the facts and the fiction
wanna take a look take a look
he didnt fight in the civil war
your beautiful wife keeps your life on a shelf for you
you might even shake the hands of presidents
but mostly we've been living here uninjured
i smell the earth in my skin
listen here young lady
and whip smart as the english channels wide
and games are just another way of life
i see you in everything
i'll see you around
i'll see you
why cant i breathe whenever i think about you
but wouldnt it be beautiful
high enough for you to pull me under
why cant i breathe whenever i think about you
it doesnt even stick
and simple ill will
well momma i would give some thought to it
you've gotta smile
howls around me
kick your shoes off
and it says

so he asked the question and she answered yes
well it might have been luck or divine intervention
it dont jingle like a jingle bell
you wont find it underneath the tree
yeah what it is
this little twist of fate
every day
this aint no fleeting thing
and back again
there's so much freedom in knowin
i can feel how much you love me
forever and ever
i wanna spend the whole night in your eyes
i'm so in love with you

one of those going out of our mind times
one of those crazy nights
and tell me everything's gonna be all right
and tell me everything's gonna be all right
in the mornin when i rise
and i bet my boots that he think he knows you from a to z
yeah darlin does your daddy know about me
and lead you to the light
she could twirl like a tilt a whirl
cotton or leather
lisa broke my heart
ooh when i see her in my tee shirt
watchin tv got her mama on the telephone
oh yea oh yea oh yea
that ol drive ins a new wal mart
yeah everything's changed except for the way i feel about you
ooh no news
her mama's been a little vague as to her whereabouts
lost her car at the mall got locked in a bathroom stall
holdin on so tight
you didnt waste anytime
and no one can miss you the way that i do
nobody loves you when your not there
somehow you remain locked so deep inside
somehow you remain locked so deep inside
long lay the world in sin and error pining
the thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
only you can make the darkness bright
only you can make this change in me
headlights on the cars and bright neon signs
and girl i want to take it slow
the way you look the way this feels
and when they all got together on saturday night it was easy to understand why
there's was drinking and dancing to the music of bobby lee and the blackjacks
kenny dean just grinned the best he could and said your honor it seems to me like it was just another
bells will be ringing the sad sad news
sure as the stars shine above
all the makings of a real hot summer
a '65 chevy from a friend on loan
i need you and a ragtop cadillac
the baby jesus born in god's grace
the baby jesus born in god's grace
he is the reason for the season
i got a heartache nippin at my heels
she's running away with my heart
when we're out there under the moonlight
santa claus is coming to town
so be good for goodness sake
goodness sake
coming to town
they're throwin a dance at the union hall
i got a date with lady luck
saturday night
saturday saturday night
say when i'll be there by your side
if it means holding you i can wait
say when say when
i knew when i met you that this would last forever
you beat around in my heart
two people meet it's destiny that they're together
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
why do i do this to myself
i'd get my heartbroke every day if i could
i'd get my heartbroke every day if i could
you can lock me in your heart
i love the way you do that do that
anytime at all
anytime at all
i love the way you do that do that
they only want one thing
please let me be the one
but someday time will tell
i wanna be the one
lovers sharing a sleigh ride cuddled close
if everyday could be christmas
oh it's that time
if everyday could be christmas
where the love light beams
just to hear her say i love you one more time
i'm the shadow on the ground
but i know that i'll be in your dreams tonight
can you feel the love that we share
can you feel the love that we share
i've gotta find you
for all i know you're the girl next door
new york city making waves on wall street
back of my mind i thought she'd be
and i kept working this rock hard ground
i need a john doe on a john deere
here's the keys to my heart
here's the keys to my heart
here's the keys to my heart
they're resigned not to do the work
in a deep trance
that we kept the promise made
the kissin the laughin the passion
walking down the street in la
it's quick draw credit cards the world turns but in my heart
5pm is a rat race
when friday night comes i'm gonna turn up the noise
rum pum pum pum
pa rum pum pum pum
the ox and lamb kept time
me and my drum
two for one on a blue lagoon
and the love we threw away
another smoke filled evening with no fire to be found
and the love we threw away
i never knew it before that i could feel this way
suddenly everything's new
and i know that it's here to stay oh 'cause
sunlight fell from your lips tenderly you shattered me
there's so much trust in your eyes they make me remember blue
i dont wanna be that strong if it means being alone
who am i to tell you why
tell her you're believing
before i close my eyes
even though it's hard to say
tell her you're believing
when i told you i'm still not over you
it was just the tequila talkin
jack frost nipping at your nose
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
merry christmas to you
is the best one ever
came true when you walked in
is the best one ever
she's unusually unusual
absolutely unpredictable
and that's beautiful to me
baby for once let's dont think twice
'til our hearts start racin for that county line
but there wont ever be a better time to take this chance
what child is this who lays to rest
the king of kings salvation brings
the babe the son of mary
we got all of this time on our hands
roll away that book of rules
we got all of this time on our hands
what would it take to take me back
i would give all i own for one little stepping stone
back when the west was wild and cowboys didnt dance
thirteen hundred miles to go as they slowly made their way
didnt wear designer shirts
snow is glistening
then pretend he is parson brown
walking in a winter wonderland
the eskimo way
sometimes i feel like just a bump on a street
straight to my brain
when you're with me
i got my highs and lows
and it feels right as rain
nobody's here to see me cry
without you
still i'm
changing partners
then you came waltzing in
then you came waltzing in
you dont know what love is
if you think that i can fight this feeling
you dont know what love is
you dont know what love is
you walked in with legs up to your neck
yea yea yea yea yea
you walked in i'm a physical wreck
i couldnt think of nothin better to do
when you walk in baby love begins
a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
too bad i gotta do it baby someone new
too bad i gotta do it with someone new
all i want is a cadillac
to feel the earth move when we kiss
all i want is everything
i love the way you understand
a heart full of love wont let go
all that i am
'cause if my head was on right you wouldnt be sitting here tonight watching me shakin it
brian dean maher bergsnes
a restless girl in a pink bedroom
would keep the stars from stealing her innocence
yellow brick road and technicolor dreams
where i stand the sun is setting
so strong so real so right
my love will hold you
just close your eyes
eyes that never leave hers
that's the fine art of holding a woman
it's just a little slip of paper
oh baby for a good time call
seven numbers away
oh baby for a good time call
i wasnt doing anything wrong
and i took your twenty bucks
you know that's when it hits the fan
guys do it all the time
they talk about the rainy weather she's thinking all the while
what she wants to say is
i'm more woman than i can show you in this old cafe
love me in your arms
hold me closer to your heart
sunny russ
being here with you this way
pain meets harder as i close the door
out of control
that wants you here
i'm not some ghost from your past
i'm not so tough
i'll call your bluff
i'm not so tough
let's get it started make it last all night
'cause it aint a party 'till the girls arrive
of holding your sweet body next to mine
your love it's so easy oh oh
sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
all the while you failed all of the girls you never knew
to try and change your mind
i'll have another glass of wine
count my blessing
you're every womans dream
you're too good to be real
lucky me
maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he cant live without
he called her up he said i have been such a fool
gazes into the dark
i would not die for you
who would lay down her life romeo
oh romeo romeo
you can paint our names on the water tower
a 50000 watt radio spot
baby bring it to me sweet at home
i like it most when we're up close
life is a dream
the night is lover the stars are glass
over and over and over and over and over again
i'm falling over and over and over and over and over again
you keep me guessing most of the time
kiss by kiss
but you hesitate dont you
but you hesitate dont you
take me apart
'cause i cant figure out why it all fell apart
so make me understand why i still need you so
look who just walked in
help me break this spell that i'm under
lead me not into temptation
watching over me tonight
i wanna read you baby like a book
i wanna know what's on the other side
i wanna know what's on the other side
if the rule wont break i'm going to bend it
i've had my share of wrong directions
this is me take it or leave it
passion that brought tears to my eyes
with somebody who shakes me
all i need is someone who brings me thunder and roses
took a listen to his advice
if we ever get lost we can use the stars
got each other and that's enough
tumble and roll tumble and roll
when you hear
what i think and what i say
well i'm the first to tell you now
i have to draw the line somewhere
that's two different things
is two different things
what if i do will he love me more
what if i dont will he walk out the door
what if i do will he love me more
she looked her daughter in the eye said girl you are so young
he found the ring beside the pen and tears illed up his eyes
i'm begging you to take it back baby now i see
'cause i'll be smiling when i see you my tears wont ever show
yeah i might always love you
we used to hang out at anthrax together

the forest burns there are fires in the sky
'cause everytime you touch me i feel like i'm being born

i could leave the whole set but never go too far

talking to a man from galilee
empty
you might run
chorus x8
i saw it in my eyes
well it's solace baby
now it will die mine
gonna say it's all mine
when i know it's not mine
i know it's not mine
if i was beautiful
i was always looking
i fly so high i fly so high
as far as i can see
closing people come in but also lying on the floor
to the ruins where we played
so many empty nights
holding hands
holding hands
i feel it soft
so soft
i feel it
it's soft but it hurts
well i feel it
what sort of love
i wont be there calling
i know
i gotta face it
i'm feeling so real x2
x16
lift and squat
the street bears no relief
on the strings of my heart
my heart is full
when i see it i cant wait it got to hold on now

this is my dream
it's so brutal with the cold sky
wrapped in cold late at night
sample give me summer x4
i'm not worried at all
to be up
and in my lifemy lifemy life
well i'm here in my lifemy lifemy life
so many time's i'm down
i broke everything new again
dirty basements dirty noise
oh baby oh baby
up to anything
i would stand in line for this
all alone i open my eyes
i fly into the blue
empty
reaching forever
i am wide open
into the blue
someone to love
you make me another hell
and no one lifted me no
is the soul to love
here we are in the pouring home
hey elan
dark cloud has come into the way
empty
dark cloud has come into the way
empty
once i had my dreams
that's when it all gets blown away
that's when i reach for my revolver
that's when i reach for my revolver
let the water creep over your face
while you hold mine again and wait
it's washed away
i watch it crush me
it's broken up pushing us
it's deeper than love
to let you know that this world will never decay
we must move m move
the time is comin for the song that i'm hummin
we can do it we can do it we can do it if we try
it's later than it's ever been time's up in this world today
well i make i write i dance i sing
'cause i get my thing in action
empty
left in my mind
'cause we are all made of stars
people they fall apart

yeah how's everybody coming on
see my love gonna see what i can find
empty
i dont want to swim forever
when a problem comes along
go forward
no one gets their way
like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
let the whispering wind come lift us away
why does my heart feel so bad
feelin well
they see us talking out both sides of our mouths
through the cracks in the wall
standin upside down and talkin out of his pants
500 miles is a real long drive inside a car
hey alright i might be goddamned

if you think you know enough to know you know we've had enough
i'll be beating my heart's record for speeding
ahaha ahaha

like the lumber or weeds
empty
this is the part of me that believes in heaven
where i could go away and you could wish that i had stayed or just
and i do ont know at all
i go home
i broke every bone in my goddamn jaw
i was knocking on your ears
at somebody else's page
of course everyone goes crazy
oh and i know this all myself
so we could shake shake shake shake shake
i'm the same as i was when i was 6 years old
that never even ever really ends in the end
but i dont know what i need
'cause it's night on the sun you're hopelessly hopeless
freeze your blood and then stab it into me
not a person doesnt want me underground
remember through sounds
named after the things they replace
you're on you're wrong ohio
hardy hoping i spend it all on game machines
out of existance or just down the road forever
i was excited but usually i hate to see them
out of existance or just down the road forever oh yeah
going out
palm tree houses way down lane
i dont know how i'm going to go and
and everyone hears every little sound
i cant be blamed for nothin anymore
never walking away from
but still lost
if you say what to do i know what not to stop
some day you will die and
often you will die somehow and
and we're the places that we wanted to go
and i dont want to know
but we were the people that we wanted to know
all this scrambling around
you shouldnt have to ask
cuz you cocked your head to shoot me down down
i'm trying to drink away the part of the day
defunct that timebomb at the space station
he realizes and itemizes
flourescent lights will always equal empty
sleepwalking cuz i'm sleepwalking
left town for a week
make you cry the rich get money but never what they want find ourselves a
she's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
i'm shot to the moon
the opinions that i do not give
let it all drop
well looking what direction and waiting for a train and thought over
oh it's over
i didnt mean to bite you so really
cheer up baby it always wasnt quite so bad for every
oh what's the use
empty
well i smoke in my neck
steam engenius you see
what a waste of words

steam engenius enough to bring my own damn doom
far away from the milk and tea
empty
you meant for
1996 1997 1998 we're all waiting for the year 2000
it was on the rotating eyes
it was all in the same rest stop
the parts to pound attractive
and i claim i'm not excited with my life any more
i've changed my mind so much i cant even trust it
it isnt even enough
i'm gonna' let my own bad self take over
it wasnt even enough
well i hadnt noticed but the people really noticed that they really didnt want us around
our bodies were laid out
that it's always been said that
it's weeds pulling weeds and you're blaming yourself
four fingered fisher man so uptight though
dig hard
i've been working on the railroad time uh oh
it pulls all on down my sore feet
you're standing by the grey ice water
short to long distance
surf rock mess with no surf but pine trees
to grey and back to grey again
surrounded cut off jeans
i'm trying to get my head clear
we tore one down and erected another there
come inside and pour a drink
here it comes
speak about the future in the past tense
got myself my bottles back
i came as ice i came as a whore
i came too soon so i came back
i'm on a road shaped like a figure 8
i drove around for hours i drove around for days
wind up anger with the endless view of
i go absolutely mental
oh we had to have some kind
we were never invisible but that i guess we did not see
of course we lay down
but it will not get us wet
he went down to the river
you should hide you kids
i probably will not ever be
i took a trip down to california
and came back for the van
i could have told you all that i love you
i know where you're from but where do you belong
to be pulled strings to be pulled
that's what i'm waiting for
that's what i'm waiting for
that's what i'm waiting for
cause thats what we're waiting for
waiting to bleed on the big streets
well arent you feeling real dirty
grass stains and fresh fruit
that's the part i seem to hide
and the busy ant empire
wasnt far enough
i couldnt remember if i took my brain out threw it so directly a the goal
i bet that you'd wish that they'd just shut up
it's hard to remember it's hard to remember
my mom's god is a woman and my mom she is a witch
from the top of the ocean yeah
ha that boy fell down on his harelip ow ow
oh if you could bottle and sell it you might have done
he sparkles shimmers shines
but not no one not now not ever or anyone
here's the man with teeth like god's shoeshine
he goes to the reservation drinks and gets mean
i didnt move to the city the city moved to me
well cowboy dans a major player in the cowboy scene
he goes the the reservation drinks and gets mean
to reach for my shoes then walk
i might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
well its funny as hell but no one laughs when they get there
dry or wet ice they both melt and you're equally cheated
oh it could've been should've been worse than you would ever know
why should we ever even ever really even get to know
well it would've been could've been worse than you would ever know
dont wear eyelids so i dont miss the last laugh of this show
and the evening was consoling
out of the shower on to the bathroom floor
eats a lot of gas cause it's that more heavy
i cant swim so i dog paddle
i cant swim so i dog paddle
i'm down on the water
ride on the greyhound
rutting through garbage
down the road in your life
your lips
travelling swallowing dramamine
and you think you've figured out everything
get em up put em up
sometimes my feelings get in the way
you're taking your point of views a bit too far
think it over
well i'm not sure
our instincts they were cringing
i dont know
all them books i didnt
could it really hear highly if you highly care
stubborn beauty stubborn beauty
and it still wont take you where you want to go
and it still wont take you where you want to go
i hear voices insinuating
fire it up fire it up
fire it up fire it up
but even if we had been sure enough it's true we really didnt know
it honestly was beautifully bold
and we'll all float on ok
and we'll all float on ok
alright already we'll all float on
so long to this cold cold part of the world

to move away from those younger years
in a car no brakes i dont mind

to the national
i've lost my boy
you want the day to come sooner
i'd love to
now i've had enough
only with you
i'm the end of the line
empty
there are some bad people on the rise
designed to kill your dream
you wonder why we're only half ashamed
the one that you took
with my innocent hand on my heart
because freedom was wasted on me
mouth slack and wide
where no one is likely to pass
i want you
empty
you didnt even thank me
you didnt even phone me
you coo ed for an hour
goodbye house goodbye stairs
as we spent the last night
oh truly i do love you
came home late one night
a powercut ahead 1972 you know
a half life disappears today
they took you away in a police car
i took the key from maudlin street
always looking for attention
oh oh hooray
oh hooray
what's your name
what's your name
friday nights 1969
torture you
i will roar from the stalls
and i will roar from the stalls
before the beginning
our story or not
in a low cut blouse
is an ancient ocean
making it anything
oh never to be trusted
make me feel so tired
do not shelter this dream
oh
but they were never to know
tell me tell me
oh dreammaker
how come it's just around the bend
two drifters
oh
two drifters
wider than a mile
deserves us
crying so loudly on the floor
still testing the strength
4 am northside clapham common
i was dancing when i was twelve
what's it like to be a loon
i liken it to a balloon
wait
come on and do something new
aah
i know you love one person so
oh give a
aah
empty
oh i know you love
somehow expecting no less
i praise the day that brings you pain
but sorrow will come

tattoo of you
how once i was in love with you
head in the clouds and a mouthful of pie
oh dagenham dave
dagenham dave dagenham dave

young boy i wanna help you
young girl one day you will be old
with your standards so high
with your standards so high
just do your best and dont
turn left she says
and she's laughing
i'm parking
everyday is like sunday
trudging back over pebbles and sand
found found found
in this murkiness
the more you give your trust
recycled papers paving the ground
to the girl least likely to
see me as i am again
but somebody's got to make it she screams
so chucking churning and turning the knife
oh darling it's all for you
everyone lies
where is the man you respect
for the language we use
here is london giddy of london
could totally destroy me
oh hairdresser on fire
i'm gonna sue you
is it real
only the other day
your one big contribution
a small girl runs crying through the park
oh
ha ha ha ha ha ha
and he cried
and so he froze where he stood
so he froze where he stood
or i think he does
he knows i'd love
you're just another person in the world
may be lost
to have friends
resist or move on
a brick in the small of the back again
i am falling
to anywhere
sincerely i must tell you
so this is why i tell you
rejection is one thing
things can only improve
call us home
call us home
call us home
and we just cant stress oh how more the mess
useless and shiftless
one november
all the bad that's been done
spawned a monster
because it's the closest
in the clothes that she went out
tell all of my friends
and i just cant explain
now my heart is full
now my heart is full
would you work for me
so horribly lonely
oh hear my voice hear my voice
the glass is moving
they bring me down so
red pullover
so give us a drink
from thinking all the time
so bleakly so bleakly
in decline
looking deep
all alone
in any form
roller skating back from the grave
oh where are you
where are you
was just silly slang
oh i secretly knew
so why do you smile
you dont know a thing about their lives
books dont save them books arent stanley knives
go on
roy's keen oh roy's keen
but that's alright
into each corner
then you let it go
right under your nose
roy's keen roy's keen
to be my home
satan rejected my soul
so take it please
come on come on oh
scavenging through life's very constant lulls
you can tell by the way i sleep all day
do you want to
oh sing your life
oh make no mistake my friend
la la la la la sing your life
a lovely singing voice
sing your life
with no reason
i love the romance of crime
in their citroen vans
all over this town
to talk about the books i read
and is evil just something you are
and you with youth on your side
happy being no one but themselves
ordinary girls
so lucky so lucky
to some other mid brain
is humiliation
to be finished would be a relief
to be finished would be a relief
empty
and looking back
making you ill
empty
would you put your arms around me
i never said i wanted to
is would you tell me that you love me
tell me oh tell me oh
you had your time and you spent it
oh why do you always wanna stop me
and you're sicker even quicker
or how i knew that something bad
so console me
it's still much more
still running 'round
seeks and finds me
then at midnight i
in some distant land
i'm not to blame
ha ha ha
you see it should've been me
middle eight
we've stayed alive 'till now
empty
oh
but never in my favour
oh
yes yes oh
and then syphon all your dough
your distress
that's just the way it goes
useful or useless
then just walk away
wide wide wide
will undoubtedly die alone
and it laughs in your face
if you're really there
and in my sorry way i love you
on a hill
you're just like me you're just like just like me
someone kindly told me
day or night
you're the one for me fatty
empty

some hope and some despair
empty

spat upon by passers by
beneath the valley of the underdog

i thought she knew

i should have known
you're all i ever needed yeah
the way you used to look at me and say
you're the one i want
if i'm not the one you want
empty
enough of building castles in the sand
know when you see him
know when you see him
chasing the moonlight
chasing the moonlight
over the rainbow
too much sorrow
i'll be on your side baby
are paved with gold
are paved with gold
but the streets
i was thinking that
when life and love
i was watching
the act of love was slowly pounding
you know i'll never lose you baby
act of love
act of love
help me help me
so wont you take me take me
i never seen before
after berlin
help me help me
wont need no shadow man
what will people say
where will people go
and we've got to get ourselves
that was floating on the breeze
and i felt like getting high
there were children crying
aint it the truth now baby
what i say
the devil fools
your cadillac
dont it take you down home
make friends down in alabama
is less than ninety miles away
so i'll stop when i can
i cant forget
your crazy smile
our little son wont let us forget
our little son wont let us forget
still some love
back in the old folky days
with your make up on
oh mother goose
it's hard to say
there's room at the top
your hook and ladder dreams
and i hope it isnt you
in the wind
for every set of eyes
god shed his grace on thee
and three young girls who cried
i took you for a ride
she got down on her knees
i'll mail you back the key
the coroner was friendly
but i was afraid to ask
when a friend dropped by to ask
we have here
for speedin and no brake lights
like a black and white super 8
from inside his cell
living in the internet
by watching others too
this must to be told
it doesnt matter
been laughin too much
of those lines on his face
holdin on to what i got
let it shine shine shine
let me ride ride ride ride
let them dance dance dance
let me shine shine shine shine
riding on the range
when you gave good 'phone
looking for a good time
you're hung up on the line
of why we have to send our men to war
flip flop
but of course our president is clean
time is runnin out
i hope someone can fly this thing
you've gota face it down
let's roll for justice
people sleepin on the sidewalks
dont that trouble you sister
dont that trouble you brother
sleepin on the sidewalks
i dont know how you feel
to make a handout worth a lot
standing in the light of love
turning once to fire
you could have been
and i'm gettin blown away
you touched my lips
i want to love you but
who put the bomb
i would build such
get down on the ground
the gypsy told my fortune
we're gonna lose this place
why should we die
to house the chosen few
hangin head
only love puts a tear in your eye
a little thing called love
she comes to town when the children sing
good conditions
cross the line
running from the daily grind
try to remember peace visualize
dont take no tidal wave
to never kill again
be the one to change the meaning
it's a lonely weekend
is lying in the hall
i'll never understand
after midnight you see
rock rock rock
people sleepin in their shoes
keep on rockin in the free world
and what she's done to it
for the homeless man
got roads to drive
if you were really all alone
feels just like yesterday
to climb my hood ornament
arent on the ground
no i dont believe
goin down
the paper illusion
how slow and slow and slow it goes
when you step on your pride and you cry
through the time that you spend
round and round and round we spin
of findin you're usin
and wherever you go
to mend the tear that always shows
to weave a wall to hem us in
if you are not loving me
and it's not hard to see
i'll know it's because
the things i've done
and turned it to the sky
are overcome
sad movies make you wonder why
to feel for a while
of the wealthy banker
dont pick up the knife
the gravy doesnt matter
i could die
see the losers in the best bars
stretched out between us
sample and hold
but not the lonely one
we know you'll be happy
sample and hold
we know you'll be satisfied
perfection in every detail
whatever happened to saturday night
and i stumbled for a while
she'd be gone
no more sadness
i'm a little scattered
sometimes they leave you
wont try to give you
that's where
when you need
to take a hero home
home of the brave
i think i'll take it
i'll love you tomorrow
how could you give yourself
to another man
i tossed and i turned
i'm just a fool in love with you
at the door
under white sheets
all the bushleague batters
good conditions
cross the line
running from the daily grind
i never believed in much
empty
not clear to you
like a musical ride
curves beneath
are all over the floor
if i could just live my life
you'll be making love to me
gateway of love
where we watch the bouncing sun
i gotta get along
i got some things i gotta do
it's too late for general custer
i hope i'll see you soon
yeah tons and tons
'bout how to get gone
get gone get gone
gonna get a lotta drugs
yeah me and the boys
is not a dream
i'm riding down this wet road
the laughter in your eyes
give me strength to move along
how to stand by her man
what life without them would be
doing forty hours
so we'd understand
how to stand by her man
in god's perfect plan
back where
and now we do what we do
and his gun in his hand
going home i'm going home
you'd think it was easy
and obviously doing well
going home i'm going home
i wish i was back in the saddle now
well i used to be so happy
i'm listed under broken hearts
i cant reach out and touch you
when i'm looking down on you
i feel like making up for lost time
i saw you take your typewriter
the way things are downtown
down past the railroad track
outside the jail window
it's longer than all the others combined
grandpa saw them there
the only good thing about tv
susan carol from early magazine
i dont know for the life of me
share your lovin and you'll live so long
your smiling face
now you think about
going through your garbage
you tried to make
dont know when
it dont matter now
were young and strong
standing in the light of love
drowning in the deep blue sea
towards that goal
the speaker speaks
test tube genes and slot machines
where even richard nixon has got soul
on each night
computer cowboy
come a ky ky yippee yi ay
see the turtles
there was a dying breeze
the cards on the table lie
who run and cast their doubts
she breaks out on her own
change comes slow in the country
and caught that young mans eye
she's livin in the summer of love
and then they rock some more
yeah everybody's rockin
rockin their blues away
rockin to the dancin beat
it was last seen
and the wheelchairs are gone
was that me
empty
no one else to care for or love
on the carousel
in the great divide
of the beautiful things
that the country brings
so the subtle face is a loser
i got lost
i come down
now my name is on the line
from what they've seen
you told me love is blind
they think the lord of me
well there's two kinds of love
at the crossroads
cant forget you babe
living off the land
is firmly in the ground
on the whitehouse lawn
was the last of his kind
of the ways he talks
at the end of the car
it's the loner
know when you see him
and then she me told something
on love
you better take your chance
you gotta move to start
my son
i thought we had just begun
that old country waltz
the two of us died
old country waltz
that good old country waltz
and a half a million people
the house and the boat
lose their ass
of the guns of war
tryin to help the people
if you cant tell foul from fair
confiscatin all
but they might work here again
they keep puttin
and the dollar's
try to dance away
but his timing wasnt right
each one tryin
hard workin people
ah she's lookin so good
hard workin people
look like they're here
big johns been drinking
felt reassurin
shelter me from the powder
one day a visitor
and when the gates are closed
we were flying through the night
tellin him i lucked out
the heavies are all there
his hair is red as blood
nothing was easier
we'd like to thank you
i sure was glad i had what it took
is dressed in white clothes
i'm thinkin of no one in my mind
pieces from here and there
to sing for you
floating in love's atmosphere
there's a ring for your finger
the floor is slippery
till the morning comes
her float across the floor
the chrome and steel she rides
she gets the far away look
the air she breathes
what did you do to my life
now there's nothing to hide
through my hair last night
there's an anger in my heart
we may not be good looking
with his eerie light
was that the devils stagecoach
out on the floor
comes down the stairs
just then the sound
i've got some change
the air was filled
there's not enough time
his ears were sweating
the naked rider gallops
was the best old hound dog
old king sure meant a lot to me
never knew a dog
off the truck in high gear
been here before
she leaves nothing at all
blacks out the night
old man look at my life
like a coin that wont get tossed
doesnt mean that much to me
ah one look in my eyes
it's hard to teach
clean up my whole way of living
things turned around
from the wall where
though my problems
i went to the radio interview
get out of town
think i'll get out of town
now i wont be back
though the other side
can you feel it now
once an angel
towards the window
as i'll ever be
dont say you win
now it seems that time
though we both have pride
sharing words i always said were mine
and thank them all
and it wont be long it wont be long
to all the good friends i've known
like leaves from an old maple
one of these days
i think we're
you know a body feels empty
one of these days
you dont care
can break your heart
inside a dream
can break your heart
can break your heart
that old white line
it seemed like such a
right now i'm thinking 'bout
with some highbrow
so you stay out all night
i was born to rock
you never missed a moonlit night
with his coca leaves and pearls
straight and strong
but they built up
winding paths
set me thinking
too late to keep the change
i would tell her not to care
instead getting a rolling start
it's only someone else's potatoes
somewhere i can walk alone
to live my life
woke up this mornin
carry this monkey around
for a while
hello ruby in the dust
is it the same
and to be turned down
he had all of the lowdown
or we'll blow you out of here
and we dont have a song
send me a cheeseburger
blows my head off
empty
all my friends are
well i keep gettin younger
put out anything smokin
or the way that
three fine children
the ride has just begun
well i'm standing
thinking to myself now
cripple creek ferry
the gambler tips his hat
the waters going down
cry cry cry cry cry cry
boo hoo hoo cry cry cry
and you always have to
but right up close
and an old plaid shirt
daddy went a ridin in his old car
but that's all right
when he holds her
and an old plaid shirt
hey now hey now
used to think a cloud
had a rainbow on it
i'll be her man
back to his home
here you are
but the training that he learned
with the rain
down down down
to feel for a while
dont cry out the good things
sad movies they make you cry
my friend
to make those deals
hundred thousand miles away
twenty barrels worth
i hear it everywhere i go
from the earth
there walks a stranger
the power is on
the violent side
they do their thing
walk on walk on
ooh baby
there's a face in the window
when i stopped for a smoke
these midnight blues
the little creatures
the tired warrior
silver mane flyin in the wind
on the frozen ground
and the little girl dreams
just like the days of old
in the morning when you wake up
and burn that jungle down
you are my special one
and hear my heart
you are my special one
by the railroad track
and i was born
with a broken heart
is a restless wind
there's a ballroom floor
'til we meet again
we never danced
we're controlling traffic lights
we're controlling
computer age in harm's way
we are in control
chemical computer
i hung my head down low
i knew some people
with the darkness inside
i was alone
i dropped
too much for one lens to see
it's alright it's alright
every day and every night
leave your troubles at the door
laundromat in town now
welfare mothers
empty
you can hear this sound now
rock rock rock
we're all gonna rock together
frontier justice
and on the shores at normandy
through the years
sure enough
my love shining for you
hey babe
hey babe
you pay for this
it's better to burn out
they want a piece of the action
now she dont wanna use me
hey hey
now new york city
from ridin all night
from ridin all night
honey i got the blues
the emptiness of summer must begin it
the school boy told the woman on the street
wont take very long
for times to change
i want to live
through my hair last night
there's an anger in my heart
we may not be good looking
with his eerie light
was that the devils stagecoach
when the river was wide
that could go unheard
just because
dont kill the machine
but you needed me to ease the load
taped underneath the speedometer wires
the neon lights
then came paranoia
in the real organic sea
or a runner in peru
did you just drive on through
has its fine points
may be waiting your true love
that you've been cryin
tired and blue
go your own way
if only you
just look around and you see
all those gangsters with their crimes
it would beat all night for you
my feelings coming down
i'm free to give my love
who live separate lives
substitute comes at me winking
empty
things start jumping up
now new york city
from ridin all night
from ridin all night
honey i got the blues
putting them all in his hand
horseshoe mans
will always be heartbreak
love's the answer
his words were kind
or the rocky road
in that mansion on the hill
yeah i work all day
stop singin stop singin
we had relaxing times
pretty maui mama
if i could meet you there
vacation came
lonesome whistle
on the railroad track
whittlin with my knife
and the cia said son
there was an explosion to the right
my vacation was complete
there's someone comin
in the cool ocean breeze
before the video screen
to a suite with two tvs
on the needles highway
but saloon and rodeo
brought them back to the scene
we gotta change
in the first degree
oh yeah
with your fields of green
in the summer sky
can you let this go
and her giving ways
i hear the mountains
but i wouldnt buy
and i'll stand before you
is this commercial on tv
aint got no mag wheels
who's driving my car now
i'm runnin i'm runnin
wont you lay your big spike down
and you flag is up
wont you lay it down
i'll cop out to the change
could have easily
does the trick of disaster
when we were first in love
this love of mine
before it's just too late
let's say that time is kind
is what we've both been through
have you ever been found out
that's how good i felt
take it easy there's no one around
that's how good i felt
makes me feel like i'm alright
down on pain street
all day presidents
'cause you know
son dont wait
down on pain street
time fades away
yeh a few years ago they called me
you know you'll
he says he's outside one hour
we're running all alone
well he shot four men
please take my advice
in the driveway

please take my advice
tonight's the night
a sparkle was in his eye
tonight's the night
when i picked up the telephone
at just about the break of day
tonight's the night
too far gone
that way
too lonely to fall in love
too lonely to fall in love
she's got a gold ring
strobe lights flashin
he touched the night
dissolve into
and lost will know
will touch the night
remember names
but only take me where i'm bound
to love and honor
trans am
up the road ahead
and the street lights all were dark
trans am
the hotel shook and rolled
they said some girls broke down
transformer man transformer man
the cause and effect
through the galaxy of love
but we havent made it yet
lucky as they seemed
as soon as
truth be known
up on the ridge line
we will smile and sail away
till i hold you once more
and true love is so hard to find
you're the best thing
no my son that time has gone
feel no evil in my heart
the way things change
in my heart in my heart
in my heart in my heart
of the a f of m yeah
should be issued
'cause everything's alright
every day and every night
it's alright it's alright
everything's alright
gonna leave the fools in line
for me it's not over
she waved to me
talkin bout
who'll hover
and show you the way to go
when you see me
i swear her hair
at the top of the south
when i bite the bullet
carolina queen
consoling you
it's just a part of life
security had a hold on me
i hope that it matters
i'm singin this borrowed tune
fireflies buzzin round her head
they were bound for each other
she was open to suggestions
bound for living on the edge
by the time it hit the window
they were bound for each other
through the night
i'm like an eagle
through the night
and it made me lonely
like a river on your skin
or know is right
oh that's the price that you pay
it was getting hard to see
he was talkin to a woman with a microphone
the lights turned on
did you see them
had sworn on the wall
the empty quivered
protected her king
brown skinned indian on the banks
looking out on a big green lawn
what we've got
comin down
i'm fallin down
and i know i'm losin
comin down
while the blizzards
land of might
all the colors in the sky
by the summer it was healing
so hard to laugh as i fumbled
selling papers on the corner
the right to pick and choose
when it falls it falls all over you
as i went on my way
hungry people
sittin on the porch
falling from above
will make the world a better place
and the human race just kept rollin on
said that young girl of edith and earls
a better place
window shades are drawn
i just want to thank you
falling off the face of the earth
it's such a precious thing
empty
feel like i'm falling
and your families
i just got my ticket today
that left a big mark on me
i was talking to a firefly
and then i wont be far from home
when a family cant survive
then they'll cut off the supply
i hate to say the farmer
i'd hate to say the farmer
in the struggle for parity
where the farmers used to live
and taking what he needs
right where we used to be
to end the night
wish i was swimming
the mansion on the hill
i wanna feel your love
it's plowin time again
it's plowin time again
i'll be rockin on the porch
there aint no way of telling
around my door
find another shoulder babe
find another shoulder
dont want you messin
or crossing the usa
you're hung up on the line
you never gave good 'phone at all
call me up some time
we've sometimes won before
past the flags of freedom flyin
she turns to see her brother again
fightin in the age old battle
and flying on the ground is wrong
and flying on the ground is wrong
never shine but always glare
had a date with donna
and short fat fanny
but she wasnt
kinda fonda wanda
where life's a joy
we're on the road to never
empty
for girls and boys
empty
nobody's going to help you
ever since the world began
right by his side
southern man
and i saw black
better keep your head
i've seen your black man
the mighty diesel whines
we've got to let you go
i put in my time
roll on southern pacific
i've been a searcher
the answer lies
comin to you
i have to pay the bill
you pickin someone else's patch
and leave myself behind
doesnt matter who you are
drudging in the long parade
that those other days
is nowhere in this room
to come back again
wasnt a star at all
gold and diamonds say you're mine
and the feeling is just not there
or the lovers on the blankets
there is no dearer friend of mine
all those strings to pull
you're such a stupid girl
our love with live
you are such a woman to me
and your mother and your dad
as you read the hidden note
and it's your first cigarette
when you're findin out it's real
though you're thinking that
there's corruption on the highest floor
by an unpredicted rolling blackout
it just got great reviews
she has to watch her back
hey mr clean you're dirty now too
and the room began to spin
pick up my cat and leave this town behind
and see what remedy brings
hey mr clean you're dirty now too
kiss those days good bye
with you babe
there's somebody satisfied
we're all going
his pants are baggy
we're all going
and he let it go
before too much time took away his head
out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard
prairie wind blowing through my head
prairie wind blowing through my head
prairie wind blowing through my head
happened yesterday
and make corrections
feel pressure from me
to get your money's worth
dont feel dont feel
building every night
just money
go on and live for tomorrow
step out into the sun oh yeah
where the spirit grows
it took my breath away
are you feeling all right
that's why we dont wanna be good
that's why we dont wanna be good
all the towns people gather around
could those dreams of yours be true
at the end of a weary day
i called
she's the one you can lean on
she's the queen of them all
who will hold your hand
on the railroad town
'cause you know
where wind was blowing
and the words will come fast
in my heart but you
it's rainin in paradise
sun comes up
it's rainin in paradise
hang ten pipeline
hang ten pipeline
that your old man
i got faith in you
got to look out for
you came to me with open arms
now i'm looking through
silhouettes on the window
in my heart but you
on the grassy hills
if you just follow on
with the happy sound
to yet another fine place
know not of
and she cries
you never see us
and in this land of conditions
to hear him
i wont deceive you
i see bloody fountains
it's better here and now
something for the trip
he brought out
'cause you and i been through so many things together
swirling around the old bridge pylons
it's only a dream
it's gone
it's only a dream
more than a little for me
to save my life
such a long time now
that should be over
i can bring her the peace
i'm your jellyroll man
you've got to have it right now
i'm your jellyroll man
johnny found a place out in texas
now he cant forget it
right up as
will you think of me
till february comes
and on your mind
we can go gliding through the air
'cause we'll know before we're done
but i am to them
near a garbage can
keep on rockin in the free world
for the ozone layer
i was a while ago
i'll walk these borders
i can hear another song
i'm thinking of
well i went out with jenny
the swim with mary ann
wanna wanna wanna
wanna wanna wanna
something somebody said
you could be here too
and the freeways are crammed
you could be here too
and i feel so in tune with you
lady wingshot flies away
no time left to say goodbye
feeling that the day is through
its been up for hours
wake up wake up
well i hate to say the farmer
cause the foundation
it had nothing left to give
when a family cant survive
and in the night sky
this time you wont
it's not too late
it's not too late
my my hey hey
but he's not forgotten
than meets the eye
can you do it
you who soar into the sky
to every boy and every girl
by the hungry hand
your parade of days
where the numbers grow
our childrens days
a natural beauty should be preserved
and now so much is gone
upon your burning banks
like a monument to nature
a natural beauty should be preserved
take another man
a little part of it in everyone
throw them all away
when you're lost
i reflect on my demons
sing this nightsong
from the nightsong
i feel the way you feel
and twistin the words
havin to have the very best
once i was in love
when you're down
but no one seems to know
the pockets are all torn
i'm hearing willie singing on the radio again
empty
they last the winter through
ring the wedding bells
she really knows
so we'd understand
on the workforce
he only gave us the good things
she really knows
no nothing is perfect
to singing the meaning
'cause nowadays clancy
and who's trying to act
'cause nowadays
you cant lay a claim
who's saying baby
ocean girl
come 'round the world
and feed this world
they hold the world
or trade away
gotta get down to it
and found her dead on the ground
all our old hang outs
gonna rewrite all the rules
is there anybody out there
where the devil dines
it's the devils sidewalk greendale
about a woman delicious
who cares what you believe
and the church bells toll greendale
that my friends would turn to foes
you bring to me babe
empty
empty
empty
i need your love
turn it around babe turn it
yeah yeah turn it around
disappearing between you and me
with the ones
shining in the sun
do i have to come right out
like a dream she has taken me
indecision is crowding me
tell you that you look so fine
tell you that you look so fine
i was out with a friend of mine
he was feeling mighty fine
doghouse doghouse
when i was a young boy
the punches came fast and hard
and dream of being stars
down in hollywood
dont be denied dont be denied
dont be denied
and i wonder
aint too hard to see
i wont forget the way things are
you wont really be alone
with the lorries rolling by
dont let it bring you down
and you can really understand
just find someone who's turning
but the way the story goes
but on a bright and sunny day
i'm not saying that they're wrong
to sweeping the floor
say boo guess who
but he wont ring the bell
oh no dont pity me babe
now is not the time
dont say you love me
and i got to tell you baby
dont say you love me
and no one else will know
is better spent
there's a pretty little girl
and an old red barn
baby i'm askin of you
when i make a promise
'cause if you ever leave me baby
could i bring my cat
turned on tuned in cop out sell out
and the wind was howling
and it cut through the night
of their road weary eyes
grey riders flew across my lawn
guilty train
through it all she heard his call
through the window called
and start again
through it all she heard his call
got another good one on the line
and i knock on wood
dont tell me hard luck stories
now she's gone and you're alone
dont tell me hard luck stories
because i'm still in love with you
i want to celebrate
at the top of the stairs
and was some black face
more than i can take
with the promise of a man
but the music called me
with my moon in your eyes
to the lay of the land
the devil knows
usa usa
usa usa
the last time i saw elvis
the last time i saw elvis
the last time i saw elvis
he was the king
but he was rocking while he was getting out
that keep me searching
i've been in my mind
you keep me searching
i may not suit your taste tonight
you may not feel me bawling out
i may not suit your taste tonight
hello lonely woman
i wont ask you any favors
well i know you're a lonely woman
to pick up a reason
i was down on a frown
but dont change
is moving much faster
yellow moon on the rise
yellow moon on the rise
of this old heart beating for you
yes i'd miss you
yes i miss you
dusty pick up
that prays for more rain
country families
are there any more
turnin on you
and the gunfire kept
and when they looked at me
it's working on me
because it's time to go
because it's time to go
sharing with the submarines
hey what's that you got on
around the world
back where it all began
back on the road again
bad fog of loneliness
so long woman i am gone
i got a bulletin of news
she's my desire
i dont want to see
man in the street
lost doesnt know
taking daylight fights
he went and lost
turnin the pages
they'll never hear it anyway
what you're lookin for
where you gonna go now
empty
you'll find
try to get through
everything you're looking for
empty
sweet talk is all it's made of
love baby love
for long enough to know
i saw you on the barstool when
he trusted in a woman
save the planet for another day
we got a job to do
be the rain be the rain
we got to
corporate greed and chemicals are killin the land
he had to
save the planet for another day
i got to be strong
i got to live long
oh yeah baby oh yeah
when i'm not with you babe
in my old pickup truck
so i followed all the way
where the sun
there's so much
and someday i will
beautiful bluebird
never notice how
never seems to get old
down on me and mine
it's better than silver and gold
the chief stood watching
curtains off the rod
over the hill
sometimes i feel
oh honey
oh honey
my friends all tell me
and what it was for
for everyone to see
he was known in the islands
and what it was for
she should never know
where he fit
and the service drew to a close
is this how justice never fails
but we both just couldnt stop laughin
in carmichaels space
dont let another day go by
when you're confused and
protecting you
and get the word
without the magic touch
change your mind
change your mind
whose magic touch
revealing you
change your mind change your mind
with my suitcase and my brew
i could be happy
the drummer relaxes
i need another chance
they've come to see
or did you did you did you
she feels hard and she looks hard
did you did you did you
you're my angel you're my queen
no wonder we get a little loud
when all is said and done
and forget to wake up
scored some friends along the way
once again
johnny found a place out in texas
now he cant forget it
right up as
the lonely politician
you know you got
it's a lonely weekend
with a nail through your hand
with a tear in your eye
come on baby let's go downtown
pretty bad when
baby tell no lies
you're dealin with the man
oh this old world
that's how we kept
hey hey aint that right
but somethin else went slippin by
for a hell of a fight
when i see the light
but i'm all right
computer age
computer age
this horizons getting clearer
when you could be
i'll take your hand
i shot my baby
when you could be
she'll be there to wave to you
now you hear your conscious call
i would tell her not to care
and you hang on hang on hang on
can you feel it getting
there's a place called downtown
let's go downtown
give your money to the gateman
empty
let's go downtown
let's have a party
but the stain will fade away
but the stain will fade away
and went to heaven
and went to heaven
i feel like i died
i park my aerostar
i watch you disappear
go back to the street
dreamin man
dont try to tell me
to count on me
down to the ground
you try to tie me down
i have to make you see
i wanna wake up
comes to an end
a machine gun sings
now she's gone
there's a feud going on
with numbers
just one way to go
but bear in mind
driving school
in the crystal ball
the money hits the table
the tijuana dawn
his eyes are screaming blue
atlantis is waiting down below
bobbing on the bay
evening coconut evening coconut
evening coconut evening coconut
when you hate yourself my friend
back home
everybody knows
everybody seems to wonder
you'll find me
that's not so easy to be
everybody's alone
oh yeah something more tame
oh yeah something better bred
oh yeah something more slow
oh yeah something more true
now you give to me
and you lay me down again
and so is the sea
finding that what you once
i believe in you
do you think
they all try to help me
but i cant find it yet
i got a problem
and what is wrong
who will understand
let me wonder why
i wonder why
do you think that
do you think that she'd
when you walk in a room
you know you got it
you're living like a satellite
if you got love
if you got love
hang on to my hat
that's the shape i'm in
goin goin
i've been to countries
i'm like a white man
i was driving way too fast
while i run away with you
cause i'm not tied
when they take another life
to the old boats
under lights
on the brutal crimes of love
and watched for him
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
cause i'm your kind of guy
i'll give it a try
in the great divide
you're gonna like the way you feel
you dont fit in too well
you are so inviting
by the time you stop to figure
once there was an inca queen
and they a mountain city raised
the drums were heard
she gazed at her sundial
in the sun
i'm happy singing
to bring my guitar home
calling me
instead of tearing
why dont we try
we found things to do
well it was
with your chrome heart shining
long may you run
till they grow higher and higher
it's such a long walk home
it's such a long walk home
there's an open mind
livin like i do
look out for my love
somethin sayin somethin
look out for my love
clean up the corruption
yeah maybe it's obama
we got to have a clean win
and maybe it's a woman
of what i see
that's right for me
it's going to be
another reason why
writing a song
i'm not waiting
for times to change
a hip drag queen and
remember millie
glory hallelujah
old times were good times
right up to the gate
some roads hide and wait
some roads
but you were not home
and i feel that way again
wont you ever change your ways
for you to be
dont take out the magic pen
what could be stranger
i heard i was losing you
it's gonna take a lotta love
so if you are out there waitin
it's gonna take a lotta love
overcoming hate
will break it down
hate is everything
a battle raged
love and only love
leave me a heavy one
and my words are all so sad
i can recommend
dont deny yourself
love hotel
it was raining outside
been holdin back my love
but my love still shined
i wanna see what's never been seen
but you better not pick it
there was a song
lovers pretend
and hell is blue
tear myself down again
left behind
that i dont know
left behind
than to fade away
the king is gone
there's more to the picture
she loved me all up
she got pictures on the wall
i hear her callin
i love the way
that wasnt really too long ago
our dreams went up in smoke
over and over again with you
you brought it all on
you brought it all on
the way that it should
where i might get off
i'm like a snake
where i might get off
hear what i've got to say
payola blues
i never hear my record on the radio
no matter where i go
cant feel it
livin in a sacred land
but not the take
no way to deny you
empty
then you come out on top
you know it takes
and go for peace of mind
a long long time
if it's not too slow
up and down the avenue
in the steaming heat
come the fumes of industry
on the sidewalk scenes and
i've got my friends in the world
calling my name
empty
my mind outstretched to you
pictures in my brain
i know that you can fly
through the dotted line
i tried to turn it on
to build a piece of crap
to the fields of green
on the setting sun
i would give thousand pelts
and the good things there for hire
is lying in the hall
a reason to run babe
and what have you done
see the sky about to rain
some are bound to live with less
i was down in dixie land
am i on your track
pinch yourself when i smile at you
do you know who you are
of that love we knew
sharin our little boy
someone's hanging out
i'm picking something up
electrical energy
'cause i'm here
there aint no way
my blue eyed woman is a mystery to me
way out on the prairie
without that woman i'm history
history was the cruel judge of overconfidence
thousands of children scarred for life
ringing all along the borders
with little hands
building roads
but back home
empty
and so if you give your heart away
i dont care
didnt need it anyway
if the sun dont shine
they see the face in the window
all the screamers and squealers
that's the way he lived his life
there's a judge in the city
that he blew someone's head off
he was very funny of course
one day the circus was his
and took a rifle
and those deer hit the ground
and his wife was a thief
and the story was told
get this thing accomplished
empty
the bill is up against cash
i dont know if i can stop it
a wad of cash in my pants
when he says that he loves me
sometimes i'm good then i'm bad
i got thrown out of sunday school
she wasnt perfect
he sleeps with angels
he sleeps with angels
the faces in the window
low in the valley chill
she just slipped away
hanging on my chest
we got some things to find
but the song is now
empty
'cause i've been down and back again
soldier your eyes
i wonder why
when he flew his plane
we all have to sin
empty
and it feels like fallin on down
like ten thousand dancers
well the people and the soldiers
aint got too many wonders
got mashed potatoes
got mashed potatoes
got mashed potatoes
aint got no t bone
got mashed potatoes
out on the waves in the night
come and see me
tell me why tell me why
ten men workin tonight
ten men workin tonight
ten men workin tonight
ten men workin tonight
my friends all tell me
i'm on the road tonight
came visiting me last night
we may not be good looking
she saw the pictures and she painted them
it's a long road
she towed the line
it's a long road behind me
you may not like what they said
covered in flags but i cant see them on tv
we're starving and dying from our disease
dont need no nausea
a hundred voices from a hundred lands
blowin themselves away in my hood
with such an appetite for efficiency
in the cool morning rain
in the cool morning rain
could be good things
there's a world you're living in
i dont sing for nobody
aint got no stash
it's been up and down the country roads
this old guitar
it's mine to play for a while
midnight that old clock
and a businessman dont know
made things work
what that means
take it all away
then we made our plans
take it all away
this town
in the full moon
when i saw
who were lost in crystal canyons
how i lost my friends
they were waiting waiting
where the vulture glides descending
just another line
unable to come down
show me show me
before he sees the weakness
who plan the counter scheme
the street that's paved
empty
and i know what's on your mind
grab a bite to eat
like a river needs rain
like a photograph
look everything is new
whatever happened to saturday night
or the color of my skin
that were fought in his name
when god made me
when god made me
old buildings coming down
we've been blowing up the planet
i would cry the whole day through
when i hold you in my arms
when it falls it falls all over you
another came along
then it gathers strength in lies
do your senses tingle
when you dance
a river that rolls
with circumstance
dont be waiting
that arent gone
dont be waiting
empty
when you're on the losing end
though i know i'll never be the same
then when i left her behind
coyote howls on the hill
where are those old days
too late to keep the change
they drop by to die 'cause it's
to answers that you gave later
have no lovers in the city
feel like a railroad
i was adrift
where the daylight
who swam upstream
i'll never lose it
when i shine too bright
the will to love
to the sea
got the will to love
and get lost in snow
got the will to love
but i wont turn back
and let our scales shine
we will smile and sail away
when the winter winds greet
i waited for you winterlong
things we thought of yesterday
someone's hanging out
i'm picking something up
electrical energy
'cause i'm here
i've been walking all night long
i'm wonderin if you'll come home
knowin that i need you to save me
i'm sitting here hoping
if i was a junkman
the king started laughing
it's just a game you
to say goodbye
you read it on the radio
wrecking ball
wrecking ball
'cause you might say hello
and we'll go dancin tonight
he calls my name
yonder stands the sinner
yonder stands the sinner
i went to see him
and now i wonder could it be
true love conquers all
open up and let the light back in
who knows what it means
your love again
i just wanna share it
oh yeah without your love
dont leave me babe
like you've been there before
you're leavin me just yet
on a natural high
you're leavin me just yet
and the falling leaves
you're leavin me quite yet
i used to think of him he used think of me
for god's sake wont you listen to me
he never meant to hurt me
but he never meant to hurt me
oh johnny do you miss me
yes i heard you calling
you will be no friend of mine
if you call out in the dark
from these feelings i cant hide
when i saw you in my rearview
why dont we both take a ride and turn that key
i'll be there for you when you want me to
they hurt me so
and now that i actually heard it
just what you want me to
just what i want to do
just what you want me to
i've lost you x5
is about a child who now has gone
and tell me that i can
to be apart from what you've done
they hurt you every day
to be apart from what you've done
can you prolong this tragedy
when you watch the blood but you dont bleed
how can someone like you work that slow
we'd get along like a house on fire
i found myself forgotten too
and you will look inside
they're in retreat
i'm gonna give them up someday
behind closed doors
but there's no sense in telling me
i'm feeling like i never should
i get down on my knees and pray
those who came before me
but if it wasnt for your misfortune
when your heart grows cold
and i never could be true
there's a shadow of another hanging over me
the way you told me i was wrong
while i need words like these
i'm here for you
in an hollow land
and the sound in my head goes round and round
this is why events unnerve me
watching her these things she said
any kind of fool with the will to live
and i am not a part of society
and this is how it feels to be
it's just a moment in your life
i want to be up in the air
dont be afraid to live this way
can you see where we cant be
from my home i traveled far
yes it's the state of the nation
i know it all could be worthwhile
yes the state of the nation
what do i get out of this
they need what they cant keep
one of these days when you sit by yourself
and i know what's going to be
as we spend our days together nothing can go wrong
oh you've got blue eyes
tonight i think i'll walk alone
no i've never met anyone quite like you before
only when meanings have no reason
thinking hard about the weather
we believe in a land of love
we believe in a land of love
the rain and the sea and the hours
same place same time
it's always the same
it grows so slowly
it's called love
it's called love
i've known you from the start
without you i'm left alone
know the feel of pain
without you i'm left alone
feel the rhythm sweetest sound
in port royal town the children are running
i couldnt look at you
by the hand of god
so desperately before
you got my time and you got my money
very small boys talked to me
to the childhood i lost replaced by fear
in a world that's just begun
to the childhood i lost replaced by fear
of the things that cost you too much
they're afraid of what they see
that my life would depend on the morning sun
i'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
seemed so glad to be here
i know they like what they see
dont steal my crown
take my hand
i dont wanna be like other people are
dont wanna have to work like other people do
tought that i was right
turn your eyes from me
what do you want me to say
turn your eyes from me
in the heat of the night
all those tears ago
time to go
i've seen what a man can do
i've seen what a man can do
i keep hanging on keep hanging on
i keep hanging on keep hanging on
i keep hanging on
but sometimes it's not enough
when you're gone
filling up this universe
when you're gone
how many words do i have to say hey
that's the only thing about it
failure of your moral code
who do you think you're talking to
at the end of the road
breath held tight inside of me
at the end of the road
someone i knew and he was lost
just like a lock without a key
just like the blood that burns in me
it dont mean much to me
sit against an open wide
he dont need nobody else
overtime 4x
try to get it right
take him on
its never gone
make your own play
its never wrong
but do it at the right time
is the master plan
we're playing the song
arrivederci its one one one
can you feel it can you feel it
how long would it last that's the price of love
go home young offender and stay undercover
like an angel
a search that shall remain
the search that shall remain
a search that shall remain
the path we can not take
there's no place where i have been
there's no place that i cant find
i want you i want you i need you i need you
i know you know we believe in a land of love
i know you know we believe in a land of love
it doesnt take a lot to confuse me
how can it be that we're so far apart
i've done it before and i'll do it again
i wanted to see what's inside my heart
at night it gets cold and
or try to look away
it's nothing i regret
now you are mine
have a conversation on the telephone
i would not complain about my wounded heart
i believe in politics
i put my future out of frame
i believe this world of ours is just a den of vice and sins
crawling on the floor
and you think you know what's going on
it aint so funny but it's true
the picture you see is no portrait of me
let's do it anyway
but stop acting like a child
but i do the best that i can
far and wide
who cant decide
but never be a burden
i swear it's getting warmer
so here's what you've got to do
or who i'm talking to
what did i do anyway
we can shake the blues away
with different people
we're driving down that highway
be with you there on the other side
my vague emotions one day will find
another day goes by and all i do is cry
hold on it's never enough
you lost the faith within your heart
but that's the way that i can win
sister ray said i love you
that's all that matters
sister ray said i love you
today the wind is blowing hard
that i had to go to sea
and not just still survive
tells me what i should do
and not just still survive
i cant get enough of this
my heart is burning
return my heart yeah make it feel like it does at the start
we're having the time of our lives
swear to god he needs no other
well we had a party in our hotel last night
you know what you did was so unkind
one thing you hold
all the times it takes to complain
i know what i'm saying
you're not being cool with me
you took my sight from me
yes you'll come back to me
what it takes to make you my lover
i wake up every night
it was always special
covered by the sky
i try to remember
the traces of your memory
i remember you it's gonna change
there on the floor thirty years or more
you've got to pull yourself together man
remember in the park where we used to play
you just cant believe me
you just cant believe me
you tell me you need me i'll make it this time
in a field of snow
nobody knows
i'm a poor man if you leave me
with your love you could feed me
whenever you're here with me
it comes and it goes and it frightens me
inside my soul inside my soul
deeply moved beyond all consolation
then please dont turn away
and us and he's and i'll fall
has he rememberd to not despise us
it was like no other morning
is it really such a sin
but i cant change the way that i am
hid in a long peaceful night
but never guess how the him would scream
every second counts
when i am with you
i think you are a pig
it always stays in place
every little counts when i am with you
in a spare sideways glance
cause we know love is real
with a single breath this world is gone
this world is gone
to justify the things i do
so get up off the grass
how could i fail to give her
this world is gone
is this the way that you wanted to pay
can you see your own dark face
dont let anybody tell you what you should do
i heard it all before i've heard it all before
i said oh oh how i cannot bear the thought of you
empty
you know i've met a lot of cool chicks
it is wild and it cant be cought
i need your love you and me just cant go wrong
i need your love will you help me find it
i need your love
you and me just cant go wrong
like a bright light on the horizon
this second look
he'll get you flying he'll get you flying
like a bright light on the horizon
but you couldnt walk the extra mile
hey now who's that with you
you've gotta lift that heavy load
i am for you will enjoy i can give you
no more mistakes like the last one
and we'll all get high down the ' side
it's a crazy world
take the world
it's so far away and it seems to travel in
it's so far away and it seems to travel in
gullet stretches tight and it breaks
our whole lives waking up
you're how i wanna be just how i wanna be baby
you are so good for me you are so good for me
you are so good for me you are so good for me
but you're gone
it aint the way it has to be
i've got to let you know i've got to let you know
with mountains lakes and the human race
i'll never let you go
i see a thousand people just like me
when it hurts thou
i just smile
it didnt hurt me too much to find
there's no today and there's no tomorrow
i havent time to sympathise
but yesterday is gone
were you abandoned in your youth
when you turned your back on me
how many times before
the keeper of a major key
so much my enemy
cant you see
and almost anything that you see
and some help from god
my convictions could not lie
i did not know why
inside dimension lies another sacrifice
ship sails out to sea away from me i just stand and stare
one time didnt do it
morning night and day
two drinks are far too much
so if you think that it wont get you
i just want some action
tell me now what do i do
and tell me why i never met you
i didnt care what other people would say
i've searched all these places but never found you
all the jagged edges disappear
i want a little bit
take the skin and peel it back
it let's pick away at it
and on and on
and on and on
i will be beside you before long
held against your forehead
shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
the biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
dont try to tell me that some power can corrupt a person
trading in my god for this one
you get me closer to god
through every forest above the trees
but i watched it way too long
i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground
now just this hole it's open wide
come again some other day
i was up above it
i used to be so big and strong
used to think was me is just a fading memory
break you
just might be true
we fit perfectly
just how damaged have i become
and i cant turn back
on this track
i just do what i've been told
sometimes i think i'm happy here
a little bit comes bleeding through
it took you to make me realize
covered in hope and vaseline
get down make love
make love
in fact its too much
you wanna cool down
getting a little erratic here
nothing to worry about
i think i'm losing my grip but i can still make a fist
between what i've been trying so hard to see
how hard is it to see
and it burned so bright
with the color of your skin
and we see the light
my god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
i am every fucking thing and just a little more
how did we ever get by without you
no sign of heaven anywhere in sight
runs up my arms 'til i'm on track
empty
but i do
fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around
and i see everything i've done
our bloated belly's still not full
i got my fist
lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies
she asked to take my hand
i got my plan
empty
that's what i get
i beat my machine it's a part of me it's inside of me
the me that you know is now made up of wires
down on your knees
we think we've climbed so high
there are some ones that can help themselves
try so hard to make the pieces all fit
isnt that really what you wanted now
i pick things up
there are times plenty of times
and i keep it warm
i'd listen to the words he'd say
empty
in a world full of ugliness
hoping someone can see
i was like you
well i know what you mean
cold metal in my hand
will she come
and all that could have been
in arms of undertow
with their shiny satellite
hold your breath
and i control you
mr self destruct
i give you all you need to know
and i control you
i give you all you need to know
of how much you have to learn
we will not let you in
we crawl
we crawl
got to keep it on the surface
i did not believe
i'm becoming less defined as days go by
no it doesnt really matter anymore
and i just made you up to hurt myself
there is no fucking you
things arent as pretty
you get the key to my heart
i wanna say all those things
too fucking physical
my little piggy needed something new
i dont care anymore
there was a time when it used to mean just about everything
watch the white
please i dont ever want to make it stop
so tell me all your secrets
the sooner that she gets it the better it will be
she spread herself wide open to let the insects in
need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
see the safety of the life you have built
and if you look at your reflection
you can live in this illusion
is it all you want it to be
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you
i'll be dying for your sins
deeper than the sea
the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
empty
you didnt hurt me nothing can hurt me
i am purified
doesnt that feel good
and if she says come inside i'll come inside for her
even when it's bowling shapes and see your life begin to change
i am denial guilt and fear and i control you
i am the need you have for more and i control you
you give me control
and your strain
your need for me has been replaced
you make this all go away
grey would be the color if i had a heart
i just want something i can never have
slave screams he's being beat into submission
slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall
just some flesh caught in this big broken machine
i have never been there
the look in your eye
i collect
made the choice to go away
how could i ever think it's funny how everything that
everything you do
empty
no you cant take it
you're going to get what you deserve
empty
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
i awake
we're tied to
and again
how much i've tried to
but i remember everything
on my liar's chair
goes away in the end
you know how this world can beat you down
i do not want this
you would know wouldnt you
i do not want this
i want to do something that matters
i remember sometimes
the smell of sunshine
it is watching us
you can find a better a place
can you see it
all the one's that arent allowed to stay
i cannot make this feeling go away
why does it have to be this way
and when the day arrives
i'm going all the way down i'm leaving today
come come come on you've gotta fill me up
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive
i want you to break me
for you to go and take this to smash it apart
we cover ourselves with lies
i believed i could get better with you
i give you all that you want
now doesnt that make you feel better
maybe maybe just once i get what's coming
you know
i thought i deserved just a little more
what you want from me
hey can we stop
i define myself
we've had enough of you now
countdown to the end but make it go faster
this is your disaster
but inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold
for the blood
i keep holding on to what i want to believe
the more i stay in here
isnt anybody stopping me
as far as i have gone
nothing quite like the feel of something new
this is the only time i really feel alive
you're the only one that's understood
you make me hard when i'm all soft inside
it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
na na na nah
up to us to decide
you will change your ways and you will like this
i will keep on
and now you're one of us
now you know
empty
now you know
all i do
after all i've tried
they tell us what we can and cannot do
we can leave all the past behind
all used and beaten up
until the very end of you
the deeper the wound i'm inside you
all that we were is gone we have to hold on
you're the queen and i'm the king
all the pieces dont fit
help me to know
trying and lying
of wishing i was ending
trying and lying
wish there was something real in this world full of you
she comes along
to what you were
she will not let you go
for a little bit of time even made it work okay
you cant change anything
your hand
in the hour of our twilight
and did you ever really find when you closed your eyes
i need an easy friend
i do pick a number too
but i cant see you every night
you could shit upon the stairs
where the world is nowadays
my baby taught me how to leave
everyone is gay
empty

you need a path to cross
i want to describe you
to prove i'm right
the happy ones are near

everybody else surrounded by the girls

hey you with the wedding dress on
hey you with the eyes full of hope

and what shall i give up for you
and if you lived here you'd be home now
some casual light days
it cant be sincere
then whistle

i've got no time for bedtime stories
i'm not a little girl
somebody's going to get in trouble
put down that teddy bear
nobody's looking now nobody's looking
when it gets bad

i really cant control myself
in my head
in my head
one half wont do
if i was sometimes played upon
how much do you
oh it's my life oh its my life
ladder start to clatter with fear fight down height
and the revered and the right right
every motive escalate automotive incinerate
the other night i dreamt of knives continental drift divide
it's time i spent some time alone
exactly where i stand
for me to run and hide
guess i'm some kind of freak
that's all that you'll let me be
twiddle dum there's no comparison
with my backstage wristband
i save 'em up then they'll go real far
i save 'em up put 'em in a jar
i sure am greedy
time is up what's left is over
i take the leftovers
this one strong should be labeled as a hazard
it's only been a year
snakes in my path wanna smile up at me
all i do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
now let me blow ya mind
dont believe i'll show you take you with me

in a spin
depending on the different phases

the magic's in the make up
my makeup's all off
so tell me what is going on
dont get me started
i'm fine and nothing's gonna knock this girl down
get get get in line and settle down
i'm trying to get a hold on this
get in line and settle down
so telling me would be wrongly so
empty
for a long time i was in love
i always was the one with all the love
the longer that i wait the more selfish that i get
while you're sailing the nile
you take out a bottle of rum yum
you wont be sailing you'll be sinking
it is leaking and you're still drinking
you're barely barely barely keeping afloat
and in the night i sleep
and some day
control control control
control the cycle
today is my birthday
with your body in bloom
and you're feeling real
you're only sixteen
of rotten neighborhoods
well you're only sixteen
open the basket
hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war
those who were sold out by a corporate board
deep inside the general despises himself
forked tongues spread the poison with another toxic sting
listen to the flute play
i chose a road when i was young
or because my eyes are closed too tight
from now on i will behave
would i redeem my moral vows
sometimes i find myself blind
from now on i will behave
from now on i will behave i will behave
i said it
it's groovin
the ground is shakin under me he ohh yeah

the ground is shakin under me
sometimes i feel like i just passed you by
never ever ever gonna be the same
do you remember how it was
do you remember how it was
i'm walking into spiderwebs
i'm planning my escape
i gotta screen my phone calls
and i'll call you back
it's all your fault no mattter who calls
so now that it is all out
why cant you keep a secret
but i cant begin to tell you
how bad i feel about it hey
im the dandy highwayman who youre too scared to mention
stand and deliver your money or your life
try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife
i know i shouldnt
i cant stop staring
we're gonna start the fire
go on and get the lighter
are you still mad at me
climb in love with me
get over here and complete me
and harsh words are deafened by love
the lights are shining down upon you and i
the love i have for you makes me numb
do do do do do do do do do do
and everything i chose
so deep inside she had to know
to my best friend my faded lover
everything i do
for everything there is a reason
then we will know it will show
everything always in time is gone
the food is eaten and the boat is docked
everything's wrong
that's all i say i say no more
everything's wrong
when you knew that we were different completely
i find myself trying to change you
i'm another ex girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
i'm holding sings up
empty
please make space for me in the time yet to be
and there's a force
a little of your time
it all comes full circle

for us to hang out
and there are flowers above to my surprise
i anticipate us making out
and honestly you can trust me
empty

la la la
too many years with too many tears
you came in with the breeze

imagining all the worst thoughts

it would take a lifetime to explain
for better or for worse different people
enough dj's come enough enough stylee

and i cant believe it
t'was a cold christmas eve when trevor and the skins
trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
if god came down on christmas day
you could be right
and the shortest nights
i cant stay away
one more summer
you're my lover
hiding all your feelings
but you just wont let me in
hurry hurry hurry hurry

he hopes he does not
he says if i should ever cause you to bleed
please dont be sad for me
we're playing it again
and the same old song
we're playing it again
but you know that will never be
you still keep looking for your dream
i'm just nevertheless here for me
that's just me that's just me
eyes wide open you still keep looking
you're looking for your dream
so better to climb than to face a fall
which in return save me strength for the climb
and i cant turn back now
i'm getting closer
i dont think it can fade
but enough's never enough to make a dent
it's too real now
you all are the people they're runnin around
huh well that's not my bag
total hate total hate
price increased the cost
whose dreams are buried
but now it's written in stone
welcome to the tragic kingdom
as tiny little dwarfs
welcome to the tragic kingdom
my mind rides and slides as my circuits are
light only enters from a crack or a hole
just hope that that switch wont stick
and we're all we're trapped in a box
broken promise to be around for my mind war
i'm under some construction
i'm under some construction
i'll be fine
empty
do you have something to hide and you cant show it
i'm so scared of what i might find there
oh i cant take it
i'm so scared of what i might find there
i wanna look down in your eyes
you're really lovely
and giving me your best
i've seen right through and underneath
your kisses and your sweet romancin
you've used up all your coupons
underneath it all
why's it have to end
and dont leave me behind
'cause i'm in trouble help me
if they can put up with me
and baby i got to i know i have to
though down deep inside i wish you would change
empty
when you buried in solitude
whatever you did it's got me glued
all i can do is wait for you you always had my number
empty
if you give me some back then i would be shinin
empty
empty
where's your lovin
up to their shenanigans
we understand who takes the blame
i'm not sure if i like
to make the world go 'round
'cause the pill has an awful taste
the next you're gone
'cause i know that you know how
and let's make and end
he only knows what he may
he only knows what he's trained
you cant teach an ol dog new tricks
you cant teach an ol dog new tricks
we're knocked down and getting up
i cant seem to walk away from this
it cant be understood
i cant take it
the end is calling
the phantom's aeon
the plague got in hold
the people were standing strong
when all is lost and nothing is gained
the sun fades away as a distant flame
passing away through the eye of the storm
had come forth
the one to ride again
they run from the curse for they dread
what lies in the path for me
destiny's calling screaming in anger
we are standing proud and strong
fight them all
the propheey tells of the powers so strong
an earthquake is shaking the ground
see all the secrets in the unknown
beyond the valley lies a neverending force
beyond this world lies a secret
their message is leading the way
fighting for our survival striking back with force
a season of decay
commencing the distortion
stand in the gateway to hell
the devil laughs by my side
the tide will take a turn will make us drift ashore
before the break of dawn
in a time of blood and fire
hear us prince of darkness
the seven gates we see
but you wont hear
give me a sign i'll carry on
only brave men with hearts of steel
beyond the stars to find the pentagram
to a land beyond the stars
battle begins
but the treasures are found
onward they ride always side by side
they will never give in
they will never give in
lives forever
the ring that she wears
by the rightful owners strong demand
petrified heart eases the pain
over valleys and hills
riding along the skyline flame
dyed in black
sword of steel will laude the one
standing lost at a crossroad
whose fate will be sealed
by the sword it settles
will keep our faith alive
below the unknown truth
serpent of death child of the darkness
eyes lit with fire a snake in disguise
feel the rage and the strike of the iron force
a knight is sworn to valour
before fear do your work
heed the command
you bear the powers of a second sight
your name is carved in stone
of your time long gone
no savior uo high
your soul will be free
search the inner soul
salvation is the crime
this cant be real wake up in time
the fury of madness the power of dreams
unholy powers are taking control
ride hells in fury an evil in believe
wake up dead
riding out in the storm
side by side
we could fight 'till the end
pride for the ones who died for the cause
would gather again so see through the eyes of
stare through the eyes of the
glory victory forever hail
the storm shall howl and now descend
a bell will ring inside your head
and all will be brand new
i dont know what it is
you want to be alone
what's sleepin in our soul
the things that sleep inside
what's sleepin in our soul
because we need
is it time to doubt is it time to wait
maybe your time is coming
to go through all the things that i want to be
you're gonna make a better day
wont you make me walk into the light
when you find out
tonight this is your life
tonight this is your life this is your life
as long as they've got cigarettes in hell
i dont mind not being immortal
your shit jokes remind me of digsy's
but all right now yeah yeah
and i know you'll understand
cos in a car you can go far
who had a face like a nun in pain
and all my friend are there at the bar
cos in a car you can go far
you're the hero that's still unsung
specially when your hands are tied
but you dont care because you're living fast
you're the un invited guest who stays 'till the end
i just avert my eyes to the pain
if you gave me a fresh carnation
i just sat back and i let it go
no one's gonna fight in a ten bob revolution
i feel like a bona fide
no one's gonna fight in a ten bob revolution
bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
chained to all the places that he never wished to say
the thoughts that i've conveyed
it doesnt make it all right
you wanna be who you'd be
you gotta roll with it
you gotta roll with it
i think i've got a feeling i've lost inside
brought his lines in yesterday
it's twenty five a side and before it's dark
round are way it's alright
we as people are just walking 'round
so we dont ask why
or a sad song
so we dont ask why
throwing it all away
by the time just keep on ticking
you missed the moon on monday morning
everyone can see the sun
but your mind was very old
i've been driving in my car with my friend mr soft
when i was just sixteen
cos my heart's been keeping old
you're in all my thoughts of passion
she done things i never expected
do you know what i'm saying
she's got a cousin
coz i'll be you and you'll be me
and every which way we turn
every night we hope and pray
slide away and give it all you've got
now that you're mine
slide away and give it all you've got
in the morning when you dont know what to do
they told me i lost my mind but
it would for me
you can pitch your gold against my soul
but you gotta get shattered
some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say you get what you've been given
itchin in the kitchen once again
give her all the love she gives to me
talk of better days that have yet to come
they only seem to come and go away
my heart will never be your home
and come what may we're unstoppable
may your smile may your smile
and stop crying your heart out
take what you need
we're all of us stars
take it for what it is its only drunken lies
you wont get
you should open up your mind look to the future
life is a strange thing now
there's just no place for a street fighting man
hey said my name is called disturbance
yer hear yer head a banging on the door
but i'm not sure if it ever works out right
but you wont get it for free
cos your thoughts and words wont last forever more
give me your autograph
no body can see him
she's sniffin in her tissue
no body can ever hear him call
and the good times are growing
we're going where the grass is free
you could be me and pretty soon you will be
somewhere right between the eyes
you and me see how we are
wont ever make you cry
i wanna talk tonight
it'll be so nice to hear you sing
i'll scratch a star for breath along the way
it'll be so nice to hear you sing
but not in your hand
and they all laugh at your despair
never did explain
and you may have your quiet life
and i'm howling at the moon
like a hurricane
like a hurricane
the clouds around your soul dont gather there for nothing
no it just wont let you go
you've gotta find your own way home
and i get so high i just cant feel it
he said son the bills waiting
i cant get a life if your hearts' not in it
but i'm not complaining
i cant get a life if my hearts' not in it
will dance if they want to dance
it's up to us to make
you know they're gonna go
i'm about to do what you say
all night
get outta my way
it is not dying
and love is everyone
it is not living
everywhere i go
love one another
turn it up for everyone
we'll amuse ourselves
we'll amuse ourselves
but that couldnt be
i heard that the shine's
learning to fly
it's just a case of never breathing out
how long's it gonna be
before we get on the bus and cause no fuss
you know it's no fun
whatever you say
but i hope you know
but i hope you know
thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
today is gonna be the day
i dont believe that anybody feels
you're my wonderwall
there are many things that i would like to say to you
said maybe
each and every day
love will find a way
slowly walking down the hall
wake up the dawn and ask her why
caught beneath the landslide
how many lives are living strange
in a champagne supernova
where were you when we were getting high
and my enemies all know my name
yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way
panic is on the way
bet you aint got much to say
a whole other world in my mind
the world that i want deep inside
nah nah nah
blowing my mind
waiting for my memories
and her soul will never be denied
i said to her
you might even think you're gonna call
you might even think you're gonna call
she go let it out she go let it in she go let it out
are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
i hate the way that you've taken back
i wanna be a millionaire so can you take me there
you could be my railroad
is that such a crime
no one could take us
my body feels young but my mind is very old
you cant give me the dreams that are mine anyway
and doesnt know where to run
to the tears of a clown
the days are long and the night will throw you away
there aint no sense in feeling lonely
'til the life i knew comes to my house and says
yeah yeah yeah
tell me tell me tell me the answer
yeah yeah yeah
helter skelter
but nothing is gonna keep us together
just for one day
over our heads
we can be heroes
here's more to the picture than meets the eye
i hitched a ride with my soul
i thought that i heard someone say now
what is written inside of your head
feel no shame cos time's no chain
what am i gonna do while i'm looking at you
i took a walk with my fame
feel no shame cos time's no chain
or living inside of my skin
by the side of the road
there's no time for running away now
and can be so
i choose to devour with ease now
see how they run iike pigs from a gun see how they fly i'm crying
crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
i am the eggman oh they are the eggmen oh i am the walrus goo goo g'joob
see how they fly like lucy in the sky see how they run
see how they smile like pigs in a sty see how they snied i'm crying
he sits upon a throne
and i know i'm not alone
and it's got me on my knees
i can see it comin but i just dont know
it's got me on my knees
it's got me on my knees
you gotta make it happen
is it my imagination
to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for
i need shades cause the sun is blinding
now i can feel the rain
i feel a chill in the air
all this confusion nothings the same to me
i can see the signs but they're not very clear
and i dont know why
at your door
oh no
so you think we have a lazy time
so cum on feel the noize
we'll get wild wild wild
alright so cum on feel the noize spoken
i'll pick you up at half past three
if you would come to mine for tea
i'll give you strawberries and cream
so dont go away say what you say
the feelings that are wrong
stand up beside the fireplace
so i start the revolution from my bed
dont look back in anger
and live in the sky
it's alright
we can just forget
well it's alright
about feeling down
well it's alright
about feeling down
i think i know but i dont know why
all my people right here right now
get up off the floor and believe in life
was not concerned
while we're living
now my life has turned
we only get what we will settle for
they fade away away away
without a doubt
that follows me
cos life is well tried and it bores me
to the days when i was lost and lonely
empty
all those lies man they still bore me
these things they really dont matter now
could make you sing like a bird released
i bet you knew right away
could make you sing like a bird released
i bet you knew right away
i bet you knew right away
kids are running around naked fuckin in the bushes
room for everybody here
i'm all for it
but no one knows why there's a spirit in the sky there's escape for no one
i hear my heart beatin faster
he will understand while i take him by the hand that life's time tunnel is long
you're gonna stay tonight
i'm locked up in chains
wont you let me be
there's no one else to blame but me
i know exactly where i'm going
cos i will show you all the way
i dont mind i think they're crazy
waiting for that sleepy feeling
float upstream
let there be love
let there be love
everybody knows that it's no crime
if i ever knew
it's a crime
so come outside
would never be the same
and lived their lives instead yeah
the days'd never end
maybe the dreams that we dream are gone
we're getting better man
all i want to do is live by the sea
all i want to do is live by the sea
my life is standing still but i'm still alive
and how does it feel like
and how does it feel like
and how does it feel like
who kicked a hole in the sky so the heavens would cry over me
but if it makes you happy
let's all make believe
that all mankind's gonna feed our brother
that in the end we'll all grow up
it was time to say goodnight
what's the time said today
they wont let you say
no i dont mind being on my own
no i dont mind being on my own
as little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
thank you for your smile
you swam the ocean like a child
in the morning rain
how your garden grows
we see things they'll never see
i believe in lovers
leave me to love
love me and leave me
she believes in everything
she's the queen of all i've seen
but his mind
i'll have my say
there's no need for you to say you're sorry
i dont care no more so dont you worry

leaving the the traces forgotten the faces
in a world too much
basking in the light
as you walk the line

fast sports cars and motor noise

black sabbath iommi
sunday's satisfaction monday's home and dry

oo wow echo
a deadly poison a hot and heavy load
so dizzy the poison takes its toll
but your not the first you wont be the last
hail the avenger midnight defender
if you live by the sword
man stands oh knee deep within
victory hour
drawn is a picture of myself
drawn is a picture of myself
slight of hand slight of word
feed my head reflections of a lie
looking down the barrel the feeling of new power
down the dead end street he strikes to kill the weed
said one day you'd be mine
burn her tonight
hey baby dead baby devil he embracin you
with a long forked tongue kiss
driven by the high heat call it love
with a long forked tongue kiss

i wait for salvation come

tell my bride to bury me in stull
tell my bride to bury me in stull
opposite sides of the same fence
not far apart but still
talkin talkin talkin till you're blue
sick and tired of the same ol shit
when it's over cry for sympathy
bless my soul time has come
sometime think before you speak
hit the road
i hope to see you on election day
it's hard sometimes to keep it together
and you're just the kind who's liable to never be found
beware the overdose
look inside inside my soul
is that what you want baby
it's a doll faced polaroid gonna hang it on my wall
you ready here come the pain
turning on the light that blinds me to make it easier to find me
hey hey hey
4 again
listening to what you have to say
as the motors whine
fill it with anger fill it with rage
win or lose this is what i choose
there's no tomorrow for all of you
there's no tomorrow for all of you
there's no tomorrow
when you're standing all alone
without question
when you're standing all alone
life was but a simple dream now all i see is red
i'm coming
i'm just killing time
every time i turn around
into a vord and seal the past
yes i think it's time to kill
today is the first day of the rest a' your life
he's 22 today
time wont go away no it wont
so you're gonna get up
and it goes on and on and on
underneath the gas lamp
under one nation under one
flies are fucking on my face i watch the magots breed
before it all is gone
no more to say
so bite your lip and shut your mouth it's no longer up to you
empty
you never were undying
wait not in a hurry
just enough to keep you down
2 again
stimulate me to satisfaction

they never speak the truth
cause i know that you're gonna die
so you cant see
this the way it has to be
nothing sacred
we are numb to all we see
just one sweep of the wreckin ball
the wreckin wreckin crew
pay in blood i demand
think that you will end it all
your words they go right through me
one more to turn myself insane
you wont deny me
makes my reality fade away
twenty first century
twenty first century schizoid man
it's the best
you know i'm alive
the man with the broken soul
i dont have any plans to go anywhere
but i'm still alive
you know i'm alive
freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face

we never got if off on that revolution stuff
all the young dudes i want to hear ya
all the young dudes hey you there with the glasses
boogaloo dudes how do you feel
in the darkness i can feel
i have fallen from grace and my ashes are scattered
the spirit it never lets go
back on earth
back on earth
then when he's found who he's looking for
they cursed and buried him
listen in awe and you'll hear him bark at the moon
will i believe in you
speculation of the wise
empty
empty
empty
how many more have to die
blood running down like water
i watch them dying in vain
until the judgment day comes
you'll think you got away
watches those flames get higher and higher
if you're alone
bloodbath in paradise
murdered in your bed
and i know it
dont hurt them
you there's hope for you 2x
just hold you
and you swear you like to live your life in danger
nobody hears the things i say
well i know
i've lived so many lives
they freak me out
i tried to so hard to kill
can you hear them
and again
all the voices in my head
they freak me out
you may think it's funny but i dont know why
over the mountain take me across the sky
people around me talking to the walls inside
dont need no astrology it's inside of you and me
can you help me occupy my brain
and so as you hear these words
i'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell
there's no direction i couldnt go
it took him by surprise
my friend
minding my own business
empty
oh no
empty
images of matchstick men and you
it seems it's nothing new
seems to be breaking
mother please show the children
i still find it all a mystery
i never want to live without you
they must be stupid or blind
yes i'm a rock 'n roll rebel
the ministry of joy that still hasnt laughed
joe walsh cover
is better than the way we had
and we dont need the ladies
it's better than the way we had
faith alone has guided me
running out of time
just another lonely broken hero
running out of fate and hope and reason
the execution of your mind
the people who have crippled you
they'll just tell you that you're on your own
dare to look face the test
gold that's brighter than the sunlight
could it be that i'm obsessed with feeding my disease
'cos isnt there to steal
below the surface i dont exist
loser i'm a secret loser
leaving i hate to see you cry
but we'll be together
mississippi queen if you know what i mean
you know that i told her i'd do what i can
while the rest of them dudes were gettin their kicks
with the thrill of it all
approaching a time that is classic
i'm gonna show you a brand new world tonight
so come along and play my game
you cant run you cant hide
'cos in this world of fiction
my jekyll doesnt hide
god only knows what your secret conceals
dont you weep my little man
you saved me
if we're offensive and pose a threat
oh no you'll never know why
oh no you'll never know why
people going nowhere taken for a ride

is it the voice of your laughter
that was once your relief
it's never too late to cry
it's never too late to cry
follow me now and you will not regret
our love grows stronger now with every hour
i'm going to feel
steal my love from me without a prayer
take away the pain and make my heart be brave
i'm running fast but getting nowhere
a foolish picture i live in disgust
no bone movies

but the race is run
i guess their's isnt welcome doesnt time move fast
and then now as the sabbath begins
too late too tell me it's over now
your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
maybe a kiss before i leave you this way
talk to strangers
i'd like to move on and make the most of the night
i've got nothing to hide
i wont ever let go
empty
try so hard to break me but all your diamonds turn to sand
this is why i always come and go yeah
givin it to me anyway that you can
i'm so far up i'm afraid to come back down yeah
you thought you knew but you never
there goes tomorrow
and no begining to my destiny
yeah i looked through the window and surprised what i saw
so i went to the doctor see what he could give me
dont look at me for answers
i dont know
is the end near when is the final day
fools and prophets from the past
i'm looking for a miracle man
such a hypocritical man
now jimmy he got busted
will it be alright tonight
i'm falling to pieces pieces
voices are calling from inside my head
but a shot in the dark one step away from you
but a shot in the dark one step away from you
it's in the lives that we lead
we can never go back
poison the air that we breathe
we can never go back
the point of no return
god bless the almighty dollar
i can see'em
dont leave me on my own tonight
why do you ride to take a fall
you know you'll have to pay the consequence
one day you're here the next you're gone
something blowing in my head
turns my day to frozen hours
let me feel the frost of dawn
i am so tired so tired
and i often sit and wonder why
i am so tired so tired
should i let you in
cant get something that i've never had
will i have to pay
spiders in the night
but when you look
the spider wont forget
all the spiders in the night
beware his bite
you're written in his book
if you feel that you and me
let it be rebellion rules tonight
steal away the night
'cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
but there's no one at home
cream cover
i'm with you my love
the light's shining through on you
alright now
my life is free now my life is clear
all right oh yeah
stole many a mans soul and faith
when i saw it was a time for a change
is the nature of my game
who get killed before they reached bombay
so if you meet me
what's my name
but what's puzzling you
the symptom of the universe a love that never dies
i'm under her thumb
my little tattooed rock n roll dancer
like moths to a flame
war is just another game
today was tomorrow
is all said with tongue in cheek
never what it seems
tell me what you see
will i see the day
give me something that i never had
the burning questions in the castles have still remained
but all of it's gonna burn
in the middle of your little world
you're going to burn
here we go now
i can see it i can see it
it's something that i enjoy
flying high again
mamma's gonna worry
i couldnt give a damn or two about a fool like you
you think you know it you think you know it all
an attitude in all of us
that's true
i think it's time we stop children what's that sound
singing songs and carrying signs
stop hey what's that sound
i feel i've lost my spirit and sold my soul
the nightmare starts for me at night
i have a vision that i just cant control
the nightmares stalk for me at night
there is a person living in my head
the ghost that tells me lies
there is a woman liveing in my head
empty
go go
when i was fighting
all of the talking
and its a beginning of a good time
oh yeah i am ready for a good time
goodbye to friends i tell you
repeat chorus
repeat chorus
i keep saying that it's getting too much
sometimes i dont feel right
i dont wanna live in yesterday
but i'll be with you 'til the end
and i just cant live without you
i'm here for you
and i dont want to disappoint the fools no more
i dont want to hear about it
when i was young i was the nicest guy i knew
but time went by and i was lost in what i'd found
i aint no nice guy after all
empty
we're all gonna die
i cant save you now now now now
theres one way to die
i cant save you now now now now
your future's fading
no use in trying
empty
we going through changes
we going through changes
they'll fight the world until they've won
bombs exploding and tears are flowing chasing rockets and gasping for air
burn the witch and hang deserters there's only one choice to be made
empty
baby i get so scared inside
if i close my eyes forever
in your warm and darkened grave
i'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
the fatal price she paid
you may see the mushroom
countdowns begun
countdowns begun
they're never gonna stop
they're just the result of our society
i've listened to preachers
you gotta listen to my words
empty
i'll introduce myself today
dont speak of suicide solutions
but deep inside i'm afraid
you'll never believe it
you wouldnt believe it
i knew for sure i knew for sure
nothing has changed nothing's the same
i gotta keep rockin cause it makes me crazy
and i will demonstrate my holy power
and i'll persist until the battle's won
screaming at the window
manic depression befriends me
is he trying to get out
everybody knows all the highs and all the lows
it's a feeling it's revealing
like goin nowhere like goin nowhere
i may never know when it comes or when it goes
i dream my life away
who dreams of better days
i'm just a dreamer
dreaming my life away
let's wake up the dead
through the night you hear their cries
i'm praying that you'll never know
more tears are shed
that i'm facing hell
it looks a lot better from here
i dont need another saviour
all fired up i'm gonna go 'til i drop
all my life i've been over the top
dont you try and teach me no original sin
you know it aint easy
dont you try and teach me no original sin
you telling all the people the original sin
there are no unlockable doors
each night when the day is through
one thing and you know it's true
no legitimate kings or queens
some have gone and some remain
for people and things that went before
can he see or is he blind
for the future of mankind
they just turn their heads
and love comes flowing through yeah
has he lost his mind
where he traveled time
nobody wants him
to find a living miracle
watch out there's a lot of thieves about
who's looking through my window
i'd like to stay
you try so hard to quit
you try so hard to quit
tormenting came with a crown full of thorns
but you'll never admit
then can you tell me what the weapons for
marches of protest not stopping the war
killer of giants threatens us all
but now i'm telling you i'm here if you need a friend
time never fails to make the heartache stop
i can take the weight
lay your world on me
when destiny calls
you hear the thunder roar
rockin all night rockin all night
rockin all night rockin all night
living a nightmare
demons and curses that play on our soul
your time has come you'll live to his comand
the killer who remains a mystery
'cos it's just like living
i'm so tired and i dont wanna fight
addicted to the system
the action never stops
why do people love to hate
why do people love to hate
you could have been a better friend to me
hurts so bad it's been so long
you ask me the time of day
sacred words the angels wait for me
save me all my life i've been a liar
there's nothing left of me to devour
or you'll be left with nothing and no one
winds of change that are fanning the flames
the tragedy of synthesizing rhymes
dont blow it all away
oh no
funny clothes tinkling bell
spreading his magic
i think i'm getting out of my range
fire it up
the doctor screams let's go it's party time
therapy therapy therapy
empty
you wont think you're so clever
here we go now
cant stop the deathwatch ticking
it was written in your eyes
i wanted love to stay
the games we play you broke me
driving me insane
i'll see you tomorrow
falling from the sky
i'd call you up in hell
is it just a rhapsody
is it just a rhapsody
dont want your pity or your sympathy
can you see your reflection
too late standing on the trap door
too late standing on the trap door
the court of the selfish
no fear too scared to look up
too late standing on the trap door
i am
i'm an innocent man
and i have the ultimate answer
i'm waiting for darkness
and here i'll stay
it's in their mind
why darkness is overdue
it's what you want to see
i'm waiting for darkness
you may say i'm a miracle man again
she had me hypnotized
that i dont walk on water
the light is guiding eyes
standing in front of me
poisoning their brainwashed minds oh lord yeah
as is where the bodies' burning
after all i'm forever in your debt
however distant dont keep us apart
i love you yeah yeah now and forever
when they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill
but nothing lasts forever
i had a dream that we were through
the things they will do and the things they will say
looking through eyes of time mirrors reflecting their stories untrue
you cant kill rock'nroll it's here to stay
'cause rock'nroll is my religion and my law
twisting the truth
wont ever change may think it's strange
and they dont really know even what they're talkin about
meaning you too
you cant kill rock amp roll it's here to stay
and i never thought you'd say goodbye
but i got an empty felling that you've got the cure
let them hang me
in your eyes is always wrong
your're no different to me yeah
is that envy in your eyes reflecting jealousy
dont know what i'm after
hiding from the laughter
tommy lee james kimball
just when i think i find the words
then i'd make you notice make you see
someday you'll look into my eyes
one more face without a history
modern life is like a battle ground
baby i know you can i know you can
kim richey
on a deep blue satin sky
he said from where he stood
people talkin think i'm alright
they'd be so surprised
there's no way to hide the truth from me myself and i
your memory pulls me under like a strong rip tide
but love me soft and tender and we'll make the rafters ring
verlon thompson ragsdale
empty
john paul daniel hartford medders
with all of this love that i'm saving for you
'til you come into view
you come banging on the screen door
well you look so serious leaning on the frigidaire
that you'd look me in the eyes and say
yeah i've already fallen for you
that's ancient history to me now
that's ancient history to me now
better off finding somebody new
after what you put me through
baby i'm better off blue
might be coincidental oh you just might never know
might be coincidental oh you just might never know
her lips and her dress
blue rose's pedals have been crushed along the way
but blue rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
since we were tall as the corn in the spring
from a seat by the window on wings made of steel
pam tillis dipiero buckingham
yeah that's why he couldnt buy me a ring
even though i caught him dancin last night
ah you know but now the message is loud and it's clear
nursin a pain that wont go away
well it sure can sound good to a hard workin man
are you still in his heart
and there's so much temptation out there
we tried and we tried but it's over
you're no longer in charge on my thinkin
so dont tell me what to do
is steppin into town
just 'cause you cant see these chains
doug gill
this love dont make no sense
i love you i love you let me whisper in your ear
how 'bout we just get out of here
it's a slow smoky scene at the county line cantina
she sings the saddest song you ever heard
so bittersweet
tequila mockingbird tequila mockingbird
heaven knows he cant go with her
and he rolls all by himself
heaven knows she cant go with him he cant go with her
but you dont have one single scar as far as i can feel
i guess they just dont break 'em like they used to
then i had fire at midnight
thunder and roses
someone that soothes my heart
no denying
i'll get a pizza and a movie we both wanna see
we must be thinking alike
dying to call you on the telephone
other arms other lips
but that's not what we're hearing from our hearts
everytime that you walk in the room
i can feel that something pounding in my brain
so they tore his heart in two
he cant abide a cold bedroom
trying to escape the truth
the sheets are fresh
it doesnt really mean alot
with someone to love
i saw you at the club actin so in love
i remember those sweet nights with you dear
you're going to hear me in that melody
you dont miss
you dont miss
with your right on the money honey kiss
and every move is for effect
and everybody things you're it
teach me how to be weird
now every little thought is a bridge to cross 'cause everyone's a memory of you
bruce hornsby hornsby
listen to my tears roll down my face as he turns to go
listen to my tears roll down my face as he turns to go
listen to my tears roll down my face as he turns to go
maybe it was you maybe it was me
maybe it was southern summer nights
talking that way so soft to me
maybe it was you maybe it was me
my mother's lullaby that train that ran behind our home
he takes me in his arms and rocks his melancholy child
it's a never ending circus ride
let my passion set you free
i go where the wind blows
and we fought to keep our love alive
we always will remember when
and we'll never never be the same
i walked into the club last night
god i hate to lose you but there's no way i can win
now there's one thing i know that's when to cash 'em in
i didnt say a thing i let you run wild 'til your love pierced me like an arrow
i'm outta here gone without a tear yeah i cried'em all away
but not me
i'm gonna have to learn to live without
what's left of my heart will have to be strong
your leaving is leaving more room for doubt
i must have changed my clothes
should i even care
please let him be the right one
oh what a perfect night this has been
please please let him be the right one
please let him be the right one
oh yeah she's a popular girl
she's dont know she's just another falling star
today the neighborhood tomorrow the world
come on over anytime
give me a chance to soften your mistake
well i know just where you're coming from
and you think by now it would've turned to stone
when there were no easy answers
it's been kicking around since '72
you know jealously it is a bitter as a green spring berry
and if you take my love for granted baby
til i feel your love fallin all around me
i'll shake the sugar tree
i cant believe i did that look
and lonely for way too long
but there's no use crying over spilled perfume
no use crying over spilled perfume
we've got a fine fine very fine love
it's so fine fine very fine love
seemed like a good time at the time rolling down that track
and the wayward child he never talks about still turns up in his prayers
and she's leaving in the morning soon as she can find her wings
is that point of no returnin
is that last bridge burnin
how gone is goodbye
i've got credit cards
if i need another way to hurt myself
if i need another way to hurt myself
aint tried cigarettes
oh oh i said a prayer for you baby
sorry 'bout the lightnin bolt
there's room at my table why dont you pull up a seat
i've had my moments when i could get lost in the sound
i could sure use your company now
but it might take me a little while
i might end up lonely again
it aint easy bein under the gun
but believe me baby
there's people out there tryin to look like they're havin fun
we got such a good thing here
and it might have been easier to leave you alone
that you've built around your heart
now there's signs of life and there's signs of hope
they're out there with the boys
and there's a hunger fame and fortune cannot fill
killer comfort
teardrops fallin hard on the cold cold ground
somebody loves you baby cant you see
somebody loves you baby cant you see
and confessed all his sins in one night
when it's all said and done
and she lets that pony run
it's a potentially dangerous situation
we just cant turn our backs on a feelin like this
you should never resist
oh baby let's get crazy
and love must live much closer to the ground
when i'm just a man
when i'm just a man
i said to myself that guy is a little bit gun shy
i'll take you unaware
my heart's learned a trick or two
my skin is cold transfusion with somebody morose and
empty
a nazi gangster jew it beats a dog that's dead
i vent my frustration at you old man after
but these years of detachment have left me with
i'm shoving my life right down your throat can i
what deceiving now i'm unwhole
i've come my past
pissed on
demanding plea for unity between us all
no fucking surrender
i'm born again with snakes eyes
abduction the oath
empty
praying for his god to prevail
sworn to make
and when she died
i wonder aloud
i didnt care to look around
i will unlock my door
spilling on me
the indescribable
evicts convicts
clash with reality
she's the kind
never givin her love
beggin to please
never givin her love
they say the bad guys wear black
aint talking no tall tales friend
cant lock me in your cage
'cause high noon your doom
daughters of the queen
to live her life all alone
isnt it about time
daughters of the queen
death rattle shaking
like deadly snakes death rattle shakes
you're gonna get away
cause i know
task complete
this is dime
1 barricade your door
of panterabeware
i was me but you werent you you were sticking to me like
to sever from my siamese twin
you're fucking and sucking you're friendless it's endless
i'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me
world saver a fake god rests dead inside you
slaughter the pig the self rightous king for your own
you're working for perfect bodies perfect minds and perfect
hard as a rock shut like a lock
this intention forever stronger than all
would you look at me now
but who's to blame
dont you try to die like me
when a mind's made up to go ahead and die
now in times when society needs us
you rob a dead mans grave then flaunt it like you did create
that's right
happened before us
through this trouble and decay
yet we're stronger and prevailing
we thrive on what's stronger than most of the world
ringwormcrabs and lice ecstasy speed and horse
you must admit that you mimic the weaklings
love was twisted and pointed at you
and sometimes i feel so sorry
type of pain you really dig and long for i've always been
this shit goes on and on just look down my pants
without judgement
like a scraping it's entrapment boy in a pocket balls in
there is a place
heads are falling
armies of the past
prayed to the terrifier
magic mystifier
what do i do
chorus respect walk
truly fuck the world for all it's worth every inch of planet
judges what i am in one paragraph look here fuck you all
fuck you all
empty
never turned our backs on why we're here
out of hate i'll isolate myself
out of strength you know we speak the truth
before eternity beckons
goodbye mystery
yesterday dont mean shit
they'll tell you about guilt
empty
you recognize it while some ignore it
empty
who bears an evil mark
to lure you to steal your gift
to self indulgent ties
seeping down to the bone
it has given me life beyond life i take
life's ending slay in different designs
and your godforsaken ending to life
bones in traction
i feel a conquering will down inside me
there comes a time within everyone
no one can piss on this determination
i wont be defensive
no stand
no good
held live alone without variety
hungry and hunting
onward we rock
onward we rock
wreckless crew abandon me
can you find out
to uphold the profession
the price that you must pay
the earth a purple blaze
i'll never turn it down
this force will never stop
melt it down to the core
there's a double standard for the way we live
i wont take stock in a withered man
i call 'em as i see 'em
i dont care if they
love it or leave it
i wont start to
empty and sweating
it's time to set my demons free
frustration has taken it's control
you want my money
your mind laid to rest
one chance at one thing
made it my own
i fight for love of brother
and the seventies a breath after the war
from now on cant look the other way
revolution is my name
hear somebody scream
it's alright
life is drivin me insane
locked up
right on the edge
all of us one of us all of us
then when confronted we ask them the question
of the common sympathies
fights to live
to destroy
we all
domination consumes you
your eyes will see
is reaching out divinity
the dawn of the day
body suspended by chains over razors
you could take in
erase the end dissolving disgrace is needed more
so i'm done with saving you a gift unto myself a
sandblast yourself
all across your
see the ladies
empty
drag the waters some more
the premonition of the beckoning end the end
your language unheard of the vast sound of tuning out
i've been waiting
empty
empty
tonite could be the nite
your verbal masturbate
empty
you seem to miss the point
that rape steal and murder
they put it in your head
there is a part of me that's always sixteen
the change in you is goddamn electric
and then you'll know yourself
goddamn electric system
sometimes i thought you might be spying living out some
to fuck
my soul for a goat yet i'll outlive the old
simply to thy ghost i cling
in this for the ride
'fore its too late
and i dont even know your name
snakes in southern flames
facing fears that you'll overcome and one
cant you see
it's their fucking decision
people they go to war
so they can lick my sack
we seemed like bothers
lord how we miss him
just flesh and bone
he as hollow as i alone
i might eat
it's what i want
but i'd like
a child of fire
i i am the night
tender angels of mercy
i wonder if we'll smile in our coffins while loved ones
blood too young for ones delusion the lifestyle cost
empty
tony arata
sums up the richest and poorest of us
these handfuls of dust
i dont fall in love as a rule
i let my guard down
if i call
that i'm a little bit in love with you
do you really want to know
goin through what's left of what used to be
a little on the lonely side
forgetting you is not that hard to do
forgetting you is not that hard to do
got the house on the market
after all
tell me it's not what it seems
they say it's a common thing
after all
the last thing i need's a shoulder
this broken heart is bound
but there's something
the world on a platter
to make a breakthrough
all i need is not to need you
oooh love has gone wrong
baby's gone blues
baby's gone blues
two timing double dealing
gonna get a bad break oh yeah
are you headed for a heartache oh yeah
mean mistreating loving heart
blue is not a word at all
as long as i'm with you
blue is not a word at all
picture this and paint it blue
we'd be lying side by side
a photograph of me and you
why must i always
on the lost and lonely ones
well i can be found
i hang around
well there's a honky tonk
blue side of town
you can find me hanging out where the music's turned loud
i cant get enough
we only get one time around
i hunger for your love it never gives me any slack
chains chains shackles and chains
chains chains shackles and chains
it just aint right
it just aint right
so thoughtlessly
makes me feel things that tear me apart
i was born with a jealous bone
if i dont learn to let you go
with anyone else
baby open up that bottle
i wanna watch these broken dreams
but all the pain and sorrow
we are miracles of science
because you turned to me last night
that we might get our fingers burned
standing right outside your heart
we've both been lonely too long
that's closer now than it's been
there i'll drown my sorrows
and the shadows that have dogged me since i cant remember when
lonely days lonely nights
missing you with all my might
i think i've ever been
empty
what goods a promise
that i can hold on to
that i'm on
on the lonely side of love
but what i found was never enough
this time i wont run away
now that i found you
she's watchin the clock on the wall
there's a lonesome fool waiting
they're just one call away
until each heart is willing
mr man in the moon
while you shine
are you really blue
and as sure as your love changes in the wind
so sad when your innocence is gone
so sad when your innocence is gone
and anytime you need a friend
could ever love you like i do
way on past the boulevards
and it's downto just the trucks and me
and the only thing i know for sure
i feel an old weakness coming on strong
just when i believe i can leave it alone
empty
i cant get no consolation
and if you want the rest of me
just doin the best i can
we drive into the sunset
on down the line
through the clouds still hang around me
there're some words i said i wish i had back again
is it heavens way of sayin i can let you go
in this lovin game
going on overtime
get leaving off your mind
stay with me baby
we're going on overtime
till could not lift my head up
the human heart's a fragile thing
i saw all of my tomrrows
so she wrote it out in lipstick on your satin sheets
she drew a broken heart
she drew a broken heart and put your name inside
there's a place deep in her soul a place she'll always hold
the leaves are off the trees
eddie had a few days comin
just another old sailor
her face was a little pale
and somewhere tonight in the neon light
just holdin each other
and comin apart
than a slow healing heart
i still remember those cutting remarks
nothing moves slower
once for me to say i do
i want to be there
present to live for this here girl
that was some blue moons ago
baby love's not touch and go
baby here today
some blue moons ago
someday i will lead the parade
alls forgiven from the past
and louder
that lonely sound
i'll just hear these sounds
since you've gone
i dont know why it has to be so hard
more than i ever knew
you know how to heal
i dont know what i'd do without you
right through the door came a tear stained letter
i went for the phone but the line was busy
but i just dont like this feeling in me
set it all down in a tear stained letter
lately we've been missin something
love is wearing at the seams
and that's exactly what i mean
that's the kind of mood i'm in
i'll tell you this
get me goin with the wind now and then yeah
that's the kind of mood i'm in
try to catch the wind and saddle it
darling dont you kid yourself
everybodys equal in the eyes of love
and treat a doggone king like everybody else
hank williams sr
but i cant get you off of my mind
but i cant get you off of my mind
but i cant get you off of my mind but i cant no i cant
i've got to stop loving you
i've got stop dreaming
flows down like tears
empty
someone to love
'cause no one else will do
and nobody else will do
if this is where we're going
baby this is a hook last line and sinker
no place left to go when the good is gone
your heartaches found a home
cant stop myself from loving you
patty loveless
oh how i did
who said she loved you
and who would wait forever
and be true
i couldnt see one day that wasnt more of the same
and i dont want to feel like that
'cause i dont want to feel like that
you know it's true
let's tell the world to leave us alone
i just wanna be loved by you
i just wanna be loved by you
sometimes i miss who i was with you
in spite of all our chemistry
gary burr
i just cant concentrate
everytime i think i might
i forget what i should do
i just cant concentrate
there's alot of games in this old town
but alot of times no
say baby take a chance on me
austin gill
if it's the last thing i do
and i know i'll spend my future
to cry in the dark
a tear may appear when i hold you near
heaven for me has come true
i dont really want somebody else
the best years of our lives
let me go
you had better think again
you had better think again
you had better think again
your here with me in my dreams
and let's start life anew
that might have been
empty
that's enough to make me scream
when you dont know where to turn
about a quarter to nine
a little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
i aint the woman in red i aint the girl next door
i could use a shot of good time in my veins
feelin good about feelin bad
feelin good about feelin bad
i leave you with feelings of love
feelings of love
now i leave it with you
and if i'm in your way
but a woman can hurt
that we cant take the time
i could fly away
and to believe one day
there was a time
and nothing has gone wrong
spending your nights on the town
but i wont
well god does
god does but i dont
there's no place so lonely
misery kept me company
as being half over you
sinkin to his level
almost hittin bottom
yes i'm only going halfway down
at the bottom of your glass
and you know that you're just one step
a long time ago
and i aint comin down
heaven must've sent your love my way
my feet aint touching the ground
no i aint comin down
that's the only kind of love i've ever had
ooh i need somethin to hold on to
how about you
how about that i think you know
i watched my best friend jamie slippin further away
i held a picture of our wedding day
she opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
deborah allen vonhoy
when you're in my arms
and your holding me tight
was only moving me on
you must go
with the dawn
i will try to be strong
i already miss you
if you dont count my wreckless youth
and i came straight to you
thought i walked a twisted trail
i dont have no regrets no i'm not that kind
i might seem improved
he's the last thing
sylvia was workin as a waitress in beaumont
that's when the sun starts comin up
well the music's playin fast and they just met
she doesnt want the night dont want it to end
the party aint over yet
nothin i cant climb i've got the will to find the way
so when the morning comes
the party aint over yet
i know i'll be left to blame
it has ruined the taste of the sweetest lies
i run and hide but there's always another test
right time the right place
who knows how love starts
empty
beyond his wildest dreams to have earned it
i was lucky to feel that way at all
oh i'd give all my dreams
oh i'd give all my dreams
to have you back again to have you back again
and even a fool can pretend they dont care
what makes you grow old is replacing hope with regret
how many nights you cried
how can you love a man
waitin for the phone to ring
he's not there to hold you
it's not what i have
i just have to stop
is a raindrop in the sea
billy joe shaver
i wonder if you'll understand
and they learn to love again
in the twinkle of an eye
i'm riding rails of silver
roses dust and ashes
its just a teardrop
hey baby where you been
i couldnt sleep from worrying
i will stand
oh i couldnt sleep
i'm done puttin up with you
for the day you'll see the light
oh the hell you raise
i can feel the heart of my workin man
he dreamed of riches and finer things
but it's easier when someone cares
you are so good to me
that i get up in the mornin
yes you are everything
matraca berg krekel
walkin around in your old sweaters baby
you can feel bad if it makes you feel better
you can feel bad if it makes you feel better
and now you say you're leaving
you can run from the one you need
there's no place that you can run
you can lie all alone in the dark
and the laundry piled up on the floor
he left the clothes on the floor
so what do i care if you go
you dont get no more no more
empty
empty
you dont get no more
carl jackson wills
more precious than diamonds more treasure than gold
it's a long way off from where i should be goin
i just cant wait to see your face but
i cant wait to see your face
and my wounded pride
then you saved me
your love reached out and saved me
so go ahead and do what you gotta do
it's really not up to me
then you're gonna be back
in the middle of the night
they wouldnt print it in a hallmark card
you're so cool
so i might as well say you roar
yeah yeah ragtop mustang in the summertime
in case you wanted to go
angel of corpus cristi
that time i said 'i know it's true'
why didnt i ask why didnt i
i'm flat out
everybody's god
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
the questions are the answers to questions in themselves
'til room service calls
i'm gonna walk away
listen to the tender behind the open chest in the hall
i'm workin the ballin stores 'n
that sad suck off that shit left me now
liar
but they dont know what you're sayin
no one has a clue
the gauzy thoughts of those dirty scots
and this slap is a gift
and the tones are grouped in clusters
made me make a choice
made me know at once
darlin dont you go and cut your hair
i remember lying
bitch rant down to the practice room
the magic lands call my name
the magic lawns call my name
and fight the day
i's in the socket
why you're complaining ta
a for effort and a b for delivery
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
i'm gonna take the crown i'm gonna take the crown
in a netherland of foreign beads
where you stay where you play
i'm a toughen up
these ends are sickened wars x2
that the desert was a starscape
and she believed she believed in me
this is the city life let's talk about
hes got a chrome plated baby so it knows where it goes
i spent a long time waiting for my hair to recede
ah ooh darlings on the split screen
insane cobra split the wood
you'll just have to wait
listen to me i'm on the stereo stereo
the kaiser has a cyst
lots of details
never held my service
empty
breathin for me now
mixin cocktails with a plastic tipped cigar
every time i sit around i find i'm shot
hate all i touch
i heed the surgeons warning pillars of eights
i've got a heavy coat it's filled with rocks and sand
until it's free i've got a trigger cut
the truth of the words
you will look at me and say
there's no culture
one of us is a cigar stand
trolls in the glen are consorting again
walk with your credit card in the air
lost in the foothills of my mind
out beyond the call of duty
let's drink a toast to all those who arrived alive to tell
we are underused
chim chim chim sing a song of praise
maybe we could dance x3 together
will only bring you years of fear
cant see
it's not my fault
i am not one half of the problem
just hold me back or let me run
loretta's scars 3x
loretta's scars 3x
what i was was a mark inside her hand
but i wont need someone to let me be
no i wont need someone to let me be x2
i've got a mine thats fine
she was never saved
i've got a mine thats fine
empty
fly fly fly fly fly fly fly
i love your tinted eyes
take me down from the ridge where the summer ends
no life has singed her now 3x
drifted apart to find an identical twin
the skies wont sink my soul
the blisters burn my soul
and that's the car to his soul
all the plantings are young and able
fun for an hour til the hour's gone
like a docent's lisp like a damsels spit like a dry gins twist of lime
you cant say it you cant say i'm wrong
they bind you like you want to be broken
jacob you movewhen you move
there's ways of living it's the way i'm living
out on my skateboard the night is just hummin
i dont understand what they mean
tuckin my shirt in
drowning for your thirst
blade gushers gush
rattled by the rush
rattled by the rush
with the fucked up eyes
behind my back before you cross
and take it all
leave them and lead other lives
look for the splinters you might see where they come in
here now i am here nowi am here now
passed out
i need to sleep why wont you let me
goodnight to the rock and roll era
round and round and round and round she goes
no more absolutes no more absolutes
empty
why because i need money work
and the dealer had 21
i make haste
this is a joke
is it a crisis or a boring change
believe in what you wanna do
and you can never quarantine the past
grave architecture x2
stroll past the strip
to put you to war
i dont know which whichwhich
boys are dying on these streets
tied like winshields in the night
on the breeze
but lady you need some cold advice
and i'm the only one who laughs
where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
we'll be waiting waiting where
i'm up on a hill top where i
hit the plane down
there's no survivors
taking over your life
hit the plane down
hit the plane down theres no survivors
some king chooser will wind up with my number
hope the time is right for it
pretend the table is a trust knot
so wait to hear my words and they're diamond sharp
i've got one holy life to live
i'm alone i never wanna be alone
she'll come back to me she'll come back to me
dont want to follow
'cause heroes come and heroes go
life has just begun
she wears a coat of color
stripped me
stripped me
i think i'll go there on my own
stripped me
cause now you are mine you are mine
by all those chains that bind that bind
bound and tied bound and tied
i know i have something free
through my head
through my head
at times life is wicked and i just cant see the light
believe you can fly
because inside i know that many feel this way
are we hiding in the shadows
against the faceless man
he looked me right in the eyes
i know i might not make it home
so wont you come inside and never go away
but our missions set in stone
i'm just a freedom fighter
cant you hear us coming
my life my love my soul
for the sould is so exposed
when dreaming i'm guided to another world
can you take me higher
to let love replace all our hate
come on lets go there
to a place with golden streets
is anybody there
so i can stay the same
things are going to get better
just an illusion
i'll go running into outer space
oh lines form on my face and hands
we're slaves to be free
in america
tell me which way to go
in america in america in america in america
what is right or wrong
i'm still here
when you're not looking up
there's a peace inside us all
let it be let it be let it be
for us my friend
and i ask so
they're gone
then rain took its course
so look to the sky
no more sorrow now its gone now it's gone
could have compared to the eye of the sun
but rose once again
and as the moon hides the sun
so is this the end for us my friend
my breath the only motion around
and i said oh we're all held captive
a light to free me from my burden
and i said oh we're all held captive
seeking only his decision
and i said oh so i held my head up high
aint got no time
this brings tears to my eyes
above all the others we'll fly
i'm careless i believe
with candy canes and french braids
in searching for substance
and death you will defy
so let the children play
let me see you smile as i die
adore me as i drift away
we believe
i'm holding to all i think is safe
aint so far down
i'm six feet from the edge and i'm thinking
i'm six feet from the edge and i'm thinking
i feel angry i feel helpless
we may rise and fall but in the end
cause there's nothing left to blame
yeah just one dime
yeah forcing a smile
yeah is it worthwhile
an actor out on loan
girl you gotta love your man
like a dog without a bone
yeah the back of the roadhouse they got some bungalows
thrill my soul etc
the future's uncertain and the end is always near
who is to blame
we'll surely melt in the rain
but i dont know him
this is not about god
come with me i'm fading underneath the lights
cant you see them
bottled up and empty holding back
now realize little sister
you stand here with me now
on and on we sing this song
my freedom
and i hope those eyes
your eyes stare at me in the dark
lies are what they tell me
stole all that you gave me
lies lies lies lies in my head
yes i'm the one who
took a chance at deceiving myself
to kill to burn to mold its purity
well i guess she closed her eyes
for we have crossed many oceans
as she lay lifeless
but still i'm silent
and just imagine everything's alright
well if you just close your eyes
i lie awake on a long dark night
mei'm rusted and weathered
i'm covered with skin that peels and it just wont heal
that is your right
what if you did what if you lied what if i avenge what if eye for an eye what if your words could be judged like a crime
what's this life for
cause we all live
to rest our head on
we pick up the broken pieces
tell me the truth nowtell us the truth now
under the sunlight
under the sunlight
with arms wide openwide open
with arms wide open
i'll show you everythingoh yeah
yeah yeah yeah
somebody told me the wrong way
i hope i helped you live
yeah yeah
that's his key to understand
there's a fight between boy and man
so far in a distant land
just give love to all
been so tired throw away my surrounding
hope mine eye made of the soul choir
lean upon me
i remember callin love
scat lesson
should i take from the night
i'm coming slow but speeding
reeling in you now
i'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head
let the tears splash all over you
none of them along the line
and all along the watchtower
the thief he take
still make lemonade taste like a sunny day
you bring me hope i'll see you soon
hope i dont get left behind
i hope you
your hands to your chest
i swear
it's all alright again
makes no sense
he wakes up in the morning
he forgets them
no time to exchange
cut cut cut cut
bartender please fill my glass for me
bartender you see this wine that's drinking me
i'm on bended knee bartender please
and so can pull on through
and if you hold on tight
whatever tears at her
how it dreams to be a bird swoop and diving through the breeze
but oh god
but look at him now lost tired living in the street
rain in my dreams
take this my arms
the river taste me
without a care she floats above me she got me down here looking up
she's the one for me
curious hands and fingertips
oh our love how you do me
one healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy
he met another mary for a reasonable fee less than
the blood of our children all around
taken into custody by the authorities
the blood of our children all around
you've got your ball
oh and you come crash into me
in a boy's dream
hike up your skirt a little more
wear it so well
oh no no no

wait until my momma gonna see me with a you
'til i ask why do you run around me
tell me are you satisfied with fucking

and crawl back to say
feeling colder
and when we call
too long
empty
you know you got what it is i want anyway i'm gonna take it from you
you know
a hungry boy
'til we die
oh much faster pass the years by
tv preacher tell of heaven
dangerous hours
and i'll walk into the big line
hold me up
cry as i may
oh great light of love
it's hiding to cure you
you and i oh oh
i wanna be your hunger
and make a bomb of love and blow it up
to change the ugly ways of the world
you better lock me up i'll do it again
to change the ugly ways of the world
you got love
does it matter where you get it from
it was me right or wrong
empty
as if i'm stuck in the ground somehow like a tree
then tell me what in the world would i sing for
if i were giant sized on top of it all
and here mother comforts child
if i were a king
i'll go on forever only knowing
and i know your the heaviest weight
i remember thinking
around my head
a remedy is what i'm seeking
i'll get back to you
day is gone i'm on my back
til i get to the end of this tunnel called jimi
oh sweetest smile in a confident come along
how they design and then we go again
whoa how is too late now
i let you down
dont walk away
i'm a puppy for your love
i let you down
when i'm walking by the water
when i'm walking by the water
i cant believe that we would
dreaming of things that we
i cant get your face from my mind
with luck i'll see you again
the wait is too long
dont you think
down by the bayou
brother cant watch him beat that girl down again
say my story again you ah
sold your soul just trying to get over low
same old story again you ah
troubles do it again
tryin to play with the 'caine
slip into my lover's hands
lover lay down
she and he
lover lay down
leading me all around
i bent down to collect them
this space between us
that my only love should be her
it's just i roll that way
if you know they coming for me
if you know their coming for me
got central heating and i'm alright
treading trodden trails for a long long time
little feet little hands little feet little baby
so much to say
come on now
roll on and run the red lights
our love is so right
everybody's tranced dancing tonight
i swear it would last forever
in a distant passing stage
with a fool holding hands
and in plays to write the wire in
and turned to the gate
you hung me out to dry
stirring my coffee
and maybe you're a little crazy
this drop of hope
the last stop reprise
wouldnt you like to retire with a million
rising up around me steal my soul away
wouldnt you like to retire with a million bucks
but all out in this world
empty
reached up and i caught it at your chin
and it began to rain
now a night so fine
hey love
just the other day
little taste of the good life
you and me you and me
what a day
and i would do most anything girl
know troubles they may come and go
you set me free
empty
you look the same
do you remember lose everything
funny the feeling when forever ends
steal me away
that's you here standin well i am afraid i might get in your way
he feels the falling dark
you'll always be my baby
as crooked as danger
but wont you speak
now she's falling hard
how he had promised her
the last stop
this is the last stop
raining tears
the symphony of death
but why your lie
so it's not so black and white
and i hope that we can break it back
in a distant passing stage
with a one eyed jack of spades
i'll come back again
is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
with warring hearts
in a church in the middle of a crowded room
splash in your heart
what's wrong and right
why do i feel as if i'm in too deep
as heavy as stone and as blue as i go
i will run and i'll be ok
i was just wondering if you'd come along
tell me you will
so i can get in
i want too much
over my borders
your homes you know
tripping billies
for tomorrow we die
to get out of this place
so why would you care
you laid down and gave to me just what i'm seeking
to be sure these days continue
to be sure these days continue
say love watch me celebrate
nine planets around the sun repeat
why are you different
everybody's happy
we cant do a thing about it
dont throw away your playful beginnings
this question i found in a gap in the sidewalk
and soon i'll fade away i'll fade away
you can read in whatever you're needing to
the walls and halls have disappeared
how i love to stay here
and fear wells in me
of how the things we know should be
and pass through a night so black i cant see you oh
but the reign in the house so no one sees me
oh rain in the love of my mother my brothers
and the brotherly love and go away
upon this way
'cause of original sin
if you a monkey on a string
look in the mirror my friend
if you a doggie on a chain
just as i have
we're all drifting away
i dont hear you
what you are
just as i am
when the world ends
float there and watch it all
through the criss cross of the mountains
i'm going to take you by my side
oh when the world ends
ours just begun
i'm going to love you
i am no superman
i am no superman
let's go
cause you
cause you might die trying
the things you never did
breathing just to breathe
funny when you're small
the world has come to play
sometimes that is the problem
then again i will falter
eyes eyelids and kissing lips
and dont you see the strange way
oh turn back
why should i
more than ever seen before
how did i come to this
there's still a hope in her it might
and it breaks her heart
and though it's red blood bleeding from her now
santa maria choose your children
screaming from the minarets
screaming from the minarets
willing to punch it out
our emtions can be swept away
face it all face it all again
sometimes your well is dry
take a look again take a look again
you seek up an emotion
crazy how it feels tonight
oh god i want you so badly
and here i'm dancing on the ground
just knowing that the world is round
come on come on baby
deep inside my friend
through my head
while we wait head in hands
a mirror in which
but gold between divide us
into a cold dark space
human as to human
oh so be it
could i have been
anyone other than me
could i have been anyone other than me then i
dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
oh so i'm praying all at night
oh but the girl the girl is gone
surely you'd be speaking speaking no change
oh you may find you're faithful
digging a ditch where madness gives a bit
cause i'm

for here we can rest safely
and here we will rest safely

and down from here
i start to feel like i'm crazed
it's outta my hands for now
pay your respect everybody tells you

what if a great wave should wash us all away
it's you and me
greedy little pig
i'm saying open up
let the love in there
lying down here
come sister my brother
dont beat your head
limb to limb you see
i went to the city
monkey see monkey do
that i'll do my best for you
up and down we go
through the darkest dungeon
you alone have all of me
i'll give my best for you
crazy is alright
to undo what you've done
while everything is open everything is shut down down down
the man stood there twisting
everything is open now is everything coming down down down
some people think some people wont
quite a bit of this woman live on my street
people stare and we just ignore
she says all the time
if you promise to feed mine
old as you are
we reconcile our differences
how he had given rise to him what would we care
oh brother of mine please dont forget me if i go
on bended knees god please
my heart calls to me in my sleep
and i dont believe it will
it's got me living in fear
until i'm six feet under ground
oh how i wish i didnt smoke
until i'm dead and gone
the fearing wont come back
satellite in my eyes
satellite headlines read
rest high above the clouds no restrictions
peeping tom for the mother station
say goodbye
and know you feel the same way
and we'll stay here
i'm turning and turning for you
on our way here
one evening starts with a kiss
were up against the wall
desperately i tried my best
alter or defuse
stood by and watched
i've walked the cage
escaped to nowhere
rockets in the sky
i never shoulda listened to you
let you do me like you do
and in the mornin when the corners are jaded
and it's hot like infra red
your hands are tied but your mind can run
we are the children of the damned
that after all these years i have the same old dream
do it right or cut it out
you're just a passenger and life is but the course
bad case of love
down to the canyon 'cause you cant get enough
your situations on the top of my head
it will never come again
for i cant falling in love with you
this sound of freedom called rock and roll
but you know you cant let go
wish i'd been born on a georgia farm
some may come and some may go
castaways children of the damned
dont you worry 'bout hurting me
i bleed so easily
we all come and go
for those who push hardest soon run out of breath
they've got your number television eyes
the skyline was falling like the armies before
i gotta get away before i walk
as you let go of me
you were up against the wall
sooner or later i swear
i wanna rescue you
all the good and all the bad
thank god the search for me was the search for you
it's only revenge and the worst of it all
the hounds pursue the weary step
i've been dragged through the mud
seen the walking side of death
the way you've fallen too
no one sees the man with no eyes appear
they'll only cut up you sky
we aint the first to be braced
that public cry that never knowing
that grand illusion that radar scan
it's a code red
murder in the sky
dream your dreams before you disappear
for some pass the buck justice
it's the last of the old ways
backstage spray paint security in rollerskates
time moves on so fast
it left no evidence
watch the falling star
you say your one of us
poisoned by the edge of social arrows
how much does it matter
we all pass through this wilderness
i coulda been famous
coulda made the right contacts
i coulda jumped on the wagon
going down to shoot my old lady
i took out my gun
get a rope around me no one gonna
god damn i hate the blues
leaving me to take the blame
some people put' em in their arm
god damn i hate the blues
i tried to get you off my mind
but you played on me
i wont be the one who fades
where the lost souls are being set free
so dont speak ill of the dead
drifting out of paradise
disgusted by the point of view
touch me when you cry
looking through colored blinds
you've never faced the day when judgement comes to town
i've been noticing some changes
i was looking for relation
but i aint worried you know it girl
gettin beaten broken bones
gettin old gettin gray
empty
that's gonna take a different man
it was easy to break through
in a world demanding of me
jane will you ever come back
the flags of war waved high
the seeds of war were planted
a planet put to rest
they couldnt dig my anti social attitude
i'm only human but time will tell
sinister love came knocking on my bedroom door
i shoulda been smart and got out while the gettin was good
i dont care about security
i never thought being alone was being without you
even with the lights on
i've tried to fight it just gets worse
you still look good but i guess you know
which bend we take the lonely road
i was wasted i was dumb struck
with the shake of her nightgown
the midnight sermon the morning rain
into the light
day after day nothing ever changed
you used to head the point
you had the coldest eyes
you used to have a look
flames overhead
o oh good
guard it from the light guard it from the light
you took me to dependency i tried to get clean
your eyes are so beguiling you whisper to me
into the elevations where everything's clear
goes to the doctor says doctor please
looks through the cobwebs all in his mind
i dont want to talk about it
i'm not ready
i'm not ready to be controlled
how could you go so quick
bound for the twilight flash in tears the blinding match
no one seemed to care that much
as i slowly laid the receiver down
in a minute we'll just see 'bout you
what they didnt want then is what they think they want now
i can still remember being here a long time ago
i caught the fever and the shakes wont stop
down to the dogs
so i lie and i cheat
oh little baby you trest me right
18 wasted trying to hide the crack in the floor
it aint just color the message keeps cuttin clear
can you see the stream drowning in
make me wish i'm dead
but i just got lost
the sheriff's like lightning
i know what i done lotta men do
somebody talked
dont that sun look good goin down
when your old man aint around
something i cant hide
down that narrow stairway
oh you can see it in our eyes
who's to blame or what's the matter
so i go to my room lock the door
but lately it's beginning to show
run silent run deep run as fast as you can
you sit in the corners of a world gone square
going through changes working my job
i only have so much it's just the way life goes
the silver beads of heat that weld the night to day
a vaccination wont make it stop
i close my eyes for you
empty
wore my boots down to the heels
all the things i'm going through
out in the blue
and every second always on the run
before the shadows start to cloud your mind
but school for me and reality
to break away and go beyond
over the edge
put me on the outskirts of a mental train
shadows on the pavement never looked so long
well i'm putting that cotton in a never full sack
how you can turn a crowd and still care who i am
we left nothing behind and nowhere to turn around
your entering the streets of despair
and you're playing out a scene
it's all i ever wanted the best it ever gets
my head's a little scattered 'cause i'm working on the dead line
maybe we were meant to be like a heartbeat turning black
within the crystal pains that we shattered long ago
i couldnt find the road the signs had been wiped out
time has come today young hearts can go
i've been loved pushed put aside i've been crushed
come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
so get out of the new one it cant lend your hand
maybe i'm a broken arrow
to nowhere down
maybe it's a nightmare really nothing at all
why do we then pretend
you rid your life of everything
but that aint me
there's a mist coming down
i wont forget her face
with my suitcase and my old car
and i must confess
just to keep alive
walking on my grave
i cant stay knowing what's going down
the struggling arm of defeat
when will you stop
we never knew what we would go through
i tried to walk away but
i followed that dream
i cant stay no i cant stay
where i'm bound i dont know yet
i want you baby cant you see
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer
on a psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high
high still flying no gravity
she's a 21st century sha la la la girl
it's automatic it's in control
c'mon and shock me let the cameras roll
lights camera sound i need action
cause i'm the main man
dont you bring me down with your insatiable greed
that i dont know how to say
tomorrow never comes
guitar solo

empty
the legend tells of an agin man
dont turn around dont turn around
he went back to his people
his life's work in ruins
why wasnt he even there
and soared into the air
death is a very high price
can you feel it in the air
gettin caught is the chance you take
it was the hand of fate
blood runs cold
this fall from grace
strung out as the night comes crawlin
i die a little
overflow of emotion
i tell you know that aint so
do you tell lies and say that it's forever
empty
it cant be love if you throw it about
love lives love dies
if you know who you are then you know how to feel
that love dont lie
it's got the heart and emotion to heal
love dont lie it lifts you up
that you'd go and tear it apart
you never lose you never fail
oh love love why do i keep searching high and low
love her like a man make her feel a lot better
when you need someone
do it good do it right
never ever wait it's a little to late
make love like a man
oh yeah
got some walking from a back reaction
i dont remember anything that happened the night before
to make this damn thing right
but there aint much news
i dont remember anything
i'm finding it harder and harder
empty
feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking
my hair's a real mess
you know that i'm doing fine
i can take you and put you back together again

with something that i wanna ask
oh when i look at you
you make me stumble make me blind

'cause it dont matter anyway
no need to worry no need to turn away
i keep the faith and there's a reason why yeah

'cause it aint love if it dont feel that way
i miss you in a heartbeat
i miss you in a heartbeat
the prophet stood on the hill and firmly he gripped his sword

cause i'm crazy 'bout you baby time after time

the whole sky froze golden
and all the children lay crippled and lame
when the walls came tumbling down
everybody ran as they screamed at the sound
when the walls came tumbling down
could you open up your heart then close the door

and have their fun
sometimes i dont blame them

closer all the time closer all the time
to think that things couldnt turn out worse
the mountains and the sand
and seem so sure
set upon weary feet
i'm not the one
when everything that i've done
i've been staring down the barrel of a gun
oh little girl

black celebration

that we've seen the back

put your little hand in mine
i dont know at all
who heard it from john
nothing of this
i taste when we kiss
i'm breathing in fumes
sea of sin know where you've been 'cause i've been there
sea of sin know where you've been 'cause i've been there
all i want to do is see you
if the water's still flowing we can go for a swim
after years in deep freeze
when everything is looking dull
set me free
i'm not going down on my knees
nobody knows me
each other forever
to shake the disease
at least the dirt will wash off
and stitch and stitch and stitch
and make the people one
and come with me
you can turn me on
it's difficult not to
you've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
shine for me
shouldnt have done that
like the girl who acted on the tv
carefully watching waiting as i
we've got to understand
we've got to get it right
giving voice to the flame
sweet sister
so you slide to the floor
embrace me
i want somebody to share
about the world we live in
i want somebody who cares
of those things
wont you come with me
you've got your leather boots on
i'd gladly go with you
but you must
empty
to take some bride
i really like you
you can try
and feel these lips
there'll be times
empty
there'll be days
and i'll make it all worthwhile
i give in
come with me
let me see you
let me see you
stripped down to the bone
not worthy of your call
chained to my desires
heavenly surrender once again yeah
rapture rushing through my veins
but that's not the reason why i'm feeling warm inside
you know how easy it is to tear it apart
but i will try my best
if i lend it to you would you keep it safe for me
right next to me
i'll be fine
dont say you love me
john the revelator
let us hear his alibis
all he ever gives us is pain
send them home on the morning train
by and by
if you want my love
idle talk
so open yourself for me
we slip and slide as we fall in love
just like a rainbow you know you set me free
i hate being in these situations
i'm heading for the door
that could stop this
the way of the innocent
arent necessarily
some great reward
that exists in your mind
is not yet in league
why does she have to defend
every once in a while
that most of the time
all of these absurdities
we call it master and servant
if you despise that throwaway feeling
let's play master and servant
when i have to deal
the mercy in you
when the site was found
with the last stone placed
work all of my days it fell down
then take all the icecream so we've got none
my joy the blood in my veins
i'm not a mountain no
no my secret gardens not so secret anymore
search and search for hours
and i had to go and leak it
we're watching the world pass us by
never let me down
empty
empty
my pleasure at being
reminding me
and in your head it's worse
though we may deserve it
i am happy
that we're staying
dont pretend you miss me
the respect you have for me
earthquake terror figures rise
in black townships fires blaze
and when you change a vote
each one pushed me nearer the edge
now i'm a satellite of a free state
i stop and i stare too much
having effect on me
but i wouldnt trade
complicating circulating
the stranger in the door is the same as before
you take this too far
everyone pretend
this aint nodisco
empty
empty
it is relentless it tries my patience
to bear the pain
take one more look
it's only when i lose myself in someone else
there's a thousand reasons
that i find myself
to treasure your kiss
i find myself
i cant understand
but i'm sure it exists
and you're all alone
you know i'm a forgiver
i will deliver
and the tape is your voice
but i never got the time
we're laying on a pipeline
working on a pipeline
if you're looking for a reason i've got a reason to give
pleasure little treasure
pleasure little treasure
it used to be so civilised
never again
the policy of truth
what i'm trying to say
of the things you say
no more reason see the cloud
see him laughing reason man
more than two thousand miles all the way
repeat well it goes part
open your sensitive mouth
heard my truth
i rush for you
that i saw for you
but it's my duty
trying to sell the story
trying to sell the story
and the in between years
i'm starting to grasp
twist and they turn
you've got me dreaming
here i believe
here inside
comatose almost
hand me my sentence
empty
as immaturity
arent meant to confuse
empty
you know by now
i'm coming home
i know that it was wrong
death becomes me
pain is ready pain is waiting
can you feel a little love
you party for a living
fused tomorrow
i talked of war
i'm begging for more again
she's a picture of the world
i lay here helplessly
cant you understand
words are trivial
in korea being insincere
tells the story of it all
to be flexible when the boat comes in
to be flexible when the boat comes in
waiting to die
death is everywhere
empty
empty
and fools dont run away
so call me now and tell me that you're home
i can see the pain that you're frightened of
just free love
to bring you free love
you've got to take this moment
let's make it clear
i can feel your desperation
let yourself go
i can taste the tears falling
playing your part
friends if you've lost your way
already told you once once or twice
when you're born a lover
when you're born a lover
when you're born a lover
wanted to feel the joy
and i would have to pinch her
happiest girl i ever knew
in this house
i'll confide everything
so we stay at home
and i feel your warmth
i can almost lay my hands upon
moved my souls on fire
by a higher love
a cage or the heaviest cross ever made
that cling to the backs of my knees
feels like home
for showing me home
i must live with this reality
dark obsession in the name of love
i am you and you are me
and temptations taking hold
i feel loved
within my mind
i feel you
your precious soul
and spread their wings
and i like the way you let yourself in when your mommy's not there
that's another thing i like you for
i like it i like it
just for me and you
never say goodbye
and accept my love
we've got time to kill
a love that wont wait
i ring you on the telephone silently
resurrect as a feeling on my window
working week's come to its end
if you want to be with me
cover up with all of your pretences
place it in your memory
your favourite consciousness
your favourite slave
your favourite passion
this is a strange flight
and the spirit of love
empty
the world still turns
and oh what a feeling
it doesnt matter
i'm just a television set
i'm just a television set
changing for modern times
that is out of our hands
i walk blindly on
i feel love's wheels turning
who take the easiest girls
we're twilight's parasites
when delirious fun
we are the dead of night
just take good care of the world
oh the tears that you weep
and the love that they swore
love will be the death of
they're crooked love thieves
i've read more than a hundred books
know it's a feeling and it comes from above
if they could spare a few minutes of their time
i've never been in love before
a debt you pay with tears and pain
it costs you more when you're to blame
or we'll have to estrange them
and the rainfall
cleanliness only comes in small doses
how i suffer the sweetest condition
they know me better than that
how can a view become so twisted
about the things you said
i need to be cleansed
although i may flirt
and do those feet in modern times
told you so
if things arent suited
you dance your dance you dance your chance
you dance with pride and you dance with pride
exploding in my heart
i played an american
no sex no consequence no sympathy
no radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
all your cutting down to size
here i stand the accused
you should see how it feels
is tranquillity
and when i squinted
keeps us from the stark reality
the countless feasts laid at my feet
if you try walking in my shoes
and before we talk of any repentance
but before you come to any conclusions
if you try walking in my shoes
you're so pretty
we can go
keeps the heart imprisoned
of a girl
the mind will follow
oh i need your touch
but a broken back
it never will
if you want anything at all
her first boy
she doesnt trust him
let me take you on a trip
now let my body do the moving
all the heavens in the motion
then he sat down looked around
can light up a room with a heart so true
to live my way
some were born to listen some were born to play
he'd ruled the town for thirty years
billy stepped up on the stage and conley whispered go son go
and wanna get out of this someday town
and one of these days you just might change their minds
the loneliness down in his heart
when you find the love you've always wanted
collected stamps since he was 10 years old
you ought to see him metamorphosize
empty
calling out around the world
can i hear an amen
every heartbroken boy every lonely girl
but you're pushin different buttons
it's not too late to turn around
i'd rather be alone than be in love just half the way
empty
repeat chorus
there's peace in the wine
knows that he tries
there's not much that's sweeter
i took my baby out and bought her a ring
we made love in the broad daylight
now faithless love makes that willow cry
empty
there's no path too winding no river too wide
some people need their space
for the love of a woman
empty
your mem'ry came to stay
i know it's just a matter
yeah i'm lookinaint' everybody lookin
empty
dont ask me i aint going there i aint touching that
hearts against the wind
they just wont mend
hearts that ever break
go and make me cry oh me
and wish she hadnt broke my heart in two
she's an old weakness
just knowing she's this close
one more day
one more sunset maybe i'd be satisfied
empty
a helping hand on a hopeless heart
another chance for true romance
sawmill road
one by one we outgrew
were the songs we learned to sing
on this red dirt road the county never paved
they still held hands
but she misses him on sunday the most
holding each other close
said she needed a permanent vacation
she'd crank it up and let her hair down
and took off after the call of the wild
anything will do
since she left me high and dry
home shopping on the cable box
stuff never gonna ever get enough stuff
it's easier everyday
he just wins more stuff
hey dad what ya doin
an angel on a pink schwinn my first crush
that's just that
but they used to stroll in the rain
hope is crumblin and walls are tumblin
lay on a blanket in the ground
all the lvoe they used to have
life's never been better than this
heavens right here in my hands
heavens right here in my hands
1st chorus
she's herself no one else she knows you only get one time
the box
even though for now
and take you for a ride
empty
but i cant stand seeing her around
let the tears fall like rain
they can never take your place
'til the heartache's gone
she was pullin on the hair that got caught in her lipstick
he calls 'em friend but he'll probably never see 'em again
he's heard about those big city shop n go stations
yeah he does
she's so kissable huggable lovable unbelievable
there's so many things
kissable huggable lovable unbelievable
hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
baby dont go there love dont get nowhere walkin away
you dont have to skip a bar each time
your feet wont always be on the ground
cleans out his desk and he heads on home
i cant think straight i cant concentrate
there's nothing else i'd rather do
repeat chorus
what more do you want from me
'cause i thought it was you in her eyes
oh love what more do you want from me
still it's hard to understand
you could be waltzing in paris
the way that i am
i will be the file in the cake
into the wild blue yonder
into the wild blue yonder
empty
and how much she missed them and i said
but those wrinkles in life aint nothin you cant iron out
you aint in it
it's still hard to face a day if you aint in it
that's more'n i wanted to put my old
i dont now how you got in
you set me free you let me see
you make me feel like i never loved before
sitting on the dresser
it's a conflict of emotion
is how i let her go
and how it warmed my heart
you'll find me
you knew all my lines
lookin back it's still surprisin
and i bless the day i met you
in a home for wayward girls
elvis aint dead
i feel it yes i feel it i do
work out your own salvation
the last words that he said
heavens more than a place
but lately our love's only flesh and bone
but it's gone
but you dont play by any rules
of a bigger game that's going down
it's then you will know this feeling of running out of trust i'm
i can live with a lot
so i'll get out while i still can
you see them every monday morning
to coal dust they will return
bill rice rice
the neon clock is humming showing sign of wear
i guess i oughta know 'cause that's where i'm headed now
chuck jones crittenden swint
ooh ooh ooh gonna love a little stronger
ooh ooh ooh gonna love a little stronger
ooh ooh ooh gonna love a little stronger
without love as your guide
there's places you'll never find
only love takes you there
take my heart take my soul
take your time take your rings
well hello it's good to hear your voice
oh mama dont forget to pray for me
i should be happy but somehow i'm not
i'd start walking your way
standing in the back yard reminding me and you
babe i love the way we work it out
i'd start walking your way
we'd meet in the middle
no wait a minute i believe i see
yes i'm the one who swore she would stay
miss that girl
dyin to try again
i missed the point of this whole dang thing
oh i miss that girl
you see she used to be my sunshine
i guess i'll just have to live this way
wish i had a car top rolled down the music up loud
oughta learn to dance with the hottest moves and the latest styles
everybody says fool fool nothin you can do
i know god has had a master plan
no ocean deep no fire's heat
empty
clock on the wall says
if i'm gonna fall at all
when my grip on the day when my grip on the day
hold me now hold me now
fishing with the boys
she's kept me up all night
i hear you saying aint this
nowhere bound
you're gonna have to turn it around
your heart's gonna break but never break even
two lovers stare up at the stars
that nothin matters like this love they're holdin
holdin lovin kissin huggin
that nothing matters like this love
it wont sound like anybody else's version of love
we could go through life together without a worry or a care
i have always heard you cant put love into words
that's how i feel
i believe i believe
and i'll hold you even longer if i can
one hand on the wheel is probably
from your heart down to your soul
well baby you know i will
i could love you with my eyes closed
when it reaches the sea
just to find you
holding fast home at last
looks can be deceiving
i have to see you
i'm on a one way mission
that smile on your face says
'cause when i looked at you something you do
and now i cant believe my eyes oh baby
i was meant to be with you
it must be written on a block of stone
as sure as rain was made to fall
the streets and their madness
i'm through with the struggle
oh let this world slip away
and i wont care where i've been
if you'd like some lovin
he brought you many heartaches
just walk away and let it go
there's no doubt about how i feel
empty
but i can tell you this
and said i wish i was stronger
i dont want to be afraid
oh i love you still
i'm trying believe me
imagine that a love that lasts forever
we'll just take it day by day
do you believe enough to handle the resistance
in a week or two
in a week or two
sometimes you dont do a thing
in a week or two
i hear them talking but they dont say a thing
every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
i guess that's just the curse of being born poor
man givin me a thrill thrill thrill i aint never known
i want a great big house on the hill
emptiness became my house
blow through my soul
the golden touch my heart becomes whole
set my soul afire
now i touch golden
and when ants so feast upon my flesh
the fable of time no longer blinds
my heart becomes whole
i know why you came here
i know it's the same sheer fear
the staircase has one too many steps
the lady wouldnt give me a taste
even if we just pretend
how can you tell me
i'll go over and i'm bare foot
empty
empty
place it here on the bureau
train for now but soon forget
you mean everythign to me
cant we move this along
cant we move this along
as i'm eating a sandwich in a small cafe
he didnt do me no good
on my way to heaven to heaven
why dont you like me
there's a truck out on the four lane a mile or more away
what's the latest thing the neighbors say
it's the sweetest thing i know of just spending time with you
i said hey it's good to be back home again
and shapes know where the heartache will lurk
a stone has come if i could cheer
forget the swan
it's always weirdness while you
the weirdness flows between us
just dont let me fuck up will you
how did i believe this fool
forget where i was standing stood
you'll split
for one more day
'cause only jesus christ can slit his wrists he says
if the tides have turned
let's just get it straight
and i wish for all these things for you
empty
the world has done enough to me
if the guy is right for you
where the people lived was filled of lies
i'm a mountain man
another tale slips your mind
are you
give me all
so why
listen when i feel serious
when you want my love
dont you want my love
dont you need my body
when you want my love
wont you take my heart
every dream is someone you replace
empty
every creep's your friend
without you close to me
i hear your voice in the evening rain calling
i'd gather all the tears you cried
we could make all this wrong seem right
try and believe i thought i'd show you the way tomorrow please just peek at the ground i been achin just to go to wherever your head's at just please bring it down things i'd like to show you cause you dont even know you do you girl i need to feel your angle cause things dont wanna mangle answer me girl take your pick you pick the bark off stopped you and we need you back to turn things around things above and it's not far off that everyone will puke and cry please come down come on down come on down come on down come on down come on down come on down things i'd like to show you cause you dont even know you do you girl

is there something that i could do to make her feel a thing i dont know what to expect guess there's one thing i got left but then i could be wrong maybe that's the thing she wrecked i dont know why she'd see me i dont know what else to be hope she's diggin being free but does she cry for me i dont know her memories wont let me be just cant let go but in the morning is when i think about her could it be she cried for me i dont know i'd like to think she cried for me i dont think so
i dont talk when you're around it
i cant decide if you
i dont wanna think about it
into and all over you
dreams are not themselves
giving me a chill
throat starts to drain
i know you're somewhere i'm insane
i know you're somewhere i'm insane
i just want to find out what you're nice to me for
i'll be grazing by your window
in a jar where you believe
come on rescue me
i've paid for my crime
a rabbit always smashes me again i'll crawl
tried to think what's over me it makes me crawl
have i begun a feeble chase
'cause i let you be alone for long
now you'll have to decide the fate of my sanity
the thoughts of love so hazy
the world drips down like gravy
empty
i see no stain upon you
my child i want to rain upon you
but you just hold on to what i have told you
i sense you're riding pretty low
'cause i'm scared of feeling
i never knew a rubber doll
you're better than my pillow
there's ringing in my ear
when someone drops a cup and i submerge
i cant believe this is happening to me
those guts are killing
those guts are killing
i obsess about my finest dream
dont wanna blow it together
every night we're drifitng farther
and it's gotta come from comfort me
afraid stick my neck out
your stare is forcing my face open
empty
eyed it dried it untied it
she's my post to lean on
i've been drying for it bugging again now it wont bend you've been frying for it a mound of smack wont fill the crack they always come in two's all the space they always use all the steps i've taken hidin not sure now what's left inside me so i've taken napkins all the things i left unspoken the one that fits still got me joking hope it dont mean i'm still nappin i've been drying for it bugging again now it wont bend you've been frying for it a mound of smack wont fill the crack they always come in two's all the space they always use all the steps i've taken hidin not sure now what's left inside me so i've taken napkins all the things i left unspoken the one that fits still got me joking hope it dont mean i'm still nappin solo cant face the the ones you left can trace me sky broke down that rainy sound gotta save me

who do you think he's fooling
yeah now yeah now yeah now
he said it was a mistake
no jokes from the jester
in a voice you know so well
you can turn it upside down
but herself
oh she aint gonna change for no one
and when she loves you
there goes the passion we'll talk about
jane's got soul
cause you're breathless ready to burn
you've been this way before
does the gun point straight at your heart
that the thunder was made in your mind
everything's always the same
bring down the rain
and the moon makes you blue
but with the truth in my heart
and i'll be there for you baby
the things that i've said sometimes
you might see someone you dont know
flying away int the clouds
just like the way you've always been
you'll feel it
he's still a man
he may have lost his faith
he may have lost his dreams
a nothing or a zero
living in a world of make believe
oh here it comes again
here it comes again
i i good for nothing
we do things our way here
on strange highways
and now i know i will
oh we've got no answers
whe the winds of fame have let you down

sunny days are over
sunset superman
trying to hide his burning heart

sunset superman
hot nights summer in the city

and you've got control
the cold without the warm
the throw before the toss
we're the last in line
repeat chorus
no dimes in your pocket

put a quarter in that thing again
all your troubles little darling
hold me closer
'cause he was twisted you could see it
so twisted
they told me i was guilty
they're twisted
he almost lost his way
till they strapped him to the wheel
and there is an end to summer
you cant walk on water
the cloud that's left behind
if we listen they will say
but only we can see
cause we rock we rock see how we rock
we're the fools
cried out with one heart
to find a way to break our chains somehow
what's a woman when a man
dont go by the rule
faded so fast
in the dark
they're shakin all the earth
it's stronger than a smile
oh rain falls
shakin all the earth
he was ready to rock and roll
why are they watching me
the eyes are what you see
are you ready for rock and roll
nothing's really safe around here
one in the hand
man in the moon
they bend you over
get me where you want me and i'll ask for more
each time we touch i'm purring like a tiger
but dont hurt your brother

empty
and they dont tell us everything has it's price
we keep hidden inside
hidden deep in our hearts
dont break my heart
dont break my heart
dont break my heart
bought her what she wanted
i met louie on a hazy morning
i just had to teach her
he said you and i we'll burn this town
broken dishes on the floor
i dont hate you anymore
i'd try to explain
i dont hate you anymore
the dark that you find in the back of your mind
dream evil
dream evil
you'll dream evil
empty
weaving chains to hold the prize
la destruccin de ecosistemas
se pueden vender
nuevas epidemias
un sistema que esta enfermo
la disciplina diez horas mas
no estimula el aprender
juegas tu futuro en un tribunal
then the strange ones came and the people knew
you've seen flying through the sky
el olvido huir de la represin
en tus sueos pesadillas
i guess she didnt know
aint it just what we both need
say the words that will heal you
they promise you treasure if you fly
sail into never they'll follow wherever you can go
there's evil on queen street
i can warm in the heat of your fire
starts me to remember
we know what's good for the brain
come in you need no appointment
is just about to crumble
empty
sleep comes slowly
creations of the mind
give me shelter shelter shelter
when the fire starts to die
faces in the window
something came to me in a dream
we're fallen angels
we're fallen angels
is the burdon of the blame
playing stupid little games
by the time you come around
as if to see the light
is he coming closer
crackle crackle
someone just like you
when the damage is done
baby for you
and the lies
like a man
guess who's forever blue
boy you know i heard you talking in your sleep
i wanna get to you
aint nobody gonna take me away from you
daddy's at the door
he dragged into the cold
and doesnt pay
now in a different world
before the next one comes along
and just about to sail
that we're all fools
and turned my left around to right right
without saying a word now
not an imitation
if she's haunting his dreams
empty
you resurrection angels
there's no wrong you can change it where
here's to me here's to you
where would you be right now
hey angel oh oh you're my angel my angel
but this one lies on the silver screen
have filled up the well
another yesterday's gone gone
filled up the well
and only the fools come back
shiny diamonds
life's a never ending wheel
waves rolling on the shore
out of ignorance and fear
by the pier sirens howled
everything now is different
one night at the fair
hungry for heaven
and our dreams are what we're made of
and everytime there's sunshine
but everytime the wind blows
running with the wolf pack
i could have been a dreamer
i could have been a dreamer
he's done it before
afraid i couldnt stand the pain
yes he's done it before
he's just as weak as any other man
my demons they seem to disappear
i speed at night
like so many times before
you couldnt trust him when he's dead
you two are sailing way too close
i aint gonna go
has visto su cara
mundialistas economa globalizada
mundialistas el fmi y el banco mundial
you can see the hurt still there in my eyes
rock and roll eyes
collector of lies
with my eyes
can you hear me
we are lightning
chorus out
when i pushed the door i saw eleanor
annie was a littlie late
but the night was young and so were we
two faces
are we just shouting at the pain
or do we see just what we are
naked in the rain
naked in the rain
the sun is gonna go away
it keeps spinning around my head
write the words under cover of moonlight oh
dancing in the moonlight
now they come alive
merry making sisters flashing smiles
empty
do you like the way it moves
evolution ways
see them in the day
empty
hey dream child
es muy fcil dar a quin se lo ha quitado
no te creas que los militares hacen labores humanitarias
i hear voices out of shadows
two arms around you
now give me shelter
put one foot in the grave
the someone opened doorways
i can tell you tales you just might not believe
changing hands
one silver dollar
changing lives
wrapped in chains
empty
you got another victim of
pack your memories and leave girl
pack your memories and leave
coche descaptable
jugar al golf en marbella
you know i'll always be
empty
would toss and turn
i shimmer like the moon on the sea
and i'm walking in the rain
unless she's feeling real uptight
to be out this time at night

si t piensas que hay diferencia entre el mundo el abc o el pas
televisin y radio desinformacin
sus jefes son los grandes financieros
he's already standing under the starlit sky

tu ne vois pas qu'elle t'pie qu'elle te guette
frivole elle papillonne
cause it's free and i see that it's me
is it someone that you know
fell the magic fell it dancing in the air
they pay him well to do
he's a roving rogue
better move along
he was nearly a child
rock 'n roll children
on rock 'n roll children
whenever we dream
and he's pointing right at you
oh look to the light
to let you be free
hush now little sally
shining for you honey

maybe too long ago
the things we had together
oh they faded so fast
your wicked ways had driven me wild
the first time i let you touch me
ignore me when i'm round
i believe i really do believe that
i said oh yeah
everything about me seems to have changed
something's got a hold on me that wont let go
and he talks like love
it's like broken glass
you've been nailed to the wheel
you are the driver
angel of mercy you'll come to no harm
well now here come the moonlight down on your bed
yeah angel of mercy angel delight
and if i give up my sword wont you give me the right
through these fields of destruction
and we have just one world
calling elvis is anybody home
calling elvis i'm here all alone
oh love me tender baby dob't be cruel
he's saying nothing at all
maybe he could talk about the money that he made
speculation rising
think what he say
near misses on the dogleap stairways
when she's walking by the river and the railway line
i'd do anything to reach her
she says boys dont know anything
sweat on her tip
hey maestro expresso
you run your finger round the rim of his glass
oh well the sun go down
i have passed my time alone
i know the way
a drink of water a drink of wine
i'm like a wave that's got to roll into the shore
rain coming down to wash away my fears
on heavy heavy fuel
i love the babes dont get me wrong
how long how long baby
how long how long you gonna keep
harry had to work in clay and stone
and they decide who gets the breaks
somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
and everyone's concerned about industrial disease
philosophy is useless theology is worse
send in another victim of industrial disease'
they wanna sap your energy incarcerate your mind
the deep and strong the straight and true
in england's green and pleasant land
the harder they fall on you
from off your merry go round
it just comes pouring down
we never got no money no breaks'
is the use of your side show tent
and leave lying bleeding on the ground
couldnt understand now
i dont know what's worse
that's the one that you rely on
southbound again i dont know if i'm going or leaving home
right now i'm sick of living
but not too many horns can make that sound
with the sultans with the sultans of swing
'we are the sultans of swing'
then came the lawyers then came the rules
there's six lanes of traffic
you know i'd sooner forget but i remember those nights
and i dont want to see it again
sometimes it all comes together baby
and you're coming on strong
sometimes you're going loose it all
sometimes you're the ball
sometimes you're going loose it all
and everythin that's shakin in between
we could have been the king and the queen
if you should ever land upon it
now it's all i can afford but the lord has sent me eternity
they're tuning in across the land to hear him sing
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night

when the things that you hold

custom kitchens deliveries

he take the road as it comes
he make a line in the news
silver spurs on his heels
it's a ravenous town
oh yeah once upon a time in the west
heap big trouble in the land of plenty
she got to turn up all her roots now
and bella donna lingers
do a song about a long gone irish girl
bella donna walks
she gonna travel light now
she sees a man upon his back there
ah but the blind singer
bella donna's in the jungle
for the usual fee plus expenses
blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes
anyway what you gonna do about it
you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
i cant do anything except be in love with you
laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made
what you take me for
your six blade knife can do anything for you
i'd like to be free of it now i dont want it no more
she had wheels on on her feet
she used to be the lonely one
and the story was whatever was the song what it was
cos the city's benn so rude to her
dj play the movies all night long
little gypsy moth she's all tied down
yeah and on a night when the lazy wind is a wailing
but he just shouts hey man what do you call this thing
you can run run into the middle
you blame it on the bitch you say she let you drown
this perfect reality
this perfect world seems clearer
how she laid low laid low on the floor
still its all she can see
this is the last time i will fall
are we ever gonna come back down
it will take time
cause it might be the last one you get
i pray for something
now that i am bleeding out
now that i am bleeding out
and there will always be this thing you just cant live without
like an angel in the snow
she'll break apart all by herself
take me over make me strong
it feels like i'm talking to
it would take the jaws of life to pry open your words
i cant hear what you're saying
cant you see
when we collide we lose ourselves
when we hurt the ones we love
when we collide
we break
dont you confuse
cause you're right you're wrong and i'm everything you're not
he said
tell me all your thoughts on god
we pass many cross eyed people
am i very far now
and i cant live another life among these streets of you
there's nothing inside
as the poisonous time
and its all drawn out
silence love is in reach
but sometimes they break
empty
i just fade away
but i get the strangest feeling that you've gone away
just lift me up dont make a sound
i wish i could be
every little thing you wanted
wasted time
empty
what would you give
what would you give
cause you'll find he'll go harder
he's so kind
against a gin and tonic sky
caged as she waits inside
and she wants and she wants to live
i wish i was the best thing that you've ever had
inside you
you give yourself away you give
forever days
lead me to your door
to get myself in shape
i'll learn how to bend
after all the tears we've spent
i'll learn how to bend
hold me up
hold me up
its a mad life that we know
can i see only beauty all around
after you there is no other
before he blacks out
a star search spokes model starlet
for miss emma peel
why did you take
i am dry i sigh
how you said the sand would burn my feet again
you yourself are free
you yourself are free
when you close your eyes
just wait you might change your mind
check that you're still featured in my mind
tell me if you want me near
and i'll play along
without you i cant believe
and now you're not satisfied
it's too late to change events
and tell what you have to tell
you'll see the saints are all a step below the masters
and so are all the prostitutes and dealers
why the need
are the lost things are the silver spoons
and why the need to eroticize our children
i know that you know
too much is enough for us to burn
i hope you understand
and i was waving as you were passing
and i saw you so we had a fight
when i drink i want you more and more and more
staring at the wall because you know it understands
sift your hands through broken glass
gotta stay awake
lay with me so far away
surrender give to the crown
i've got to
i give you all a boy can give you
the love we shared
dont touch me please
baby baby
so hard to see
where did our love go
touch me
so much harder to believe
meeting strangers
come on down
and you will thank me
with the feeder
to the overflow
gonna slide
the thrill is gone
someday i know i'll be over it all
waiting for the perfect match
waiting how long can you stand
and i'm just standing here while you're down
they always say the truth will find a way
you're saying things i cant explain
dont want to wake up
feel it here the silence
there's so much life here
i could hear you fall
still i hear you cry terrified for the first time first time
baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
and they watch you dancin
and the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
and i'm gonna need you
but a heartbreak town
is forever enough
cause i'm never never giving you up
how long do you want to be loved
somehow i saw you as a weakness
a home
in a house that might have been
and i listened to my pride
like i fool i lent my soul to love
god help me
as another night surrounds me
let's kick the babies out of bed
hold on to me
baby hold on
so lead me by the hand and let's make up
hold on to me
they still ring in my head
will you be the same when we see you again
farewell to old friends
what happened to
well it's a bloody mary morning
that the pitfalls of the city are extremely real
it's a bloody mary morning
and a voice comes through the speaker
baby left me without warning
your bags are packed not a word is spoken
you said that we were gonna last forever
watching you drive away
oh yeah
oh it sounds good to me i said
and not see a building standing tall
set me free oh i pray
set me free oh i pray
oh it's plain to see you'd rescure me
the tables have turned
paralyze my mind
monkeys on the barricades
and the peaceful quiet you create for me
and the way you keep the world at bay for me
hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
but every time i turn around
everybody knows
everybody knows
we knew a love like ours would always save the day
but sometimes things cant stay the same
that's when i was at my best
well i'd walk right out your door
and if i can make that sacrifice
such a long time ago
fish bite moonbeams every night
and i love you
godspeed little man
both active in the ffa
well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
goodbye earl
high and low
and a roadside stand
we'll pack a lunch
he was a mexican
chain smokin while the stereo plays
fran and rita drove from harlingen
mix margaritas when the eggnog's gone
we need some celery and a can of fake snow
you're my faith you're my doubt
so we fill up the days
if there's ever an answer
more love i can hear our hearts cryin
if there's ever an answer
'cause there's a long line of folks giving up on love
lovers like you and me will never say die
i'm not ready to make nice
i know you said
can the words that i said
it's too late to make it right
it's too late to make it right
get on with my life
look what you've gone and done
when the train rolls by
i feel the wind blow through my hair
i'm ready to runi'm ready to run
whoa i'm ready to runi'm readyi'm ready to run
and never even bat an eye
he needs lots of strength to sing and play
who do we become
all the pieces you left
your favorite dress
and i'll remember the years
i will carry it on
and i'll remember the years
well now i've been good for way too long
do a little mattress dancin
praise the lord and pass the ammunition
now we've got something
it's so hard when it doesnt come easy
and sometimes i just want to wait it out
when all these clouds open up for me to see
it was about five 'til five on friday
'cause when the world doesnt make no sense
and there was only one thing
and you're feeling just a little to tense
and if you love him whoa be proud of him
and if you love him whoa be proud of him
walk down that lonesome road all by yourself
it doesnt save you from your troubled mind
no i i could never follow
taking the long way around
but i'm taking the long way
but i i could never follow
b b b b b b
cause baby there's no better baby there's no better letter
all we're saying is to give b's a chance
should have fit like a glove
you keep seeing double with the wrong one
could have been true love
you could've heard a pin drop
tonight the heartache's on me on me
she'll learn what heartache's all about
i wished i loved jesus
she's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow
go to work in the rain
to the top of the world
she tore her name right off his heart
but the mighty cloud of destiny came driftin through the gates
two days past eighteen
he said i bet you got a boyfriend but i dont care
a soldier's coming home
one friday night at a football game
you dont like the sound of the truth
and i'll bring you
just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
coming from my mouth
and i'll bring you
i tried i really did
so i i made my way
in the choice i made
walk softly on this heart of mine love
let it rest in peace and quiet love
walk softly on this heart of mine
you cant afford no ring
baby's on its way
it takes the shape of a place out west
if these are life's lessons she'll take this test
she knows the high stakes
without you i'm not okay
you made it look so easy
somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
i need to find find someone to call mine
right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
i grow impatient for a love to call my own
no matter how long it takes gotta wait
you cant hurry love
without you it aint worth livin alone
please tell me she's not real
come in and wear your welcome out
love walked out on me
or only passin through
to kick me when i'm down
i've been expecting you
i can hear you calling
empty
good times waiting there
i need a boy like you like a hole in my head
chasin the tracks that you left around
it must have hit me hard
you better find somebody to take my place
hole in my head

if you could only see the love that you're wastin
so open up your eyes cause seein is believin
'cause our children are watching us
i hope i hope
i hope for more love more joy and laughter

but struggle through another day
i dont care as long
but when the laughter dies away
can the child within my heart rise above
children get older
well maybe the landslide will bring you down
let 'er rip let it fly
repeat chorus
you know the light has left his face
the proof is in the fire
i'm gonna let him fly fly whoa
and me i've been a long time gone
said she could hear me singin in the choir
empty
watching the children and the garden grow
and it aint coming back
yeah yeah
even though i tried
baby i want to wait until you can
love me like a man
i've been too long in the wind
repeat chorus
salvations gone
on the strip the kids get lit

there's nothing left to say
we'll be forever yearning
still i know how it feels i'm alone again
still i know how it feels i'm alone again
when i wake in the morning
just leave me alone
well i cant stay out of trouble
just leave me alone
now i'm back in the streets
dont call me no more
dont build your world with bitter regret
empty
and that last train rides
feelin scared
take a good look around you
she'll be upset
take a good look around me
i'm alone
lyrics dokken pilson brown lynch
she felt no pain
another night on the run
lynch pilson dokken brown
i asked for hope and a chance
and you know that
that you wanted to hear
it's out love that's never gonna change
burning like a flame
you talk to me 'bout love
i cant change the world
but the promise that you want the most
i cant change the world
i cant change the world
he's a real convenience store messiah
he's a real convenience store messiah
empty
leave our fragile pride
its time to sail away
looking through the keyholes far behind
and he told me he thought i ought to not let you just fuck on me
and then you gotta act all rude to me
everything was right til crazy mary went down
she gave me a scare she was combing her hair
mary crazy mary goes round
you can say anything you like
the cry of the gypsy
i got my own cross to bear
must be the gypsy in me
yeah i'm feeling it now
day after day
you dont love me
you dont care for me
somebody's watching me is it just a crazy dream
just a shadow in the dark you've seen this face before
out in the alleyways there is no second chance
darkness comes so cold
save me
i'm slippin away
back to the way it was
you had such a foolish heart
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's nothing left for me
so mnay tears
he wanted more from life
standing in the shadows
like a loaded gun
he was looking
watching the world
that we're through
do ya love me baby let me know
empty
i'm not the kind of person who quits
stick to your guns
stick to your guns
you gotta stick to your guns
i'm the one that cared
dont say goodbye
until there's nothing
i let your lust for love excite me
dont say goodbye
your words were so bitter
sweet chains
sweet chains
the pain of knowing the hurt it had brought to so many
dying inside ever slowly
i'll be on my way
dance like nobody's watching love like you've never been hurt
oh will i ever learn
i know it's hard for you my taste for the kill
that i might never find again
that i might never find again
i try to find an open door to go through
thought i'd finally found the way
they look the same
i try to find an open door to go through
now i'm stuck inside the maze
i'm not with you for love
changing the look in your eyes
not gonna wait for tomorrow
dokken lynch
we send our words in a pretty perfumed letter
but you were almost there
the storm comes with the pouring rain salvation
tearing it up in the daytime
tearing it up in the daytime
tooth and nail
turn up the heat
forever young not getting older
i've been lost in the middle
never unchain the night
never unchain the night
never unchain the night
constant motion kept me standing still
there's no point in living up among the clouds
i'll see you there
i'll see you there
i'll see you there
bordering on sadness no tranquility
i search the heavens all i ever see
look to skies that surround me
oh yeah
baby i've never changed
so it must be you
empty
picture yourself in a river drowning inside your heart
psychologically induced by all the things he'd seen
i can see the visions it's emitting from you mind
take your friend's emotions and dissolve it with a lie
i'm gonna leave your spirit dead by the side of the road
cause i'll be waiting
until tomorrow
and i can feel you in my arms
what have i done girl to make you leave me
nothing will ever come between us
tried to go to sleep last night
and this sadness that i felt will finally set me free
that the questions and the answers will come easily
in the name of liberty we set off to the sea
opne your eyes do you think that you're the best
will the sun rise when it's over
staying out all night dancing
driving me crazy
i love them all
she's looking for
i want them all yeah
she's looking for
repetir estrofa 2
solo espero que hoy me entiendas
then at night
we're living night by night
but i wanna have more
living night by night
when you're under the spell
we never see the light of day
we're living night by night
on that highway tonight
i dont need to go to school
dont make mistakes
danger lies around the bend for me
dokken pilson

and time slipping through our minds
when i believed we'd make it through
it's the loneliest number since the number one uh
one is the loneliest number
lynch dokken
my life's in ruin
i cant stay
you know you played me for a fool
paris fade out
baby i'm a prisoner
remember how it used to be
chained by love
your holding me
i'm a prisoner
i'm a prisoner
you know just like that
she might take your life
i stand here benignly
like a puppet on a string
my ego could not take
and the fate is coming down on you
she take you down
you will pay the price
she will come and take your life
you pay the price
dokken pilson
save it for the cruel
save it for the innocent
heartache breaking down my pride
leave me in my barren world
i'm feeling empty inside
no need to hide
embraces everyone
in a way we lost our innocence
we look into the world find no peace
the gentle rain begins to fall
come with me and see it all
even more confused
you're all i need on a sleepless night
on a sleepless night
wide awake
on a sleepless night
leave me go turn and walk away turn your back on me
just dont lie to me
just dont lie to me
just dont lie to me
no ones sees
slowly moving
my future waits outside the door
i feel i feel crystallized piece of time
i want the ordinary life
if it's just me then it's just you
when the sky is dark i feel like it's light
i never knew the charm of spring
i never new my heart could sing
you'll come my way
i hear the voices callin out
we're the dream warriors
we're the dream warriors
dream warriors
slip beneath the waves and drown
to drown
of love and heartache there's got to be a way
my religion is a mind condition as it turns out
life forgave my call
erase the slate
empty
i'm struck down
those tight blue jeans
it's just like mruder
i've been shot down
so come on baby
what you do to me
well one day while crossin the avenue a big car knocked me down
well now one real dark and dreary night as i was staggerin home t'
well one day my house caught fire while i was layin down sleepin off a

dokken white
we're dancing with destruction
are we too blind to see dont fuck it up for me
i was so afraid to let you know
empty
empty
your spirit chills me to the core
you cast a shadow bound romance
i dont know the reason or the rhyme
you got a heartless heart
you had to play the only game you've known
when you are the one
dont let me go
you took passion
heaven sent
heaven sent
i've fallen in love
thought you would set me free
heaven sent
soon i'll walk through gates of steel
here i go into the earth
all i need is just to drink your water
empty
i'm just one voice on the line
change our world into sand
seems like forever
that i'm just a fool
but baby i cant help myself
repeat chorus and fade
i dont mind what you want
but i never got an answer
i dont mind i dont mind at all
kick the ones that fall
in my dreams it's still the same
i've realized too late
in my dreams it's still the same
in my dreams you'll always be
love's got me shackled in chains
torn apart
repeat chorus
repeat chorus and fade
everything will come around again
that it's winter all the time
about the one i truly loved and pushed away
i lit a candle in your honor today
open your mind
i'm going somewhere
is some free association
looking outside
you weave your spell
when will it end your love consumes my soul
into the fire
there's nothing left to take
that left you cold
telling you to be this way
told me of your heart that you had been away
to bring your heart to me
jaded heart
you cant believe
finding out the hard way
i'm looking everywhere still i see your face
you just got lucky
you just got lucky
but then it was gone
the kiss of death
she knew what i wanted
the kiss of death
the final destiny
dokken pilson lynch
it's hard to rise above
thought i knew where i was going
i watched the world go by
empty
when you tell me lies
oh when will i know
oh when will i know
you can hear the sound
you lost your mind and then you lose control
there's a solution
one way or another
live to rock
it's all you got when
til the end
if i'm not what you're looking for set me free
if your wanna believe in fantasies say we're through
living a lie
of someone's path
then why does it feel
i could not be
when the sun fades to black and the night has come
will be lost behind the wall
all of the dreams you've ever known
will be lost behind the wall
the traffic starts jumpin
it's enough to drive you
just a' watch 'em shatter
2nd chorus
9 to 5 yeah they got you where they want you
barely gettin by
and you dream that i would daunt you
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
though i thought i had closed it
with the edges all brown
i'll clean off that shelf
saying something about a king
with the full moon in my eyes
in the yellow haze of the sun
i wasnt looking for love when i found you
'cause i had big plans for a bright shining future
and it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you
just poor appalachian farm folk
i know he'll love and guide and lead us
dont i wonder how the old folks are back home
i knew he must be the one
i was born again
that's growin deep inside of me
repeat 1st chorus
but i dont know how to say goodbye
let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
or clingin to each other in the soft mornin light singin
ooo baby can you come out tonight
empty
i cannot resist you
this red hot emotion
baby i'm burning
though it hurts to let you go
and i'll be there
my baby makes me proud
then we let out hair hang down
he brings out the tiger in me
but heaven is what we both want
this soap opera play that we're in
so may the best woman win
so at fifteen she took to the highway
when she comes to town crowds flock around
blue dress blue shoes a blue cadillac
when the mornin sun
oh i love you
you know that i love you
live on dreams alone
you know that i love you
but you know that i love you
put a little love in your heart
put a little love in your heart
put a little love in your heart
dont you think it's time we start
you've hurt me enough today
you've hurt me enough today
between giving up and giving in
real love
but we've never thought of giving it up
repeat chorus
repeat chorus
and i'll fulfill all you fantasies
until the end there'll be no other
and i'll stand by you thru our rockin years
but not as bad as me
romeo romeo romeo come dance with me
empty
so dont step out on me
so dont step out on me
resting on a marble stand
dearest sister do not weep
all of the other reindeer
rudolf the red nosed reindeer
empty
i thought i'd been in love before
you better not cry
he knows when you've been bad or good
santa claus is coming to town
satin pillows to cry on
repeat chorus twice
and in who's arms you're gonna be
oh i love you so much
and dont forget who's takin you home
and you're no different from the others
that i love you please dont let her ruin our lives
by one bright word or smile
he meant for it to shine
the greatest gift the gift of life
he said i love you so much
he said you cant change this old world
for that day i changed
empty
you're careless and thoughtless and loud
those moments of heaven
'cause you have a hunger i know how to feed
that i seem to need
baby needs love and needs direction
depends entirely on me and you
what will baby be after baby is grown
some glad day i'll fly away when jesus comes calling for me
or i might be plowing in the field down yonder just old muley and me
some sweet day i'll fly away when jesus comes calling for me
when you know they want to leave
it's a sad situation i must say
the only thing that will have mattered
i'll still be shining with love for you
i'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
whenever forever comes whenever forever comes
and dreamin of a white limozeen
dreamin of a white limozeen
now she's really ridin high
empty
daisy mae in hollywood
limozeen a white limozeen
limozeen a white limozeen
and i have seen children at play in the park
i had a dream about a lion and a lamb
in your cowboy boots and your painted on jeans
but i remember when he was mine
i just cant stand it
all decked out like a cowgirls dream
why'd you come in here lookin like that
i made a promise that i wouldnt cry
dreams dream on baby
were content to be lost in the crowd
so the garden one day set me free
i never should'a left him
or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
i wonder if he missed me
the body grows weak
well he was baptised in the usual way
what am i gonna do with you gone
with you gone my whole world has just come to an end
she wears a push up bra from freddericks five inch high heel shoes
designer clothes by halston and diane von furstenburg
cause she's a working girl
and i found you sweet and bold
and on every occasion
are you sending your new love
with a single yellow rose
yellow roses
but against your warm body i felt so alive
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight
and you wont be the stars in heaven
so even when the dark clouds gather
i know too late
this ol heart aint gonna break your heart again
to where we started from
to find what you left behind
you're the only one
to where we started from
that i'll think of you each step of my way
and i hope life will treat you kind
i will always love you
i wonder where you are tonight
oh the rain is cold and slowly fallin
if teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
and heartaches arent gold
and find you need me i'll be gone
so bye bye baby
repeat 2nd chorus
softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose
do do do do do do de de de oh h
i'll make your bed
i'll love you truly and i'll make your bed
i'll never say goodbye
i never wanted you out of my life
while i been sleepin all my life away
so i'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
breaking my little heart
but you better sleep with one eye open from now on
people dont you understand
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
we've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
and i've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
in the good old days when times were bad
empty
repeat chorus
is it ok if i stop by
it's all wrong but it's all right
hard enough hard enough
easy enough
our bedroom almost every night
oh daddy i'd be so afraid
'cause it took her one dark stormy night
jolene jolene jolene jolene
from crying when he calls your name jolene
he's the only one for me jolene
there was this little old rundown shack
and i heard somebody say well who are you
he said come on in and pull you up a chair
and there was just so much we had to say hey
joshua joshua
i got in a little trouble at the county seat
no money down
she shouted back at me
i was feelin mighty hungry
give me cash on the barrelhead
freeing it i watch it as it flies away from me
to have a word with god in the early mornig breeze
half in hope of sorrow
expecting swords and torches
we both ran towards the garden
john believed a miracle
when at last it came to choices
and i fell down on my knees
he's alive yes he's alive
he's alive he's alive he's alive
before something else took its place
and see if we might make it back
i wanna go back there
and heaven and heaven and nature sing
he comes to make his blessing flow
i've been through hell and half of louisiana
i wanna be your friend
my name on your mail
and i wanna be your full time woman
i wanna be your friend
yes i wanna be your full time woman
this could be it
better keep your hands off my
give us some privacy
he's all yours
dont sing love songs
and court someother
beware beware a silver dagger
eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
tennessee homesick blues running through my head
tennessee homesick blues are runnin through my head
you're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
i thought i saw the promise of forever in your eyes
and i was warm and willing anytime
it just goes to show that you never can tell
what a heartache ooo what a heartache
but you think i should be happy with your money and your name
the fool who understands
you know the working man
year after year
looking for what they can find
when a glance becomes a stare
would you like to dance one more
got your toothbrush in your purse
lost in her own little dream world slow dancing with the moon
somehow my heart never grew up no one ever burst my balloon
still a starry eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
empty
some hurts take longer to fade
you know nothin moves slower
empty
yes you are something special yes indeed
empty
you lie in gentle sleep beside me
something's burning something's burning
cant you feel it here it comes
he's got a way of talkin
he's got me dreamin
and i'd go through hell to make him mine
speakin of the devil
starting over again
he's scheming big deals with one of his friends
never any end
now where do you begin
raindrops tumble to the ground
tears that cannot wash away the pain
i try so hard but it's no use
as steady as the rain
i've had my makeup off and on all day
it's a sure thing i'll be the last one leavin
you're a heck of a singer and powerful man
nobody else can make me feel things are right
they're through with you
sing your song sweet music man
take me back take me back
i miss the simple life i had
where the stars at night
and the treetops touch the sky
but something inside
is it a fear
tell me i've no need to fear
empty
and i cant go on
should've locked up all my silver
who's no stranger to treason
but my face is just as wet
you just want to die
when it's family you forgive them for they know not what they do
some are fighters others faint
not the family that you're in nah
when death has come and taken our loved ones
toils of the road will then seem as nothing
if you knew how i wanted someone to come along
and a siren walls in the night
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
and i'll be here if you should find you ever need
empty
empty
we've come full circle we've been all the way 'round
but cheaters never win their heartaches never end
and i guess i should be ginginrock of ages
torn between two lovers just keeps playing
today as i was walking
a soft white floating cloud
the greyness in an old mans hair
the more i realize that i am viewing
empty
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
will lead me up to the master's throne
and the golden streets of my new home
and i had to go
take me back if just in memory
offered me fame respect and gold
do you ever miss me
life was free and simple for gypsy joe and me
and the night was cold and still
tonight we'll be together again
on an old freight train
repeat chorus
just a little more kind to me
if you need a love that's true
my world is such an empty place
oh here i am oh here i am here i am
you look into my eyes
an fillin up my senses
and there go all my defenses
is here you come again
i can see you're disappointed
just think of all the shame
he'll just walk off and leave her
my mistakes are no worse than yours
but i dont them of the nights i cried without you
i dont know why it's just the way i am
i might go out chasing butterflies
for there are childish sides of me
than i missed you before
if you would just send one to me
and i struggled for something to say
oh you left me
where she'll sleep beside daddy again
and sing oh she's an angel let her fly let her fly
it's been a long dark night
i can see the light of a brand new day
it's just a mountain i can move it
and everything's gonna be all right
i can see the light
and memory is a little bird
then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above
as i realized no one could take your place
it flutters like soft wings in flight
love makes your heart feel strange inside
as soft and gentle as a sigh
empty
farewell i think i love you yet
an i have been wonderin just what i would do
but i wont keep walkin to keep from goin home
i'm making plans for the heartaches
'cause you're making plans to leave
so mama when you pray tonight
these good night kisses i get now are cruel and so demanding
he's real smart with a real big heart
his momma dont like me one little bit
we're gonna be so free
he's gonna build me a pretty little house
then i saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
my mommy ran away again
i wonder if you'll let us stay with you
if you dont mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
take these old used memories from the past
if you dont mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
empty
scatter in the dust we left
you want me to forget and to forgive
it's she's just the straw that broke the camels heart
what we all call the carroll county accident
said he was sick and could she drive him into town
the truth about the carroll county accident
noel noel noel noel
to seek for a king was their intent
then entered in those wise men three
unless i pretend that the opposite's true
where is that fine line before it all breaks
and the sky is green
and i dont love you
at the house of the rising sun
there is a house in new orleans
with no word of farewell
with no word of farewell
with no word of farewell
you know that was the last thing on my mind
weary yes he must get weary but he doesnt say
he's always been my hero the best friend i've ever had
now how can you stand there and honestly say
the stars and me
they all heard you promise
i know that it's true
and i search my mind to try to find an answer
many men will give their lives just to try to find
you just cant stand to see me happy
two people together
you and me we are the right combination
here we go
i'll be yours through it all
gave you every bit of my time
that you aint worth the salt in my tears
you only hurt and deceive
that you aint worth the salt in my tears
wont you reach out and lead me
and you are my last hope
wont you reach out and lead me
'cause i am a seeker
my jealousy these
our heaven now has
to make the move
and there's nothing left but walk away
but something has to change
back through the years
sewin every piece with love
and momma blessed it with a kiss
so with patches on my britches
and i told them of the love
now i know we had no money
you never pay me no mind
if you ever hit a dead end street
and they're the only kind you take up town
in my rhinestone studded suit
he was ski resorts in aspen
we somehow came together for a night of stormy wheater
i was grand ole opry nashville tennessee
but love is cruel and life is hateful
as a true blue broken heart
i'll always be here by your side
my love grows stronger as the time goes by
oh daddy come and get me and take me home with you
i'm depending on you daddy 'cause there's nothing else i can do
'til the blood in your veins
it's dark as a dungeon
my body will blacken
where the rain never falls
you're flying them back to the mexican border
goodbye to my juan goodbye rosalita
who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves
i dreamed about my mother dear old papa sisters and brothers
they'd know i want to go home
and the flowers still grow but they dont smell as sweet
you back into another place in time
they dont think my heart is true
go on and tell 'em baby
'cause that aint enough
we've got a better thing baby
just tell 'em you're my everything
'cause you know that i love you and i'm not the stealin kind
i dont want to cheat dear but i cant help myself
there to my surprise
dreams do come true
but you're living proof
still she weathers stormy skies
but she's an eagle when she flies
she's a sparrow when she's broken
he is high and mighty
say god i'm just a seeker
so if you've lost direction
he is high and mighty
he said if i be lifted up
'cause he's high and he's mighty
repeat chorus
you're a part of every dream i dream
and you've always been my guiding light
when his time comes to die
will we always have money to spare
with really nothin left to hold onto
god only knows how long how hard we've tried
but why dont more women sing honky tonk songs
why dont more women sing honky tonk songs
we seem to have found a safe comfort zone
the time has gone by we forgot what it meant
lets love like we're hungry again
your mama cant give you what you're crying for
i dont intend to be treated this way
many years you have lingered around my cabin door
come ye no more
singing me on through heavens door
i am ready i am ready
i believe for everyone who goes astray
then i know why i believe
empty
and broken hearted
oh please give the right answer to the questions i'm askin
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
i really got the feeling that i'll love you 'til my dying day
you make me feel once more like an innocent child of two
i gave my love completely my heart was always yours
too late for starting over it hardly ever works
at my door the leaves are fallin
i see them everywhere
hey hey yeah
or i wont accept your pay
empty
empty
i was just a little past eighteen
and it's easy to go wrong
he grew tired of waiting for me to return
he has left me and gone
go spread your blue wings
thinking of you and your sweet face
for he was all this world to me
honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
i used to stand on a corner when i was a child
cause i finally made it to what they all call the big time
nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
and i just dont have it in me
of saying good bye
empty
the hopes and fears of all the years
how silently how silently
where misery cries out to thee
we hear the christmas angels
flickering embers of love
i've known one or two
down paradise road
the sun shines warm and all the time
make the travlin sweet
i could change my situation
someday it's going to come
peace train sounding louder
'cause it's getting nearer
why cant we live in bliss
come on peace train
and when i'm in darkness
you bring me the sunshine
close the door to temptation
i can never be free dear
please help me i'm falling
that's one thing that we've got a plenty of
what we've got we're payin on
and the promise of a mansion in the sky
so come on down
and i need to somehow let you know
oh whats a heart to do
empty
i close my eyes and you're there with me
to have you come back with your same ol act thinking that i'll understand
i'm much better off since you left
time and tears and somebody new
'cause you never give it
i know it hurts to say goodbye
enough of this jealousy and intoleration
time for me to fly
but it's time for me to fly
she didnt mind the stayin home
empty
so i've gone in search for love i need so badly
is to love love love him
yes just to know him
i'm right back where i've really always been
today i started loving you again
touch your woman
needs the man she loves to help her stand so
train train
let him go
hey lord would ya look out for him tonight
make sure that he's gonna be alright
for it gets rough along the way
hey lord would ya look out for him tonight
that behind her back i was making plans
if she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
he took my love then he took my mother
empty
and get myself together
we're having a party just two doors down
oh oh oh oh
feelin everything but sorry
you stir up sexy feelings
feel feelins that can take me
wait 'til i get you home
wait 'til i get you home sweet baby
when you knock on my door
it's time to feel good
walking i'm walking on sunshine
me and you
and even though you're gone
we used to
like we used to
six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
and turns the music down
coming outside
and memory flies out the window
i know all about the honor of god samples from the film the dead
my frail virgin mind
still i longed to search for more
viciousness and subtlety
the chill of november
gather ye rosebuds while ye may sample is james waterston from
alive from what i've learned
it's the most awful thing you'll various samples mainly john
empty
i was blinded by a paradise
holding me at bay
let's feed upon his misery
i realize there's no turning back
now that my life is done
in the unity of our five day sessions
a trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion
until everybody smiles
a place within your eyes
the angel you've been sending for
it's power in a look of fire
the answer to a prayer
one to one
but now you cant turn away
what's left behind
will dark be bright
hidden conclusion
will dark be bright
to steal from you the innocence that bleeds
dont wanna be alone
wounds that never heal
where do you belong
you dont wanna breathe the air you breathe
live another day
so die another day
and said maybe when it's right for you they'll fall
the beauty of the starlight
'grant me this request please
'i gave you my word now my love
bono u2 from the album the unforgettable fire
i'd leave this heart of clay
into the light
oh no no no
empty
and so fade away
headline murder young girl killed
but he'd turned the weapon on himself
but he had another plan
was the victim unaware
our deeds have traveled far
our deeds have traveled far
lyrics by james labrie
understand our fears
empty
no sign of you around
and still life pushes on
i hope that you hear me
empty
twisting turning
who can think for you instead
responsible thinkers
that gives you your life
burning my soul
i cant hold on any longer
the one you take
i bare all that i am
spinning the lies
you cant heal the wounds of my soul
spinning a cage
bloody but never cry submission
life aint for you and we're the cure
damage incorporated
empty
a day like today
days disappear
i gave you my hand
the aspiration to drop a name
graceless intrusion
change of opinion
you draw the bottom line
now i'm turning away
another whole life's waiting
there's a girl in the mirror
the one that nobody knows
the mirror's shattered the girl
the missing key to unlock my mind's door
i just cant help myself
but i will raise a shelter to the sky and beneath this star tonight i'll lie
and from an ivory tower hears her call
when angels waken with a kiss
but i will hold this one on high above me still
i guess he wont be singing in the rain'
i'm tired of this fight
please dont let it rain
are gone somehow
take away my pain
empty
there is something that i feel
it's time to take them time
if there's a pensive fear a wasted year
i close my eyes
all of the seasons
i can see
i tasted the answers
music by myung petrucci portnoy rudess
i'm powerless have to let go
spinning around
so much safer here
run fast from the wreckage of the past
all it takes is a little faith
at this temple of hope
living the life
all the things that i can
i tried to open
line
music by myung petrucci portnoy rudess
the right to life is strong
turn to the light
are you justified
or otherwise discarded
life to save life
turning away would be a terrible mistake
we are deciding
we defy our own mortality these days
remembered is the sacrifice but
motionless by stiffening cold
walking amidst a frightening still
iv thorns
i've stopped the killing hand
what i have learned
why wont you leave me alone
how could you be so cruel
it's time for me to deal
everything you need is around you sample is mary beth hurt from the
are slowly coming into view
i'll never hurt you again
there must have been a time
you're my immunity
felt my hands upon the wheel
this time for real
we're past the time
there's always one more mask
when there's no answer
and maybe they wont notice
there lies the silent man
they say life is too short
the spirit carries on
but i know that i still have to try
but please never let
at peace with the girl in my dreams
you are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime as the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness remembering all you have learned when i tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present feeling peaceful and refreshed open your eyes nicholas
a victim of her circumstance
i felt like i would suffocate
as i lay awake in bed
relive the anguish of my past
is etched upon my memory
too far away
here for you
wait for me
taste the memories running from my eyes
praying for time to disappear
kevin moore
so brilliant the light you will see
has proven to be
you're not alone
the angel in the pool
like a scream but sort of silent
dream control
'good behavior
love is what matters loving every
i'm kneeling on the floor
just another sunday morning
infectiously perverted
can you rid me of my secrets
empty
and tries not to think
with wings up in heaven
jon bon jovi and richie sambora
man this has got to be boring
wanted wanted dead or alive
i play for keeps yah
cause i'm a cowboy cowboy
personally thank bon jovi and richie sambora for their
i put my hand in my father's glove
all the white horses are still in bed
that's alright i'm okay
it's all about you not me
it's all about the things
it's all about you not me
to free you i am told
will you give your hand
it can be won
tragic reflex shattered calm
sometimes if you're perfectly still
swept away with the tide
we conjure up our skeletons
there's a bitterness we harbor
are the fabrics of our lives
stages his royal ascent
there is no time no distance ahead to continue
the awe
van halen from the album fair warning
this is mean street
and of sorrow and pain
as a child i thought i could live without pain without sorrow
the third arrives
love is the dance of eternity
trying to wake
and leaves me in a state of disconnection
i have been
how can i know so many
leaves me numb and strange
the tide is turning now baby
keep your head up
and not go insane
the tide is turning now baby
it 'tis the night of our dear savior's birth
his law is love and his gospel is peace
oh night when christ was born a
beginning at a above
this tragic ending
one last time
and as i'm standing here right now
feeling as cold as outside
just sign on this line
to an audience that ticks on the walls
a mariner soon from an open cocoon
with every rising sun that yields no sight of land
and at odds with our senses we'll climb
under peruvian skies
hey i hope you know
battered and bruised
vanessa regretfully waits
clouds roll by and i roll with them
i'll take seven lives for one
all that i feel in honor and spite
pull me under pull me under
the coal face cracked
you're all that's left to hold on to
i can lose myself
we scorch the earth
you're all that's left to hold on to
lights go down on red hill
my subconscious mind
my friend
how i love you baby my i love you girl little girl
lord yeah that aint right now now
i'm about to lose i'm about to lose lose my worried mind
the grey and the green together
surely now can all of your hearts be free
make a stone of your heart
is there so much love to hide
have you ever been used
with a thirst for revenge
feeling the ceiling and walls closing in on
what trust and loyalty have done for me
what trust and loyalty have done for me
she never felt so alive
he says i've never seen her get this bad
with endless drive
all she wants to do is cry
much to her advantage
and mind distortion
of palmtrees and shrapnel

hoping to find in me
curled up in the darkness
the answers to the test that stumped them all
goodnight kiss in your nightgown
my tainted blood's still the same
just a healthy normal boy
but in every other way he was fine
he was helplessly behind
in his solitary shell
i feel strong
and when i fall out of the sky
but she always wakes up
hope in the face of our human distress
losing oneself
alone at night
he talked to me that night
without faith
as i stand there all alone
now it is time to see how you died remember that death is not the endbut only a transition
i must act fast to cover up
i ran into julian
their love renewed
one last time
a familiar voice comes shining through
we'll meet again my friend someday soon
much of what chris collins is actually singing
the power of what has been before
the gates of babylon
a chase with the wind
sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
when are you going to land
i'm going back to my plough
there's plenty like me to be found
beyond the yellow brick road
on his hobnail boots
mother superior jump the gun
because happiness is a warm gun yes it is
getting lonely getting old
out there on your own
but it was only fantasy
breaking bottles in the hall
he never said a word
over your head disappears
carry me to the shoreline
over your head disappears
is lifted off your shoulders
once the stone
the sound you'll hear the crashing down of hollow years
i cant shake this charade
cant have it this habit
no matter how hard i try
she's taking me to my home
help regression obsession
heart goes leaping at a knock from the door
in the dead of night
innocence faded
empty
opinions are calculated
open your eyes
just close your mind
just let me breathe
and then the sales go through the roof
all my heroes have failed me
feed my head
there was no time for pain
like some people never will
it's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
the 90s bring new questions
and now i reach for life
the way your heart beats makes all the difference
'til i figure it out
so you tell me 'trust me' i can trust you
empty
i had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
i wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
off a dream once broken
moved by desire and fear
and the winds die slowly
i'm waiting for you to say anything
followed the piper's sweet whistling
i'll need thirty seven stitches to keep the pain in
i'll need thirty seven stitches thirty seven stitches yeah
maybe it's me and maybe it's you
let the bodies hit the floor
two something's got to give
let the bodies hit the floor
i will break you
i will break you
i will break you
everyday always the same
how much more will it take
empty
i told you you've got no clue what it is all about
you know you never came through
what who where were you when i was down on my luck you know you never gave a fuck
what who where were when i needed you
i can see the moon and i can see the stars
it's duet it's duet
this duet let's do it
cause i hate you but i need you
this duet let's do it
it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet
never want to be your enemy
labeled malcontent by bastards of decent excuse this place i stand words are to elude you
walk away walk away you made an enemy
this is the life i have this is the life i choose
i'm far from done
empty
forget the pain you keep in side
the dragged realm making deal resting another hell
it's time to rise above you
wake up time for a simple mani bullshit
my time to rise above you
you think it's over
rise above you
you watch it burn
incarnation can bring down the stars
and you its plain to see
ignorant is bliss so raise your fist and say hate
my best excuse is that i'm drained
that you knew that i would
and our long dead dreams
all our shattered hopes
when i hear the sounds of the trumpet call
you know i never wanted to go away
you know i'll break it break it
your love is so obscene
your heart strings strangle
i dont need you no so i dont need your love
no matter how hard i try
you cant control me any more
this open heart will blind you
push a little more you said push a little more you bled
no more no more
no more no more
the nothingness that we've all become
the nothingness that we've all become
the nothingness that we've all become
when it seems like tomorrow might not come
so why dont you just tell me
you ruin me
you keep me tied down you're stealing my crown
under everything something that you cant see
together forever slowly severed us apart
whatever happened to the lies that i believed
woah oh woah oh as you watch me fly away
watch me fly watch me fly watch me fly away
with a rebel yell she cried more more more more more
i walked the ward for you babe babe babe
in the midnight hour babe she cried more more more
as my halo i'm scarred by where i've been
crucified every time i tried
i cant forget i cant forget
and i've never thought i'd see the day
everything i've ever had has been taken away
where was god when i needed a friend
i'll tell you what you should see
my tongue rhymes one thing for eager ears to hold on to
you know i'll try again
i i've got no time for you and i will i will i will shame you shame you
is this everything you wanted find another dream
on your feet who's with me
there is no compromise your bringing forth your sacrifice
your pride inside of me your honor inside me respect inside of inside of me go
every time i see inside you i see myself within you ohh let that fade away
you better stop and think twice
you're gonna get knocked down knocked down
so take some good advice
if you wanna step up step up
you're gonna get knocked down
i'm tearing away
i dont care about anyone else but me
damn i love me
this is my time i make the rules
time to play the game
here comes the pain
you wont forget my name
here comes the pain
time to play the game
suddenly your rule the universe
she takes my hand
you cant bring me down
c'mon x4
before you're led off to the slaughter
all of this so pure
none of this will save you from yourself
in the sleet and snow
all the bullshit in my eyes
shut up
to crawl back inside of myself
little one what i need aint what you bleed
broken by your one sided compromise come on
you're not changing me you got me all wrong now
deep inside you've got me all wrong now
sitting back on the sissy bar
and i looked into the mirror last night
kneel down and bow to the princess
now that its time that
know that it's good
airplane is flyin up in the sky
'cause every day i'm here
if i could just remember what it was like
all in a day's work
a sight to see
keep me safe inside
but i love a few things
empty
and you are one of them
i dont know how much more i can take
heavens awaiting those who dare
baby genius
guess i'm doing something wrong
but stick around long enough and you'll find out
and i was soaring down
but that problem lies only with them
i bet you are flying inside
and if one mans cage is another mans stage
then she'll be the one wiser than her age
dont look at me
i'm the man baby i am the man
well hee hee hee
and so do i
you play the little bells and tell a good story
as the hours turn into days
and who's to say
these could be the good old days
plug it back in the jack
she had the eyes of someone older
i am a broken wind up toy
i have my memories
the garbage trucks are coming
when the telephone rings
you might remember me as
the one who let you down
but never made another
and i just wanna go with you
like a path beyond the grave
with the day before
but my heart's in the right place
now i can say that i have a love for him
before i leave
i bought some rock star ashes
grew some legs and took a walk
miss o'malley didnt mean what she said
than an englishman
tomorrow i'll be nine
tomorrow i'll be nine
there's got to be someone who cares
and when they do they cant catch up to you
at least that leaves something for me
dear cousin
and i dreamed about a place for us to rest
i was never gonna be the greatest catch
daddy dont let me down this time
and it's no small thing
hello jesus calls
lunch box collector loves all the pussycats
through the cloudy sky
looking straight ahead into the black
woman driving man sleeping
had to use my feet
picking up the trash
you're on your own
la lala la la
just staring at the haze
more than equal in this world of shit
a world where fear will always win
you gotta give it up for the new modern man
to the next great unknown
something we shared
for a dou reunion
the one i adore
this could be your lucky day in hell
this could be your lucky day in hell
so now i'm sitting her thinking all day long
just let me try
meet such a pretty face
my losing streak is done
did you hear me
love of the loveless
all around you people walking
god shine your light down here
'til they flash the lights it's time to go
oh i'll meet you there tonight
just a manchester girl
like i am a child in love
and tell me somehow i'm gonna be alright
so i guess i'm gonna try
that could hold onto me
thay say im mental but ive been abused
there's truth in lies
yes i am
yes i am
yes i am
i think i'm gonna die
yes i am
she says her mother is gone now
oh mockingbird you're not the same
i'm a lot like you
and now it all
i'll try to find you
i'll see you later baby
they dont have a little clue
and set the evil free
god damn right it's a beautiful day ahah
the kids fit their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
we go everywhere together
she will always be the only thing
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la
oh no
the winner stands alone
she says it's easy to sleep
i feel like i'm a fighter
and i am cold
now i've got friends that do want me
dear ma
living in the lost and found
and take me as i am
i'd rather stay in bed
i dont know where i'm bound
hard to look the other way
but then i play their game
dont you think that i know what they're talking about
spiders in the kitchen
field mice head lice
i'm here to tell you
this is that fresh
babe in the hood
i've been spending all my days
and everyone's gonna leave me alone
on the attic floor
empty
trying to vent some of the terrible passion
think i might have left the door unlocked
in my book
you're gonna love it if you give it a try
everything goes away
smiling like its no big deal
no ones gonna take the blame
and traded up now she is a queen
taking your order he willlook away
wanna feel like i'm missed
am i on the wrong track
the angry mob the happy mass
and mother nature changed her name
hello cruel world
but what the hell
could become of this day
she is the one that makes me believe
what's waiting 'round the bend
is the curse stronger than me
and let it guide the way
let's go down to the fashion show
nobody said that the world was fair
we'll blow off our heads in despair
perfect day for lucky guy
and squeegee tales
is shitting in the alley
with hollywood suspicion
in my suitcase
i am a lone wolf
just not that steady yet
dont you tell me to lighten up
empty
had a house
i'll shine it on just like macbeth
well that's what they call it
from sinking deeper down into the ditch
from sinking deeper down into the ditch
knockin on the door for a 50 bang
from sinking deeper down into the ditch
are coming back
novovaine for the soul
may wash away my pain
hold her hand in japan
when i get there
spinning my wheels
why you wanna ruin it
we can lie
packing blankets and dirty sheets
floating up into the sky
i've never known anyone
but then he blew it away
i've never found
i pray
there must be something that's folowing her
i dont know how
i dont know what we'll do
i dont know where we're going
and i cant stop staring back
now i go back whenever my tired head hits the pillow
how do you stand when you've been crushed
i feel like an old railroad man
things are faster now
just someone who knows he's in love
find another love like this
but i dont care about their rules
but no one's laughing
they dont know what they need to fear
the world is gonna end tomorrow
looking for a light with her head in the oven
this rotten world's gonna chew you up
and if i have to drive back by
to really be alive
i got a long long day ahead of me
and this aint the place for me
i got a long long day ahead of me
but my selective memory
i wish i could remember
she loves a puppet
he's made of flesh and blood
dont you ever tire
so i'll just lay here and chew
we'd rather have chew toys than yule logs
the nurse she likes my writings
what i am ends
i wont be denied this time
not what you are
a boy and his friends to go
i feel better now when they dont call
i see your face when i stare at the ceiling
so i know you're going pretty soon
of the unfinished line
i like a girl with a dirty mouth
making somebody a happier man
i like a girl with a dirty mouth
begging ma to shave me please
jesus cant save me
ma wont shave me
i'll take a dog's life
i guess i'm just too soon
this is the day
and you blow it all away
now you can bring my suitcase
but you dont know
to be true
feeling scared today
another day
but waking up is harder when you wanna die
i got a mouth but is doesnt say
dont give up now i'm almost there
remember last year when you were on your own
i'll go and throw another log on the fire
everything's gonna be cool this christmas
you keep your eyes down
or keep your eyes down
coming down through the alley
karaoke castration
hospital food
hospital food
and i wont listen to their words
i cant stand in line at the store
i've got a feeder for you to perch on
time to put the old horse down
i like the seaside
throw a nut up in the tree
i know that you've been through
if you dont brighten up
you may not need this world
and see it somehow
to realize that losing me could mean
and i have no way of knowing where you are
sit upon the overlook then
gray stones as the gardens growing dim
it's a motherfucker
you wont ever be the same
it's just that i've been kicked around
am i alright
dont worry i'm all right
the way that i've been kicked around
i just wanna be a page
i dont have a prayer for writing the book
jehovah's witness leave me alone
you walking up in your very nice suit
i came out
shaking off the bugs and fleas
i dont know why i should believe her
walking along by the la river
walking along by the la river
la river
i'm gonna fly on down for the last stop
let you in
get down
fly away
and it's a hard time
all the days that drag on
and will be
they just write things in the sky
the good life you left behind
somebody loves you
you up there
someone to break the spell
there's no water in the well
while i wear newspapers for pants
take a look in the killer's eyes
she was my mom
it would wreck your day too
crawling down through the muck
gina clocks the broken hearts
44 skulls buried in the ground
souljacker cant get my soul
and if you dont like what they are telling you
one day the world will be ready for you
and your picture etched on my screen
and secret shelves and hidden rooms
if i thought that it would help
but i dont give a damn
but she sure is upset
i'd welcome her in my arms
she said this time it's the end
you think you'll get under ol monsieur's lid
falling from the ceiling and covering your ears
you've got to be kidding
nothing hiding behind this picket fence
for the whole world to see while they put him in the bag
and i'm thinking that must be her sister
she's my sweet li'l thing
my nose against hers
she's got a glow around her
i think that you know it's not so bad
but now that it's daylight
so brave
halfway to the truth
i'm afraid of reality
does he listen to the wishes of his kind but stressful mother
she tried to teach him right from wrong
empty
now he's the keeper no one's fool
empty
the beauty of the word
war greed and illusions all caught in the fight
build your walls up high
love is your destiny
so sad to say you're no one's child reflection is a part of you
flower black like my blood
i'm flying away to distant lands of feelings
where's the light of sky
i gave you freedom dont hand me your pain
surrounded by water your problems are oh so deep
words left unspoken not to return
close your eyes tonight
allow me to fly up to beams
enchanted by a friendly face
what's it worth
love will come around
touches of godless happiness
touches of godless
drops of rain are falling down from my face
it's destiny calling you when destiny's calling you
each step with each day will get harder harder if we go our own way
surreal nightmares they appear
the unknown eats your soul alive
empty
i'm hidden under iron mask
wrung by painfull disappointment
silent night your cold light
do you float in silence praying for the night to fall
but i couldnt let it win
down in the dark i stand
his nervousness takes a form of it's own
empty
empty
empty
however any trace of his original character
thru' those naked eyes captivating
repeat bridge chorus
they know about you and your fear
from the shadows of the trees
dance like flames to dark night
only steam
took the time just to find that there aint no way back
all our dreams we left them for
on the surface he portrays a person being of caring and consideration
wait dont be fooled by him
an acts like a friend offers comfort to all
sorrow took her mother so castly so she was
music henk van der laars dirk bruinenberg
all of that money you've made
empty
hide the fear away
repeat chorus
a separation between the soul and mind to be as one with each other
though innocent eyes dont lie it's hopeless subscribing retaliation
after you my dear
telling me in heaven they dont have enough
by my side while i'm inside of you
my brother isnt mine i know it
i'm like the black night
as the years pass she slowly gains his trust
there stands a lady inbetween the shadows
empty
in its corners
i'm hiding my true passion
you're his grey tomb
i'm a ghost from the dark
i'll lie down to frosty autumn leaves
and then
but now i want
strange eyes
old and tired tired and old without wings of
the chance to say what's on your mind
when starting over new
last powers are drowning in swamps
in a dangerous environment a single mother fights against tradition
it's easy for them to say
empty
her efforts are in vain
sadly his mother watches helplessly
empty
those memories still remain
close your eyes try to recall
responsibility or shame
where reality and thought drift through time
who are you projecting my crimes and dealing in pain
under in body and soul
who are you projecting the grief a world gone insane
instead they just left her to die
and the pretty thing he made desert you
but i'm gonna split us back in two
the both of you can just fade to black
you disappoint me you people raking in on the world
shine on me baby 'cause it's raining in my heart
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
vomiting in your kitchen sink
the cold comfort of the in between
a fond farewell to a friend
though i'm beyond belief
though i'm beyond belief
you know you know you know you know you know
you know you know you know you know you know
you walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
but the fix is in
if you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart
you say you dont want anyone around
but all you say is you dont want anyone around
i saw you with your make up running down
they paint you out in straight silhouette
black eyes always watch the clock
she probably wont say you're wrong
her hand on your arm
so let's go out
i'm ready to go
that fell down here to lay beside you
picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
and be forever with my poison arms around you
water pouring from her eyes
you wont be happy 'til the bottle's broken
revolver's been turned over
for someone half as smart you'd be a work of art
all spit and spite you're up all night and down every day
looking at all the rows
break off of in someone's laughter
placeholder come and take up mine
pretty words that you whisper maybe i misunderstood
pretty mary k is off in somebody's room
pretty mary k
walk 'round the door
i felt so ugly before
i didnt know what to do
in the wrong order again
wait for a call
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
who'd never close both his eyes
he played himself
i hear you cry
i want to hurt him
and when i traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
and when they clean the street i'll be the only shit that's left behind
the satellite
it's always been wait and see
she'll decide what she wants
in quicksand from the main man
see you later
empty
see you later
you were all getting drunk instead
and not get upset because something goes wrong
seen how things are hard
seen how things are hard
drunk on dreams now i'm glad i didnt say out loud
square two beware i can deal with the shit you've just done
and looking at you all i see is your waiting
you idiot kid your arm's got a death in it
i watched you deal in a dying day
got no where to go
couple killer running out of time
where no one else gonna give me grief
dont keep me around
i've been outside
burning every bridge that i cross
sleep the rest of the day
'cos even though some cant sleep
under the moon as well as the sun
you come over with all of your friends
about being alone
because i just bounce back anyway
you come over with all of your friends
but everybody's scared of this place they're staying away
but isolation pushes you 'til every muscle aches
most cooperatively
with some help from johnny walker red
got plans for both of us
its a comedy from the 70s
the hay stack charm around your neck
head down to toes a reaction to you
now on the bus
i'm taking the cure so i can be quiet
and it's been here it is up here
where every new blood gets time to become resigned
you're waiting to start waiting to light
need a pat on the back
for the millions of fans ignoring the bands
look at your hands unoccupied
just a total waste
anything is better than nothing
with your warning
you remind me of someones daughter
leave alone 'cos you know you dont belong
said do what you have to do
killing time wont stop this crying
killing time wont stop this crying
home to oblivion
home to oblivion
i'm okay lets just forget about him
once we got back inside
and everybody's gone at last
waiting around for me
and stopped for a spell
do me a favor and let me know
you got yourself to tease and displease
so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
see nothing wrong
everybody's dying just to get the disease
when the socket's not a shock enough
everything is exactly right
it'll go around with anyone
high on amphetamines
everything but you and me
the truth is otherwise
burn it backwards kill this history
sweet adeline
although you've already disappeared within yourself
it's all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
you got a bus fare in your pocket and more money down in your sock
the subway that only goes one way
and everything that you do makes me want to die
it's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discrete
the white lady loves you more
rock and roll is here to stay
everybody knows which way you go straight to over no one
drown tomorrow out
i told him he shouldnt have sent her
what i used to be will pass away and then you'll see
but i'm already somebody's baby
but you're already somebody's baby
but i'm already somebody's baby
now i never leave my zone we're both alone i'm going home
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
what are you doing hanging out with me
the question is wouldnt mama be proud
the long stemmed glasses a movie
photographs of moving
drink up baby stay up all night
shoulder who keeps singing over everything
told you off and goodbye
made him ownder who he thought that he knew
and i think i'm all done
you start to drink you just want to continue
i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
a silent kid is looking down the barrel
the first time i saw you i knew it would never last
i dont wanna walk around
nobody's seen red
do what i say and i'll make you okay and drive them away
where i like you the best
i believe you
i wanna be you
puffed up like a macho jerk
it's a big decision
bled white
i'm never going to become what you became
put it away and check out for the day
you never show
nobody knows what he's doing
cant make a sound
and you think i ought to shake yourr motherfucking hand
while he's turning around the open sign
oh my darling
i've got no desire to use you you know
pulling feathers out of your hat
leave me alone
coast to coast
i see color bars when i come
that you learned from tv
i'm a junkyard full of false starts
the things that you tell yourself
and she locked the car and slipped past
i dont know what to do with your clothes or your letters
they took away the bottle and the hat he was under
little whisper smoke signs you'll never get
she's shaking down
the stupid kick that makes me real
empty
dont go down
baby stay
dont go down
two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
but when it's 3am he wonders where in the hell she went
sometimes i ricochet from the past
look at the spin chief battered and broken
it's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head
and a sickened smoke illegal in every town
but why should i lie
trying to get your cops to talk right
got no interest now in undressing your kids with cheap angst love letters
for the hard time you give yourself
i think of you with hesitation
close up and personal
always cussing and crying
and now i know it was just a false alarm
go on parade and fade
scared of every little noise
pretty words and inside slurs
we met there's no changing my mind
should a been forgot
going nowhere
going nowhere
good to go
good to go
would you say that one of your dreams
he's not half right
it's not half right
i went to meet you at central square
high times
just to hear a voice
things i'd have to forget
just to march in my place
i'm getting further away
what a fucking joke
he held his breath
feeling weird
he thinks of you
stay with me
everybody knows
independence day
your walls gone wider than your head trip is
i dont need a remedy
better sell it while you can
you're going to get wet
because i took my own insides out
read the part and return at five
instruments shine on a silver tray
you came alone now
i dont want the lead in your play
just lovers we were oh what a lie
your 10000 promises
what about your
what about your
once we were lovers
and if you're that type of girl
yo brian stop lying
my love my love
yo my name is aj
my name is nick
my name is aj and i'm gonna always love you
but i'll be there to make you smile
without you i dont think i could live
i'm on my knees
but love is all i have to give
together we have seen
this world is not at ease
so tell me why we have to cry and not try
is it today is it tonight
far beyond the call of love
your love as far as i can see
couldnt live my life without you in it
people say i'm crazy and that i am blind
who you are
what you did
i dont care as long as you love me baby
where you're from
it's not that i cant live without you
the road to take
and made you feel the way i feel
and find a way back to your heart
but still i'm not complainin
empty
every time i near
my beautiful woman
there's a spark of magic in your eyes
ladies sometimes a man cant find the words
empty
it starts pumpin pumpin
boys will be boys hey hey
that you think that we should wait
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
my body's callin for you
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh yeah
and all my memories erase
something made me look at you
what i'm asking girl is one more chance
there's no use in trying
with a little bit of love
2 4 fam here to lend a helping hand
we just have to understand
about this time of year
empty
a smell of chesnuts in the air
empty
that keeps us from each other now
take my hand take my life
and i dont wanna know
no i cant let you go
the reason why i
but you get nowhere
empty
roll with it roll with it
someone to trust
young woman understand
just roll with it
empty
roll with it you've got to
you've got to roll with it you've got to roll you've got to roll
you take away life's heartbreak
cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
i feel you movin through me
before i met you i was lost
something here
i know that there must be
take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone
you see colors no one else can see
standing here where i've always been

but i do need to show you a little more
she knows that i know this love i couldnt live without
moving vibration
some be heading
i believe in people lying
empty
feel the strain
sugar cane
i believe when snow flakes fall
empty
there'll be a new tale of
i'm scrunching
empty
empty
you were the main event you didnt need to steal the show
empty
and there was nothing here to make me stay
and i somehow thought you'd slip away
baby i could walk through fire right back to you
what about you little darling what about you
what about you babe oh baby
i'm only livin half a life without you here with me
when we made love we belong together
empty
empty
so what does it mean when your mind starts to stray
brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay
but today
laden with reaction
phantasmal myriads of sane bucolic birth
the vortex of their minds ensconsed within the murky deep
on valium she's so ineffectual aint life a mystery i cant explain
on valium she's so ineffectual aint life a mystery i cant explain
maybe god is just a chemical fiction
and as the gawks and stares bombarded me
to some other school
and it was time to set the town on fire
i stuck out my chin when i should have ran
of somewhere else
i'm going for a walk
all alone i'll be an empire
call me monstrous reprobate
there's a sleeping resonance we hold
it's the surest way
but if we mute them they decay
melody is the key
restitution of pavement pomp and show i seek a thousand answers i
swept away against the grain there's a common consensus and a
all fantastic images they only are apparent
the sun climbs up to a razon
when the fighting starts who will
that was twenty one stories tall
with grave allegiances
content upon a rail of pain for just a little rain
and everything is dearly missed blood relations and bricks
and we'll try as we cry and our brothers pass us by
american dream's gonna swallow you whole it's bursting at the seam
american dream
more times than i recognize
no proof necessary
people making babies sometimes just to escape
but there's so many other fuckin robots out there
small in vision and perspective
scooping up the booty licking all the right holes bolstering the
so fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
ubiquitous compelling too
the blood of the hybrid
oratory of hope and glory a whisper and a rhyme
a monumental blunder averted and betrayed
sound the revolutions thunder
raise the rebel from its grave
in a world that is always changing
and sanity will make you strong
and the most difficult part is accepting what the future may bring
it seems like a lifetime of scrutiny
it seems like a lifetime of scrutiny
i dont know why trust me
i wanna write down all the things i feel
a million scurry they are looking for advice
oh what was god up to
shades of truth between dispirate lines
sinister rouge
and only god will ever know
we'll not forget
to even the score
like a skyscraper
build me up tears me down
waiting for it too then you realize it aint too much fun
'cuz you've got nothing to say
faithfully assuring that
and we pitch into help it die
but the consequence is clear
there's a furnace set on high
but it's time to turn the tide
and an underdeveloped intellect filled with impotent and static rage
empty
transfixated on the big blue screen
power and disease
from the lack of coverage
controlled and copied
a medium upon which you build reality
superficial urgency
you'll be offended too
cant someone protect me turn away turn away
operation rescue you may wonder where they come from but i just
there's an ocean of unpleasantries we are not prepared to face
is there nothing we can do for ourselves or only what we should
as we watch our foundation crumble away
we're one nation under god we stand above the rest
our specialty is infiltration
as man unleashed his deadly bombs and sent troops overseas
and our diety's omnipotent oh yeah
and we destroy everything that we find
but others sing of beauty and the story that's unfolded
your superstitious lives
my pessimistic lines
and the professorial truth
are you scared of the logic that swirls within your head
is there anyone who lives a painless life
and a final everlasting peace
pity pity on the billions of ignorant people
empty
you're lucky if they listen to a single word you say
men in suits without a happy face
it determines wrong and right
and it haunts him every day
and nobody has the will to tear it down
and a plague across his land
for the canticle of manacles abating
did you ever connect or come to reject or even inspect
well hell no dont look at me
ten billion people all suffering
10 in 2010
and distractions
hey ho
conserve life make it right
subconscious minds when we're asleep
filled with poignant morose wonder
resonating its screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence
which we carry deep inside
while the human masses and their vague conceptions
that i'm so far away from home
all gets pointed in the same direction
so far away to another abyss
we spear ahead and forge our destiny
we're trying everything we can to stop this fall
and i wonder if i'm living too far out of bounds
is it too much to ask
i aint no blind supporter
he used to touch it when the wind was blowing high
immolation incorrigible delight
then i'll turn on the light and i'll burn lika a roman fucking
like diamonds in the sand
'cause noises in the house are terrifying
and over agin one part per trillion unacceptable on part per
our progeny in silence thinking what about us
consciously omitting the losers plight
the pain was like brimstone but the kid hardly bled
among the parade crowd there stands a decorated man
the evil sits inside them torpid timing its escape
ban questionable books and contribute to many other godly services
hire men to change the law protect and serve with one small flaw
love for money in god's name religions now a tv game
today after 40 years of toil he just stood up and walked away
the rotating ball where man comes first
they will all soon be put to rest
so now it4s time to watch it die
there are other folks in power so you kick back and get farther behind
with their minds
you see the world's falling apart at the rifts
i am one and plural too
but i dont know what it is
and our generation doesnt know
empty
all those places i wanted to go
wasted children fixed blank eyes blood and sweat we socialize
white trash 2nd generation white trash 2nd generation
us government drew up plans
empty
stop dont wait too long make up your mind
and kiss your ass goodbye with a shadow dream of yesterday
and the ringing in the air is the sweet debris of yesterday
the country cant pretend to ignore its people's cries
just think of all the things we did
hey you
mugger was security
like a confederacy of the wrong
and i wish you the best of luck dear
it's where everyone has been and where everybody goes
a rhapsody
desperate romance
cheat your friends
you've got to hit the links
if you dont make it to the dance
seem to pull us under
president's estate
it makes us walk
of the starving children
and the kids with no moms
and this is what she said
they unravel like the thoughts in his head
and is it possible too many have died
all thrown in without a choice
that drastic actions will make them unique
feel the sting of its consequence and i know i shouldnt but it's too
in the city the day is too hot
you cant see no light but you hear those heavy footsteps
and the breathing at your side is it yours or is it
pilgrim see the writing on the door
pious eyes ignoring passers by
is it any wonder
that we hoist on our own shoulders
are just for someone's personal gain
remember life on earth is but a flash of dawn
just keep your fucking distance
angst and madness weave the fabric of his life
i know there's so much you want to say
dont wanna live
we're comin on fast
dont wanna be
but even ten million souls
i cant live
them and us
them and us
and there wasnt any reason or
reading my mail
now somebody out there must be
yeah i'm a man with a mission
if i can touch it
everything you take leaves a mark on your soul
i knoe i have to face the harshnes grin and bear the truth
there aint no fear in this
and i'm not meek
like rome under nero our future's one big zero
sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of
reasons not to be what the privileged define with their
`cuz i'm an overactive brain
mediocre minds
you'll be discarded away
they wanna keep me locked away
so proud a history replete with sanctity orbs in their harmony they
comprehends you feel no affinity to the rabble we're in sources of
that's ready to blow
know all the right equations
this is the 21st century
modern man evelotionary betrayer
if you're discontent to know you world's a pile of shit
did you find what you were looking for or not at all
say the name
his ship is crumbling
i know there are people
but i'm so fallibly human
transcend the mass hysteria
we are just marching toward extinction
empty
you can live in staunch denial
that can expand beyond all hope of light and plunge us into unrelenting night
the world will be erased our kin will be
this is deep
we all had better stop hoping and set our heads on straight
'cause that old one's turning on you
a new a new a new
history and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
you have no control you are not in command
now a confused school girl stares at the tv tray
so they look to someone else
you'll get no direction from me
once you convince yourself
there's no substance
you cling to your hopes while your drop to your knees
yeah sure i might do harm
i look for inner wealth
listen to me
she was barely a teen
i'm bound to be broken
it's so sad no one saw it coming
who are you here to repair
there is no such thing as human debris
a little cracked it's just a token
cant stop
i hate when i gotta tolerate
cant stop shocking but i just cant stop it
institution on the hill
like the comforting caress of a mother
millenia in coming the modern age is here
and you made a maelstrom of organic debris
you took a lion
someone tell me please
you have created a powerful monster
full of adherent people with the same objective
but i swear to you we're different from all of them
but we're lookin for a few more stalwart clones
if you're not one of them you're us already so
all we want to do is change your mind
where truth is determined by consensus
come and join us
people tell me of a divine right and the happy chosen one
extract the nectar burn the tree i gotta be damned to be free
make no mistake despite our traits i've seldom seen evidence of genes
did you know him in life one filled with regret
chaos is the score upon which reality is written
meaning in your life
lament not your vanquished fantasy
headed for eternity and destined for nothing
there aint no destiny
i sit on my ass all goddamn day
so do what you must do all you can
william had 26 blew his brains out now look at him
you're losing sight
so the company asked him to quit
dont do that to me
back when he
that's written everywhere
dispose when i'm shot
that no surplus can repay
just dont sell me short
mother father look at your little monster
doctor cure me what is the cause of my condition
i am incompleteincompleteincompleteincomplete
urbana is oozing like a bloated carcass
individuals command exception
please stop before i do it again
i love to strike you
you and me we're made in heaven
dont look for new consensus dont stray from constitution
in sagacious dialog they despise their average ways
as is dinner with your loved ones every day
on the bus ride home from work to end your day
you're too scared of other people not like you
wo oh oh oh oh
wo oh oh oh oh
wo oh oh oh oh
and pointless way of dying
it feels so good
founded on petrochemical plunder
this mythologic hopeful monster to exact its price
we live our lives
this mythologic hopeful monster isnt worth the risk
the camera's on them they're in the land of competition
tell me what do you need to make you happy indeed is it out of your reach
just blame it on the kids and toss 'em into the tank
political resentment and people start to crack
dont even scratch the surface of the problem here
you create your own reality
and it's wo oh oh oh
you cant assess the future
with fortitude and mental might
but the people arent looking for a handout
but the people who benefit most
we've got to kill 'em and eat 'em
but not tonight feed 'em death
and to say what's waiting on the other side
would you give it all up to live again
i saw myself in the broad daylight
that this was only human
one day you may find
st anne's skirts are billowing
even the stars are ill at ease
when the hills of los angeles are burning
the flames are stunning
i could be the archetype a credit to the
but the storybook sages fill their pages
one by one we all fall down
one by one we all give in
could it be that it's only superficiality
and these have created the new foundations of society
and if you wont uphold your side then it's better to
pocked flesh and malacious bones
the hippy killers
and a passing wink of the eye
at least you tried to kill the demons inside
and a comfort zone
and let 'em all know
why do you lie
why do you lie
why do you lie
seen it through the accolades and rested in its lea syntactic is our
downs from all industrial crimes and the weeping mothers and those who
it's only for a while we have been deceived and it's only for a moment
and the pain that it brings
to come alive
poor science in service of a faith
just a quest for new bargains
empty
we're not the same person
clinging to their childish notions of social welfare why you're even kept
back ward country will give us what we need by exploiting its uneducated
we have arrived neighbours we are the priviliged elite
sparkled promises paved with pathos and hysteria
hardened surface
for what you promised
how can your romance hope to be the veil of an ersatz human nature
you know
convince yourself that someone cares
and unwittingly you just take your place in this parade
you've got to quit your little charade and join the freak parade
the world wont stop without you
i said the world wont stop without you
a chain reaction i've been hanging out here for eleven long yeras
the caste of coffee achievers didnt perform like they planned
that common goal for which you strive
what you do is what you are
it is wise to know their ways
empty
only temporary reprieve
and it's time to de evolve
but nobody wants to play in my garden
so i could make the gardening stop
'cause i'd wiggle all night
his life is meaningful because he gets things done
he's our savior he is the common man
factory precision is your
it's conjured up in lies
as you ruminate the hopeless sands of time
when you bite the dust was it for purpose or for trust
so think think before you die
just a neighborhood reject
because it's written all over your face
above us lay the burdens below us lay the truth
how could i know that you'd burn
take it away cuz there's nothing to miss
the next time i create the universe
a smile on the lips and a hole in the head
better off dead yeah better off dead
up on a mountain encased in solar rays
beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays
as it crouches literally in space
big bang big crunch you know there's no free lunch
big crunch you know it's gonna be quite a show
i can recall the warm youth of a summer day yeah
he couldnt break the chain of slow decay that seemed to drag him
how fragile is the flame that burns within us all
intertwining can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell
and like fools we trust the delivery
weak and sick dying in the sand no such thing as a promised land
in the end you'll return once more to die again
empty causes
a war for the body an army in the mind
empty causes
temporary fixtures for which we strive something in our synapses
of no return my brothers
the fallacy
we could be
why do revelations fade to cold blue untruths
of epiphany
conspirator so fine
cuz next time
when the house is burning
time because our tender isnt valid if your soul needs love you can
but when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
so you'll always have god
they'll tell you you cant have your own way
dont let your emotions mask your sight
and we're all in this tigether dont you know
and the fertile crescent is haunting us today
seeking a purpose and the meaning of kin
war is god
will never love any less
below are picking up sticks and the man in the gallows lies
no destination lie lie lie ad inifinitum
but soon enters dusk as the last surrey rusts and a new day upon us results
frogger with my life with my life x3
in the end the good will go to heaven up above
like a fucking atom bomb
like the blood on the door
there's a knife on the floor
delegate facilitate investigate and obviate
clip the wings of progress turn the direction
frippery unnecessary in our expanding global cultural efficiency and
who succumb rapidly
twisted torment make believe
they call it god's love
is profit and greed the only conceit on a scale between
but i dont wanna hear it anymore
but i dont wanna hear it anymore
you promises me a new day a'dawning
but a score of mothers' sons
who like good dogs sit and lick for their reward
amid the heat and the wrack
cracked vertebrates stacked by the wayside
did you laugh you know i did
how did you get so mean i want to know what it means
i imagine how his mother felt when she heard that her husband was dying
we're all mad and tangled in secret rooms with roman candles
i've been incredible so damned irascible
tell me is there anything so sure
think about the times and places you've never known
respectable despicable it seems all the same
i love my computer
and we'll be joined
i love my computer
and a clever screen name
and it must looks pretty appealing
and it must look pretty appealing
the blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion
your actions speak so loud i cant hear a word you're saying
promote equality in all my decisions
promote equality in all of my decisions
no one really knows why we die
blind to virtuosity ignorant of your sanctity
let me take you to the herding ground
and there will be sorrow no more
and there will be sorrow no more
and you sit there adn watch the world go around
yeah the means are verified
shed a tear for the criminal give him something to believe
you can fake another cry and compromise your dream
substance was restrained
promising salvation
weighted as a murder trial
rythmic as change
tonight the windows are watching
my morning papers got the scores
and a pack of wild desperados scornful of living
holding a candy cane
you can never get out
empty
a collision in the dark
he see's a note in the obituary
like a barren winter day
but i'm thinking altruistcally
i try to close my eyes
they just betray impoverished accomplishments
and hawk ultimatums so their weakness wont show
expectation indoctrination
door leading to the gift of hope renewed eternity for you
it'll never go away it's in the cards that way
just to stay in the human race
how does it feel to be outstripped by the pace of cultural change
i wont lie
tell me does life exist beyond it
crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution
i prefer my big brother he's so gentle and understanding
ten billion people all suffering
10 in 2010
and he complelled people to follow along
but as they were scutinized
searching for a modern day savior from another place
but stealthily in the land of the free he's lurking there
it's not there on the blackboard it's what they dont tell you
and my high speed connections monitored daily by the pentagon
i wont resign before the struggle ends
we trace the mortal edge with no defense
and your mother's in the kitchen
i must conceal myself and steal myself and break away
a message to you ru deee
a message to you ru deee that's right that's right
a message to you ru deee
a is for argument a is for apparent
a is for adversary a is for affection
a is for acting a is for abhorrently
you're an abacus
there's still a long way to go
i discovered alcohol
for while i cannot love myself
i love you more than i did the week before
alcohol my permanent accessory
my life never will
was a waste of precious booze
o alcohol would you please forgive me
i make sure the customers arent thieves
back to the dream i dream to leave
so we can get out of this town 'cause it makes me sick
aluminium to some
empty
am i the only one who asks you to go
am i the only one who needs you to go
is getting others involved
we are all phonies too
we're only trying to lend a hand
are trying hard not to care back off
oh until you're just like us
chorus x2
a goin fishin chimp a british chimp in the bath
i've got some shaved chimps that's chimps devoid of any hair
i've got depraved chimps dressed up in womens underwear
i dont know where to send it
sweet potato pie
i give the globe another spin
for auld lang syne my dear
we'll take a cup of kindness yet
my mother will start to worry
say what's in this drink
i really cant stay
so nice and warm
i've got to get home
at least there will be plenty implied
and all the selfless things you did with billy
he said you are the only one
40 days at sea
if you think growing up is tough
well i thought i was wide awake but my legs were still asleep
that my parachute failed
but they tell me that i'll never walk again
i get a good seat at a concert
over the fields we go
jingle bells jingle bells
o what fun it is to ride
jingle bells jingle bells
batmobile lost its wheel
empty
go it while you're young
in a one horse open sleigh
singin song tonight
i know you must have loved me sometime
a boy to be who
'cause i cant afford to lose more sleep
do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do
it's never enough
for me
then she came 'round
when we are happy we both get fat and still
it's not that easy 'cause
her life in a nutshell
no way would she want it to change me
sing in tune with the din of the falls
to light my way home
somehow that always just made me feel good
only you can cure dismality
suddenly she wishes just like all the fishes in the sea
only you can make importancies into trivialities
hey watch me now i'm on your plate
for the first time i knew what to do
why not spend a week on a star
then the worst timing i ever knew
lovers in a dangerous time
sometimes you're made to feel your loves a crime
please dont go rushing by
i cant do anymore
stay and make my heart fly
chorus x2
she's got a daughter and you're just not coping
pretty soon you will be needing me
we'll find our way to what we're looking for
and we can argue 'till our throats are sore
maybe we should divvy up the things we bought
shall i take back everything i've ever said
shall i take back everything i've ever said
shall i take back all my attacks all of my accusations
maybe you're right
i turn the corner at the traffic light
she doesnt try to impress anyone
she has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
good bye good bye
i am in love with a mcdonald's girl
that i can do anything
i'll give you a hint
got a big chip you want a fat lip
when i'm old and grey
i can be that
what do you say i love you
but i'm playing castanets with my knees
everything will be alright
everybody just say ahh
dictate a memo to myself
but it's hard to stand up
everybody get in line
just get on the phone tell her you're coming home
when you make a mistake
if you think of her as catherine the great
but you've got to be fast put your foot on the gas
just pack your bags and get yourself on a plane
from god our heavenly father this blessed angel came
gold i bring to crown him again
worship him god most high
empty
andrew govatsos he's our man
he'll wack you up
first day of school and i'm already failing
and none of them can help me study for my math test
i've got a red leather tie and pair of rugger pants
where does the time go when it's not around here
as your road narrows so mine grows wider
bundled up against the cold
red bows on the railings and snowflakes on the ground
the snow's here everyday
now dont close your eyes
creepy creeps with eerie eyes
to socialize
anyone with half a heart would let me drown
anyone with half a heart would let me fall
before they ever let the other half find out
it's easy to forget
there's a joyful time every night
gather round the table we'll give you a treat
something's gone wrong something's gone wrong
and if it's a girl i'll call her gordon
all i want is a baby all i want
steven page is having a baby
they say by mistake
hopping 'round from site to site like tourists on vacation
everybody's laughing while at me they point a finger
the same quicksand
of the hotel room
climb down three flights to the streetlights
then it sunk in this enduration
a hidden sun that burns and burns
mistaking lust for love
when you walked me to the bus
i thought that you would be begging to be with me
god that was dumb
and then there was me
put your hands up or i'll shoot i dont have hands
i'd like to learn about your pizza and your weather
i like your hat fade
just why does she need him and why does she stay here
you've never really known that when the white flag is flown
the ribbons of the flag
come on now now
come on now now
come on now now
i've never felt so small i've never been so dissed
you know he's not the king of bedside manor
he's a quickdraw with a lighter he's a pseudo movie star
he's not the king of bedside manor
the bluebird shall not sing again
i know it hurts
broken glass broke and hungry
i guess they still are i want them back
how is the neighbor downstairs
only memories fading memories
you know i did the deed
when two men dream of you at night do you just dream of him
empty
if a spider gets killed how does that make it rain
and the water's gettin high
but i've never been good with plants
can all this fruit be free
i'm not trying to sing a love song i'm trying to sing in tune
i believe in the prozac nation
does it show in the drinks i've bought
doing it myself
'cause i thought you'd know
i never told you i agreed with you
now i cant believe
i never said that i would wait for you
the highway's dividing the city's in view
not the feeling so much as the sound
i guess it's over now
i'm just a posthumous part of the scene
you say that i pulled the world from under you
just wait
if i knew i was understood
she's upset and i want to lick the honey
with tracy
and that's the trouble with tracy
with tracy
in taking me back for the night
i dont know where i'm going
you know that somebody got there first
to leave me
you can drop me there
my elwyn is small
i've been here i've been demeaning
i took a trip but it was never a vacation
turning all the pages
empty
imagine everything you've done
the kind of man who'd make a choice
so i will not turn my whole life upside down
i wont make a sound
he's a magician
you are vanishing
you are vanishing
the only flaw in her detailed plan
she falls asleep in a lukewarm bath
but never seem to be
from the very fear that makes you want to die
my hands were tied and the phone was bugged
people want to strangle us with them before we take our first breath
if i pass if i fail if i drop out
chickened out grabbed a pen and paper sat down and i wrote this song
and when you were born they looked at you and said
i wish i could fly
they're lined up at the window peer down into limbo
with life just begun my sleeping new son
what do you dream about
he's forgotten all he knew before
or languages not yet conceived
what do you dream about
i throw the sheets off and i freeze
who needs sleep
the only thing that counts is
since the second world war
so many pleasures all around
that i wont sleep
since the second world war
wind it up
if you are leaving then i wish you luck
wind it up
wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
quickly loudly
wishing well
wishing well
do you believe that we are all innately good
until we forget
empty
and so you hate my arrogance my smothering and sitting on the fence
and tell me where to go
we'd over rehearsed it we had full control
you had the last word the go or no go
instead we're most wanted on the six o'clock news
i think we all know who should shoulder the blame
there's no need to phone
standing next to you i feel hopeless and you know this
and we have to or we'll end up in the bath
have a nice day
saw it coming from a mile away
we're just pulling legs
it was a gag
leave that dial son
gallows pole will be erected
it was all for a laugh
knowing you'd never travel far
that's what you do when time is running out and running down
someday i'll write and ask you
the girl works at the store sweet jane st clair
she made me feel i was fourteen again
no promises as vague as heaven
i can go to europe travel with my friends
i never worked my way through a forest inch by inch
you never have to do that stuff
i never want to do that stuff
join the chorus of the second best
is it true yes it's true enough i guess
maybe it would be fun
if i could just reverse time
it's out on the escarpment
soon gone
you wiped out on your ten speed
and in the mist our hero stands
an offer and a pilot drew him west
the casting agent called to say
and vaguely celtic music fills the air
distracts us while the actor takes the stand
with money from mowing lawns
good for you
making room for something new
good for me serendipity
rolled over got a kiss on the ear
she's on time
we cant stop when all our systems are go
one day i might look like a fool
she's on time she's on time
a note on the table and a meal in the micro
it's under my bed it's never been read
and you dont want any more from me
and it's nineteen ninety four
it's always lalalalala
shopping never end
it's always
how i fit in
i melt away
i dont fit in
pay up front and make a wish
but none as much as my want to be with you
as i launch you into space
and it'll make you want to be with me
i missed out on the best of you
i'm hoping you find it
staring at the sun as you're blinded
that's not even there
could you be the one who will find it
some kind of bondage
that it's fine if it's not in me
oh how i miss waking up to the sound of your voice
to the sound
i'd better grow some fins 'cause
in the corner beside my bed
there's a spider in my room
that's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart
that's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart
my gastrointestinal festivals best of all
are two of three women who dictate what i'm worth
you signed your picture with an o and x
although they've heard the songs my friends want living proof
but guts only eat
not real words mostly vowels
heart beats in sync beat in time
words music by steven page ed robertson
you cried a tear i wiped it dry
you could have said thank you
but i know it was meant to be this way
but try to look away
we will never lose if we remove our shoes
oh i i watch it all go down
no sound everything's a race
but then a break is just around the bend
i fight embarrassment and shame
then i've got a six lane highway
but i can and i will and i do i can and i will and i do
it has a lovely body
a happy game of dreidel
my asking you questions you cant answer
and stop meowing
you have faith you just need to use it sayeth the lord
on august first nineteen eighty one
a marathon of heartbreaking moments
but i'm staying here inside my biggest mistake
empty
let me explain dont walk away
but just take a look at the chart for my heart
how did you know that i loved you so
on christmas day in the morning
words and music by steven page ed robertson
if i had 1000000 you could help it wouldnt be that hard
if i had 1000000 we wouldnt have to walk to the store
if i had 1000000 i'd buy your love
i'd buy you a k car a nice reliant automobile
i'd buy you a fur coat but not a real fur coat that's cruel
if i had 1000000
i'd buy you a monkey havent you always wanted a monkey
if i were a field you would be in clover
if i were the sun you would be in shadow
when you're done
there'd be no tomorrow
a book and record love
and found each other
unless i've got this wrong a secret all along
we groped for excuses
i'm in the drink for love
i'd like to sip the sap from your tree
a feathery crystal in the flavour of gum
inline bowline inline bowline
no one knew he'd give it use
it's handy on a whim handy on a whim
hope you dont mind
but should i tell you to your face and
stick around if you enjoy disaster
now i'm on my own and i'm sorry that you're gone
was much more fun
it's all been done
now that all the snow has fallen
he set it up with his family
odd grunt
i'd save on the wedding ring
i'm the me in monogamy
to get to you
i'm the me in monogamy
be my be my
i know that when i say this
what if you were not just for show
empty
empty
empty
empty
beautiful when i see
what can be gained so if all else fails you can blame it on me
maybe if you'd ask me on any other given day
they say that absence makes the heart grow fungus
will she ever understand my world
born human to the crazy world
i never thought that you would love me the way that you do
but if you want it folks you got it
this is really me in a grade school play
you can hear it on the oldies radio station every night
a dance remix so i can catch the latest trend
i hope you enjoy my new box
just like this time and every time
even half assedly loving you
try to make you love me as much as i love you
that makes me fall apart
but when i'm surrounded i just cant stop
so i'm lying here just starting at the ceiling tiles
empty
just to check out the late night record shop
i'm a walking advertisement
i cant hear a thing
come on over i'll show you how
now i'm finding out that it's so confusing
no time left and i know i'm losing
i'll point you home
i'll point you home
but i'm warning you dont ever do
and do you think that you know mine
i'll roll the dice you try your luck
i thought that it was nothing but now i
living wondering what if
i couldnt care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
i couldnt care less if my car says the door is ajar
i couldnt care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
and i'll be imitated
and there's nobody i dont know
try to behave
hold still wait for the click
tears rollin down my nephew's face
just like me they long to be
so they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight
ahhhclose to you
we were right we were given
i couldnt care less what's in a chocolate mousse
i couldnt care less how do they fill the caramilk bar
i couldnt care less what morton downey says
their like fourty or something
i'm not a manic depressive paranoid or schizophrenic
i'm not playing with a full deck
stills nash and young crosby stills nash and
but it's all bark and no tree
now you really wanna show her
hey now wake up
it's like making love to a tv
she makes you wanna know her
now i'm wrapped around your whole hand
and manipulate
easy to betray
easy easy
make some noise
but when thrown into the moment we just dont seem so courageous
trends come and go and your friends wanna know why you arent just happy making crappy little gizmos
make some noise
enid we never really knew each other anyway
and there were times when i know that i did
but enid we never really knew each other anyway
i took a phone message oh and speaking of communication
enid we never really knew each other anyway
enid i can teach you how to snowmobile cross country ski snowshoe
til every friend i'd known was gone
everything had changed everything was strange
then one day i was not alone
everything old is new again
is it all lost no we never had it
afraid to roam in love with second best
all across the world people going mad
now that i'm back with you again
everything under the sun
and everyone she questions never seems to know
i'm so cool too bad i'm a loser
anyone perfect must be lying anything easy has its cost
feels just like i'm falling for the first time
well i grew up on a farm
taller than danny devito
the s one w
sound of the funky drummer
gotta give us what we need
lemme hear you say
to revolutionize make a change nothins strange
make everybody see in order to fight the powers that be
but he never meant shit to me you
was a number one jam
never knowing if i was right behind you
couldnt move and this is where you found me
and i'm surrounded with the sound of laughter
though i thought over it through and through
there is nowhere else i would rather be
she walks through the corn leading down to the river
and her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
you know she took all the love that a poor boy could give her
i'm not internationally known
it takes two it takes two it takes two to make a thing go right
you crowned him king
young girls scream and old boys mock
'though it just might be your daughter on our bus
even my humility's humiliated
everything i've yet to break is surely bending
in photo three is my dog in the backyard
subtleties of black
each frame captures the various subtleties of black
he was your imaginary friend
the credit card receipts the dirty sheets
shaken while he stirred
waves crash the wall
pass me a drink
my heart's done
one week
hold it now and watch the hoodwink
you try to hold me but i bust through
cant understand what i mean
yesterday you'd forgiven me
okay i dont make films
i'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
yesterday you just smiled at me
peterborough and the kawarthas
tell him i love him look him in the eye
peterborough and the kawarthas
i feel fine enough i guess
t we fooled you huh we're sneaky like thatyou can never trust a canadian next thing you know we'll be supplying your natural resources
and run through with my gym shorts on
realise that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
if i packed a car and leave this town
take your time cos the way i rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya
powder blue always suited you
i made love blind i lost my mind
you held out your heart
psycho killer
qu'est ce que c'est
run run run run run away
i hate people when they're not polite
just show me the venue
it cant be beat
on the other side
it's all true cross my heart and hope to die
i may go back someday
it cant be beat
you always wear it with a sense of style
i like to wear it with a skirt
take off to the great white north
empty
when will he learn that he never can hold you down
it wouldnt happen with a better plan
one for all is fair in love and war
empty
though it was handed to us we refused
i stopped into a club
i'm running out of ink
they said that it was fine
and see it in their eyes
until you heard me sing
to drive a man to drink
i saw you on the lawn
i threw it off a bridge
this is what it takes
i've been around the block at least on my bike
must've been the same thing
who asked you anyway
electronic actors and astromagnetic
biochemical jism
comin to you
and a backstage pass
portions of the proceeds
comin to you
much too bright
telephone bills up my sleeves
and they were singing like this
just shake your boots and let it all get loose
i'm sad and unhappy
buddy put me down on the bus
gotta be
wake up
through the cracks of his eyelids
black hole
dont know what life that i'm livin
black tambourine
we'll shoot our guns
i'll never forget you
like a mirror in my mind
light a wooded matchstick
from the mangled lungs
hardware defective
just to savor they did it
from a moving van
but everybody's double parked
this jam is real that's right
turning out of a tin can
think tanks empty
from a sky lit terrain
delirium seagulls
from a sky lit terrain
shooting venom at the passers by
blow back derelict when lay my soul in the foul of the air
got a devils haircut in my mind
got a devils haircut in my mind
devils haircut in my mind
talking trash to the garbage around you
na na na na na na na x4
looking for a life to call our own
i push i pull the days go slow
like an epileptic battery man
probably do it again and again
'til the dirt gets wet
to talk to my brain cell
the dishes wash good
now everybody's sweatin
with the weekend off
animals with bananas
i threw a roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain
when darkness has fallen
all i need is all i need is two white horses in a line taking
some may say this might be
fuckin with my head
no no no no
empty
hey hey hey hey
i saw her yeah i saw her with her black tongue tied
and i know i'm gonna make her die
throw a coin in a fountain of dust
hey my sun eyed girl
two dimensions dumb your head down
please enjoy
code red cola war conformity crisis
please enjoy
saying everything is groovy
anything you want is yours now
high 5 high 5
'round and round with the speed of sound
beers and chairs no frontiers
turn that shit off man what's wrong with you
ok now do like designer jeans
they know it's
she's ridin a landslide down to me
it takes a backwash man to sing a backwash song
translation i'm a broken record i have bubblegum in my brain
jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease
and you got the hotwax residues
translation i'm a broken record i have bubblegum in my brain
when i wake up someone will sweep up my lazy bones
i dont want no cryin
when i get my money
i dont want no cryin
your senses are gone so dont you hesitate
throwing your two bit cares down the drain
with the plastic eyeballs spray paint the vegetables
so shave your face with some mace in the dark
'cuz one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
soy un perdedor
soy un perdedor
i'm a loser baby so why dont you kill me
doin the latenight run
there was a warrant out on me
called up some girls
and we stopped into the 7 11 to try our luck
and three big macs to go
the last survivor of a boiled crap
when the cup is filled you can run and be killed
it's a sensation
down a dirt road to find you
and wash me down the gutter
current turns on a lifeboat floating
something always missing always
we're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
the lord will take his motorcade
telling me everything's gonna be ok
running on a plane
somebody's calling
i'm not scared
hey mr asshole
total paranoia
everyone's out to get you motherfucker
oh it's nausea oh nausea
who could see his own reflection
i eat alone in the desert
a chain link wind
jingling a wish coin
down on the corner
drivin on the sidewalk
she's a whimsical tragical beauty
uptight and a little bit snooty
she's cooking salad for breakfast
we are aimless
paid vacations
on a billboard
or modesto
got so low your mom wont drum
grinding the gears eighteen wheels
this is the album right here
i pay no mind
so get out your lead pipe pipe dreams
that's why
crown never wake them up mas cerveza till
guero where you going qu onda guero
like a mariachi band in the middle of the street
plastic bags walking to church with their
a donde
we dont have to talk at all
let the rats watch the races
pigsties and prizes
one and all
in the next life
stuck together like a readymade
down where the reaper is walkin alone
she dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
big fat moon
in your truck
she is all
sometimes the jail cant chain the cell
what gives you comfort now
i dont need no wheels i dont need no gasoline
i got a stolen wife and a rhinestone life and some good ol boys
dont talk to me if you're looking for somebody to cry on
put a candle on the window sill
taking heart out of the shell
like a bird with no hair
i was only trying to get warm
get busy get busy you know it
fourteen days i been sleeping in a barn
with a butterfly net
cause i aint washin dishes
put me in a hole in the ground
lost my head beneath the wheel
we can watch it from the rooftop
lord please dont forsake me
besides the dust in my pockets
we'll be on the shoreline
i'm gonna break my face
with your husband dreamin
i wanna swing through the city
gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
first time first love oh what feeling is this
but ya got to reach and ya gotta explore
and when something's happens
we'll know what we're made from
highrise eyes see for you
she's got the lily white cavity crazes
she's alone in the new pollution
dont wanna let the night get ahead of myself
counting all the cash from an old shoebox
to fake your death
really think i better get a hold of myself
think i'm in love
i'm totally confusedby you
fuck you
empty
screamin jackass with a wet cigarette
it's just the shit kickin speed takin
oh yeah
left the keys in the car
doo doo doo doo doo doo
as it was turning around
we descended on the reality
let the scenery pass
last ditch road
with the jig saw jazz and the get fresh flow
where it's at
let the man get loose while i rock the most
two turntables and a microphone
there's a destination a little up the road
i got two turntables and a microphone
lay it on to the dawn
everything we done is wrong
and he swaggered off walked past the window and down the stairs and then at the bottom
night living there's a lot of squirrels and birds and stuart says he's seen about nine
he just got up and walked off into the mist and didnt say anything the first few times
thought he probably liked the fact that we were living there because he came round so
and you're filling your fat face with every different kind of cake
i'm sorry but i've got some things to do
and my face is scarred
another century of fakers
but what if i got there and it was light all civilised and populated and stuff
winter in springtime
is all i have to show for
seven weeks of river walkways
she couldnt tell if it was a man or woman
i wish that i could sing
her worries make everything else seem trivial
i'm in senior year
a demon at maths and science
i put on my headphones
'not today just the choir from the radio'
what would i do to believe'
we're playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
i heard the eskimos remove obstructions with tongues dear
she lay in bed all night watching the colours change into green and gold
beautiful only slightly mental
there'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
she mad herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
he wants to love and he wants to care
he would never be young again
for belle and the boy sebastian
belle was ok but oh sebastian
joseph was travelling with a heavy load
feeding our counsel and true comfort give
call my girl on the phone
met the indie cool queen
1 like the tone of her voice
are you talking to me
why is this happening to you you're not a child
dirty dream number two
written for you
on the river bridge to me a vision was shown
day upon day of this wandering gets you down
cell of your mind
to crowds there assembled
we know you are hard cause we all saw you drinking from noon
sunday bathtime could take a while
she caught the bus
she asks me why i dont
she caught the bus
girl in the snow where will you go
boy on the bike what are you like
it's time to take a holiday
in the hope i'll forget i'll wait
that makes a lonely one less cold oh
there's got to be a better song to sing
feeling wise
ride in the field
guitar break
walk to the station
the picture was an old collage of something classical
'cause lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
the dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
i know you were historical from all the books i've read
of all the trouble kept her inside
you're happy cause your cosy and the rain comes rattling in
kissing girls in english at the back of the stairs
in his blue velour and silk
the stars of track and field are beautiful people
but when she's on her back
he stood up with a sailor friend
the priest in the booth had a photographic memory
i gave myself to providence
and i found her in the morning somewhere in the back of my mind
you think i'm faultless to a 't'
just hope that you are on my side my dear
i followed her across the city
she wasnt even looking
i'll leave them to do what they need to
it's beyond me what a girl can see
empty
and forever and for no one i will let it all go by
well my heart has fallen down
i'd never been along before
now a new day comes
'cos the days are long where i come from
so far gone
and cross the street whenever we walk on by
why did she do it
dont be afraid
driving from california to new york
your wage wont stretch to picking up checks
she said 'not for me i've got plans for later on
go ahead and kiss her you dont know what you're missing
you got spit in your chin
love love love love
and maybe that's enough
there's nobody else around around
just a minute close your eyes
i'm thinking of a song or two a boy a girl a rendezvous
with a torch and a womans realm to keep you warm
fall back to uneasy sleep
for a flight across the ocean
and the view outside the window
and i wont be there to see you go off you're head
you're just a baby baby girl
so let go of my hand so we can get some sleep
i go outside it's not so bad
how will i get her to strike a pose
sebastian you're in a mess
for looking at the floor
i know the company you keep
but whoever is in this day and age
no she wouldnt tell me no
well i'm in love with a certain boy
do you know what they are
and a fag in the morning with his special k
well i'm in love with a certain girl
at least that's what we say we are doing
new tall elegant rich kids
cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
half a world away
has he ever seen dundee
it's a good day for flying
she knows she's losing it yeah she's losing it
she says inch for inch and pound for pound
oh yeah she's losing it
and there were blue veins blue
and you walk twenty yards with your head in the air
and you trusted to this and you trusted to that
if you put down your pen leave your worries behind
imaginary friend
now the kid has gone to bed
and if they come tonight
enough's not enough i never ask why
'sunshine we all see the same sky
you said walk before you crawl
you said think before you speak
if all you want is to stay loose
my belief is like a bolt
if all you want is to stay loose
i couldnt care what's in the news
yeah i got my fingers dirty so i took a walk
and it's like your holidays whenever you go round
and when jo was short of cash i had to give her some
seven to eight years old that's pretty small
it didnt suit sukie
he watched behind the screen and she started to undress
she had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
for years and years he's done nothing but bow down and put up with all their demands
towering over the table he's lost
just please leave me alone
he's changing fashion the way he dress
she's taking an elementary class in kung fu
the dock in the lazy sun
but with a little wink i'll be there
you can put some money on it you can place a little bet
at least she may forgive me for my honesty
dont leave the light on baby
is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours
counting acts and clutching thoughts
would you love me till i'm dead
i think we're going walk out through the open door
maybe when we wake up in the morning
the boy done wrong again
what is it i must do
all i wanted was to sing the saddest songs
so says your r'sum
we had a deal there
the men are surprised by the language
i'm knitting jumpers i'm working after hours
take your shoes off curl your toes
suddenly without a warning
you're scouring everybodies face
1 could see the house where you lived
take a step to the discotheque and people
if you dance for much very longer
monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
so they jab you with a fork you drop the tray and go berserk
move to ladieswear and take a feel off joe the storeman
i've been looking round the town
the way they act i'd rather be fat than be confused
a thing i want to know
then i will change my name to jones
you can wish because i'm not here to fool around
where no one knows me and where i
you say i've got another face
sit down enjoy the show
dont listen to the gossip of the other folk
she took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
you're my vision in the hall
at the party at the club on a saturday night
you're the funny little frog in my throat
and i dont know how you smell
here on my own now on a bus
you're so naive
washing against the lonely tenement
i could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
is he your husband
i dont love anyone
i dont love anything
yeah if there's one thing that i learned when i was still at school
but i dont love anyone
to go looking for the enemy and it wasnt very long
there's trouble plenty in this hour this day
if your underarm smells
i've got my mobile phone
odds on was the noble pose and
i wish i could say the same for you
the day will come soon when i look in your eyes to
nobody was really saying anything of interest she fell asleep
how and why and when and where to go
look at me i'm on tv
if you stayed and played with yourself
i think i'm waking up to us
the beauty of the world surrounding her
i helped the kid survive
i cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
and they ran her out of town
when the dealers come to view
and you can tell by the way she looks he is sorry and resigned
well i'd thought about her
and i will make it some day
have we ever been true
we'll never change
judy was a teenage rebel
judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping
the best looking boys are taken
call it judy and the dream of horses
but you go all the way to being brutal
you know a girl who's tax free on her back and making
and you hope that she will see
you are sleeping at bus stops
municipal pool you're a junior life saver
wouldnt you like to get away
if i said all these things you would hate me
and open roads of eucalyptus
extend contractual period me and you for evermore
get out of the office and into the springtime
on your own
on your own
like dylan in the movies
you all stay quiet or you will die
bang on the teeth you are off for a week boy
melted tolberone under your dress
lord anthony but hey it kind of suits you anyway
from the view i saw today
after their tea when life begins again
that she could respect
mary jo sitting alone
she doesnt want to sleep
it's someone else's turn to go through hell
what you want is a cigarette
you are waiting for the time
you were there to see him play
you are the girl left on the shelf
me and the major could become close friends cause we
cause the queens own army makes a man of you
i get stuck in the lift it's always with a man

and everybody does
you were so disappointed
things that seem still are still changing
since the war was won
the ascent of stan
textbook hippie man
crossing the border with her starving child
spread the love around
spread the love around
rock on rock on spread the love around
sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
in a minute it will all be coming down
that i survived the other 25 before you
i am
that i am
that i know
the ultimate sacrifice
the final hour approaching
through their clothes
empty
now that i've got the disease
it's ok
we're all children of
cause every moment life is slipping away
because there's always someone cooler than you
nerds gone wild
and it makes it better i know
in time i wont care what you say
in time but time takes time you know
see the sisters shouting whispers
for the benefit of tom and mary
but i came home early
happens to be that everybody else's dreams are freudian clues
like she's hiding from me and
christmas twin falls idaho is her
that's where she still was the summer when she turned 17

he drove his chair in the cavalcade

rented a pool and hired a band
and they seemed to all need to believe it
and they wont fade
that keep you from falling down
je ne parle pas francais
playing sara with no h's favourite song
zak and sara
visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
though they say you'll never know
kicked it over and ran
never given a chance
both of us never tiring
empty
i never had experienced
it makes me think
got into a car
singing out loud
it felt like a lifetime
but it felt so good
are you sitting in the lights
when we were standing
three and a half minutes
i like a green leprechaun
i hit a new kind of low
kelly was a blackjack dealer
me and my honey rocking back and forth
they finally made it on the evening news
light it up again with my kin and friends
you'll go down to the gulf
m i crooked letter crooked letter
pretty momma come and take me by the hand
fingering your hair
aint that how it always goes
that it hurts to watch you waster away
so i go over later
over schooled and uninspired
sometimes you understand
got her boyfriend headed out west
she says
hoping for a raise
i can see they're both sides of the coin
i want to know what happened
it's three o'clock we're driving in your car
a long long time ago
could it be we've done something wrong
standing in our drive
waiting for this day
leave while you still can
and all that you were
into my arms
all around your feet
i think that you've found you even
i'll never judge you
cause nobody wants to be the butt of every joke
empty
and now i'm close
on a tuesday in december
always calling never phoning
you could be my winning season
to the room they painted blue
falling through again
closer than your faith
than touching the hand of god
closer finally
a stone's throw away
empty
for the warmth that the rain denied
as it crawled across the night sky
for every one yeah
but i still can hear you say
you're a cut that refuses to heal
and you're wearing thin
if the night is cold
i'm drifting i'm drifting
and the morning cuts you
come around stay awhile
that's ok that's alright
empty
aw yeah alright truth hurts inside
we sit around the house
everybody wants to be your friend
when you quit work
everybody loves a situation
i push the limits of good taste
shame shame
a loss
sailing on the charles when i heard you say
right now
dont worry the rain will
you get accustomed to the sound
parking lot a figure come about
towards something real
we'll be fine
dont look down
if the future leaves you needing
in our finest year
but those days were over
or was it just like those promises that you made
the sun would always chase the day
like 'harold and maude' and singing
on our last night
i fell in too deep
i'm a little bit sadder
overcome by you
cryptic elemental
hey you've got a lot of nerve to show your face around here
to chorus
get in to my car drive into the night
we both want the same thing
we both want the same thing
feat dj swamp
aw you better recognize son

shout outs to the ones we've lost
me and you

on a sunday afternoon
put on your mask my rosealia
you say no no no but the fighting goes on
you say no no no but the fighting goes on
how could you have missed
and kind words are scarce at best
and if you should fall
the best that we can do
the day we met that i cant forget
oh my god and dont forget ps
on this nasty greyhound bus
signed sincerely me
the face you make
the rain goes the sun returns
one thing will never change
scent of pine drifting by
hey yes i want a southern girl and i need a southern girl
i want a southern girl
empty
she smiles as she drinks ice tea
empty
even though you're far away
people move and fall away
i was pulling far away
you were special
when they all believe
then they'll leave you dry
now daddy dont love her anymore
watcha' saying
it's just still life with cooley
then shed a tear as she hid a smile
they dont know what they do to you
and if it feels good do it
and if it feels good do it
fade into the night
well she believes that i'd be better off without her
but there's no place to hide
though it fades too soon
feeling right this time of year
well i know there's a reason to change
so go on let it be
along the edges colors blur at seem familiar
when we barely could survive i was never more alive
take over me
the want ads are strewn on the floor
a street serenade
and i recall all your
dont wake me i think i'm in a dream
now sleeping is easy
but what thoughts can i call allies
the strangest gravity affects my way
you'd make me whole again
you find yourself over your head
sweeter than sour
all i want to do
at a debutante ball
you know i love you baby
and all i've got to say yeah
cant i be your lover
can there be another
why cant i be your lover
searching for signs of life but there's nobody home
sitting around the house
aha it was good
your face is creased by the pillow case sheets
you got a laugh when you fell face first on the floor
you were great
happy day mama happy day happy day happy day mama
you always said tell me when
reading your eyes in the glow
now maybe i'll try
and if you said i would go to heaven
to chorus
three different souls
all my rage
one was black one was blue
and all my days
bill and holly disagree
sunlight on a razor blade
and you framed the sun
they never remember
i got a little bit of reason
feeling the same way that i do
could it be so damn naive
in a world that's cellophane
make me a believer pick up the receiver
and that's the reason that i'm asking
empty
that's the reason that i want to know
dont fight it girl
girl is that the way it's going to be
na na na na natural
na na na na natural
a paris street
all of her days in a dry eyed haze
mining the seats for cash
worn out in juarez
empty
cant get enough to eat
you say you got all the sordid details
as if you'd even care
before the weekends over
did you see the blood run down did you laugh at all when the
going down again
before the weekends over
i like it like that
she can move you
just let yourself sink into the groove
just let them drift through your mind
with ten wide safe stairs
you've stolen my heart it's true
i want revenge
like adam in chains
why tear our world apart
wipe that shake it lose the blues right now
so shake them loose the blues right now

childproof the scene
aah life living in a rat race c'mon
with a rebel yell she cried more more more
with a rebel yell she cried more more more
a million times for you
more more more
i was scared to ask you out
sitting there our toes all muddy
but the best ones that i've has
thinking i could do this forever
man that was a good day
to give it to you and make you mine
now i'm a brand new man branded with the thought of you
that little tiny gage said it's that time
it's a pain in my gas
who's to blame for all my sorrow
there seems to be a real pain in my gas
they wont be reaching out for you no more
or tell your aunt louise tell anything you please
words dont come easy from a mans broken heart
i'm sick of fetchin and sleepin in the rain
the pack you found me with was bayin at the moon
i get off the interstate fifteen minutes late
all i'm thinkin bout is you
it's bumper to bumper and it's rainin buckets down
he said you see two old people but somethin down deep inside
and baby every kiss we kiss still feels like it's the first
you're like the sun in a clear morning sky
that saved a wretch like me
when we've been there
oh but now i'm found
to say i miss you more than ever and to promise you this
but they say this thing is finally coming to an end
next to his medal and a flag that she would gladly give back
i should be feelin like a king
i know just what i need
still dont fill the empty spaces
to southern is so sweet
and find my way back to you and me
and you my brown eyed girl
sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
with you my brown eyed girl
sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
burn down the trailer park
i've got a strong suspicion she's at it again
saying daddy could we play a little one on one
you got responsibilities
you got to go got to run
there's a call one day from the office
in that schedule that you keep
someday somewhere somehow
no more peace than a southern breeze
the sweet taste of homemade wine
through every storm and each endeavor
searchin for my daddy through the pines
stand still
now that i'm a grown man
playin on my tv screen
stand for what you believe in
i feel the earth shake raise my voice
stand when it's dark all around you
stand when it's dark all around you
stand when it's dark all around you
well you done proved you aint shy honey look me in the eye talk some
tonight is history lady if we cant talk about it
dont think it's crazy baby it's just my rule of thumb
it's good to be good but i'd rather be lucky
the future was looking bright back in '62
but there was trouble on the other side of town
as i turn off the cable and put my babies to bed
i love
having lived a life
i fell
when i'll be gone
when i see
all those victory lanes
and wish the man was here
he knows the future's lookin bright
nooo no noooo
preacher man sang a song of love
the other side is waitin
the other side is perfect
oh the other side
now i go back in time
now what's right is right and you aint been right yet
cant stand the thought of being alone you need to be there when i get home
three little words would be fine
every story has a lesson to learn it wont be long till you take your turn
for you for you for you
for you for you for you
blows by
the only thing we had then was us
god i wish you'd clip it's wings
it's time for letting go we cant hide what we both know
it's time to realize that we're both just living lies
love through eternity
to this life i've made but dont understand
and let you hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
i want to laugh i want to be set free
we'll share our secrets our little white lies
it's way too soon to talk about forever
dont even whisper one little word about love
how can this world be so dark so unfair and so untrue
morning suns cast some shadows with questions inside
it was blockin my view so i steered that thought aside
looks dont mean a thing if the heart aint true
now i need somethin that's more my speed
drops the kids at school along the way
and he may not drive the nicest car
i wanna be your joe
but i want you to know
the farmers rise up every morning at five
here's to every salesman on the telephone line
we the people choose it we the people vote
we can talk all night or make love by the moon
god's smilin down
that's the whole human race
what else is there
you say lover's vows only hold you down so i guess i'm moving on
what'll you think about me when i'm gone
where'm i gonna live when i get home
i hear your footsteps down the hall
without you
no i cant go on without you no i cant go on without you
from this aint easy to you'll get along just fine
i took off my jacket and put it away
talkin to mom about his day
wouldnt you do this for me
man asked why'd you risk your life to save mine
all he can see is a billboard sign
back to the day when the innocence died
now that you're here in my arms i'm alive
to brighten up even your darkest night
keep your head together now or call my name out loud
people can be so cold
and i'll be there yes i'll be there
so which one here belongs to you
there 'd be no question in your mind
he whooped up on that boy way bigger
yeah man he's mine and he'll always be
time sure does fly by
she called out are you leaving home
that little girl is a mama now
hey elvis wontcha come back home
hey elvis you're still the king
they're makin records but there's nothin new
now he's gone away and i'm in his place
you give it your best but you cant forget
but sometimes we cant reach that high
you can reach down deep inside
just believe dont look back
but not like this no nothing can compare
and i i never held anybody like you
how much love do you want from me
you took my castle and you stole my crown
i know that we just said hello now it's time for me to go
and i aint even left and it already dont feel right
you were my lover my loyal friend
i walk around like a nervous wreck
i cant live without your love
you're all i need the air i breathe
i want to call want you to know
that'cha need in your life even if you dont realise
empty
but baby if i aint got nothin
he didnt have the answers
is not enough to show
he has to leave and that's the way it is
drove in the nails as the rain came down
you're all legs in my old t shirt
a natural born beauty just the way you are
with twenty two freckles and a rose tattoo
but as time goes on i think about you more and more
i didnt know you when
there's just no way i could've seen you then
and i couldnt have needed you
oh i need you now
baby i still believe in both of us
empty
skinny dippin at a swimmin hole
your mini skirt an your sweet kiss
a simple time that's what i miss
things are changin man and that's a fact
little girls depend on things like that
caterpillar in the tree how you wonder who you'll be
we been waiting for this day
well the note said mrs johnson you're wearin your dresses way too high
and mrs taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
the day her mama socket it to the harper valley pta
please dont ask me to let go or make me give up
ask me i'll be there whenever you fall
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
bluebirds fly
you would never think a couple years ago
now i see him every week and every now and then
somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heavens sake
it's kind of catchy
white metal burn of the phantom mullet
all night long
i'd be forever wondering why
i'd be forever wondering why
the jeans i'm wearin look like dirt
instead of feeling foolish pride and fear
show her she is that special one who shines in your life like the rising sun
say you love her strong and true
i think back on yesterday being in your lovin arms
the people come to hear about the truth
the choir sang 'amazing grace'
love needs no space or time
she only smokes when she's sad
fightin my way through the rain
baby give me your hand one more chance dont go dont go
why did you have to go why am i missing you so
why did you have to go
i'll be beside you
i'd show them your picture
first i'm falling to my knees then i'm hanging by my tail
i called my psychic friend on channel three and she confirmed without a doubt
one night stands would end up from a midnight rendezvous
i never ever thought that i would fall in love with you
story goes the rest
years passed and young got old
nobody wins
but the mem'ries i'll caress
then i'd be happy and i'd take you home
give me one last kiss one last thrill
he sent you from heaven just to make my dreams come true
and there aint no man who could steal your hand and tear us apart
i made mistakes you made some too i guess there's things we just cant undo
little boy running through the yard fell and skinned his heart
as he looked in that baby's eyes as the baby cried
and says daddy i miss you
it could've been me standing there with you
i know i called just in time a bit too late
still live for my truck to be covered in mud
though i'm just as country as country can be
light in the head weak in the knees
holdin you close feels so right
crazy bout you baby what can i do
lordy mercy can i see crazy mama come back to me
there's a cross around my neck
i forgot to care
there's a cross around my neck
the cool of the night reveals the spark of a sweeter life
there's a pale light shinin from a bare refrigerator
dreamin in color livin in stone cold black and white
aint it sad johnny had another accident
in the board room of a squirrelly third world government
and knowing that i'm the one that makes you smile
everywhere i wanna be
something much more than her mother and me
that somebody out there is speaking to me
makes me think i may be looking at the face of god
it's like it's never gonna end
you're late again
flying by
you better hold on tight to that sweet sweet life
you better hold on tight it's a short short life
on a tall paint pony on a bolt of white light rode a fire eyed medicineman
but if you think i look bad bud you better check out yourself
empty
missing something searching high and low
till you give it to somebody
is there anything i can do
all you're got and all you've been given
all you're got and all you've been given
i gave a knee to the football team
to a boot camp corporal with a barber's chair
so there aint much left to offer but i give my heart to you
tough to go
it just wants to find
somebody's tryin to tell you they love you patsy come home
you see it's getting late
if you want the world to know
put a little love in your heart
put a little love in your heart
whatever they are
she's waitin on my blessings before she hits that
this is where i dont say what i want so bad to say
baby get ready
get set
when i see something that i dont like
everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
slow down you're gonna crash
but you cant say it 'round here
got my pedal to the metal got my hands in the air
and i dont know what to do
or is there just no use
the world needs rockin and i aint stoppin till it's done
we cranked it up till the wall came down
you dont ask i dont do
run run rudolph santas gotta make it to town
said santa to a girl child what would please you most to get
run run rudolph
well it was nothin like that rainy night
right then she turned and introduced me
she just smiled and didnt say the things
not only she dont love me
i guess she's really doin well now she's picked herself up off the ground
i was heartless and cold whatever i'd go i shot down every young girl i found
shot full of love shot full of love
and my heart says i should stay but my mind says i should go
and my heart still feels the same and will forever
take me away and turn back the years
few folks even knew his name
for the red white and blue
who stood the ground and took the fall
think of all your liberties and recall
i cant forget the look in his eyes or the tears he cried
to help their fellow man
has never ever loved the way that i have loved you
i hope you never find somebody new
rivers turn to wood ice melting to flood
evil souls fall to hell ever trapped in burning cells
why doesnt everybody leave me alone now
why dont you just get out of my life now
how i tried to get away from you now
was it wise to disguise
i've seized my soul in the fires of hell
i want to reach out and touch the sky
got all i want and i dont need to pretend
the unborn child that never was conceived
to know the reason why
will make your soul return
but now i'm wondering
yes i've seen the light and i've changed my ways
i think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
her distant dreamer on the seas of time
she was the queen of dance
what a combination peace and radiation
he's got to be more decadent than me
when i step outside i feel free think i'll find a place to hide
tell me people am i going insane
nobody i know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
visions cupped within the flower
take your wall of remorse takes your body to a corpse
faces shine a deadly smile
take your body to a corpse
turn around quick and start to run
people running 'cause they're scared
i lost the best friend
in love together
that i can still hear
and all the hate that's in their hearts
show the world that love is still alive you must be brave
fast sports cars and motor noise
kill someone no one will weep
out on the street i watch tomorrow becoming today
a woman for sale is gonna help me save my day
sunday's satisfaction monday's home and dry
dont you ever say die
never never never say die again
forever with me 'till the end of time
oh yeah
now i have you with me under my pow'r
leaving the life you led before we met
look into my eyes you will see who i am
i'm going to feel
taught young in legends
what can i do
you made me believe in the stories you told
mad politicians
think i'll lose my mind if i dont find something to pacify
stars shine like eyes
silver starlight breaks down the night
he's gonna blow me away
gotta see my rock'nroll doctor
the race is run the book is read
the gates of life have closed on you
where can you run to
god knows as your dog knows
someone to love me
makes me feel happy
i'm never gonna leave ya anymore no more
and then you said your last goodbye yeah goodbye
this time you realise that you're gonna die
ghostly shadows fill your mind
you know that this shouldnt happen to you
cold cold feelings are running through your brains
empty
let me feel the frost of dawn
will my ice age ever come
the world is a lonely place you're on your own
sadness kills the superman
synchronated undertaker
metaphoric motor replay
you think she wants your money but it's you she wants instead
wont you listen
oh yeah
i want you part of this sweet leaf
you took up all the vandals
there must be some way out of here
i wish you good luck
empty
empty
when you see this world we live in do you still believe in man
time to stop all your messing around
casting his shadow weaving his spell
just keeps walking
i wish i'd walked before i started to run to you
yeah with you
your folly finally got to spend with a gun
you've changed in life since it began
you are nonentity you have no destiny
i feel my world is out of time
catch the fastest train around nine
become reality to me
i dont even believe in peace
'cause no one else is true
it's the only way to fight in the end
well i dont want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
the ante is risen once a week
in the fields the bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning
wait 'till their judgment day comes yeah
i was looking in the sky
and i dont believe you can
'cause there's iron in my heart
lost in happiness i had no fears
eyes full of angered illusion
who worship you are blind
i dont think you're so smart
while people just across the sea are counting the dead
nobody will ever change my ways
still i wonder what it's like to be loved
'cause it may be that it's over for me
evil woman dont you play your games with me
your body moves just like the crack of a whip
fairy boots were dancin with a dwarf all right now
yeah i looked throught the window and surprised what i saw
fatalistic ships froma distant shore
she took my hand and then she started to speak
when i awoke in bed she lay beside me
so you wanna be a gypsy come on now
from life you escape reality's that way
so drop the acid pill dont stop to think now
your eyes no longer seeing life's reality
children playing dreamers praying
sing along
let's sing it again
oh it's a hard road
i'm living easy where the sun doesnt shine
i dont believe there's any future in cause
through the universe the engines whine
with the hateful battles raging on
love upon a land a world unknown
is he alive or dead
planning his vengeance
heavy boots of lead
give it all and ask no return
go the tiger burn in hate
he kills them with his knife in hand
what will happen to you johnny blade
who's fooling who
with all the pain i've watched you live within
with all the pain i've watched you live within
with all the pain i've watched you live within
pain suffering and misery
you think i'm crazy and baby
never give your trust away
everyone just gets on top of you
like butterfly so quick to die
hard to open yet so easy to close
your world was made for you by someone above
you turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride
they only started the war
hand of god has sturck the hour
dont you know it seems to be so unappealing
i'm talkin to myself more
if i was to smile and i held out my hand
another life's falling down onto it's knees
out back where they plant all the trees
even there my god will be
and all my ways to him are known
ten feet away my daddy buries me
though the gloom of night be round me
and his loving arms enfolds me
they're just afraid to change
and then they'll paint it
it's wings to fly away to better things
my new found faith will pay by check
grab my knee and look at me
when i heard a leaf of my life hit the ground
the sand blew in my eyes
he's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
will make you stop and wonder
would listen to me anyway
religiously they seem to sin
anything for anything and ending up with nothing
nothing's ever gonna come between
but i'm not appalled or afraid verbal pocket play
and you're leaving me
who today will be knocked off
i ate them off cause i was hungry as hell
is that what you're thinking that you are
i met a holyman that said that he knew the way
you've planted rotten seeds
i dont need your spells or the little
every day my living hell
where i can feel no pain just calm and sane
arms holding up my knees
in the stir for breathing air
he'd be free they'd let him be
bring him to his wife and kids
i walk around and it feels good to be movin
i'll bloody bleed on everything i'm seeing
so god why dont you come on over here
they'll stick straight through you
but its alright to smile back at me
we can count on problems that we might not necessarily
see everything on the inside out
laughin from the inside out
how i'm desperately in need
i write a letter to a friend of mine
from the inside
and a faithful father i am to be
'cause now she's telling me she'll have my baby
all i can say you know my life it's pretty plain
all i can say is that my life is pretty plain
and i start to complain that there's no rain
now i'm scroungy as can be
so he rambles through the weeds
pull you down now
when you or you or you feel the need to feel
with a candle comes emotions that
never had a problem till i stood face to face with me
high time i washed it all away
hey it isnt mine
oh because you know i cant hide
the time that all feels is the right time
i sure as hell dont feel like
these ones are getting lose
jump in the river and let the
gonna sell
we dont have to
outside i cursed the birds and the sugar sky
but i never no i never got the chance to say good bye
cause he's no longer living here
big stretch and not much sleep
one porch one dog one cockroach only way to be
twenty stories below
maybe sleeps gonna get me in the shade
but if i could buy the sky that's hangin
over this bed of mine
i dont think that i can find easier way
but you should have been in my shoes yesterday
that's why we'll crawl to walk for running
because they're just killing my time
sunny so funny not funny to me because
if i'm hungry at 430 in the morning
and i said god damn god damn that bible pushin man
the sun warms my body as i'm
mean you can feel that it's time to go
where you cant see me
now tell me why am i to lie
so i can start sitting so pretty
if i stood up and i walked away
the land of milk and honey
saying i eye god i gotta go
gotta have your own space to play in
pickles never opened since 1983
around and over and in between the seas
my feet are so cold
as its feeding on me
and he's breathing on me
and i take off his pants
what i said it is always my esteem that i sure lose
i'm all shook up as i get all nervous inside
any more than this
that hides away
empty
but i let the dream go
and make believe we never needed
i can really do
princess leia where are you tonight
i was hanging out in the cantina
and i wake up alone
16 just held such better days
you'll never step foot in my room again
the tour was over we'd survived
to pass the time in my room alone
up all night long and there's something very wrong
dark and scary ordinary explanation and information
again i wait for this to change instead
it all just seems to be how
she's all i need
another night with her
say it aint so i will not go
say it aint so i will not go
say it aint so i will not go na na na na na na na na na na
between what answers
you can do what you want to
and your hands they shake with goodbyes
i'm so sick of fights i hate them
come on let me hold you touch you feel you
come on let me hold you touch you feel you
stand up straight tall and shout about it
and there aint nothing i can do about it
corporate leaders politicians
drown our youth with usless warnings
everything has fallen to
kids cant vote adults elect them
teenage rules they're fucked and boring
we never wanted to be abused
cause she laid me
and mom and dad possess the key o instant slavery
cause she laid me
the good intentions that you had
and she said it could never survive
show up right on time
i'll take what you're willing to give
where are you coming from
this place is void of all passion
my head is made up of memories
i feel alone and tired
i hope i wont forget you
unless your mom will touch my cock
unless your dad will suck me off
i hate hate hate your guts
it`s labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin hot dogs
i'll never talk to you again
but the words get confused
my life just lost all meaning
i need some more time to fix this
fucking and sucking and touching
when he comes home you'll be in his arms
you know i'll be there
empty
i know someday i'll be the only one
you'll come running right back to me
he's got three testicles
we'll have halloween on christmas
and as i stared i counted
the voice inside my head i miss you i miss you
my girlfriend is by my side
it's christmas time again
and even though the jail didnt have a tree
i wont be home i wont be home for christmas x6
i'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
cause i am i'm lost without you
and i'll see you around
at least nothing i can see
is to move on through the week
sorry happened to you x4
and she doesnt get all jealous when i hang out with the guys
i show up at 3am
and when i feel like giving up
i know that everything 3x everything's gonna be fine
we'll let ya know hey
empty
just about done with your butt
we'll let ya know hey
i'm only asking for what is mine
is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time
you turn your back on the friends you lose
because when i'm with you there's nothing i wouldnt do
i'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what i saw
so sorry it's over
you can only lean on me for so long
there's so much more that i wanted and
yeah later see you around
never dared to go
put the broomstick between your legs
he takes it all away again
committing crimes that dont break any laws
about being on time
about being on time
i couldnt care less of what you say
much rather be riding prone then
dont talk to me as i walk alone i'd
there's this one guy
guess they just want more
walk right through the door they
dresses like a man
if i misbehave she kicks my ass
when i'm at work ya i always rush right home for lunch
i'm taught how to think from the evening news oh
as well my feelings do
i was the one there last night
this time i'll get it right
one hours waste of time
cant count all the things they see
like violence you have me forever and after
i've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
i keep wishing i could be home with you
the lonely guy i am i like to watch her change
she caught me once but i dont think that she cares now
he kicks my ass so much that filthy white inbred
i bet this last time's the one time too many
to be what you want me to be
but somehow they end up the same
and i dont think that you're the one
and i'd show her it's okay to fart and
sitting at home thinking about her
and in my town you cant drive naked
sitting at home thinking about her
either way our band gets dropped oh yeah
who pretends not to hear you when you cry oh yeah
is it something i'll regret why do i want what i cant get
i hate our favorite restaurant favorite movie our favorite show
sappy love songs on the radio
i'm kicking
what's my age again
what's my age again
what's my age again
did he tie your hands behind your head and was it on your mother's bed and
man you like to fuck him in the butt and
my girlfriend is by my side
it's christmas time again
and even though the jail didnt have a tree
i wont be home
i wont be home
'cause there's nothing left to bring
'cause there's nothing left to bring
so change your tune one step to make a stand
cause one thing that you know for sure
no we aint gonna take it unless it's from a doverman pincher
that the girl under his arm wasnt the same
she knew at that one moment
i said a wah wah wah wah wah
what a nice creation
so all you little ladies
all along you wish that she would stay
fuck this place i lost the war
good times
hanging in a chow line
it's mother's day
it's mother's day
but that's alright
i thought of all the lines
my broken dreams of you
she's pissed that she had to wait
now i miss her so
where's your daughter
better suck up your pride and admit you lost her
move on let her go move on let her go
from your mom
forgot being the importance of being right
what am i supposed to say
i think of all the things i'd scream
running around around
i know not a reason why
i need a job just to sleep in sheets
arent you feeling alone
or hold it
the steps that
i'm writing
but everybody's gone
and walk by
i wont come back
well i guess this is growing up
oh oh i'm dancing with myself
so let's sink another drink
oh oh oh oh
if i had the chance i'd ask the world dance
oh oh oh oh
yeah in a sweat
i wait so long for my love vibration
but their empty eyes seem to pass me by
oh oh oh oh
if i had the chance i'd ask the world dance
when an xke pulled up on the right
the street was deserted late friday night
and then i saw the jag slide into the curve
nude in a gutter is how i was found
had my nuts attacked by rats
saw ben dover again and he's still gay
kicked ol sally 'cause she's fat
because i cant control my bladder anymore
i left a soil on a bus seat i didnt know what to say
all along
a boy who went out when he finished all his chores
since i have used that line
nothing to lose
and i'm not complaining it just hurts after a bit
it doesnt work as your just a jerk with no excuse
it doesnt work as your just a jerk with no excuse
just drop me off at home
go on ahead i'll meet you there
there is no use for explanation
and when you came running back
most girls most do mean trouble because they are rarely honest
unos dos tres quatro
did he tie your hands behind your head and was it on your mother's bed
i'm not even gonna have sex with my mom tonight man this is stupid
better than you inside
the drops of rain they fall all over
down down down down x4
down down down down x4
another guy you think it'd be unlikely
she's a dove she's a fucken nightmare
cause i love your little motions
so all you little ladies
all along you wish that she would stay
he's a fucken weasel
hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights
want to make a deal
where's my dog girls are such a drag
she's the flower that you place on my casket that's what she wanted
better run run run run run run run holly let me out
'cause she fell right off when all
it's okay to just want more
to be the one who gets stupid over you
i swear i'll act enthused
betray my short attention span
is this to much to live through
i never let what happened stay in the past
shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart terd and twat
let's give it up for love
i love all the things you do i'm feeling this i wanna take off her clothes i'm feeling this
where do we go from here
after you came and went
i think i'm fallin asleep
to tell me what you expect of me today
and do you think that it is right
to pick you up on our very first date
forever and ever let's make this last forever
honest let's make this night last forever
but i've seen to much to try you
the weirdness flows between us
cause when i need a friend it's still you
mark and tom
but i've found the dog
wanna fuck a fucking dog
and i love his wrinkled scrotum too
it's cool when this piss people off with what they wear oh yeah
why we need to be like them
and saw the look of fear in my mother's eyes
i dont wanna know
i dont wanna know
i'll write you once a week she said
and i'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
still hanging in her locker
she has her curlers set her credit cards are paying the funds
he wants to bone this i know she is ready to blow
been starved for attention before
and he thinks of me the way i think of you
i am in his demand
it's useless my name has made the list
i think you used me again
it's obvious
how do we fix this if we never have vision
you're my source of most frustration
you'd leave it out for me
i wish that this would end
please dont remind me
there's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
i think it's disgusting believing and trusting
dont pull me down this is where i belong
so hold in all your aggresions
give more than you take
walk barefoot down the street
it's not easy or so damn pleasing
now it happens again
try hard when things fall apart
please take me home
i'm so jaded i calculated wrong
i bet you're sad
buy hope hope that it lasts
why did we have to go date
i bet you're sad this is the best time we ever had
you cannot see things that are different to me
on and on reckless abandon
memory thats full of fun
eyes are red and my movements slow
and break the truth with more bad news
on and on reckless abandon
change for the better
you cant hide while i'm running
help another you want for someday
i cannot be bought
i was brought up without a silver cup
and there i stay
all i remember's the way her bedroom smelled
another blade next to you from the ground
i can see that girls are a waste of time
there's a black shadow on my wall
walking through the grass
but as i look into my mind
what have you said reach out your hand
my broken dreams of you
i'll never ask permission from you
i'll run away
i think it's time for me to leave
'round yon virgin
just when i think that they are gonna stay
but how the fuck am i supposed to make you understand that
so here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away
it`s not right
i'm so lost
the last contagious victim of this plague between us
why is this hard do you recognize me
i fell behind
i fell behind
what scares me so bad
dont want to live my life alone
take off your pants dad
with your brother in her bed
your mom is not the only one
when you fuck your family i guess that's
and every day's the same
she drowned in the lake last night
it would be nice if things could turn out right
i am the one johnny carcinogen
i must be wrong this cant be right
do you want to come to a party
this place is so lame all these girls look the same
maybe we'd watch the sun rise
how she's down with the iwise well constructed disguise
some girls try too hard
she's the one she'll always be there
17 without a purpose or direction
and if i ever got another chance i'd still ask her to dance
i'll never forget tonight
six years long
no it wont mean a thing in a hundred years
could it be you were ignored by every passerby
another lost little boy in a big old town
the tendency to hurry
dont move
be worthwhile
but like i said before it's all in the groove
that any son or daughter
all in the groove
soon we'd say nothing
i tried patience
beauty and the beast
i'm alone
now i dont care how i look and dont care how i act
and maybe then
i'm alone
i'm alone
i'm free free in all i see and that makes me free to roam
you may remain here in the jungle and hunt with the free people
dont give a damn if you're close
yes i am nothing
for i am everything
the equation the reason for my being here
perhaps you'll love me too
and i aint sure why
when all is said and done
we've already won
get myself together
well what a day and what's for breakfast
please wont you hear me
and it's hard to be believed what can be achieved
the things that hurt just wont go away
if you feel like weeping
please wont you hear me
wont you rise and shine
then all the sins they came
their investment should do well
when will it all be done
music brendan hill and chan kinchla
where it's ripe and i can pluck it
and it's survival of the healthy
business as usual
if i can let it be then i'm free
let it be deceased
everybody's constitutional
i really dont care right now but anyway
it's my life he's trying to save but anyway
be real confusing if not but anyway
lyrics john popper
all aboard
where we used to grow up
now i know you guys have that here around boston
so here we go
shoot everybody with a mutt this side of the town
or even short and surly
or you or you or you or you
empty
while your uncle rolls his joints with his fifty dollar bill
hail to you my mountain climber busy at your task
when all is in harmony it can be such a lonely place
whoever she is now and whoever she'll become
i'm gonna ride you
no matter how hard
empty
aware of different shapes
to ensure that he will die
we have you in our sights
i will
i dreamed about you last night
i dreamed about you last night
last night i dreamed
and i've tried
but yourself
and simply put them down
if you want peace then live alone
it's up to you
music chan kinchla
a man in love willing to go half crazy
you could see prison bars or call it home sweet home
i just couldnt cry
showed me the potential of each and
the pain i feel you just cant understand
she needed to learn for once on her own
and for that i do love you but i know i
and then and only then i started to cry
take a little trip with me
or let assholes decide
but when i'm thinking about it
and if it's a sing
but what does that mean
i've looked and searched her over countless times
we're talking about a forever after
so soon your chance will have come and gone
feel the wires swaying to and fro
and she doesnt know it but really she loves you
why does it feel like a big mistake
i keep on looking till this very day
ooh it looks like rain again
ooh it looks like rain again
ooh feel it comin in
i cant seem to fret now
twinkle twinkle little star
you know he's strung out on future
they lie there all forgotten
dream prophet dream
with the current savior risen
what will our mighty future be
keep it in your eye
truth well it's here too
cause if you look around you might just feel like me
hate the price you pay
barely see barely see barely see barely see let's see
who had gotten there first
with judea enslaved
throw the drowning man a rope
could be so far we've only earned the right to barely see
in her navel there's a feather
i swear i'll never forget again
i shall honor and disgrace you
if you're sold or if you're bought
and the dawn is coming nearly
i swear i'll never forget again
she'd do anything she could
he promised he'd return for her come next spring
with her heart on her sleeve
and something began to hurt
that i guarantee
i like to think she did okay
lyrics john popper
so satisfying i would be lying
he's finally rid of you and me
what's a daddy gonna do
are there any more out there
good book says that it's a sin
are there any more out there
rays of sweet illumination
never to burn or char with fire
please please wont you take me away
the smooth perfection i can only dream of
i can find it when i play
sitting in clover looking for the fifth leaf
or did you think that everybody else feels completely at home
but maybe if i told you and informed you out loud
and it will come
just wait
and it will come
i dont really need to see
and i didnt have to play
was hey dont you leave me alone
it's a busy night
it's too loud in here for words but those staring eyes have much to say
by providence i'm sent
and decide
come see what the madman sees
and all of a sudden you find you just dont care
of being scared of the choice you made
empty
decorum has its place
empty
yeah i'm fallible
in a moment come and gone
forgiving nothing
for it to do her any good
everything to be in love
she'd soon inspire him to stand
and it takes everything you have
he said everything i am now is for and because of you
it could take weeks for me to say
he changed his name to luck because he had so much
and it takes everything you have
but in the end it only makes me want to more
come on and dance with me felicia
i want to dance with you come on and dance with me felicia
in spite of her momentous groove
and i was never any good
and for a moment i can barely see
but maybe if you'll dance with me
raise your head
has grown too small
and fight to rise above
the clouds separate to reveal the warmth
the earth
he could be dead i'm supposed to walk away
i guess that's what it's for
it's what i'd fight for it's for what i'd bleed
i think there's money in a book about you
take a look out your back door
gina gina
she'd dance till the people and the liquor were gone
i 've really got to clean up my room
but these are the things we tell ourselves
till my floor comes back and my room is clean
eventual stories designed to amuse
amongst the crumpled letters the mood's quite perverse
it mustnt get a foothold but it usually does
but these are the things we tell ourselves
i really have to clean up my room
but these are the things we tell ourselves
till my floor comes back and my room is clean
eventual stories designed to amuse
town one by one
so hold on this great big world we only get to rent we never get to own
and it's a great big world singing come and see and come inside
and then suddenly you're done
cause you know i want more baby
like a diamond and a ring
sweet talking hippie
that makes you feel that i'll convey
there is something amiss
the hook brings you back
of love
i wanna bust all your balloons
the hook brings you back
i said i have my moments now and again
coupled with the things i've told
with a leaf and a kazoo
do our homework on the way
i said i have my moments now and again
i hope that you will join us
lyrics john popper
just take yo medicine and help it go down
feast well avenging madness
not a goddamn anyone can do
to show thee fit to continue
you might just prefer to pray
i could not believe my eyes
but you
and hollywood's calling for the movie rights
why you wanna give me a run around
i shall drink in and always be full
that there's something left to say
i woke with something in my head
and when you're feeling open i'll still be here
about a great many things
so what you feel becomes mine as well
it seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
i still got this dream that you just cant shake
but you
guilty of nothing more than fear
brings him back to this painful place
and with his last breath he cries out
well fear not cause my fear soon turns to anger
we shall overcome is what they tell us
music lyrics john popper
empty
the answers are getting harder
you might faint from the fight but you're gonna find it
empty
and once upon a time
sweet pain
what did them in not suicide
sweet pain
there's got to be a reason it works out this way
when will i embrace this life i see
sweet pain
cross your killing floor
we'll sell tickets honey
why would you wanna stick that thing in my heart
thank you
and the bullets start to fly
if you dont so what cause you dont scare me
and if it's me who will lose or win
you only have to lose once
if you want to talk well then i'll relate
keep it all inside dont show how much she rocked ya
i guess from now on i'll be careful what i share
can you feel the same
something about dreams as fragile as bubbles
it takes a thousand of his best spies
but lack started to take an interest
to condemn the man who dies
unaware of how in love lack was with she
to finally realize
featherhead didnt quit and would be finishing flight school soon
to condemn the man who dies
music lyrics john popper
were just like you and me
with everything i can
i hope we can forgive them
a story that's only just begun
we are ancient
and life itself
i got to know him well and only now do i see
you feel like you are driving but you just took a ride
and to my sweet surprise it does work out that way
i'm into warmer days
go on ahead do your thing
how dare i even complain
well here i am
get me good to eat
have to see what comes along
but we're just monkeys
on that hilltop we're still trying to find
and in this corner
but you gotta wonder how
and it's this frustration that yields relief
empty
from fossil to fossil
and i hope that you can see
and as hard as i may try
empty
up above the world so high
empty
empty
the price of your piece of mind
again and again you find it's yet another
again and again you find it's yet another
ad lib from the shopping channel
if you stare too long you loose your appetite
anything to be scared of
i want to tell you this
no aint got
to know
she dont know how
to know
'cos i'm numb
so what's the worth
to the hard of hearing
they've dropping like flies
as suffering believers
so far i've not really stayed in touch
because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
waiting for an underground train
everybody's doing it so do it too
in and out of one ear
i dont need anyone
then there's sticky fingers
john is down the fun pub
days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers
i've broken every bone
you can be with me
battle battle battle battle battle
battle battle battle battle battle
and when she lets me slip away
she'll suck your thumb she'll make you come
he's on he's on he's on it
all on their own down soho
in his drink he's been talking
other people break into a cold sweat
watch the sky day
baby when you hold me
baby when you hold me
give me my soul x7
empty
empty
and i'm resigned to that
doesnt help me
empty
i want to crawl all over her
she's so high
so what's the worth in all of this
think that's all i want to say
and all those things
by a jumbo jet
pleased to meet ya
well i lie and i'm easy
but still i'm getting into work late
and i dont need any practise
and i dont need the practice
at the possibilities
become an unconscious man
for the future
we dont think so you seem starshaped
they're stereotypes
he likes to wear it tight
all your life you're dreaming
stop dreaming
you should go on another bender
dig a hole and put it down
submarines are diving deep
from another star
sunday sunday here again a walk in the park
you read the colour supplement the tv guide
together the family around the table to eat enough to speep
and mother's pride is you epithet that extra slice you will soon
give me music give me love
give me fever
i'm a believer
what am i to do
i believe i believe i believe
i believe i believe i believe
tender is the touch
come on come on come on
oh why

how many times have you heard someone say
hmm when my life is over and my time has run out

underneath that apple suckling tree
who's on the table who's tell me
or will he say depart from me

are you ready for the judgement
on this new morning new morning
it always does when you're with me
on this new morning new morning
i never know what the poor girls gonna do to me next
well come over here pony i wanna climb up one time on you
going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
but we're heading for a wall of stone
he who cannot be trusted must fall
betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
and there's no time to think
he's content when you're under his thumb
anytime anyplace anywhere
fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
and there's no time to think
come gather 'round friends
may mother took sick
my friends they couldnt have been kinder
then the shaft was soon shut
in the south american towns
this silence of tongues it was building
shadows are fallin and i've been here all day
i just dont see why i should even care
every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
the fewer words you have to waste on this
and the sooner you come up with them
yes 'n someone must explain
that a man must swim
a fella who never blushes in
take care of all your memories
i've heard it said before
dont let me down
outside my yard
fifteen jugglers
i'm callin you to
now you take your file and you bend my head
odds and ends odds and ends
we grew up together
hold on to me so tight
run your fingers down my spine
and let it burn burn burn burn
there's more frost on the window glass
then you ask why i dont live here
well i asked for something to eat
your grandma prays to pictures
even the butler
your loyalty is not to me
so no stranger does intrude
and your pleasure knows no limits
lighting ev'rything in sight
one more night i will wait for the light
slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run
things will be okay
like a needle in a haystack i'm gonna find you yet
to wait upon him hand and foot
than a place for you to stand
it was all very painless
come to me now you know
tell me that is isnt true
tell me that it isnt true
i'm trying' to read your portrait but
lean against your velvet door
and he's hungry like a man in drag
sayin take your pick frankie boy
well judas he just winked and said
with a voice as cold as ice
burst upon the scene
yes that's the one said the stranger
it's not a house said judas priest
well up the stairs ran frankie lee
except of course the little neighbor boy
so when you see your neighbor carryin somethin
now ira's folks were hungry and their farms wene crops of weeds
call him drunken ira hayes he wont answer anymore
call him drunken ira hayes he wont answer anymore
yes call him drunken ira hayes but his land is still as dry
such are promises all lies and jest
looking for the places only they would know
where the new york city winters arent bleeding me
but the fighter still ramains
mistake your shyness for aloofness your shyness for snobbery
i'd a done anything for that woman if she didnt make me feel so obligated
i see the burning of the stage
see the groom still waiting at the altar
if it keep on raining the levee's gonna break
i look in your eyes i see nobody other than me
some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones
i woke up this morning butter and eggs in my bed
and the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and didnt even talk to the people at the table
in the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
william zanzinger with a six month sentence
take a woman like your kind
everybody's building the big ships and boats
you know it aint my cup of meat
when quinn the eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want to doze
you'll be drenched to the bone
and dont speak too soon
dont block up the hall
and dont criticize
the curse it is cast
there was a wicked messenger
until one day he just appeared
he would not bow down he would not fight
with a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
there was a man named mahatma gandi
the only one called jesus christ
i'm in love with my second cousin
well the old men 'round here
it has the opposite effect
he's got more lives than a cat
why dont you just shove off
i've seen enough heartache and strife
not always easy kicking someone up
may you stay forever young
forever young forever young
may you stay forever young
he was her man but he done her wrong

all except when 'neath the trees of eden
unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf

two wheeled gypsy queen
and the princess and the prince
at dawn my lower comes to me
for she was once a true love of mine
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
she once was the true love of mine
many times i've often prayed
god knows it's a struggle
god knows it's terrifying
god knows you aint gonna be taking nothing with you when you go
she puts it to me plain as day
empty
i'm bound to meet the sun
and keep away from pranks
empty
on the pages and the text
so i am going
before i get to the ledge
so much oppression
swords piercing your side
you can mislead a man
jesus said be ready

i repeated that my friends
when i picked it up and said hello
so i hooked my sailor suit
and i said captain kidd
that was married to the deputy
i'm beginnin to hear voices and there's no one around
it's sadder still to feel your heart turn away
i'm twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound
well the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank
'til someone lets me ride
until my eyes begin to bleed
lookin for the sunny side of love
well i dont mind dying
i hate to leave my children crying
well i dont mind dying
might be a rock'n roll adict prancing on the stage
you may be rich or poor you may be blind or lame
but you're gonna have to serve somebody yes
well it may be the devil or it may be the lord
you may call me terry you may call me jimmy
where another mans life might begin
but i did not trust my brother
and hold your judgement for yourself
in the great unknown
when the roses fade
it was you who understood
you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
shedding off one more layer of skin
you look into the fiery furnace see the rich man without any name
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
bird fly high by the light of the moon
lo and behold lo and behold
this is chicken town
get me a truck or somethin
count up to thirty
they say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
well you know i even outran the hound dogs
you're beautiful beyond words
and wait for you to come
when i saw you say goodbye to your friends and smile
i couldnt see how you could know me
i couldnt see when it started snowin
sooner or later one of us must know
and i would leave so soon that your man wont never know
she's got everything she needs
but you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
she wears an egyptian ring
gypsy gal the hands of harlem
your pearly eyes so fast an slashing
you've slayed me you have made me
they never did like mama's homemade dress
but i used a little too much force
i had a job in the great north woods
i seen a lot of women
said to me dont i know your name
and handed it to me
there was music in the cafs at night
tangled up in blue
heading for another joint
and you know that we shall meet again
if i knew for sure that it was yours
that called on me to call on them
trust yourself
trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
trust yourself
pulled me out of a bondage and you made me renewed inside
he gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie
whatever pleases you tell it to my heart
she makes love just like a woman yes she does
she makes love just like a woman yes she does
aint it clear that
but you break just like a little girl
please tell her thanks a lot
and she invites you up into her room
you better go back to from where you came
but left looking just like a ghost
i cant use it anymore
i feel like i'm knockin on heavens door
stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead
but he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about
he just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
honey can i jump on it sometime
we'll both just sit there and stare
you know i dont mind him cheatin on me
it's your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
so never leave me lonely
come on come on stick together
you know we made a vow not to leave one another never
then they bury him with stars
sitting there in a cold chill
oh man is opposed to fair play
everybody that was hangin out
but you know you only used to get juiced in it
to be on your own
aint it hard when you discover that
they're drinkin thinkin that they got it made
to be on your own
then everyone commenced to do what they were doin before he turned their heads
he made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf
the drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
has your luck turn out she laughed at him'
no one knew the circumstance but they say it happened pretty quick
the next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black
when first i came to louisville some pleasure there to find
and the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
oh where is little maggie
than to see you be another mans darling
pretty flowers are made for blooming
i run right home and i went to bed
standing on a corner as he's ringing my bell
i had no one for to go my bail
i dont have to go far
oh how could you refuse
well they'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good
but i would not feel so all alone
they'll stone you when you're riding in your car
i wandered again to my home in the mountain
some beautiful day i'll meet 'em in heaven
but the bottles are done
but to remain as friends we need the time
as the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
and the point is slick
and so is the bride
where the willows weep
ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
the landscape is glowing gleaming in the golden light of day
this woman so crazy i swear i aint going to touch another one for years
let's forgive each other darling
i think this time we shall escape
soon you will be dancing the fandango
dios nos vigila
in the little church this side of town
agarrame mi vida
we may not make it through the night
oh who do they think could bury you
with your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
who among them do you think could resist you
they wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm
and your magazine husband who one day just had to go
should i leave them by your gate
prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies
makes no difference where she's been
when the children were babies and played on the beach
as they follow each other back up the hill
it's all so clear i could never forget
beautiful lady so dear to my heart
and a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
saro jane
and rock about my saro jane
saro jane
and rock about my saro jane
by the blood of the lamb
i just want to thank you lord
i've been saved
i want to thank you lord
for so long i've been stalled
so glad
my faith keeps me alive but i still be weeping
the wicked know no peace and you just cant fake it
i got two white horses following me
and my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
i'd like to get you to change your mind
well i have had some rotten nights
oh but our time has come
oh yes i am
senor senor can you tell me where we're headin
there's a marcing band still playing in that vacant lot
senor senor you know their hearts is as hard as leather
you'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
just like old saxophone joe
blueberry apple cherry pumpkin and plum
shake me up that old peach tree
to stay closer than any friend
he must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you
covenant woman intimate little girl
unto heaven for me
you can rock this joint
if you go down in the flood
queen for queen
i dont carry dead weight i'm no flash in the pan
to break a trusted heart like mine was just your style
well you bet on the horses they ran the wrong way
but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
i was ready to leave i was already walkin
yeahthe locusts sang off in the distance
and the locusts sang with a high whinning trill
my comrades they all loved me well a jolly saucy crew
and over jake they held a wake in the days of '49
when we dug up the gold in the days of '49
and i pass by from town to town they call me a rambling sign
dead man dead man
when will you arise
cobwebs in your mind
dust upon your eyes
please heed these words that i speak
i'm not about to move to no other place
just remember that death is not the end
just remember that death is not the end
where the spirit never dies
just remember that death is not the end
curtis's looking high curtis's looking low
all about them rounders judge tryin to cut me out

the crystall ball upon the wall hasnt shown me nothing yet
what good am i some like all the rest
and i freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
what was it you wanted
we can start it all over
is there something you needed
is there somebody waitin
whatever you wanted
is the whole thing going backwards
why did you trade heaven
the strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god
can i cast it aside all this loyalty and this pride
in the still of the night in the world's ancient light
i laugh and i cry and i'm haunted by
more frailer than the flowers these precious hours
i owe my heart to you and that's saying it's true
when the night comes falling
it'll fit you like a glove
stick around baby we're not through
that icy wind that's howling in your eye
this time i'm asking for freedom
like the stillness in the wind
as they swim out of the path
and will be buried at the bottom of the ocean
and the ship's wise men
sayin we'll meet all your demands
karl marx has got ya by the throat henry kissinger's got you tied up in knots
when you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain
you think he's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain

and accept it all bravely
in a many dark hour
the confusion i'm feelin
well the place i love best is a sweet memory
just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from

i sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
no one can ever claim
i got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
no use in worrying cause the world gone wrong
but it seem like you never right you got no loyal mind

they'd like to drive me from this town
i believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
is worth more than i could pay
keep me set apart
why she did go
but it's hard to think on
'stead of turnin her back to my face
i'd gladly confess
i'll leavin today
i dreamed i saw st augustine
come out ye gifted kings and queens
oh i awoke in anger
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
but in the end is always left so alone
who hears but does not see
when his gladness comes to pass
26 27 28 29 i'm gonna make your face look just like mine
i want ev'rybody to be free
i sat with my high heeled sneakers on
now i gotta friend who spends his life
hope i dont blow it
it's nothing
'cause i got my little lady right by my side
it's president kennedy callin me up
she's a man eater
eyes were closed i was half asleep
tellin me he loves all kinds a people
what do you do about willy mays
i just walk along and stroll and sing
once i had mountains in the palm of my hand
so if you find someone that gives you all of her love
but it's not that way
me drinkin from my broken cup
well i return to the queen of spades
honey i want you
honey i want you
sweet lady
after losing every battle
it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
i waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the
down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy
idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves
if dogs run free
must be and that is all
if not for you baby i'd lay awake all night
oh what would i do if not for you
we had a falling out like lovers often will
and i've never gotten used to it i've just learned to turn it off
you dont have to be afraid
i came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
i met the contagion and sank to the tomb
they're doing the double shuffle they're throwing sand on the floor
funny the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least
he's not sentimental dont bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed
long distance operator
ev'rybody wants to make a long distance call
ev'rybody wants to be my friend
some pretty little girl in cornersville
she took him by his long yellow hair
or these costly beads around my neck
my love she speaks like silence
read books repeat quotations
statues made of match sticks
my love she's like some raven
you destroyed me with a smile
this kind of love ah i'm love sick

big furry paws and he liked to howl
ah think i'll call it a cow
in the beginning in the beginning
in the beginning long time ago
slithering his way through the grass
he looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
there are no mistakes in life some people say
i am a man of constant sorrow
i'm about to ride that morning railroad
you know sometimes satan you know he comes as a man of peace
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
the sea may freeze and the earth may burn
you that build all the guns
like it's your little toy
and i see through your brain
and is buried in the mud
to talk out of turn
do you think that it could
down to your deathbed
you'll know the love that i had for you was never my own
when there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
for not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
i always liked san francisco i was there for a party once
and a thousand miles behind
that dont mean no one no good
a hand set the spark
for the politicians gain
from the start by the rule
and he's taught how to walk in a pack
today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught
and land in some funny lagoon
but i feel just like a jesse james
i'm carryin for good luck my black tooth
ev'rybody's got their hats bowed down
what do you think about that my frien
by golly what more can i say
peggy day stole my poor heart away

and i cant be the last to leave
says 'your wife' i say 'she's busy in the kitchen cookin'
police at your back
pickin up the cherries fallin off the plate
i dont know any more than this
we're living in times
it rots in a cell
houses are haunted
little by little
as soon as you're awake
climb into the frame
when the truth's in our hearts and we still dont believe
sister lemme tell you about a vision that i saw
what god has given to us no man can take away
ya know i just couldnt make it by myself
precious father loving mother
well i'm pressing on

our captain he is dead pretty peggy o
you've got a heart of stone
say he's hard of hearing say that he's a chump
'cause he doesnt tell you jokes or fairy tales say things that make you smile
resent him to the bone
and all of your children start to resent you
trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
fixin ev'rybody's troubles
lord i aint goin down to no race track
well look it here buddy
with half damp eyes i stared to the room
we thought we could sit forever in fun
i wish i wish i wish in vain
just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
that i might be gone a long time
saying i dont know when i'll be comin back again
in the lonely night in the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
you tried and tried you made me slide
or broken
lordy lord
cant you hear me baby rappin on your door
he was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
i can still see the day that you came to me on the pinked desert
but i'm too over the edge and i aint in the mood anymore to remember the times
come rolling up in a trail of dust
until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies
well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
you just find yourself over the line
brownsville girl show me all around the world
are most content
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls

everything about you is bringing me
all ya can do is do what you must
i'm watchin the boats i'm studyin the dust
papa gone mad mama she's feelin sad
she longed to see that seaport town
now when the other sailors heard the news
and with the whole ships' company
she's dressed in silks and satins now
you'll see the honor i have gained
i cant wait wait for you to change your mind
i'm reelin from the blow
and i dont know how much longer i can wait
i thought somehow that i would be spared this fate
the cat's in the well horses going bumpety bump
the cat's in the well and leaves are starting to fall
merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down
a messenger arrived with a black nightingale
the endless road and the wailing of chimes
but eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination
seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
tolling for the luckless the abandoned an forsaked
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
an the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
spellbound an swallowed 'til the tolling ended
they said what's up is down they said what isnt is
they said listen boy you're just a pup
only game he could play was russian roulette
he was wearing boxing gloves took a dive one day
he never did know what it was all about
mama come in and picked up a book
the dogs were barking a neighbor passed
i reached up touched my shirt
and then i shut all the doors
over your senses you have no control
there's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit
but if you do right to me baby
ya got to do unto others
dont wanna wink at nobody dont wanna be winked at
dont wanna miss nobody dont wanna be missed
dont fall apart on me tonight
i wish i'd have been a doctor
i aint too good at conversation girl
dont fall apart on me tonight
you were so fine clark gable would have fell at your feet
dont fall apart on me tonight
when your rooster crows at the breaks of dawn
we never did too much talking anyway
so long honey babe
i went down to the river on a saturday morn
i's lookin around i wouldnt say when
i looked for a cow and i saw me a few
dont ya tell henry
i spied my little bundle of joy
knows we're in love yes and they understand
and your highway's gettin filled
or i'm bound to die tryin
lord she took it away to italy italy
and were taking him away
you could hear it from the door
the drifter did escape
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
i was riding on the mayflower
we sang that melody
and start buying the place with beads
to the bowery slums
of a famous etiquette book
but i went into a bank
and robbed my boots
get out of here before i break your bones
parked across from a building
i shook his hand and said goodbye
at bringin back any help
so i made it back to the ship
i said for the pope of eruke
i saw three ships a sailin
cut on runway number nine big 707 set to go
you cant hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
it's like my whole life never happened
there's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere
i gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
i am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
broken switches broken gates
broken voices on broken phones
everything is broken
who shapeth the cloud there up in the sky
each one playing a horn
nobody stops to ask why
a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
the writing on the wall come read it come see what it does say
i think it will fit me like a glove
as i've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
dont wanna take a chance with somebody new
what did you expect
i feel the breath of a storm
whatever you got to say to me
you're the one i've been looking for
there's just a hot blooded singer
i never could learn to drink that blood
i feel like the whole world gonna end up against the fence
i was all right 'til i fell in love with you
i'm thinkin about that girl who wont be back no more
we sit beside the bridges and walk beside the fountains
aint no reason to go anywhere
gonna get their bang
one bird book
tell 'em all
now grease that pig
take it on in
to be alone with you
with only you in view
i wish the night were here
the pangs of your sadness
your magnetic movements
i can tell you are torn
and no one is better 'n you
but soon my words
the sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
daddy's in the alley
stop all this weeping swallow your pride
saying tell me great hero but please make it brief
i'm in the kitchen
mama's in the fact'ry
now i wish i could give brother bill his great thrill
where ma raney and beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
daddy's in the alley
tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright
'cause tonight i'll be staying here with you
i can hear that whistle blowin
too much of nothing
give them all my salary
say hello to valerie
it just makes a fella mean
tough mama
born of a blinding light and a changing wind
i stood alone upon the ridge and all i did was watch
trouble in the city trouble in the farm
trouble trouble trouble
since the beginning of the universe mans been cursed by trouble
i'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes
i saw you drift into infinity and come back again
you belong to me baby without any doubt
that ever did walk in chains
from the corners of her mouth
i'm sorry for what she'd done
baby let me follow you down baby let me follow you down
baby please stop crying stop crying stop crying
baby please stop crying
you know i know the sun will always shine
so baby please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind
with sensitive instincts she was the creative one
the could be dream lover of my lifetime
the timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
soon shattered as a child to the shadows
how good how good does it feel to be free
when you get home
and you say oh my god
to be such a freak
but nobody has any respect
you're very well read
he asks you how it feels
and you say what does this mean
and your nose on the ground
hollis brown
your baby's eyes look crazy
if there's anyone that knows
your babies are crying louder now
way out in the wilderness
your eyes fix on the shortgun
there's seven people dead
and i thought of a goddess to beauty
therefore i remain at my service
for me there is no other damsel
beyond the horizon in the springtime or fall
beyond the horizon at the end of the game
beyond the horizon over the treacherous sea
beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
you never know what you got till it's gone
you never know what you got till it's gone
listenin to the billboard knock
you can come to me sometime
black crows in the meadow
from another time and place
and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
on black diamond bay
but the dealer say attendez vous s'il vous pl it
she passed the door that the greek had locked
then the volcano erupted
you can take you money but i dont know how
watching old cronkite on the seven o'clock news
to black diamond bay
be sixteen come sunday
we'll both go off together
rode off with black jack davey
wrapped up with black jack davey
bid farewell forever
love my black jack davey
i got blood in my eyes for you baby
no no babe i got blood in my eyes for you
i'll tell you something tell you the facts
yes how many times must the cannon balls fly
the answer my friend is blowin in the wind
blue moon you saw me standing alone
done laid around done stayed around
johnny's been out on the road too long
this old town too long
and it seems like i've got to travel on
late last night you come a rollin across my mind
you kiss me baby in the coffee stop
wearing a long dress fire engine red
handy dandy
handy dandy
handy dandy he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow
'tis the song the sign of the weary
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
'tis the song the sign of the weary
i'd give you the sky high above
heart of mine be still
dont put yourself over the line
dont let her know
well my heart's in the highlands gentle and fair
wouldnt know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
i'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean
i got no idea what i want
i said i would if i could but i dont do sketches from memory
dont look a thing like me
she goes away for a minute and i slide out out of my chair
i see people in the park forgettin their troubles and woes
the party's over and there's less and less to say
nothin standing there
jump into the wagon love
it's rough out there
i asked fat nancy for someth'n to eat she said take it off the shelf
highwater risin rising night and day
it's tough out there
highwater rising six inches above my head
either one i dont care
thunder rollin over clarksdale everythin a lookin blue
running from up wisconsin way down to no mans land
god say no abe say what
ol howard just pointed with his gun
told the first father that things werent right
but yes i think it can be very easily done
you'd be honest with me if you only knew
she's tossin a baseball bat in the air
i'm havin a hard time believing some people we're ever alive
and i still got their advice oozing out of my ears
needs a worried man
so you'll have to do
that is lost in the sand
and the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town
pistols shots ring out in the barroom night
and another man named bello moving around mysteriously
number one contender for the middleweight crown
they jumped into a white car with out of state plates
yes here comes the story of the hurricane
remember you said you saw the getaway car
we want to put his ass in stir
but then they took him to the jailhouse
and the all white jury agreed
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
all i want for you to do is take my body home
well well well
jesus gonna make up my dying bed
up stepped the sherrif of thomasville
they crammed me back into the crowded jail
with a forty four smokeless under my head
saying master tell me why a man must be born again
did they speak out against him did they dare
when he rose from the dead did they believe
in the summertime when you were with me
in the summertime when you were with me
in the summertime when you were with me
or must i explain
do you understand my pain
for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong
i gave him my blanket he gave me his word
i still cant remember all the best things she said
there was no jewels no nothing i felt i'd been had
i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead
leave at your own chosen speed
go lightly from the ledge babe
no no no it aint me babe
a lover for you life an nothing more
i dont wanna be your boss baby
i wouldnt mistreat you baby
dont you know really dont you know it hurts me too
shinin through the trees
but i could not get across
and it's all over now baby blue
has taken all his blankets from the floor
shadows even the silver spoon
that he not busy being born
a foreign sound to you ear
made everything from toy guns that sparks
sometimes must have
all around you
insure you not to quit
speak jealously of them that are free
while one who sings with his tongue on fire
limited in sex they dare
life sometimes
they'd probably put my head in a guillotine
oh would ever suit your mind
before you step on board sir your name i'd like to know
among the dead and dying her darling love she found
how across the sea from england
or else you'll surely hang says he
but i'd rather have joined that pirate ship
now it's day and night and the irons clang
i'll shoot those tyrants one and all
larry was the oldest joey was next to last
when they tried to strangle larry joey almost hit the roof
joey joey
his closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
it was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
joey joey
joey joey
to hurt a honest man
his name it did resound
with his checks all forged
the louder they come
out to the barn
well i'm hittin it too hard
it's that million dollar bash
ooh baby ooh ee
i'm driftin in and out of dreamless sleep
feel like talkin to somebody but i just dont know who
well there's voices in the night tryin to be heard
well aching and jumping with all laid down
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin
i was raised in the country i been working in the town
well the devils in the alley mule's in the stall
i need something strong to distract my mind
everybody's moving if they aint already there
only one thing i did wrong
where the geese into the countryside have flown
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
yellow fields with twisted oaks that grow
i'm gonna let your pass
but you know how hard you try
but he's badly built
but this time i'm not gonna tell you why that is
i can follow the path
i can hold my own
dont even remember what her lips felt like on mine
i dont cheat on myself i dont run and hide
is there anybody home
dont shoot me please
she looked like she stepped out of
well by the dirt 'neath my nails
that you dont touch my daughter
i knew i had to split
so i yelled out
'bout her mother on the hill
as i seen him get his gun
there for a spell
i might be in the swamp
or maybe say hello with just a glance
upon the beach of sunny mozambique
he grabbed his pants for a better stance oh he jumped so high and he clicked
he shook his head yes he shook his head i heard someone ask him opleaseo
i have no one to meet
i'm ready to go anywhere i'm ready for to fade
and if you hear vague traces of skippin reels of rhyme
the haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
crimson flames tied through my ears
lies that life is black and white
flung down by corpse evangelists
ah but i was so much older then
yes my guard stood hard when abstract threats
they got him outnumbered about a million to one
seen his family scattered his people hounded and torn
'cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
now they wouldnt hurt a fly to hurt one they would weep
he took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
neighborhood bully standing on the hill
if i dont do anybody any harm i might make it back home alive
the world has gone black before my eyes
you could get wrecked in this dance
dont have to wonder no more
when i'm through with you you'll learn to keep your business straight
a life time with you is like some heavenly day
now you're here beside me baby
where your secrets are hid
now i cant go back to what was baby
you're my baby
i'll always do my best for her on that i give my word
poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
i took too much for granted got my signals crossed
and old men with broken teeth stranded without love
beauty walks a razor's edge someday i'll make it mine
look away you rollin river
look away you rollin river
look away you rollin river
well you give me the blues i guess you're satisfied
seen a shooting star tonight
if i ever became what you wanted me to be
seen a shooting star tonight slip away
doctor can you hear me i need some medicaid
why would i want to take your life
what makes the wind wanna blow tonight
sign on a porch says three's a crowd
built me a cabin in utah
wont buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
and charm the whistle off an evening train
you give something up for ev'rything you gain
find out something only dead men know
moving with a simple twist of fate
brought on by a simple twist of fate
blame it on a simple twist of fate
just when she left me
an i dont worry
down in the yard
now she's gone
she said boy without a doubt have to quit your mess and straighten out
in the home of the brave jefferson turning over in his grave
they say loose your inhibitions follow your own ambitions
and wont let go and i cant let go wont let go
it's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
someday baby you aint gonna worry about me any more
so many good things in life that i've overlooked
i'm gonna drive you from your home just like i was driven from mine
rainy days on the great lakes walking the hills of old duluth
something there is about you that i cant quite put my finger on
but am i no longer a part of your plans or your dreams
why are your eyes just staring off in the night
i can feel it in the dust as i get off the bus on the outskirts of town
hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings
and to all the good people that travelled with you
every day your memory grows dimmer
tryin to get to heaven before they close the door
but i dont know what all right even means
i've been to sugar town i shook the sugar down
i moved in closer got up on my toes
it will destroy you family your happy home is gone
the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
they pass by so silently
tweedle dee and tweedle dum
brains in a pot they're beginning to boil
they're lyin low and they're makin hay
i've had too much of your company
how many paths did he try and fail
how many more without any reward
five by five cant stay alive
her fond face pale with woe
and guarded them as they fell
the words that her lover had said
i go half crazy when she calls my name
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
i dont know why i love her but i just cant stop
it's indescribable it can drive you to drink
all the sweethearts that you can hold
he stood beneath the silver skies
it's unbelievable it go down this way
there was an old man
let the wind blow low
let the bird sing
if you ever want to reach me you know where to look
baby they ring in my head like a bell
well my shoes they comes from singapore
sure was a good idea
well it's sundown on the union
when it costs too much to build it at home
they used to grow food in kansas
this world is ruled by violence
aint it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin to be so quiet
and the all night girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train
he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously
but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
but like louise always says
the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
you dont want a love that's pure
i think we better talk this over
i feel displaced i got a low down feeling
i guess i'll be leaving tomorrow
why should we got on watching each other through a telescope
ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete
my thoughts of you dont ever rest they'd kill me if i lie
oh cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
he smiled when he saw me coming
go on back to see the gypsy
i went back to see the gypsy
you can call me right here at home
oh i'll be right there
hey 634 5789
but the fire's feeling really good tonight
hey baby you're the one
just a little sweet talking and a pretty native honey
i got the radio blasting in my old mans chevrolet
i'm gonna lay it on the line
we've been to hell and back again
you can take this world away
i'm all about lovin you
her face because the grass looked greener on the other side
all i want is everything
tell me what you want
was the night she said good bye
i never shot for the moon
but your memory kept calling my name
i filled the party up with company
she's got something i want man it's something i need
baby i can always run
and when the morning comes and i go to sleep
you see i've always been a fighter
the words dont rhyme
i've made mistakes i'm just a man
i would
and i will love you baby always
on any other day just might wanna die
on any other day i would just go crazy
just to get a little edge
baby luck and love
the breaks are only gonna save me
first i need
there aint no doctor that can
i got a jone for your affection
now i'm addicted and your kiss is the drug
you're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
shake it up just like bad madicine
say it with your heart your soul and believe it
ooh let me hear you say yeah yeah hallelujah amen
bang a drum bang it loudly
no i dont claim to be a wiseman a poet or a saint
bang a drum for the lies
let me hear you say yeah yeah hallelujah amen
i think she's still in my bed
what you mean to me
still i run out of time
the barkeeper's wig's crooked
mean i'm not lonely i've got nothing to prove
time dissapears
just reach out and ring the bells of freedom
chorus x3
billy get your guns
all the whores are hanging out waiting to get paid
they christened you with whiskey
no billy get your guns
there's trouble blowing like a hurricane
once you were my inspiration but that river's run dry
once you were my inspiration but that river's run dry
i would drink of your river it would always get me high
my dad says i'm insane
i'll come back another day
i played my music way too loud
blame it on the love blame it on the love
i got my vaccination from a pornograph needle
threw me a wink
take it off make it work
how far you gonna run in those designer shoes
cant you almost taste it
must have gone and sold your halo
empty
all messed up
alright she's schizophoria
but she's extraordinary to me
and we knew how to cry
'cause love is just another word for trust
yeah and we could run like lightning we could run like lightning
as i kiss this world good bye
i pass my time with strangers
you and me and my old friends
you and me we had a fight
never say goodbye never say goodbye
change aint nothing but change
if it all should end tonight
and i would gladly give up everything
i'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone
man it all comes down to you
for the next 100 years
stand by me
cut me out yeah i'll be fine
some dont seem to notice
i've changed my name to novocaine
i'm up to here with dr phil and the modern man in me
till you're ready and willing to fly
didnt know who i'd find
when you're standing on the edge
we're sweating by the light of the moon
one wild night i stepped into the twilight zone
so i stopped
you gotta live it up come on let's go
one wild night life if for the living so
all we've got is one wild night
fight was all you knew they're all the same
only lonely but i cant stop loving you
cutting wounds that run so deep
when i just cant let go
last thing you need's another pickup line
i dont want to make the same mistake but it's too late
it's too late i've crossed that line
guitar solo
they should have put her in the movies
when you better like hank here
at the rodeo she kissed me
that's southern woman made a new man out of me
that country woman
she said baby our love's just like your songs
she said you wanna drive me home
nothing's what it seems she was a venus de milo in her sister's jeans
ooh ooh shalala dancing with the queen of new orleans
well now that we're together
when you want to let a feeling show
i'll raise the flag if you'll defend her
through the back door to heaven
but aint got the money
a friend of a friend needs a favor
we'll slip across the border on the wrong side of right
we'll slip across the border on the wrong side of right
life was just what happened while we were busy making plans
i lost all faith in my god in his religion too
i watched life criticize the truth
in a world that gives you nothing
but does it matter if anything i'm saying is the truth
you place your bets 'cause no one thinks they'll lose
the night is fading like my old tattoo
aint nobody riding shotgun
some will love and some will course you baby
you got to give it all you got now
but only if you have to
aim from the heart
tripping over my own feet
anything can everything can happen
this is the story of my life
gotta be a little something more than this
feels something like summertime
theres a heaven baby your the proof
empty
feels something like summertime
all i've got to give to you
i never knew i had a dream
you ring the bell before they count me out
you parted my lips
i keep on going keep on going
empty
close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
and he walks so tall trying to hang on
the hardest part is the night
these four walls they could tell you some stories
you can wrap your arms around the world
makes no sense its hard to understand
this is the last night
risk your life for a stolen kiss
each move goes so slow
and you know you wont cross that line
empty
guess she's trying to be james dean
his momma said he was crazy he said momma i've got to try
this world keepd turning round and round and round and round
there aint no time to waste
i cried and i cried
remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
then i'm wrong yeah i'm wrong this aint a love song
if the pain that i'm feeling so strong
maybe light a couple candles
why dont you look at me
til we aint strangers anymore
there aint no need to lie
we would take no prisoners
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
in a time in a place
empty
and there wasnt a care
but it felt so good
to have you in these arms tonight
i'd get down on my knees for you
a promise this world would never blind us
i'd get down on my knees for you
this old place still smells like
and make everything alright
would all just call in sick
to some organ grinder's lullaby
it's hard letting you go
the ones with the hole in the toe you wont lose
there's just one thing that you should keep in your book of dreams
it's just me baby it's just me baby
what's it gonna take to make you see
you're gonna hear my voice
i did it my way
and it's now or never
dont bend dont break baby dont back down
i just want to live while i'm alive
i just want to live while i'm alive
i remember how it used to be
janie dont you take your love to town
i hated you the night you said you loved me
sitting here while you're fast asleep
janie dont you take your love to town
joey keys was from my neighborhood
come on come on come on
hey joey
hey joey
the old man lost the restaurant
you're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
i've been up and down and in between
it's not old just older
but i wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
i kept my faith
and i aint gonna hurt no one
i think they're both my middle name ooh
in the barrel of a loaded
there's justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
i am broken like an arrow
when there's no one to lean on
do you keep it all inside
when there's no one to dream on
lord we got to keep the faith
there's things i've done i cant erase
keep the faith
i'm the king of the mountain
there's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls
like the dancing smoke that rose we tried to find our way
dont ask the past to last it's about to change
one i cant forget the last cigarette
only seen right here
honeys dont forget to breathe
see those real live calloused fingers
there's something in the air
right now the rules we made are meant for breaking
if you show me how to get up off the ground
dont you know i only aim to please
i'll take my past and paint it black
there were faces all around
pucker up it's time to kiss the ground
seven days too soon
empty
well i saw roxie on the table
a see through disguise cant conceal desire
let's make it baby
turn out the lights
first time i heard the music
then they took me to a preacher
i'll never grow up and i'll never grow old
if people think it's bad then i'll be bad for good
every song i've sung blame it on love
what the little girls know
i came here like so many did
they say the oil wells ran deeper here
empty
i heard a preacher say
for this burning in my veins
men spend their whole lives
down in dry county
when you're feeling broke and bruised and sometimes shattered
see if anyone believes you
i'm ready and i'm winning
cause baby was born with the beat
too much is never enough
in and out of love
in and out of love
i drove all night down streets that wouldnt bend
now the sky it shines a different kind of blue
but i've made my last trip to those carnival lips
she'll curse you like a sailor
she's a ride
she's a ride
keep on rockin in the free world
there's one more kid that will never go to school
we got department stores and toilet paper
yeah i had a taste you were my fantasy
give me something i can use
come on come on come on
run through my veins night is calling
come on come on come on
in a world they forgot
take me back to tokyo road
sometimes i wish it was that way
she knew that i didnt have any money
so i try to forget it any way i can
he hates her life and what she's done to it
machine gun hand
i need you you want him dressed to kill we live in sin
when you make the rules no one can slow you down
repeat chorus x 2
all those things he couldnt say
daddy's girl learned fast
daddy's girl learned fast
but the things i hear are there just to remind me
it's judgment day in santa fe
i swear i'm gonna live forever
will he close the book on the hearts i broke and the lives i took
i'm tired of hearing talk about this world's about to end
did you ever feel like you were drowning
say a prayer for me
i'll save a prayer for you for you for you
no one to blame but it's hard to explain
i learned all i know on the streets
you make me feel i could fly like
like this old tattoo
maybe i cant save the world
it was all a lie
from someplace we've never been
say everything's all right couldnt be not you
tell me it's a lie i dont need no proof
say everything's all right couldnt be not you
cold hard rain fallin cant find no cover
baby say that you'll take me wherever you're going to
maybe i want you to save me a seat next to you
oh i live love to loose control
i got to get to you get to you get to you
i need you
there's nothing left i can say
that i love her
she dont want things that she can keep
she says that words dont mean a thing
even in my dreams she ruins me
'cause she's a mystery
shot through the heart as i lay there alone
when will you ever learn
baby you just got burned
it's too late
and we're both too tired to fight
it's too late
silent night
she's a fistful of dynamite
so you play hide and seek like a blind kid
empty
i'm sleeping in my car my dreams move on
yeah i'm down but i know i'll get by
thursdays fridays aint been kind
it may not be tomorrow baby that's ok
across the border they turn
to find my piece of easy street
i packed up on my wife and kid
praying for some holy water
and i hoped that he knew
all my dreams went up in ashes
here in dry county
make it by the gun or knife
and no one's getting out of here alive
to sing an outlaw's serenade
but it taught me how to fight
dyin aint much of a livin for the young
empty
bleedin sweatin dyin
life learning how to live my life
and i spread these wings and fly
i'm gonna touch the sky
or did you laugh so hard that you cried
'cause i know i can never escape you
maybe i've lost my guts
but know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now
little lines and cracks
make yourself at home
it's ok to feel a little broken
it's ok to feel a little broken
empty
bleedin sweatin dyin
life learning how to live my life
and i spread these wings and fly
i'm gonna touch the sky
but baby there aint no luck down there
and yeah i know them
a partner in crime
i'll let nothing slow us down
still that's what you call living
through the years one thing hasnt changed
this boy becoming a man
that's right
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i would run
i like 'em down and dirty so hold on tight
you want to take me all the way tonight
my daddy lived the lie it's just the price that he paid
have a nice day
i aint gonna do what i dont want to
i aint gonna do what i dont want to
when the world keeps trying to drag me down
did i cut myself with the same damn knife
since i've had your love here in my hands
dont got a reason
but i'll see the light again
heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day
lord heaven help us all
but i almost lost the house
it keeps on getting harder hanging on
seems like all the good shits gone

hello is there anybody out there
i'm hanging on the line come on
my dad says i'm insane
i'll come back another day
'cause i wore my hair too long
blame it on the love of rock n roll
blame it on the love of rock n roll
when you're brought into this world
take me now but know the truth
you ask me if i known love
i'm the devils son
staring down the bullet
hey patty garrett that's what i used to call you
or would i have traded your life for my own life
bought and then sold you
but we were so young so young
till kingdom come
we were so young so young
till kingdom come
i'd be right by your side
blood on blood
my heart beats like a drum all night
cause you were born to be my baby
if we stand side by side all night
cause you were born to be my baby
even if we dont know where we stand
if you're breathing you know how it feels
kicked around cut stitched and scarred
i'll be bouncing back again
bounce bounce i play hard i play to win
you're too hot to handle with kid gloves
i'm better off on my own
empty
i'm burning for love
tensions mounting bodies shaking
dressed up for a big date
they're shooting for the stars
playing superman he was wearing eyeliner
we can be oh so tragical whatever
now that you're gone i can see what
come back cause i need your love
with another man
ni ese frio en tus ojos al mirar
si al final yo te ame demasiado
se que en verdad el amor al final siempre duele
si mis lagrimas fueron en vano
you bleed you bleed

you watch your whole life pass you by
crazy i'm crazy for feeling so lonely
i'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying

damned if you love me
the lies are on my tongue and i cant turn back i know
damned if you dont need me

destination anywhere left or right i dont care
destination anywhere name the place and i'll be there
blood red rose tells me that you're true

all my life i've been short changed
i wanna thank you baby i wanna thank you let me count the ways

i like them right where they are
i bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
so baby just turn away
if you could see inside my heart
we are cast from edens gate with no regrets
i'd cry for you
without it we would starve
if you're ever on the spot
until the work is finished
if i could make a living out of lovin you
if i could make a living out of lovin you
if you're ever on the spot
i could make a living out of lovin you
empty
empty
would you let me hold your hand
i could get so close it's true
bringing home to meet me
love dont get deeper
there's no one else you'd ever need
thought that love belonged to someone else not me and you
i bet you counted all the tears i bet you've cried
if that's what it takes
if that's what it takes
you say you're cried a thousand rivers

when you get drink i'll be the wine
and i want there when you were happy
words cant say what a love can do

i'll sleep when i'm dead
come on let me drive you crazy
sleep when i'm dead sleep when i'm dead

going out of my head

'cause i can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away

when you're mad at the world and
feeling down misunderstood
to survive
a little bit o soul
i got my call light on gimme one more fare tonight
and the grapes of wrath they're on the vine
where the nights explode and life is still living
there's an old song i used to know
'cause it doesnt make a difference

empty
i just need you baby

and here's to you mrs robinson
jesus loves you more than you will know wo wo wo
a nation turns its lonely eyes to you woo woo woo
life is feeling kind of strange since you went away
i send this song to you whoever you are
as my guitar lies bleeding
and call me the tumblin dice
playin the field ev'ry night
the subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
in a two story town
the ghosts are calling me out
never going down down down down down
put it in a frame for you to see
and that's ugly ugly
that was my brother lost in the rubble
i found spirit they couldnt ruin it
we stand as one undivided
empty
i'd drive all night just to get back home
empty
is there anybody out there looking for a party yeah
'cause tonight you got the right to let your head down
how old in the back and now a public service announcement
we got it goin on
ah ha ha ah ha ha hey yeah ah ha
welcome to wherever you are
remember everybody's different
i was running away from the only thing i've ever known
just a hometown boy born a rolling stone who says you cant go home
who says you cant go home
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright its alright
whose searching for our pot of gold
i close my eyes and picture youre hand in mine
where i need find a reason to be strong
while the old men recite their story lines
they werent looking for trouble
wild wild in the streets
i tried to make you happy
that takes me away from you
somebody to be there night and day
cold is the night without your love
maybe a better man
that tears us apart
she'll draw a crowd then try to hide
well she'll tell you she's an only child until you meet her brothers
yesterday's a memory
she wasnt young but still a child
nothing else feels right without love
and nothing would mean nothing without love
and nothing would mean nothing without love
woman in love
like a woman in love
barking up your tree
and i looked up on the screen
and give them the world
you think that you can
got everything i wanted
when the seas get rough
but there aint no woman
the damage is done
a school boy's dream you act so shy
to me you look so beautiful when you cant make up your mind
you had me from hello
you had me from hello
well you're dancing with the shadow
but they dont recognize you
and you're shouting that i'm dead
but you really put me through it
if you dont know if you should stay
you wanna make a memory
you could sing a melody to me
the sea gleams with lethal cold
primal wisdom from natures own longue
facing the cold stuck in the mould
the minded mountains of old
a loop of convulsion
wisdom set mind and spirit free
arranging the pieces to vivid perfection
universal ritual aesthetic beauty adored
in the mind in nature's argument
the flux that strengthen earth's ability
while fire is fed by air's viability
like a sine curve in an endless loop
contrast condemns and the answer insults
enigma solved
gods of my world behold
the amend forces
gather in the storms asunder
by visions divine
the branches hung low
high up there where his ravens once flew
the source of life the course at sight
the pulse of time shades of light
pre eminant sample of hastins ions
inherit the earth
inherit the earth
raised by the dawn of existnece
raised by the dawn of existence
springs out with the nation to expand
we think therefore we're cursed
the notion of our emancipation
lies far from any genuine liberation
came death to his fear a corollary
expansion and a constant alteration
clutching at straws climbing in air
it would cut through his fingers
but a fragment of time
as a weak and stunning flare
where the oceans rise
i fed the fire with my flesh and desire
a northern notability
an illumination of all illustrations
spilt the blood upon existence
upon the ruins of the future
upon the hands that fold
upon the ruins of the future
the denomination of the grandiose demise
observation of foresights
entwined by the senses of fantasy
to spear the hallow star
soul sphere the pulse of energy
premeditated by nature's sense
the fringes of the canvas always stir
my cells forever redeemed
like a token of flood
leave no shores where the torrents stream
up there on the mountain above all fire
tender are the havens
the fields down there and the ravine below
twine the existence sense of serene
wane as the circle of zero
the gephyr the sullen breath
on my path i wandered high
on my path i wandered high
prior to the forces of primacy
i see fear so clear when you die
i see fear so clear in the eyes
reversed in time proceed in time
circles the spine of the universe
the gloat characters of the gods
i am circling twice my visions
furious are the storms
in fierce affection
in fierce affection
awakened beneath a restless sky
the winterway
when the moon goes hiding
random fields of tension
i can spill all the water
i have walked the silence yet furious fields
i heard sorrow groan
the frost force the ocean up
ride the radiant waves into unexplored space
like my fathers before me
my way is for those the sinners kind
beware the sight of those
the wind is my passion the passion to fight
