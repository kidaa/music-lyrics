i channeled in your frequencies
and i love to watch you sleep
of loneliness emptiness loss of direction or the resolution to my deprivation
alluring lassos slide on so smooth
the taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness
so close to healing the weak
the world has caught on fire from what i've been told
so bright we cant ignore
have you seen it though my eye's
smile and give a toast brag and boast
washing conscience from the skin claiming innocence
and in arrogance you cant accept the nearing end of this short lived life

slightly out of reach
i want you to love me
i'm surprised that you've never been told before
shoot it shoot it out 'cause they want a little more
suffocate integrity till i'm not breathing

feeding the wolves you're feeding the wolves

pleading for sanity

the buzz of this poison is taking me higher
cause i'm a loser
i've got to make this life make sense
i'm over this
that shines the life away from me
'cause now again i've found myself

just to live one day in those shoes

falling in
sober mind time now is gone they carved my

when i get suffacated save me
god i feel so feel so frustrated lately
citizen soldiers holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
citizen soldiers holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
on that day when you dont have the strength for the burden you bear
the sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry
we throw all of our hopes away
i've dreamed about this
it's all a bad dream
bad enough to die from one
down poison down poison
welcome to my world she said do
so you call this your free country
i'm trying so hard
down on my knees
wont turn away
cause i'm not built that way
and you said that i lie

for a little while
oh give me just a little bit more
i've been on my knees for a long time
little bit more
i'm going down in flames
i'm falling into this again yeah
i'm going down in flames
since the last time that i saw your pretty face
but your still with me in my dreams

this could be the end of me
and everything i know

you've got to live this life you're given
and you wont have to feel
like it's the only one you've got
they tell you who you're not

after all i knew it had to be
kryptonite

holding my hand
hopin to come back around
behind someone else
let me be myself

live and let me learn
now slave to the grind
same old song world moves
but i dont have the time
if you dont understand man

maybe it's not worth what he gives away

unable to lose this image

floating away repeated
i'm so weak and powerless over you
desperate and ravenous
we dont need to escalate

'cause this aint what i meant
i swear your love is stronger
and i guess that mansion on the hill

there's honkey tonk music long neck bottles
hahah just fun lovin people like us
every wrinkle every scar was a painful work of art
'cause even the worst of times have turned out for the best
and read between the lines
oh yes she feels like a brand new man tonight
and he's gotta have a tender touch
she's through throwing good love away
just a vision of the past is all you see
yeah that woman made a memory out of me
'cause she's got a way of makin me forget
she takes complete control of my heart and my mind
a million reasons why i could
so i'm standinon the promises
she's standinon the promises
and leave me weak as a baby
but those days are all behind me
nobody had a hold on me
maybe i'll never watch you dressing
but i can sing this song to everybody
that's as close as i'll get to
even though that was incredible now i know
the first time our baby cried
and it's still growing every day
like a caged up tiger she's pacing the floor
love making state of mind
she can turn it loose and howl
and i need to tell you what i've learned before you turn to go
and that stranger's gone for good
but i've always survived
as the sound of your goodbye
compared to the cold cruel words that just leave your lips
she needs a carburetor a set of plug wires
i got stopped by a cop late last night
dual antennas whippin in the wind
i wake up to my living hell
your heavenly memory is pure misery
to swing this nine pound hammer one more day
without this heart in me for you
so it sure does raise a flag for that
you'll be a pile of shavings
now they walk around with their heads hung down
so before you sign that dotted line
just a little here and a little there
seems i was running into trouble every time i turned around
i've never been up against anything quite like you
yeah we'd go back to the basics
be proud of it and always love it
'cause what this country needs
they ought to build a statue of hand williams sr
you just be proud of it and always love it
when country took the throne
they cant get enough of this country stuff
in the last frontier they'll stand and cheer
when country took the throne
and all i need is a chance to change your mind
and all i need is a chance to change your mind
thought i was too much of a sole survivor
you'd think with all the lessons learned the hard way
with your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
if you wanna cram course in reality
as a matter of fact i'd like to set things straight
i've stared into the eyes of strangers
you are the woman oh precious woman
for what he thought was right
you've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
you gotta take it easy
and there'll be no past
'cause you're ahead
get up and roll on
ahead of the pack
hard and heavy
filled with love and pain
dreaming in my sleep
aiming high aiming high
aiming high aiming high
439
what a time what a place
a single tear in the river of life
they write about my coming end
tainted and fainted and lonely i picture my life
living on the edge
bad habits bad habits die hard
i know i got a lot of bad habits
just when you thought that youd
everybodys got bad habits
im searching for identity
i tried to break the circle to
like a bad religion
im gonna pull myself together
bad religion im beggin for
watch the damned god bless ya
you may mortify their flesh
you'll get your balls to the wall man
victory
458
what a deal
is it true
if you were king he'd take your crown
icicle brains
bicycle chains
tyrannosaurus rex
he's a breaker
silly things i do
if i'd only seen you goin
he called it this he called it that
smokey nights gloomy lights
on a cloud of ecstasy
that he could reach the sky
know and it's right
right on rockin man
burning burning burning just like fire
burning burning burning just like fire
burning burning burning just like fire
love you tore my world apart
all you give is pain a curse upon your name
cant you see it isnt right
love why do i take you and why do you take me
to divert my attention
yeah another boning day
feel my desire or break this down
just another one night stand
sweet china lady
dont let me down i'm standing at the crossroads
i really hate uncertainty
aint nothing but a game
come on get your timing right
you've gotta get your timing right
on collision course
of the wheels
its the living hell
dead on like the hammer and the nail
dead on like the hammer and the nail
a life time in prison wouldnt justify
some kind of punishment before
outta my face
death row im ready to go death row
im ready to go death row death row
death row death row
we've got your number no use to hide
demons night
rolling a thunder a curse on that night
demons night the angels fight
but it's only a game
but i feel the weakness now
hard to understand and hard to say
i'm burning in hate 'cause it's just a game

honey dont fool me now
dont you want me baby
lay it down on me lay it down on me
lay it down on me lay it down on me
ive been there before
im tortured sick and tired
you can pull my trigger
im human ammunition
love the twilight love the dark
bad games all night long
cant wait anymore
they're roaring down their way
nightmare's pleasure what you've done
london leatherboys
all together
write a letter what's the matter
when you cant win her in this game
just like you and me
just like you and me
and my brain is gone what is going on i'm burning inside
a love child running wild a love child love child
full moon in the sky
way too extrame
i'm a man and i stand
the one who has to die
for my life and my land
i am man enough to cry
a surgeon said it in the news
they found the same nightmare
metal heart metal heart metal heart
i'm on overdrive
i'm on a high spacin out
midnight and i cruise along the highway
ooh you will remember me
ooh you are forever free
coming in the night going with the light
at all
i've not be mistreated
i've tried more that once before
no one vares what's on my mind
on controversial sides
and we're swearing both to free us
dead or alive dead or alive
fading dreams of the city
red eye whisky
neon nights neon nights endless flame
the days are cold and grey
baby come back run away all my blues
members of the jury
your honour please
one finger at the law
the judge's hammer falls
objetion overruled let's take it to the senate
hunting in a pack
nature's takin over
when you try to escape
what you're gonna do
is to shed my skin
it's felony to me
that she'll be mine
got a lot to fight for prisoner
run on up run on down
flashing out just kill them all
out of the day knowning no way
when you heed the demons call
and he's alive
i run through the night
i run through the night
to make my stick like glue
it's an award i've won
you might have a celebration
wargames for satisfaction
does he stop this bloody game
beyond the hill of fantasy
black hill castle there in the dark
repeat
it hurts just the very first time
when you went on and on
sit beside the room all night long
it is night and the seawinds are calling
soon the sea turns to darkness
a world in flames
the cost of living dont mean much to me
shake your heads cry out as loud as you can
and we scatter them around
'cause we are slaves to metal locked into the taste of steel
it's the ultiment commandment
we are slaves to metal chained up to the sound
dont you see that the point is near
i was born tell me why
seems to be the end of this rotten land
you're on your own
no one really ever made
all you're saying you cant day
you gotta face it make in on your own 2
deep down in the gravel
you say you've got to drill me
stand tight all right
all right
to the light we know so well
starlight shining bright starlight
learned from history
stone evil infected from within
this is the lesson we have learned
rivers of pesticide
her body was imaculate her hair was solid gold
if you dont know which way to go
take him in my heart
it's a long way to start
crime is colour blind
crime will never pay
when they're doing time
come on and kick out that slime
we dont know the things we're doing
we wanna know how you are doing
come rock and roll and feel allright
come rock and roll and feel allright
when i feel the urge
its breaching the chains
i know my soul is under siege
the beast the beast the beast
id like to shred your face
again and again the force is too strong
the mirror its staring at you
prowling in the dark
it's too late far too high
now i'm ready to explode
and now you aint so tough
stick it shove it
i know it's going going to my brain
he's the winner he's the sinner
and nobody wants you
tired of me she's got my back to the wall
you wont remember and no one would wonder
you cant deny it you're leaving your world
too high to get it right
too high to get it right to get it right
yes indeed i wanna have it now
but sorry here is no lamp
baby that was a hot lick
i know you want some more
in the hush of the night suger daddy's dont know

bloodless but deadly and cruel
tv war tv war
bloodless but deadly and cruel
before i get to the top
i'm not the kind of guy you can check
to the limit up to the limit
to the limit up to the limit
for very first time in your life
walking in the shadow walking in the night
wallstreet buy in politics
i dont need personality
whats in it for me
flickering candles in the room
dont try to tear me apart cold winter dreams
freezing the heat in my heart
i'm buried and covered
dont pretend if you love
we dont care about the time
wrong is right wrong is right
like a hell of a load
in the back of the street
x t c babe
he wants it rare but something's there
that they are just like you and me
but someone's there who leads the lead
is a hunter held on leads
dogs on leads dogs on leads
and there she was neat as a pin

you may end up six feet under
sick dirty and mean
a pair of concrete slippers there're all vultures all over your back
sick dirty and mean
sick dirty and mean
i pray there will be an answer
i pray
turn around expectations
i pray there's another day
have you heard have you heard
and my joy'll never be denied
tossed astray far away
exploring what the nature brings
adventures in paradise
when the moon is at its height
oh give me what i need tonight
she leads a lonely life
she's gone tomorrow boy
but the morning means goodbye
until we kissed and made it open up so easily
just how much you mean to me
i always will
and sometimes i dont know
doesnt matter where we go
will you always be there to hold me
angel eyes with your angel eyes
what you're doing tomarrow's gonna come your way
see the nature in bloom a laughing child
now and forever
believe me
the best in life is free
others weak with sorrows
believe me crows will always fly
reality reality reality is always
you cannot pierce that and
take a voyage to the bottom of the sea
if we come in peace at heart
he is curious about the plan
oh no he's far too continental for mankind
simon and garfunkel had a little problem
were a single pair not free like you
according to a well known song
i'm always 21 at heart love listen to me

ca tourne dans ma tete
the city is crowed

tu nes qu'un reve qui s'enfuit
you're not the only one
i'm drawing the line

i'm with you from time to time
you're living in a dreamer's dream
you're living in a dreamer's dream
da da capo
dance into my daydream
help me take control of my fool imagination

but that chapter of love stays unfinished for you
in the summer time life was easy
much more to living
but dont go away

you're gonna regret it
take another look on your way
dont worry about this heart of mine
i'm letting you go
i'll make it through
they dont know what's going on
my vacation is gonna be a pleasant memory
i dont want to be alone on the beach no
guess who
i believe in to let a little sunshine in my life
lead me to the light
i start to see a picture
i know the storm is coming any minute
every time it rains i get wet
i feel you i taste you
i feel you i taste you
i fall to pieces
i want to hold you
i'm gonna be yours this time
i'll wear your pearls more precious than silver

carry on smiling
mr jailer is your host
living without life
without no sense of logic
you'll be living in danger
they're the purest of flowers
to ease all their sorrows
the money they earn when everybody wants them
forget the past for the time to come
what's left of the magic
i will always remember
where everything has a happy end
like the leaves in november
love in december
lucky love belongs in teenage heaven i know i know
and your heart's so full of soul it makes me believe
oh mnchhausen was a sun of a gun
with a company containing just five
searching for my destiny
oh can he see just you and me
sit down and take a look put me into motion
have mercy on me
you've got to have pity on me
mercy mercy

oh no glove love aint cool
she told me gimme some slack
gettin your rocks off
and when you say dont
when you keep hearin no
stationed on top of an undersea mountain
face the truth of time
shattered lives wont matter here
share your space with souls forever caught
forced cowards to run out of spite
masters of metal agents of steel
masters of metal agents of steel
i am justice i am vengeance
let your hatred rule your mind
my star is death in the sky it burns
we've stared at the sun until all eyes are blind
live to disease betrayer
souls lost to time
rise from your knees rise from your knees
oh chosen one lead us to our doom
the earth and sea are not your home
and still we are denied
we're children born of lies
the more you know the less you're worth
some will pay for this pain
no remorse i tried to explain
feeling there is no doubt
the hearts of humans left to dry
looking into the darkness
sun sets the slaves all die
with fire they draw on our mountains
will only cause you pain
to turn them away
we're children of sorrow captors of none
their science was left to decree
and a tear in the eye
chanting awaiting the gods of the sun
you've chosen the moment
assuming all that surrounds you
it's not in your hands
bass solo
the passion born to an inquisitive mind
it's odd how they match your own
you gained a thrill from the sickening stench
from dead eyes
cherish your freedom
those who will suck from your hard work and struggle
destroy the hush
not what they make you a monitored slave
neo kosacks in nato colors
look to the sky it foretells your disaster

they pray to those who would be king
suffer for their pound of flesh
you are enslaved
abused into servitude

our death is life for the few outside

an appetite for profanity
the you you knew is now the slave you are dancing
create the killer from inside
above theocracy we reign
in god's name all the heretics must die
who is the great dictator
satan gave himself a name
on your back shouldered greatness
chorus
you pave their streets with dreams
as the new city sinks with despise
the crew is gone the ship left behind
the channel is open they're coming through
abduction begins memory lost
our time keeps us measured
eyes shut yet we still march forward
skies filled with our fathers watching
embrace them and call them father
do we trust them or are we their tools
the dream is death the dream is death
i'll fight
and the godz are sworn to treason
his world is made of steel
in symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
the failures scratch and carve the lines
alone he accepts all the blame
what we all are
predecessors
wait inside us
together we stand
barbaric approach
as destiny stands
you'll never retreat
never to wake from these dreams of destiny
all are silent

signals of warning message from space
he's coming to town he is the rager
denying conformists alive in the lights

chubby old groundhog croakin bullfrog free as the feelin in the wind
and these days that's a special way of life
gathered 'round a checkerboard
they can fall back on
fantasy midnight and you and me
whisper to me softly three words upon my skin
your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high
listening to the old jukebox playin a song
it was gettin late but they had all night
and they both knew without a word
just wont die
where you stand with me
when there's age around my eyes
forever's as far as i'll go
i know my mind is in it but my body's almost shot
and all i see is sorrow you're all i lived for now you're gone

i have no gift to bring pa rum pa pum pum
then he smiled at me pa rum pa pum pum
i've only got one plea
chorus
that i need to fit my plan
let me be your lovin man
you're tellin me the same old lies and i dont need your alibis
trippin in the ole starlight
yeah we're havin us a party down in the holler
jimmy's got the four wheel hooked to the wagon
then i'll float on down the river to a cajun hideaway
play something with lots of feelin 'cause that's where music has to start
and when its cold outside girl i've got the month of may
well i guess you'd say what can make me feel this way
then i heard about the barrooms just across the georgia line
chorus
somewhere high on lookout mountain i'll just smile with pride and say that my
daddy's little girl is growing up in the world
i guarantee that we'll have a good time
then we'll go home to our warn winter bed
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
why do you ask of course i'm alright
but you'll never know 'cause i keep it inside
if you dont want to know the truth of course i'm alright
hung where you can see
and everyone you meet
but i'm a little bluer than that
whatever i do
now wherever i go and
well i've been wonderin what i've been missin
a truck needs a highway a train needs a track
two young people dancin in the daylight
lovin and trustin blindly she'll follow
i have known
and i know
taken for granted
thank god for it
love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
i sip a little coffee and i drink a little booze
aint no way i'm ever gonna change
i'm my daddy's spittin image and my mama's pride and joy
the world is callin you and you must answer
they'll be there for you if you get down
my wife died early i've got children
i'll be waiting for you
when i'm sober i'm almost a saint
that's another good reason not to drink
he said 'are you drunk or blind'
if i keep going on like this
are you washed in the blood
and tempt the soul of any man
again i know it's him
outside her reach is my concern
i see her there
born of his spirit washed in his blood
refrain
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
you can make what went wrong today
and turn out the lights
and bring on the night
and bring on the night
on waters that will take you back in time
i'll just fond somethin else to promise you
and i stop lovin you
when they caught her with them matches
when i ran out with my fiddle
daddy won a radio
'cause all i've ever wanted
half the time i sing for free
chasin that neon rainbow
'cause all i've ever wanted
we laid rubber on the georgia asphalt
a lot about livin and a little 'bout love
she made leaving me look easy
if dallas was in tennessee
then she'd be here with me
2 i said i dont usually come here for the dancin
bridge
i couldnt stand for something else to be gone
i know you know i'd do the same for you
oh tonight we're the designated drinkers
i got the dog river blues
and i pray someday it'll bring you home
so dont rock the jukebox
dont rock the jukebox
but when your heart's been broken
i dont feel like rocking
we put on a shine put on a motor
he'd say you cant beat the way an old wood boat rides
i'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
but i was mario andretti
i cant replace the way it made me feel
with a '75 johnson with electric choke
i guess i made a big mistake
'cause everything i love is killing me
til my life on this old world is through
i loved her at first sight
i was a wreck cant drive a check
in '93 a gift to me on christmas eve
she was mine
your voice laughing out loud
when i looked in your eyes
from a distance i can see you
the records that everybody's buying
but he's holding out in the village
he's gone country back to his roots
this aint no place for children
he's gone country oh back to his roots
never leave the sound of the telephone
i never saw your face this many times
love is a sweet dream that always comes true
here in the real world
here in the real world
what have i to dread what have i to fear
so let's back up to yesterday
well i dont like the blues
i'm always on the road
let's start makin plans
all those little things we used to do
little hometown or a big old city
life goes on for a little bitty while
little hometown or a big old city
except for an old coke sign from 1950
and killed the little man
and he wouldnt sell beer
they dont even realize
god bless the little man
without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
livin on love
but love can walk through fire without blinkin
i cant eat and i cant sleep
it's turning me every way but loose
it's turning me every way but loose
on my front porch swing
but it's a real beauty
stepped on a pop top
yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
maybe you should stay here
somebody said only fools rush in
for all eternity oh baby we should stay here just
a meat and potato man
folks with poodles dressed like kids
and cruise it up and down the road
crazy bout a mercury
well if i had money
who vowed to love you
and i opened up the present that i gave to me
then the wind picked up and he was gone
i climbed back on my eagle took one last look around
smell whiskey in the air
the keys are just collecting dust
said he missed me at the service
but as for me without your love girl
cut out its heart and soul
down on music row
once it was dead and gone
mixed right up in your face
i cant recall what even started out fight
with cowboy boots on and nothing else at all
i must've had a ball last night
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
but all the signs are showing
two kinds of mothers i'm told i'm told
repeat first chorus
once in a lifetime love
you know how lucky you are
i can finally go to sleep and get some rest
i'll always love you so
please daddy dont get drunk this christmas
please daddy dont get drunk this christmas
i dont want my momma cry
noi dont want to see my momma cry
pop a top again
sit 'em up my friend
i will cling to the old rugged cross
i can hear her thoughts
those are the sounds of a woman leaving
now the truth is ringing clear
i can hear it
i sure could use a haircut and shave
yeah the thrill is back the heartache's gone
wish i enjoyed what makes my living
yeah i just dream and keep on being the way i am
behind and whisper my name
you like to see what you can do
there goes my heart fallin for you
there you go you're doing fine
that's it
but you gotta try
the new messiah
heaven knows
there's a new kid in town
but he's just another baby i suppose
weak yet redundantly strong
in a three minute positive
a little guitar then it's gone
in a three minute positive
not too country up tempo love song
i'm so glad i learned to trust thee
made my daddy wonder where my good sense went
the drunks that dont listen the crowds that dont care
so i count my blessings when i step up to sing
i'm not sure what's the cause
when you love the one you hold
smiles in the morning
is a good thing
feelings like this cant be wrong
watching the tide ebb and flow
this tropical depressions gonna
this tropical depressions gonna
in the light of his glory and grace
chorus
well i found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
i'm drowning for you dear
the story of heart breaking pain
on the cover of the usa today
in a small town down in georgia over forty years ago
grandaddy rolled down on two logs
except the time she took a job to play a bill or two
they taught us 'bout good living
merry christmas girl
chorus
thy hands have made
my saviour god to thee
how great thou art
how great thou art
for me
hurtin comes easy
for me
so maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
so maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
i never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
and keeps me higher than a georgia pine
bu it's her sweet love that packs the punch
of unseen things above
to tell the old old story
refrain
to send north to the pole
a drunk man walking down a rainy street
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
i hope that you're feeling the way that i feel
that aint nothing new
my arms still ache my heart still waits
except i still love you
but time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
but you're looking better than you did back then
the longer we love
just the way i expect to
i'd wear a smile endlessly
that if french fries were fat free
if i could have you
tell me it's not too late
if i could hold you tight
if it aint one thing it's you
if it aint one thing it's you
it's true
if love was a river
if love was a firefly
if love was a party
everything's gonna be all right i know
and their timing's not the greatest
for ole stnick tonight
if you dont wanna see santa claus cry
so baby come back to me
i'll fly away
revealed to me as you slip off your dress
or the change in the tides
will remain strong and true
over the rain
let's face eternity
repeat chorus
the son of god discloses
and he walks with me
all that i want is you
it must be love
it's alright to be a redneck
it's good to be a redneck
ba bom ba bom
it's alright to be a redneck
i'm gettin paid by the hour an older by the minute
tomorrow mornin i know there'll be hell to pay
i could pay off my tab pour myself in a cab
it's only half past twelve but i dont care
i seen your boat there
let's get out of here
and a chance for you to cry
so here's your lesson in heartache and grievin
so i wrote this job description
well each night i take the stage
dreamin 'bout my little girls
i told everybody including my mama
dont want to see nobody
so i'll keep george on the old turntable
he's playin possum
oh i guess a saner man
a little hole in the wall
oh i've got this hammer in my hand
and let her know you think about her when your gone
and let her know you think about her when your gone
so i can clear my mind
on the wrong side of the bed
on this rainy day in june
a natural born guitar ringer
she changed all that one night
he got cuffed on dirt roads
i'm over 40 years old now
son i wish i could turn back the years
and hold on to those you love
let my mistakes
slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
every night i hear her cryin
i'm not buying or selling anything
i just hope these few lines will get to her
looking through these old photographs
and there's no tomorrow for us
but
everything to god in prayer
who will all our sorrows share
love will find me a brand new man
when love comes around
when love comes around
the way i love you
the way i love you
the way i love you
when we all see jesus
ten minutes after midnight
well i was south of detroit city
where i come from a lotta front porch pickin
we like the girls that sing soprano
that's rollin on like thunder
where i come from
yeah where i come from
or did you just sit down and cry
and look at yourself to what really matters
teaching a class full of innocent children
did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
i watch cnn but i'm not sure i can tell you
but i know jesus and i talk to god
and it's just because you love me
you go to church on sunday
and it's just that you're concerned for me
i've got precious memories at my beck and call
but you can not impose you cant stick your nose
you see it felt so right when she held me tight
though it's wrong all along it keeps going on
i did buy you a ring i believe it was back in '93
just be patient i'm a work in progress
i swear one day you'll have a brand new car
now i love your cookin honey
i'm a work in progress
to really start over
that old working class hero lives on
'cause the blood sweatin years
that workin class hero lives on
at wwwmemory
i'll be waitin for you patiently
you feel like talkin you can log me on
even take my hand
and you just cant win
daddy's livin in a house all alone
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
then when you first put it on
hand in hand in the haze
and time stood still and love was all we knew
remember when old ones died and new were born
remember when
for all the life we've had
cause i'm a revenooer man
i noticed on the side of the hill
and a gun on my hip
it's revenooer man
and a wedding band
when it's right in the palm of your hand
feet on the floor holding my head
chasing the rainbow and looking for love
the sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
i'm forever on a roll that's how she's got me feeling
when she says i wouldnt last ten minutes without her
cause we live way down south
cause the weatherman had some problems
and there's gonna be a merry christmas
she aint looking for romance she danced that dance before
i got my first motorcycle when i turned sixteen
daddy didnt like it and he made no bones
when they tried to change the startion to some rock n roll
she likes it too
chorus
chorus
he'll love some woman 'til he go insane
chorus
calling o sinner come home
and i took her by the arm and said dont leave me
'cause sometimes someday just never comes
she said i cant wait
there's a song for the life i have found
it keeps my feet on the ground
standing on the promises of god
refrain
memories seem to know just where to find me
strong enough to get her off my mind
well i didnt go to work told the boss i was sick
well i'm a gonna raise a fuss i'm gonna raise a holler
on all the waters and the seas
if it's money you want then i'll get it
i'm a fool fool fool for you
i'll buy you tall tall trees
when i'm far from home
thank god for the radio
thank god for the radio
that'd be alright
if my dear ol dog never got old
and that'd be alright
if everybody everywhere
i had to look through our old pictures
and i'll keep holdin on forever
chorus
the reason god had sent his son
the son of man
risked abandonment and stood by that
i wouldve baby stepped into intimate
torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
and dont believe in capital punishment
i'm in no hurry i could wait forever
born of your bellies i yearn for the cord
and i have relented
to dispel our archaic reputation
i'm surprised i still love music just as much
after a year like this one
i'm surprised we're all not weeping drunks and
and you say how appropriate
and all i really want is deliverance
i am humbled by his humble nature
did you think about your bills your ex your deadlines
all i really want is some comfort
and soon i realized that your
i put my heart on a shelf forever
whoand when i think of the time i med you
it's something i could never have planned
are you still mad i gave you ultimatums
of course you are
only on your potential
in pursuit of your nirvana
completely absolve me
their own essence
completely absolve me
several hours and several ways i'll feast on scraps thrown from you
you cringe at the thought of living under the same roof as me god and everything
but i'm not screamin or cryin
chorus
i keep on pushin and shovin
i lay awake alone in my bed
give me love i know that you can
every day you're always on my mind
because i cant not
because i cant not
because we cant not
i know there's a reason you're forcing a smile
'cause you've been crying for too long
but change is never a waste it's never a waste of time
look to the horizon
i am a citizen of the planet
i come alive and i get giddy i am taken and globally naturalized
and angry and free
and it's all you could do not to throw her on the floor
she'd grow to be a maid if she couldnt find a fella
and this is the story of the death of cinderella
i'm not enraged
i'm not afraid as such
cause i have moved on too
i'm not jealous
when you sing
my name is alanis i'm just sixteen so
now dont overdo it when you shake your thing
bass they keep on pumpin a groove and it'll melt your face
got her all figured out and there's nowhere
one day i'll feel comfort inside cause i'll
i cant ever let them see me cry
has told me all alone
we do some funny bits back and forth
she doesnt do it so much anymore
then theres my friend from chigago
shes been tortured in this sense
she sure knows how to dress that one
i would seruptitiously put it in front of him without him asking
i have been utterly threatened
i have compensated for my days
you mean we actually are all one
wrongly label ed and under fed treated like a rose as an orchid
and your garden is a nice spot
i see this pasture
the only way out is through
the only way out is through
every time i dream of quick fix i'm swaged
the only way we'll feel better
oh baby
party boy you're just a party boy
you know i gave you all my love ow
misbehavin now i'll mis ya
dont forget to keep that smile on your face
you've gotta try a little harder
be a good boy
gotta look around or you'll lose your friends
tell me what i want what i wanna hear
and here's what you do do do
chorus
what am i to do with all this fire
between flying vases and secretly weeping
can you understand me in this place
for putting things back on the wall of the world
when i'd come visiting her 5 years later
only when you realize the gem i am
but this wont work as well as the way it once did
please be able to take the wheel from me
please be the jerk of my knee i've fit you always
anesthetize me with your gossip and many random anecdotes
please give my love to my family
please keep me in this state
keep it a question
keep it a question
keep it a question
the world rushes by me it's leaving me here all alone
and with every hour just hold on to what you can
we dont give a dam 'bout our reputation baby
we dont give a damn 'bout our reputation baby
that voice in my headit says you're here inside the real world
and you've got meal ticket taste
you pat me on the head
and this ammunition on my back
you've got love to love me
cause these are rules for us
dont forget that you're condemned to me
never makes it easy
we are branches of the same old tree
so
dont forget that you're condemned to me
she would give me a wink across the room
we'd talk about it till 5am when i'd come visiting her 5 years later
i thought we'd be simple together
it pierces my chest
my wealth would render this no less severe
but i was sadly mistaken
sister blister we fight to please the brothers
you and me are on this pendulum together
you and me have made it harder for the other
but you and me are strangers to each other
you and me estranged from the mother
they're happy we're climbing over each other
sister blister we fight to please the brothers
i want to be weightless flying through the air
wont be mayhem if i'm ruled by my own rule lessness
i want to be weightless flying through the air
i sink three pointers and you wax poetically
one small sideways look and i feel so ungood
so ignorant for someone of sound mind
oh these little rejections how they disappear quickly
and for denying myself to somehow make us compatible
and for my impatience when i was perfect where i was
well i wonder which crime is the biggest
and
male friends especially i'll no longer be in touch
live my life as apologetic compromise
i'll listen to you for hours wont need anything
i know this sharing of shame will ensure that i wont forget myself so easily
from hand to hand
makes the pain pass by
but on my way
makes it all alright
that falls from his eyes
laughing out loud
i see you averting your glances
i see you abusing the land
i see you altering history
i am your passion and your plight
i see you blaming each other
i see you forcing them out
you got a complicated girl like me
and never be scared of finding your way
with all the other boys i never knew
on the line you gotta keep lookin or
who am i
with his plastic protected pockets so his pens dont leak out upon the floor
can you hear me call tonight
i'm calling all superstar wonderful weirdos
you were self sufficient and needless
and i embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces
and i'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces
surrendering a feat of unequalled measure
flown off of i was afraid of holes being punched
you were my partner
manipulation i was afraid of your explosions
and therein lay the issue
all these thoughts in my head arent my own
you are better off without me
thank you india
thank you india
how bout no longer being masochistic
how bout getting off these antibiotics
how bout me not blaming you for everything
the moment i let go of it was the moment
thank you disillusionment
that i would be great if i was no longer queen
that i would be good even if i got the thumbs down
that i would be good even if i was clingy
we thought a break would be good for four months we sat and vacillated
i'm sorry i lost myself i am
she never married anyone else you took it upon yourself to console her
how can you just throw words around like grieve and heal and mourn
she was only responsive with a drink he was only responsive by photo
you are wise you are warm you are courageous you are big
until i out his false story
until i out his false story
until i out his false story
but something i cant control that
in a world that does not recognize women are victimized
you'll have the time of your life
take cold showers every day and throw my life away
with my boyfriend
why do you say you are spiritual yet you treat people like shit
and not the other way around
eleven songs
you deserve a piece
i wanna be soft and resolved
but who's still aching now
i wanna forgive for the both of us
validated
i wanna be soft and resolved
stand up if you want the answers
never too young never too old
to what your heart could tell ya
chorus
i miss your smell and your style
these are the days of raw despondence
these are the things that i miss
these are the things that i miss
where was you ally your partner in feminine crime
oh mother who's your sister
do you see yourself in my gipsy garage sale ways
where was you ally your partner in feminine crime
oh mother who's your sister
do you see yourself in my gipsy garage sale ways
livin the life because you're movin to
i'm tired of people sellin their sex appeal
portable phone he aint speakin to the people
to me than human flesh i'm gonna
come on to the weekend
how's your life
what if no one shares their humble appearance
hold off 'till the weekend
and you would be bored
and yes you're a fine woman and i cringed
i too thought that when proved wrong i lost somehow
i was hoping i was hoping we could be creamy together
you with your new kind of heroism
and i vow and i vow to not take advantage
one day i will be healed
i have been running so sweaty my whole life
and measured outside of my poems and lyrics and art
and isnt it ironicdontcha think
and isnt it ironicdontcha think
a traffic jam when you're already late
who would've thoughtit figures
how i did invest in such fantasy
and all that remains is the case
she just cant wait to party
so better make it right
suspicious so baby cant you see that girl
if we were our futures
if we were our outcomes i'd be joining you
if we were our paranoias i'd be joining you
keep the radio on
all the things i am feeling
cant you feel what they are saying
all hail the king of intimidation
i am single
he knows not of what he has wrongly done
lalalala
with the world turning circles running round my brain
there's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread
we share a culture same vernacular
you are a spirit that knows of no limit
you make the knees of my bees weak tremble and buckle
nothing's been clear
all the more feels indefinite
and my books and my dogs at my feet
sense of myself
a vow to myself
and how i do love london
the steam will smell of puke and left us in the shower
i've been most unwilling to see this turmoil of mine
oh thank you for your most generous triggers
you never seem to want to dance anymore
well it's full speed baby
you're the last great innocent
i've never known focuslessness on any form
i declare a respite from the toils of liaison
i declare a moratorium on things relationship
and every woman graced with your presence after
leaves you running for the door
and any talk of selflessness
dear self centered boy i dont know why i still feel affected by you
why why do i try to change you try to
and you feel that you cant go on
i know how you're feeling i've been there before
i'm hearing your words like the wind
my feelings turn to stone
chorus
you sample concepts like hors d'oeurves
you may never have or hold a child
i once had a girl or should i say she once had me
i wear their all on top of my face
i see the buttons i engage
we are a team
i'll only take some of it
and not as we
and not as we
and not as we
i didnt carry you in my womb for nine months
what are you hungry for
you see it's too much to ask for and i am not the doctor
you see it's too much to ask for and i am not the doctor
i'll teach you all this in 8 easy steps
i've been practicing my ass off
you stated your case time and again
your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
thanks for your patience
and dont be alarmed if i fall head over feet
who am i to feel spent
and why
how dare i ignore an outstreched hand
conclusions you come to of me routinely incorrect
talking with yous like talking to a sive that cant hear me
i swear you wont be happy til
there is no difference in what we're doing in here
so why spend all our time in dressing our bandages
i can be an asshole of the grandest kind
you see all my light and you love my dark
you see all my light and you love my dark
who is as everything as i am sometimes
you dig everything of which i'm ashamed
and god wants me to work
these excuses how they served me so well
and it clears my side
they've kept me stuck
in a town full of rubber plants
for girls in the eighties
and i cant help the feeling
all the time
fate stay with me and guide me along my way
i can sing or act or dance but i still wont get far
forever guide me
i've tried to be small i've tried to be stunted
i sabotage myself for fear of losing you
a serious kind of somethin new
now baby now love i wanna feel your love
keep your flowers cause their colour will turn blue
it was love at first sight
this might be your lucky day
we'll be great you and me
it was love at first sight
what are you my blood you touch me like you are my blood
my tongue would seize up if we were to meet again
this man knows not of how this information has affected me
and i
i took off my clothes
would you forgive me love
i love you so love
so forgive me love
we all needed something to cling to
we all needed something to cling to
we all had our minds made up for us
bed we've yet to acknowledge what really happened
time alone to fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesnt always have to be about you i've been wanting
dont owe him anything raise the roof he yelled yeah raise the roof i yelled back unfortunately
oh this state of ecstasy
this liberty wind in my face
oh this state of ecstasy
i'm not kiddin
you've got to want what you see and see what i'm givin away
is that a possibility
but boy dont you look gorgeous

you're looking gorgeous
i've got one hand in my pocket
i've got one hand in my pocket
i'm brave but i'm chickenshit
harmonica solo
and no one knows except the both of us
and overlook this supposed crime
i wish i could tell the world cuz you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
ooh this could be messy
i know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
what part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept
and overlook this supposed crime
i need a fix cause i'm going down
happiness is a warm gun mama
to watch the stoic squirm
but this is not allowed
soon be my pace
this is my town
glad that i left when i did before i know you you cant get the best of me
unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last
dear eric i liked you too much i used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me
and you got me seriously thinking about spirituality and you wouldnt let me get away
as well as we could we were together during a very tumultuous time in our lives i will always
i would be open to spending time with you and finding
and pushing you away i remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep
dear lou we learned so much i realize we wont be able to talk for some time
do you realize guys i was born in 1974
you'd like to know young lady
lord knows that we would've
enjoy and evolve and discern and inquire and accept and admit and divulge and
be gentle and make room for every emotion
coercing or leaving
explaining and controlling

to you to you
at half past seven i'm sittin here waitin for

his best intentians are never the same as what

chorus

i'd renunciate and still it would not come
you bleed you learn
you love you learn
you cry you learn
you live you learn
to make it enough for you to be open wide no

until you died til you died
and every time i scratch my nails down someone else's back
you can speak of anger and doubts
and only yourself and i'll grant it
i bet you're wondering how far you now have danced moved back into dead
you can leave and hit rock bottom have a mid life chrisis and i'll hold it
glued to the ground

how you diggin that
let me tell you something
can you feel it in your feet
you got me whoopin over you
say what na na now
yo this beat's flat
you got me whoopin over you
this feeling you just cant hide
as the mysteries of life begin to unfold
for helpless souls
your future is not what you wished it to be
oh see the sun in the sky
angels dying
to feed the few
unshined
before you leave with no repentance
i'm leaving everything
you say that i take it too hard
and all i ask is comprehension
now starts to reach my feet
thrills like we had before
and for him we made a toast
one man less on board human dreams
and the ones i left at home
matos
follow your steps and you will find
but cant you see i'm by your side
the remains from the past to carry on
so carry on
instrumental
should i always be the same once again
always be the same
and there's no way to get back
and much too high
until another day
take the freedom that you have fore seen
no more remaining time
flow cold in vain
we're knowing foundations of all
it's so extreme
but still the sands keep on running too slow
and i cry for you now
sharing the miracle of hope
portraying my face in the future
saying hi to people's like saying goodbye
gentle change of tides
beyond the creed
carried by wooden gods
long disappeared
holy land show your signs to me
playing around a future denied
blow
there i'll stand
look at me nobody cares
oh skies are falling down
oh skies are falling down
something i need
all over me the tears you hide inside
i after all
minutes waiting life's been wasted
we could never get back from the start
623
i could do
bringing life to the dead
metal icarus
unknown songs
desperation fills the air
i wonder why
made it on my own
heading for the bend
a day had come when we were like one
and we could go no further at all
nothing to say
for all what remains i've got
how could people applaud it
blood through your heart
we're armed and ready to attack
petrify my eyes
deep desires of mine
dreams last forever
tears and prayers will be taken by the rain
just like we wanted it to be
but in different lands
my hands as empty
this emptiness burns inside
now let me go
silence and distance
speed all the memories will come
then could you stop time
always
all around we mourn
killing jesus for salvation
how they yield
the stars cant find the purple sky
rest in peace
let me run away
then we'll know
let me know
freed from lies i wont forget
how things went wrong
the blaze a blast and the awakening dead
against the men for the land
while the body is freezin
boys i swear i've been there
and many things can be done
that keeps your ilusions locked
the tears you've contained
and if you get lost
time make us heal
time make us live time make us live
day by day
and we've got to know
everyday growing stronger
we'd roll and fall in green
heathcliff
i pine a lot i find the lot
it's me cathy
let me grab away your soul
let me in a your window
maybe you might know much more than me
now you've got your voice
what's more delightful than this
just feel the sea of bliss
i was in debt right up to my neck i wasnt having any fun
i've gotta win i gotta win or i might as well be dead
i'm hearing voices deep inside my head
join us i wont follow you
we are the voices deep inside you're head
alison hell your mind begins to fold
alison hell what are you looking for
alison hell what were you looking for
the storm is coming closer
blood red
infecting like disease like a disease
anything for money
and if i have to blackmail and extort
come fill me up the door is locked you cant get out
creepy crawlers sidewalk maulers have you met our little alice
i feel the flesh tearing off me oh help me please
four three two one
you're in deep way over your head' i've turned my life around
it's hard to see yourself when the mirror's cracked
it's time to realise
anxiety attacks as confusion rips at the mind
instrumental
they're banging at my door what do they got to sell
the blackness getting bigger than the serpent's universe
brain dance
sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
he jumped out of the frying pan into the fire and he's back again
watch my brain dance
gratification do you want some more
excess perversion and we'll never let it end
i am a disease or virus that has fatal consequences
i was born to murder the world
your strength devoured
but filled with nothing new
oh wont you come with me
colours now decay
i wish you all the best
and acts of violence
prey on the anger prey on the fear
bred to hate their goal is genocide
i am hanging helpless here
and fall back to the ground
get ready for the nozone
dream and pray the ozone mustnt burn away
it's time to put out the fire
good god there's nothing left to do
well i got a deal to soothe your soul an offer you cant refuse
bow to me and take my plague spread it across the lands
400
in hell
unholy inquisition sentence very cold
day by day watching you disappear
carry me out the hurricane
on wings that fill the sky
i'll blacken the night and black out the sun
and then we'll see what's begun
accidental intake down the throat the chance of survival can be
pain
bodies now corpses bent broken and strewn
reduced to ash
temptation frustration it aint easy to beat
i guess you could call this annihilator's version of 'detroit rock city' meets 'highway star' meets drinking and driving thousands of people are killed each year by those who think that after a few drinks they're sober enough to drive the few short miles to home this particular individual was one of those
concentrate kill the radio
carefree on top of the world feeling power
schizos are never alone
you'll fight but i'll win 'cause i'm second to none
just look around you i'll take you higher so just scream
can u touch it
can u crave it
can u bleed it
kick me when i'm down crucify me and stone me hang me out to die
dont care what i say you're making a big mistake
i woke up this morning
tic toc just look at the clock your life is passing by
excuse no use it doesnt work for me
time for a drink and no time to think
i dare you to come any closer i dare you to cross this line
i'm gonna get you i'm gonna blow
double dare will you come will i stay are you the one
so jealous cant you see
your life is a mess
my mom and dad are gone now i'm alone again
to get the ethnic cleansing done
one by one they collect the dead
find means capable of smothering a flea
retaliate
psychotic tendencies my dreams are coming true
the human remains
i'm full of lies just hold me as you die
you beg and i feed your blood is all i need
this is not an anti religious anti christian nor anti anything song it is about those hopefully few televangelists who prey and profit on the weak poor and directionless 'command' is narrated by one who is under their 'spell and one who has just freed himself from one of these cult like farces i guess those having problems should be cautious about who they turn to these days thrash
i am in command
i am in command
of the church's almighty greed
you better understand
magic man
528
no colour in the skies
to annihilate the earth i loved
opening imperilled eyes
shocked back into life
the pain inside is driving me insane
it's in the blood running through my veins
i've done it all before and i'll do it again and again
were a messenger
a reign of terror beware of the beast
a vicious surrender i'll eat you alive
knight jumps queen so get prepared
knight jumps queen so get prepared
knight jumps queen so get prepared
boiling water i cant wait
kraf dinner
airwoven divinity mind soul in victory
airwoven divinity mind soul in victory
approaching her i chilled to stone for it did swiftly rise
well they asy you're an animal
got to cool the fire control desire
the temperature falls
this title comes from the british phrase 'at sixes and sevens' meaning 'at a point of disorder or confusion' i think a lot of people will be able to relate to these lyrics which describe a period in my life where everything was in confusion without direction and giving up was the easy way out the moral of the story 'everything works out in the end if you really want it to'
disorder battles control
another drink dilutes the pain
determination
sinking fast
but you cant even look me in the eye
just maybe you're not good enough for me
and i've seen right through your disguise
it's time to put you on your shelf
c'mon and drop to the knees
slipping into madness cant deny the blame
airwaves as deadly as can be
just let the feeling surround you and it will set you free
dream away dont wait for the night
give me more speed
i know exactly what i need
stonewall go to bat
the power of corporations spewing chemicals into the air
you know my cause so dont turn your
i kill for god and i kill for power
of grafuitous violence hazerdous to your health
the edge i'm walking a fine line
because there's only one thing taking care of me
the edge
welcome to the fun palace
trapped inside
because of you
it's only a dream
tricks and traps never let'em get to you they'll
drag you down down to the bottom tricks and traps
you better beware
cause if they catch me i'm going straight to hell
i'm alone in the darkness and i think i'll stay
some wont fight the battle is forsaken
it's proof of evil in our souls is this the tempter's intent
i'm tired of all the noise tired of alll the pain
wash them away and they'll end without a doubt
tactual hallucination cockroaches infest the wall
tetanus shot be sure it's not i wish i were at school
moral physical decay hatred withered away
welcome to your death
so slip right in sip the wine
it's all a bunch of lies
they're melting right before my eyes city of ice
it's all a bunch of lies
why did all the lovin turn to anger
i'm like a zombie like a vegetable
cause you're a liar you're a bad child
and those who follow me i'll give you strength and might
down down down you must go down
set the world on fire
no friend to me
why must we all be so unkind
it's me that makes you hate me
when all this hate starts to explode
with what i say and what i do
tell me a story will ya will ya
in the closet
leave out any secrets hiding in the
his life is ruined but no not yet
any skeletons and all your other sins
bridge
woh oh an oh it's time to
woh oh oh my grief turns to anger
the horror of it all
there's no place left to hide
shock
a childhood's end it's lunacy
you're no good misunderstood air
break right through the wall that separates us all
you should be happy
i smell like both of us you smell like both of us
i try to imagine the best place i've been
sometimes i tell myself that things are ok
about what you've become
i'm gonna breakdown
i'm giving up my memory of what this used to be
power yes power
commit cold blooded murder
among the living
united they can battle back
i am the walkin dude
for an evil mans desire
i can see all the world
your mother made a monster now get the hell out of my house
what is it caught in a mosh
cold sweat my fists are clenching
or suffer for your words
cant stand it for another day
soldiers racing to the fight
you can see it in my eyes
you're a train ride to no importance
or just rebuild a new design
you're in love with hell existence
i've been a mark of injustice
anger shows on my face
the lion inside of me is no longer tame
it's been so many years
we're dangerous down to the last
leaving questions in my head
when your clock is up
what you gambled on
to face myself and everything else
in their face you
law and they cant hold you
death not suicide
change
hold onto your ideas
life can be a real ball
446
how could you dare to be so bold
welcome to the belly of the beast
it's killing 'cause it's from the heart
one mind one voice
but how do you accept this fate
this is the belly of the beast
you did
carrying the weight of the world
you give of yourself but your angels are gone
my love for you knows no distance
take me to
the one thing you cant give
what do you do when something dies
blood on your hands blood in my eyes
brother on brother on
brothers in blood
blood i cant keep blood circumscribes
brothers in blood
how do you get the blood off
brothers in blood

vice versa it's the same
dont assume and damn it dont praise me
if one day you'd backed up a promise you made
when did you treat anyone fair
i question your authority
i was never even a fan
you're in total control and you're still a liar
you're in total control and your faith is still
i'm in i'm out
and all these years i was the hard man
i put it out there it comes back

raging on the warpath storming through the town
feel the point of the blade
do i hate you
looking at me
stop stop stop stop
all this hatred
all this hatred
and do you think i really care
you may not know this
you left when you dropped the bomb
i move into harms way
i get off on laughing
i cant wait to get you back
cause there aint too much of that down here
just waiting to turn into satans slave
i bash my head against the wall everyday
cant look like you
what'd you expect me to give
dont have a clue
how many ways can you try
they call him judge his last name is dredd
and mega city was bombed to the floor
and you wont fuck around no more i am the law
and any crime committed is a sin
commit a crime i'll lock the door i am the law
your iso cube is waiting when he brings you in
because in mega city
that i really never had a gun
black is back all in we're gonna win
listen for the lessons
they call themselves black
soul control
beat is for sonny bono
to exist terminator x it
plead the fifth we can investigate
lines form from the ups and downs
dont always know what i'm talking about
yes i like it
i'm eighteen
you cant tell me not to quit that's it
only
swinging moods that change
only
i cant contain myself
by the one way out strange voice shouts
they all got afraid 'cos i'm the living proof
friday night you're staying at home i want you
caught in the strugle tight on the rod i want you
be careful where you tread
you told him what i was about my cover was completely blown
that may be the way i look but it's no longer what i am
i'm on my way i'm making it
i've been stretching my mouth
big time big time
and always they're amazed
big time big time
and my mouth
port elizabeth weather fine
with only one colour dead
yihla moja yihla moja
and the darkness still has work to do
in the blood of eden
is that a dagger or a crucifix i see
oh for a moment of forgetting a moment of bliss
and the woman in the man
i feel the man in the woman
extra lyrics from the film mix
in search of you i feel my way though the slowest heaving night
wont you please talk to me
from nippled skin as smooth as silk the bugles blown as one
now your future's so defined
all the barriers blown away
i said please talk to me
memories stir
i have my fears
i cry until i laugh
so it doesnt own me
something in me dark and sticky
just drive the car
to find the places i got hurt
to find the places i got hurt
you're still looking for the resurrection
come up to me with your what did you say
no fight left or so it seems
though i saw it all around
dont give up
dont give up
moved on to another town
dont give up
get back we dont have time
to make it alive
the guys to get in place
i wont be easy prey trying to find a way to make it alive
i'm looking for lost angeles
i want to be alone
the streets are lined with camera crews
they wont see me or the gun
as i burn into your memory cells
i dont care what you do
all turned quiet i have been here before
the water levels getting low something ugly's going to show
for anne sexton
lets take the boat out
wear your inside out
to the priest he's the doctor
looking for mercy
she leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella
pity when i have so much passion
opened up the door and walked outside
when all that you had has all gone
now we're busy making all our busy plans
and more than this
much more than this
i'm alone
ah look at that crowd
somebody sent the subversive element going to chase it out of down
mother please is it just a disease that has them breaking all my laws
making me tense to watch the way she breed
fear fear she's the mother of violence
unlock the door wipe my feet clean
oh my head sounds like that
what's left out and what's left in
i'm so hungry all the time
i will call any number
they eat anything that moves
night after night
i know that i'm drawn in
against the paleness of your skin
dont leave me here again i feel your pulse i hold your hand
there's no one else
in the land of the blind
there's safety in numbers
but you know how it is
on the air
oh it's not easy
these battered wings still kick up dust
i hear you calling me
only us x8
oh gaia if that's your name
chorus
pouring down all over me
they tell you that this rain can sting and look down
to return again and again
no more denial
red rain coming down
over me
cut up land each house a pool kids wearing water
the fear
we will breathe of the air
so i watch you wash your hair
chorus
shaking it up
waiting your time you're more than just a wife
they can support you when you're on your way
and you do nothing wrong nothing wrong at all
and in this place can you reassure me
when all things beautiful and bright
you know that's it
lost my time lost my place in
reaching into the deepest shade of
sky blue
crying out from my heart
you could have a big dipper
open up your fruitcage
sledge sledge sledgehammer
you've been coming through
it's what we're doing doing
dont get me wrong i'll be strong
i get cold you get hot
darlin we've got to trust in something
standing stretching every nerve
open doors would soon be shut
back home
i'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
give me steam
you know your sinner from your saint
stand back
you know your ladder from your snake
room shake earthquake
this steam
aah coming alive x2
all we did and said
i want to be clear
i can get so scared
i cant help but listen
one girl at the bar
'til the red light says 'on air'
the more you know the show will scored
'my lover stole my girlfriend'
dysfunctional excess
no man is a sea
where people say the things that they really mean
curves are still upon the hinge
desires form in subtle whispers
who loves the day but lives another
all the doors are shut
high up on the red rock
the rhythm is inside me
we spit into out hands
smash the watch
excellent birds
i'm sitting by the window
i can see it now
i see pictures of people
i pray the snow goes be bad if it settles
i'm gonna have me some fun
walk through the fire
darkness heavy on my shoulder
while the building crashes
walk on down below walk on down below
hold on hold on
to the talking room it's not surprise
hold on you have gambled with your own life
and i will do what i can do
thought that i could get along
let your waters reach me like she reached me tonight
river oh river river running deep
we do what we're told
in god we trust
and she comes out like a white shadow
if looks could kill they probably will
it's a knockout
all the walls close in on me
looking for a place to live
make the empire state look high
my ghost likes to travel so deep into your space
my ghost likes to travel
moving inside
the signals grow on radios
they were getting older sons and daughters
drink up dreamers you're running dry
we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
called it home sweet home home sweet home
just a place to take a rest just a place to make a nest
about in our home sweet home
empty my mind i find it hard to cope
as below so above
came the bright scar
i dont remember
stop staring at me like a bird of prey
i got no memory of anything at all
it's just the way that you would tied in
and i cant handle this
in all the dogs and cats
and life carries on and on and on and on
i'm waiting for ignition i'm looking for a spark
shake those hands shake those hands
shake those hands shake those hands
love i get so lost sometimes
in your eyes
in your eyes
without a noise without my pride
in your eyes
got every spare part but there aint much heart inside here
beyond the indigo indigo
darling please just hold my hand
slipping the clippers through the telephone wires
see me a big woman big woman caught in a trance
watching for the different eyes they change your face
burning burning with the kiss of life
c'mon x6
running through my skin
dont you know that this tongue can kill
get your prince x2
sat in the corner of the garden grill with plastic flowers
hidden spies
working in gardens thornless roses fat men play with their
i am willing lay your hands on me
'spect you watch those trees
when it's all gone much too far
yes i love to be loved
i want to be wanted
and i let go x2
'cause i love to be loved
cover me through the fire
there is one thing you must be sure of
cover me when i breathe
shock the monkey
close your eyes and wish that it were
brett is in the bathtub
with his three coned cap
wendy's on the windowsill
he carries a martini
softly sing sweet songs
softly sing sweet songs
perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
they hang on emotions they bottle inside
you'd bring home the groceries
she's bitchin again
i'm sick and tired of your childish behavior
she's bitchin again
for when my hand was holding hers
i see them through a crystal haze
that time and once again i'm bouncing round the room cont
then this one is for you
there's no one that you care to meet
it performs my daily functions
before you slip into the night
a dust arose and clogged my nose
the septic maidens gargoyle tooth
and caused a mighty stir
i turned the blade back on the bitch
a cushion convector a pitcher of nectar
confuse what you can of the ending
all my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
to rush and never waste the day
now i'm convinced the whole day long
i'm checkin 'em out
a lot of ghosts and a lot of houses
i will find a city
i've got it figured out
find yourself a city to live in
and i realized i love you
you get a little bit
you will reap what you sow
digging for a dime
she was overdosed on valium
sucking cherry charms blowpops
driving home to mom and dad
but ask me and i'll do anything for you
because you deserve better and once i was it
but when i think it's time to leave it all behind
i try to find a way but there's nothing i can say to make it stop
his grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks
til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see
through the window of the church a storm began to rage
floating higher over the hills and the valleys and treetops
puppet on her rump
as esther stood and shook her head
as the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep
we're just a bunch of monkeys
would you like to be in my family picture
just hop into the picture
it isnt nearly fast enough for you
and asking you to help me make it
when all my thoughts and memories are
if you overpray
always just a moment late
and peel my fingers off the rim
group of loyalists approaching from their lakeside encampment below
raid
leave it on press 2x
taboot
and she sold all her pills
but to her faithful whisky bottle she clings
crab in my shoemouth
and the people all watching enjoy a good laugh
i am a prince i have it all
i'd jive and strive to stay alive
no i'm no nice guy me no are no nice guy
this is the end
the old man knows very well
oh i heard he walked miles from the little mound
my friend my friend he's got a knife
my friend my friend the clever ruse
my friend my friend he's got a knife
and with you i'd also travel thin
i just went about my business
did you brush your teeth
the city cars just keep on rolling along
it was one of a kind and i'm sayin if you're to blame
i'll call the lord and he'll put you in the pen
oh to be prince caspian afloat upon the waves
reba press a razor to a slide cross a needle with a prune
tie a cable to a tree
picked up a jar unscrewed the top
coconuts and chloroform
the revolutions over baby now
the revolutions over baby
and coasting a terrace approaching a rift
and gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge
consume me and strengthen my will to appease
of darkness and of light
secretly afraid
with all their willies and their wares
the simple smiles and good times seem all wrong
and it walked the path
she felt the fire against her neck
they walked into her cabin shack
you say that i am selfish
you have not won your race
and the home of the free
is that when you're there you cant even tell
when you're not i follow you and always go astray
divine creation hears me and he squashes me with fear
we've got it simple
and we've got a saxophone in the band
and we play be bop in the band
see the city see the zoo
confuse you say this isnt me
fikus dreamed a dream for me
none of this was charged to me
fluff went to a banker
hellborn elfchild roadhog mountain fortune hunter
rabid victim martyr stranded
and i'm falling
meandering from sand to glass
i've lost my way
i see the path ahead of me
i'm floating in the blimp a lot
for this was my big secret
i guess i just stopped needing him
i look into the finance box
cause he runs so fast
i rowed upstream to find lenore
expanding exponentially like some recursive virus
so maybe i could be a fly
he's planning a family vacation
in a hot sand or in a my feet
remembering to check on the sausage
i'm bouncing like a newborn elf
thank you mr miner 5x
and you'll be left alone oh baby
tell me i'm your very own
take me to another place she said
can lift me up and spin me around
the source was quite invisible the ever present voice
my double wants to pull me down
and he headed down to new orleans
hey hey
jesus left chicago
what's that
i think that i know what i havent known yet
i came out on top by the luck of the draw
the dreams that i once had
and i dont have a crown
the emperor of emptiness
that my feet tread upon
to grow with them spindles the mutant i seize
was it for this my life i sought
i sank in hillsides deep
the crowd intrudes all day
the filter that surrounds your thoughts
and holds out lessons left untaught
i'm down and i will drag you along and around
`cause what it's doing to me is fine
into things i could be
the divided sky chant is part of an ancient ritual dating back to the
sky
grasp a kettle top and shoot the breeze please
you're gonna be a genius anyway
and they're pushing me further from shore
and hitchhiked to the beach
jimmy holds the tannis root
bark a scruff and go to jail
ohin at least as many years
take the highway through the great divide x2
on the way upwards the colors come back
or sink just below all the churning and froth
and to invite a new game of cants
a flickering lantern lit up on the tracks
the train whistle melody woved through the trees
the second that he saw her
of the swiss miss girl
and i'm a wealthy man
just to put him in his place
of the swiss miss girl
i'm tired of waiting
should've been canceled long ago
we'll be waving our flag silly
should've been canceled long ago
wont you step into the freezer
mailed it off to your address
and mailed it off to you
dont want to be an outlaw always on the run
to hear it
come waste your time with me
i can hear you when you sigh
mother
and i'm sharing in the weekapaug groove
little prickly hairs so i can weigh them what do ya say
five pounds six pounds seven pounds
wilson

wilson can you still have fun
that's when i handed it to liz
it's the wolfmans brother
god
a child of the twentieth century
oh fee you're trying to live a life
but floyd was jealous and alone
you want to stay with milly
milly said floyd i'll make you lose your grip
and sliced him on the nipple
split open and melt
we breathe deep
they threw the locks onto the ground
as friends and neighbors turn away
i have always looked out from behind the eyes
nobody lives forever
it's only a lifetime
the seasons change
with my love by my side
i think
i think
daddy's gone across the ocean
teacher leave those kids alone
all in all you're just another brick in the wall
a snapshot in the family album
all in all it's just another brick in the wall
if you dont eat yer meat you cant have any pudding
daddy's gone across the ocean
teacher leave those kids alone
all in all you're just another brick in the wall
shopping in sharp shoes
i catch her by the eye then i stop and have to think
she's on the run
walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
what a funny thing to do 'cause i'm feeling very pink
down by the river side
on the wall hung a tall mirror
oh arnold layne
on the wall hung a tall mirror
oh arnold layne
new car caviar four star daydream
money so they say
mother should i run for president
ooo babe
mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
instrumental
and that is how i know
i've got wild staring eyes
there's too many home fires burning
not now john
but it fits on here like thisss
or it could be reusable shows
and would'nt maggie be pleased
what do you do to make ends meet
dont accept that what's happening
we could find that we're all alone
no more turning away
god this place is bigger than our apartment
like the skin on a dying man
tight as a tourniquet
or contemplate a silent freeway
what do you do to make ends meet
no hint no word her honour to defend
that binds a life for life
that binds a life for life
make their stand
what a way to spend that evening
she would very much like to go out to a show
i open the door to an empty room
playing the game
she sees through anyway
the path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
doctor strange is always changing size
the path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
doctor strange is always changing size
you gotta be crazy you gotta have a real need
you'll get the chance to put the knife in
so have a good drown as you go down all alone
everything is turned at the sun
who was ground down in the end
oh babe
why are you running away
comes willowing across the sand
and do i take you by the hand
inviting and inciting me to rise
all that you taste
all you create
all that's to come
moon glow
i feel my dawn is near
i'm so new
i hear strange sounds
i will see the sunshine show
waiting here
moon glow
summer evening birds are calling
and if you hear as the warm night falls
and if you hear as the warm night falls
the sound of music in my ears
sing to me sing to me
sing to me sing to me
i look down hear the sound of the things you said today
instrumental
sleeping on a dandelion
but i can you
sleeping on a dandelion
but i can you
so all aboard for the american tour
and who says the hunt has begun
and maggie over lunch one day
apparently to make him give it back
did you did you hear the falling bombs
mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
she wont let you fly but she might let you sing
ooooowaa mother will she break my heart
mother did it need to be so high
ooo
good bye
did you did you hear the falling bombs
goodbye
this is not your domain
all around me
all around me
in the sky a bird was heard to cry
golden sunflakes settle on the ground
golden sunflakes covering the ground
she lay in the shadow of the wave
if you negotiate the minefield in the drive
and if i show you my dark side
would you send me packing
home for incurable tyrants and kings
and now adding colour a group of anonymous latin
wasters of life and limb
he wore a scarlet tunic
look at the sky look at the river
about a little man
fresh air at last
and then one day hooray
i'll go mine
all i want to tell you
but in the space between the heavens
and as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
you can relax on both sides of the tracks
what's done is done
exposing every weakness
and even now part of me flies
the banners and flags hung on everyones door
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
and if you want to stay for a little bit
when the nights will be as on that morning
instrumental
and you know you cant delay
before you the night is beckoning
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
and if you want to stay for a little bit
when the nights will be as on that morning
whe i saw the lady smile
one day i will catch her eye she is calling from the deep
for to fly soaring high above the breezes
floating down the sound resounds around the icy waters underground
laughter echoes in your eyes
heavy hung the canopy of blue
and i'm much obliged to you for making it clear
i'll do my loving in the winter and the sea isnt green
you put on your brave face and slip over the road for a jar
behind brown and mild eyes
backwards and home bound
by a country style
a man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
one world one soul
dogs of war and men of hate
one world one world
one world and we will smash it down
one world it's a battleground
the yards would still be open on the clyde
floating down through the clouds
you hear the tolling bell
and what's more no one ever disappears
in the corner of some foreign field
upon anything we did
well i've always had a deep respect and i mean that most sincerely
it's a helluva start it could be made into a monster
and even now part of me flies over
flags hung on everyones door
hey you
would you touch me
no matter how he tried he could not break free
hey you
running before time took our dreams away
dragged by force of some inner tide
the nights of wonder
i feel like a hard boiled butter man
yea
and if love bleeds like a sad song
if i were the moon i'd be cool
if i were a train i'd be late
and if i go insane will you still let me join in with the game
if you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
it would be so nice
but i would just like to say
and everybody should know better
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
upside down
it would be so nice
but i would just like to say
it would be so nice
a fight between the blue you once knew
lime and limpid green the sounds around
lime and limpid green the sound surrounds the icy waters underground
i'll spend my time
for the sad days and the bad days
i've got a bike you can ride it if you like
you're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
you're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
i'll give you anything ev'rything if you want things
you're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
the lunatic is on the grass
and if your head explodes with dark forbodings too
you shout and no one seems to hear
to hear the softly spoken magic spells
dig that hole forget the sun
look around and chose your own ground
but only if you ride the tide
flickering between the lines
the wall that once were high
oooh dont talk to me
dont try another cat
like that
please you know i'm feeling frail
i like to see you run
please you know you drive me wild
instrumental
when the change is due to come
it forms when darkness is increased by one
going and coming without error
sunset sunrise
perhaps the price is just too stepp
all the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice
in a churchyard by a river
lazing in the haze of midday
instrumental
i need some information first
i cant explain you would not understand
that'll keep you going through the show
the child is grown the dream is gone
lost in thought and lost in time
corporal clegg had a wooden leg
he's never been the same
he found it in the zoo
his boots were very clean
and the eagle flies in clear blue skys
climbing higher to the sky
footfall softly in the pines
she'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
she'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
watching the teley till all hours big time
is calling sailors to the deep
now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
rock that we sat on and watched in the sun
seamus that's the dog was outside
free games for may
float on a river forever and ever emily
you'll lose your mind and play
put on a gown that touches the ground ah ooh
all the way she smiles
she'll be selling plastic flowers on a sunday afternoon
picking up his sister he makes his way into the seas or land
another time another day she'll be selling plastic flowers on a sunday
counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
the heart of the sun
novices lean on each other in yearning
witness the man who raves at the wall
there may be dogs about
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
lo we shall rise up
remember when you were young you shone like the sun
threatened by shadows at night and exposed in the light
and we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
come on you boy child you winner and loser come on you miner for truth and
you reached for the secret too soon you cried for the moon
the black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
'cause life's not unkind he doesnt mind
the black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
i didnt mean to let them take
ooo
on the thin ice of modern life
the prisoner who now stands before you
the bleeding hearts and artists
i hope they throw away the key
why'd he ever have to leave me
there's no need for the jury to retire
theme beat version
and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
when i come in cold and tired
and i suffer premonitions
could be the human race is run
finally i understand
god only knows it's not what we would choose to do
it's a battle of words
for want of the price of tea and a slice
so i've changed my dear and i find my knees
vegetable man
in my paisley shirt i look a jerk
and a big pin a little hole
does anybody here remember vera lynn
walk on by
waiting to put on a black shirt
all you have to do is follow the worms
i've spent too long
i'm creeping back to life
clear through the clouds that covered me
ourselves again
you dreamed of a big star he played a mean guitar
you're so hard to please
you can have anything you want
what shall we use to fill the empty spaces
do tours of the east
train dogs
in search of more and more applause
break up homes
bury treasure
as the other ranks held back
with gold leaf and all
from the royal fusiliers company c
when he asked that his men be withdrawn
it was i recall
when the tigers broke free
so so you think you can tell heaven from hell
how i wish how i wish you were here
point me down the right line because it's time
turn to speak but you're alone
and i grabbed it with both hands
however did it come to this
he has fought and he has died
as he fades into the setting sun
ooo babe set me free
with cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time
do you think we should be closer
and i never knew we could be so thick
and i love the queen
will the scaly armadillo
will she let the weeping willow
will the following footsteps catch me
i think i should speak now why wont you talk to me
why wont you talk to me i feel like i'm drowning
well i'm a king bee
when you hear me buzz little girl
buzzing around your hive
you know some stinging's going on
a flight of fancy on a windswept field
a soul in tension that's learning to fly
there's no sensation to compare with this
made contact with the human race
was lucy in the sky oh oh did you ever know know
descending on a point of flame
the service men were heard to sigh
i was caught in the cauldron of hate
when the right one walks out of the door
always sitting by your side
somewhere anywhere
ginger ginger jennifer gentle you're a witch
hiding around on the ground
i'm in love with you lucy
seen is oh so broken up about you lucy
i'm in love with you lucy
seen is oh so broken up about you lucy
with silver eyes the scarlet eagle
a thousand misty riders climb up
tell me more
hanging in my infant air
yes they did
party sequence
and i know that you care for me
through the boredom and pain
and any fool knows a dog needs a home
what do you hope to find
you're hot stuff with a hat pin
you gotta stem the evil tide
and hide with me baby
point me at the sky and tell it fly
a little refuge on my brain
and i've finished my beautiful flying machine
pointing to the cosmic glider
while the people around you breathe in
nobody cry it's good bye
leading the blind while i stared out the steel in your eyes
instrumental
try to catch the sun
a day when you were young
try to catch the sun
instrumental
from your guilty past
and keep your dirty feelings deep inside
there were too many spaces in the line
white upon the slippery reins
over the edge for yonks been working me buns off for bands
midnight blue burning gold
a yellow moon is growing cold
we met just six hours ago
tomorrow brings another town another girl like you
i hardly even like you
i felt the cold far too soon in a wind of ninety five
instrumental
we were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire
until i couldnt see the danger or hear the rising tide
gold is lead

will shine down gently on the two of us tonight

i lost my heart
that blue eyed girl

all that time it cannot be
oh my eyes it cannot be
i thought it was worth waiting
you put right in my face
you leave me dry
easy

i'm in ecstasy
dawn there waiting right outside
along comes the wind
bearing leaves
i cry again
and i was really in love
some bird of paradise

you came from heaven and came here to me and i love you
stella marie you're my star

place for heroes only
i kiss her gown
do you remember the first kiss
to heart from mine
and i draw a line
come over
plants and rags
white and black
outside and they lead us out quietly
i dreamt of a man
white and black
outside and they lead us out quietly
once held secret
that was my veil
no more secret
but i cant learn the same
and i gave him my peace
over this dead mans bay
i cant believe what the lord has finally sent me
and my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
bring peace to my black and empty heart
disaster
the heat and
i'm breathing
i see something missing
faster
and he was singing a sad love song
and he came knelt down before him
he was thinking of his sins
the curve of my g
lick and lick it
your beautiful pen
someone outta rinse it out with soap
you're gonna be left alone
can you hear them
the city sun sets over me
the city sun sets over me
the sin and
i went out to the deep northwood
please dont make my wedding dress
how the world slips by so fast
i just wanna make my own fuck ups
throw your pain in the river
and we called it a home
thinking of nothing and the shooting stars
shine on my own beautiful prayer
love the drug i'm needing
could you be my calling
still the question lingers
speak to me
city people
speak to me
heaven and earth
catherine liked high places
and torture on the wheel
she must be so lonely
this is love this is love

when i got my healer by my side
and i'm saved
pj harvey when he said to me
abe said what
howard just pointed with his gun
highway
they were out on that highway 61
abe said man you must be putting me on
howard said there's only one place i know
just take them down on that 61
and said mmmm you're right let me tell the second mother it's been done
and have it out on that 61
with a halo of deep black
she cant feel she's no queen
like waves like the sea
silent i have pulled myself clear
i gave you my number
you just roll me over
and then she just left and
pavement
and there were clowns and elephants dancing bears and a beautiful lady in pink
we'd take long walks down by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each
cause i know just as well as i'm standing here talking to you
as he gathered me in his arms
let's break out the booze and have a ball
i had the feeling that something was missing
with the most wonderful boy in the world
is that all there is to love
i know what i'll be saying to myself
the sun dressed the trees in green
to lift us higher
is this desire
and i go kissing
you've got me lying
when i'm not with you i walk dark tunnels of my heart
clear the shit out of my eye
when i'm trusting that head ache tree
'would have left these red hills long ago if not for my condition
she wanted to go blind

i wanna be your toy
stuck inside the circumstances lonely at the top
shoulders toes and knees i'm 36 degrees
every mink walks two by two
the light dividing
the light defining
give up this fight there are no second chances
these bonds are shackle free
too long
too long
too long
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and i've got no right to take my place
in the human race
none of you can make the grade
none of you can make the grade
i was never faithful
and i was never one to trust
she's insane this friend of mine
hear her calling
with armageddon crawling
running on black market blood
and i say thank you
i read a book about uncle tom
said i should get expensive help
i wrote this novel just for you
i'll be watching when he's around
i'll be watching when he's around
now your lover went and put me in the ground
trying to be ruthless in the face of beauty
it's either you or me

et maintenant tant d'efforts pour une si simple erection
il reve de lendroit a la plus belle selection
things arent what they seem
hey you
chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
he never scores he just gets an infection
things arent what they seem
dreams of a place with a better selection
hard to breathe i try and try i'll get asphyxiated
always goes against the grain and i can try and deny it
it's a remedy
then you'll die you'll die dont die dont die
but if you dont change your situation
please
the poppy bird's way
with eskimo chain
and a horn of plenty
baby's looking to get laid
each tourniquet colliding
days before you came repeat
the big big blue
the big big blue
my body's broken yours is bent



instead of stressed i lie here charmed
every me and every you
every me and every you
there's nothing here but what here's here's mine
and stuff it in my mouth and chew it up with my little teeth
slowing down the metronome
slowing down the metronome
means and lies and hatreds
i just turn on the tv
'cause he's dancing with his ego
careful not to give your favours
fights the rust that
in his eyes
to your iq to your id
hang on hang on
i'm lonely
everybody goes
dont be afraid
you're a wasted face
i know the past will catch you up as you run faster
i know the past will catch you up as you run faster
mary counts walls knows he tires easily
johnny feels he's wasting his breath trying to talk sense to her
snook your way backstage
all seen better days
coursing on your brain
how's that for gratitude i apologize
it seemed to last for hours
he spends the afternoon between your thighs
she stole the keys to my house
she beats me harder than any kind of guy
une presence inconnue
an ambiguous presence
an ambiguous presence
miss moneypenny
miss moneypenny
never thought i'd do you the same
never thought all this could back fire
you are the one
so before i end my day
you are the one
different partner every night
had some help from insect ways
and it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
and it all breaks down at the role reversal
got the muse in my head she's universal
you frame the photograph
or you'll end up a wreck
wake up
concentrate
can you find me space find me space
can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
it falls apart
so i had to cut the mother down
i'm in excess need of a stroke down
you god damn liar
pay check pay check
i have to climb your wall
that stole my broken soul
with every bet i lost
i'm faithless i'm scared
a friend who's dressed in leather
a friend in needs a friend indeed
and makes for stormy weather
and then she's boxing clever
careenin
i gotta place it on the rack
her younger sister had a blister
i'm a man a liar
i'm a man a liar
it echoes in my brain
slackerbitch faghag whore
slackerbitch faghag whore
you hate me now i'm sure
run away from all your boredom
a race for rats to die
run away repeat
you come on just like special k
no escaping not for free
just like i swallowed half my stash
i fall down hit the ground
queens are left for dead
feeling demonic harmonic in a no go zone
aces take your pity
queen take your chances
you look well suited like you came to win
cue to your face so forsaken
you try to break the mould
like blood from a stone
you try and break the mould
stay with me
swallow
kind of
i
marilyn
stammering
i cant remember where i put it
stay with me
change your style again
i'm killing time on valentine's
shine the headlight straight into my eyes
and still not satisfied
lay me down the lie will unfurl
and dont forget to breathe
i dont want to be forgotten
cut your eye far to me
one more time for me one more time for me
for pleasure and passion you play the price
swimming in the sea and i think i'll
for the son of man
packing all the time
i'll take it by your side
your slipping slowly from my reach
take the plan spin it sideways
if it's a bad case you're on the rampage
you're too complicated we should separate it
you dont care about us
but i still believe in love
trust
stay by my side
babe
and every poisoned word that
see the creatures of the street
i dont wanna hear you call
i'm totally left out on my own
allways ment to be yeah
wont you tell us what it's like
closer to the fire
in your eyes the wildfire rage
chorus
you're feeling the flame that burns within you
when i take off from here
chasin the red light
it's my playground my scene
right till the end of the road
of the bitter end
to give you strength to carry on
when times get tough
i never wanted it to be this way
someone dies and as we close our eyes
pay attention
if we dont
there is no true escape
wear me out
back off
hit me from behind
hurt you bad
i want you to know
the sound of metal
back to back back to back
they'll never fall
saturday night
the battle begins
chorus
and expire no more
but all in all it's just a battle of pride
there aint no other life no second chance
i just want my share of fun for sure
dont know where i'm going
there's nowhere to sleep
where is the future
are all gone so far
as the night turns everything black
no one will ever walk the streets again
but as a rescue city light
chorus
i'm down on bended knees
found the kiss of life in the fire from your breath
face to face
in ecstasy
partners in crime
she is the animal
dont loose control
we seek immortallity
determind to evade our destiny
genious or madness
i see you shake his hand while buying dreams for cash
it will enslave you for life
kill yourself to live
power seeking parasites
mirror mirror on the wall
betrayal
beneath your feet
she leaves me the fright
so queen of the night
she leaves me the fright
i'm lost in my dreams i'm caught in the game yeah
chorus
took his freedom
inside outside all the same
well they can kick they can beat
red hot and heavy we're bringin you down
rock this city down
we want it now
tv generation
though you have faith in nothing
rise up
the guns form our hands
cast away your foolish pride
i want to hear the sound of screaming guitars
rock the house
i felt the madness of people
and make it through
then i chose to head for the light
no one to interrupt my point of view
too late
religious revolution
running out
who am i to rely on a broken dream
its time for the guns
when every flame has died
dont tell me when you walk away
and so we had our ups and downs
but you've got my mind on the bend
now woman if you want me to
why dont you set your loving free
chorus
you'll never see me coming
i twist my strangle grip
and i dont really recognize myself
no one hears you cry
and now you find yourself
chorus
better pray for your soul to keep
and when you sleep at night
for the last love by shelly the maid
she'll wear purple red on her toe nail
unfaithful children
the seven deadly sins
pray for confession
as the darkest night
i have seen the nations fall
you have haunted me right since my birth
denounced me as a public enemy
dont give what you cant take back
now you beg me to forgive
you hurt my mind
to revenge my crippled soul
its time i start walking
you'll be a hard luck woman
dont cry
loosen up the child inside
chorus
it's my decision
it's a true rebellion
headlines
gonna break defences
but somehow the wind kind of pushed us this way
i shiver and i shake
magic charm
baby babe i like your dirty tricks
got to do it
when things could work out fine
stay by my side
now what're you trying to prove
i met this girl
but she glows there's something about her
i cant resist
my mean teen queen
into that poisened rain
you've been away too long
on the road to her regret
but there's some who gets nothing in return
here you whisper in the summer wind
the promises we once mad
chorus
like a mother and child
just went out to get a couple
here we are and we're for real
little miss roundheels we want you so
as i head down the road
in the minds of the young
all i found was just you and i
'cause i dont wanna face the truth
the invisible chains that eternally binds you
and nobody ever did
chorus
now you're a grown up a cool guy looking pretty
jump the gun
has taken off from the street
get out seek and find
in beirut the hate is burning
stop this madness that we're living in
seems out of reach
little darling little darling gonna love you to night
stayed out all night
i'll go the distance
fight for all it's worth
i'm gonna live it up
i'll stand up to the test
cause my motive is my lust
let go
in leather and lace
it's a long way to go
she's the one
she's so hot
two hearts out of phase
i was made for you
inside this casino of love
chorus
invaluable unusual amusing
my rising sun of love
my sweet soulsister
you think you're dreamin
love makes you strong
when it's not there
love is a miracle
but i dont believe
but i dont believe
in the final hour
please take me away
the darkness has the power and it has come to rule
you better beware your loosin control
solo
when your bets are off
trying to make a score
in the hour of darkness
no one will hear your prayers
you want me a simple man
i love i hate
in these arms
gotta sin to be saved
cover me
i'm mentally subsidin
from sinking
i'm falling of the track
chorus
chorus
there's so many ways to make love
now quickly chack the hands
suicide on prime tv
ride on to life
stern is on the air tonight
brave new world
now there's nothing that could solve our differencies
no more bitter pills
we're holding on to something we lost so long ago
no passion to be found
i recall i do remember when
without your love
now this love is like a solid rock
when it all stand still
so many lies and sweet regrets
time just keeps on rolling by
all the bad reflectionsof my life
back when i was younger
no one really understood
too late too late too loud
me and the boys are playing hard
too late too late too loud
tortured spirit haunting me
and when my better part has gone
taking over steal my soul
i feel intoxicated
contradictions
cant you hold on back
cause when the light are getting
ever since man
unholy origin
defenceless
but there aint no cure
heaven is burning
screaming in anguish
the cross of sin is hard to bare
all are we covered by blackened clouds
culture of destruction
never close your eyes
twenty first century trash
hit without a warning
right in your face
the devil always finds his way
how do we restore ourselves
on the wings of an angel
we need a cure for this disease
i swear i'll give it all i've got
we're gonna crash into love
a heart needs love
if you're feeling lost and lonely
we came to rock
we are the guardians of the night
we came to rock
father forgive me
rapin the land
in the shades of babylon
see what created
for in them is finished the wraith of god
comes around and goes around
wear no fancy suit
what buys you diamond rings
money goes around
we're blind to what surrounds us
like the stars nedd the sky
he's got nothing left to live for
i have seen many lives torn apart
taintet heart
out in the cold
save yourself
and if the sun would ever shine a little light
tears in his eyes
the eternal pain
fighting for the nations
you're just a pawn in a game
oh oh
in yellow rain
oh oh
through tears and pain she makes it day by day
a white swan in her own little world
young blood
your heart is bleeding
has broken up inside
you're a symbol of wealth and luxury
is that you're mentally ill
in the eyes of the man on the street
chorus
on its own
an ironbound demon built to destroy
and it can destroy all life on earth
cause maybe there's a killer inside
you have to fight to hold on
and shoot for the heart
hold tight
calling you somewhere
between love and hate
now that love's gone away
are we gonna make it anyway
aint giving you up
you're not supposed to do
and from the sky i fell
feel me within you
hey you could be mine
come on babe we got all night
love can be so vain
check this out
she's shooting like a rocket
down the sidewalk
she'll make your motor run
they shout in the streets of
cry for justice when you long for it
with evil tyrannic regimes
chorus
i'll free you from reality
on the wings of a dream
for a little while
in a sea of light
do you still have confidence
now you walk in the shadows
your heart is your prison
see you drown is the darkness
when there's nothing to hold on to
you're alone with your lack of
played your tricks
we rode the storm
dream on
love in the first degree
once you chilled me to the bone
minds
more than meets the eye
all over again
dreams of a lifetime
venus arising
in the eye of the storm
she
but i cant fight this feeling
you question me
come out and face me
than ride the trend
you build me up and tear me down
every word that you wrote just to hurt me
let me see
someone behind you
something compells you
dont ask me why 'cause i dont know
just a fantasy
i dont know what is going on now
take one last look and close your eyes
on through history we've come
in legends and heroes
shout at the sky and pray to
chorus
here we are facing trouble again
the slices of the past and now we're worlds apart
in the name of romance
and rediscover what it's all about
we're dragged around
we wanna live
hurt by the truth
they're all crooks
but i cant explain
or just imaginations
tonight we're riding on
left the wastelands
we heard the fools
no demands
i'll send the fight my pride is victory
back in the light i face my destiny
in this world of promises
i relish this time and the pain
fear and terror mutilate
we're sick of all your lies
battalions of hate gloryfied crime
504
and there's nothing you can do
and you cant breathe no more
you will bleed for me
chorus
defeating the enemy's pride
solo
chainbreaker
what are they fighting for
sowing the seeds of discord
there's no democracy
359
gold and honey
if dollars were dirt
if dollars were dirt
see the truth
lightning struck on the wings of chrome
there is hate in the eye of an eagle
with 1000 miles an hour
uncompromising fighter a warrior of liberty
you are the hero you're born to win
the world lives in pain
never on the loose
i came back tonight
what is this my final moment
i'm waiting `till midnight
we saw smoke in the sky and fear in their eyes
were everywhere seen the state of emergency
pole position i'm on the top prepared to win
i'm overtaking setting the pace
showers of champagne are running down my neck
455
take my vengeance
and i swear to myself i gonna get you
and i swear to myself i gonna get you
to live in the past
to many years i have wasted
every night i dream the same old frightning nightmare
we better seperate ways or hate is getting stronger
about to spill
i need a spell and a charm
i'm no pawn so be gone
my agony was not a reason to bertay
suit up for destruction the kiss of death
living for metal you keep us going
living for metal we hear you roaring
watching this planet
one nation in fear
nation in fear
enter darkness and thrills
as i hit the trace a love's changing face
will you forgive me
i never meant to hurt you
a look into your eyes can heal me
i felt the blood in my veins
into the light we are guided by our own destiny
forever we will follow the light
as we can see on our last flight
you'll go through agony
machinery
cant you see that we play to kill
the colours of my soul
a place of pride and dignity
chorus
in a place called the promised
there's no more creeping there's no return and no compromise
the tunnels end the candle doesnt burn anymore
and i cant find no comfort here
their faces switch from friendly to attack
i'm settled for peace now step out of insanity
running in the dust
beyond imagination
and if you miss me it's too late
where do we go destination unknown
burned and marked forever now but where

move move quick you've gotta move
if we get through this alive i'll meet you next week same place same time
the smell of your dress a face in the rain the pavement shines wet
and your hands leave their marks in the sand they last for ever
to a grey and sunless sky your voice still slithers in my head
your body a legend from a forgotten year
oh what have you done to earn this prize
goodbye blue girls goodbye would it be too much to cry
i watch as you pass me by
i wish i could find you
say you'll meet me tonight
and boats and trains and

and i dont know what it's like to be young
just leave the light on so i can see you've got everything i need
and the nights on the town
watch tv on your own arent you the one with your razzmatazz
and now you're going to a party and you're leaving on your own
the sun reflecting off the water on your face the way you drove your car

and there is no one there no one to hear her voice
oh and he thinks how much better off he is without her hanging round
there is cancer in his cigarettes and the drinks wont do a thing for him
her body screams for love
candida quoting from some book
and like some kind of chain reaction
the sun rose from behind the gasometers at six thirty am
oh that's all i wanna do ow
oh babe oh i'm sorry
i didnt want to come here in the first place
that's all i wanna do
and listen i wandered the streets the whole night crying trying to pick up your scent
everyone on park hill came in unison at four thirteen am
love wont last 'til next installment ten o'clock on tuesday evening
are you trying to put me on i turned around and it was gone
selling pictures of herself to german business men
everybody cant you see she's coming back to me
i dont know why you pretend that it causes you pain
oh yeah i went with other women what else can i say
you've got to understand she's not really breathing no not at all
yeah she's going for good and i'd love to go with you but i never would
oh lalalala lalala
you will never cut you will never cut the threads of your reliance
i hate the sight of the face i have destroyed through our alliance
a place for everything and of course all you can do is talk about it
yes you knew it all
you're screaming for mercy and then you awaken
but the light comes and the day bleeds through the sky the sun
someone should have helped her through the day
why did i write this song on that day
and when his daddy would visit he'd come along
yes he was he was oh yes he was
was the son of a preacher man
was the son of a preacher man
'cause all this has just got to mean something
oh then you come down just keep on moving
somewhere in a field in hampshire
tonight travelling at the speed of thought
but we're weightless floating free
yeah space is cold when you're on your own
i know you're gonna go too far
and you've always got somewhere to go
places to go and faces to kiss and boys to confuse
on the back seat on the top deck talk dirty on the back row
while the cars drive by en route to dried up dinners
could you tell that i was watching did it make it feel better
in a way that things that arent supposed to feel good sometimes do
after many weeks in the wilderness we came upon a strange exotic life
and on and on and on and on and on
why'd you have to rise ruin all my fun
i've not seen her for a long time
please stop asking
i know it's too late now
she's got long black hair if you go home now she might still be there
the sun was bright the air was cool
yeah the birds in your garden have all started singing this song
if you wait 'til tomorrow she'll no longer be there
if you're quiet you can watch if you like
i love the way you put them on
the answer was here
you cant get anyone to come in the sack
is that you are frightened of
the mark of the devil is upon you
smiles left unfollowed start to haunt you
la la lala lala la la
when all should be done and gone he comes round again to see
he touches her hand and it starts again
stop scratching or it'll never heal just let it lie in peace

just another song 'bout single mothers and sex
what was written on the letter i posted yesterday
sleep on my love sleep on my darling sleep on my love
are the incense at the funeral procession here today
curtains drawn tight against the cold night air
you yawn once turn on your side and fall to sleep again
waiting
and we kiss to violins
but dont you remember that you once said that you liked happy endings
if you leave him on his own
one time they were just like you
when did you first realise
and it's such a lonely place
though we know that it's wrong towel sets matching combs
oh it made me feel better oh now it's gone too far we gave up hope
what made me frightened and i said
oh are we going to do it again shove it in sideways
i love my life i love my life
i lost my keys when i stayed at your place
that's right you're in the land of the living but there's so few signs of life
it may look to the untrained eye
how i will blow your paradise away away away ooh
smoking your cigarettes drinking your brandy
your ladbroke grove looks turn me on yeah
i'll hold your body and make it sing again come on sing again let's sing again
i couldnt make a sentence i couldnt even say what i meant to say
when you lapse into a friend
fit in the space that i provide you i'll take you
curse my pride curse my stupid pride because i want you

she sits on the back seat
torrentially and it sounds like someone has emptied
later she was sick because she drunk too much cider
she wasnt too bothered though she hated the smell of the rabbits anyway
well she had that alright
i cannot pretend nothing's wrong
decision is harder to take

you'd never do that to me would you baby
i watch you bleed
to another town where maybe they could see things in your way
how long has it been come on in now wipe your feet on my dreams
you are the dream i never should have caught
when he's given the rest to sommetaeone with long black hair
and you feel such a fool for laughing at bad jokes
you had it once but now it's gone
you had it once but now it's gone oh yeah
but his look's enough to murder you see what you've done and forget about the paintings
there's a hole in your heart and one between your legs
it didnt get much rest at first the headboard banging in the night yeah
'cos it never makes a sound
to last you all through the years
maybe down in lonesome town
the same as those i keep with me
yes i'm looking for life
and i thought it was my heart but then i realised
no oh it must be getting near now that you just dont know
i never leave this room no
'cos 'cos i own this town
yeah you came too soon now
you dont have to care
oh i'm gonna get on through babe
yeah i'm gonna leave this town
raise your voice in celebration
i used to do the i ching
now they expect you to clean toilets
you dont need anybody else
and she is mine
oh i dont know why
in the morning it was all still there
and you eat their insides
and tell me when the spaceship lands
in the middle of the nite it feels alright but then tommorow morning
'cause i seem to have left an important part of my brain somewhere
the will to power the force of destiny and efficiency
where's the fanaticism where's truth and beauty
the only choice the only voice
i know what you're thinking i know what you want to say
so i spent a night without you oh yes i spent a night outdoors
there's no love no love left in your body standing empty forever
and this they saw as love
night time lies so hollow and memories betray
i wonder if she's living there the way that i recall
i threw it away
he sees the wall
he hits the wall
the stars are small lightbulbs set in a black cardboard dome
this house is
he hits the floor
space time place floor wall door roof
space time place condensed
it seems i saw you in some teenage wet dream
put your money where your mouth is tonight
i cant believe that it took me this long that it took me this long
what exactly do you do for an encore 'cos this is hardcore
that your cause is right and leave them all below you bleeding as you rise into the
i had nothing to do i was bored
clean mister
you'll feel so much better afterwards
there's a brass band playing somewhere
i would lie there and see green fields and see the sky blue
to miss someone so much
so i say why pretend any longer
until the day that you say you're gonna stay
cos once it's underway there's no escaping the fact that you're a girl and he's a boy
he's standing much too near and how the hell did you get here
we're in the place so shut yer face you got no choice
because we're not so sure no we're not so sure oh no we're not so sure
no sooner has the first blooming begun than decay sets in
if only they can market this stuff right
because we got no homes they call us smelly refugees
we'd like to get you out of your mind
and it seemed to be so strange this sudden facial change
and so i rest my case i dont want another's face
oh ring dum a doo dum a da wept for my daddy o
for about six or maybe seven in walked captain farrell
ahlalalala lalala
nougat yeah nougat caramel
and then after what seemed like hours of thinking about it
but that this custom had died out when someone jumped
but if we go just another mile we will surface surrounded by grass trees the fly over that takes the cars to cities
wherever it wants us to go
distractions cannot sate the need it grows once more it grows once more
but i dont think that you know how
it's easy when you stop pretending that you just got lost on the way
hey hey check out if you're still alive talking dirt wont change your life
loosen up and lay right down watch her as she's going down
oh and i just cant see why you should keep on happening to me
and i just cant see why you should keep on
and you just cant see why you should keep on happening to me
you're always hanging round you're always hanging round
oh you'll make such a beautiful body
ba ba ba ba
hey oh now the lonely nights begin and there is nowhere left to go
all alone and see your face
oh run away now
hey i feel this night will never end and i will never see the day
oh if i didnt i'm so sorry
all of my nights and all of my days
and if you grow up then when you grow up maybe maybe you can live
when questioned the man said all he wanted was a garden
and then they grow up straight and tall
oh they thought that when we grew up we'd get married never split up
thursday years ago
when i came around to call you didnt notice me at all
want you to know that i remember every single thing
oh what are you doing sunday baby
he said it was not an easy time for me but i'll get through even though
repeat
same initials
oh yeah we've grown
they have too much again and then more
oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere
oh dogs are everywhere that i go
and if you could walk away where would you go anyway
dont you know she could break you every bone that's inside of you
i've never seen you look so ugly as the way you did that night
oh no but still your voice is ringing in my ears
oh yeah oh they can stare for evermore you do not care for me
dip my toe in the water of the river where i watched you drown
dadow
and didnt i often tell you oh didnt i often say
and if you do then there's no doubt
as the signs outside proclaimed nature sometimes makes mistakes
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
wont you come with me to the fairground
the fish eyed foetus floated blankly in the yellowed waters still as wax
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
shreiking and wailing laughter
i feel as if my whole life has been leading to this one moment
it's so cold yeah it's so cold
it doesnt make no sense no it's not convenient no
while you 'n your friends are worried about me i'm havin lots of fun
countin flowers on the wall
that dont bother me at all
and i never know when i come around
the boy's no good
girl you'll be a woman soon
cant you see i need too to
you wont need a jet plane or a luxury cruise
i feel so lonely now with you gone
the thought of our disintegration is killing me
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor
raindrops taste like tears
and it's another rainy night without you
another rainy night another rainy night without you
anytimeanywhere that's allmy sweet addiction i pray will never end
michael wilton geoff tate
so we've let this happen all along
our system awaits test
all my life behind me
i dont want to be an island
i've seen the world through a bitter stare but my dream is still alive
back street hoop star you've got it good
time for some blue sky
beholding light on the spell you're under
but the night will reflect the hunger
time moves in and out of phase of everything that i face
they told me to run but just how far
i look for your face in the neon light
cant you hear me screaming
through the streets i'm screaming
time can change a thing or two
youre begging me for a brand new start trying
you say son lets forget the past
in my head i hear the song a million voices strong
mesmerized by the waves of your smile
save me success is our hunger we need to feed
peace wont last forever
treading the borders of sin
by the pain that you bring
that they must feel
see you're in the paper late today accused of something
carry me through tomorrow guide me along the way
and i wont stop tryin for change
picking up the pieces of my life
with the one that lays beside me
kings with no mercy this planet at war
who fear the law
chris degarmo scott rockenfield geoff tate
daddy left some time ago
pardon me could you spare some change
most never care to find della brown sees it all the time
mechanized and sterilized
im dis con nec ted
i'm gonna take away the questions
now i know you wont refuse
hey nikki you know everything
so take this number and welcome to
operation mindcrime
little girl sits in the corner
shouting and cursing at someone who clearly
good bye to them
standing neck deep in life
head down nose to the grindstone
heres to love hate and promises
dragging feet through sand
blinding eyes from which it hides the key
a prophecy will make its stay
there is no escape
and black is the last thing you'll see
your soul slipped away
i dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns
that there's something out there
something just out of reach
breathe deep before it's too late
cant solve the problem overnight

stop the madness
got no love for politicians
who do you trust when everyone's a crook
about the communist plan
that only america's way way was right
i used to trust the media
gotta make a change
id love to take you to see what i see there on the right side of my mind
transcend the boundaries
knowledge was it worth such torment oh
and still i'm standing here
to a place where darkened angels seemed lost and never found
never looking back to find why
we see the light of those who find
but in the night the light will guide your way
with the air of freedom the flame grows bright
a world has passed them by
so take hold of the flame
we are the strong the youth united
let go of everything open up to me
giving it all up for love i know that you feel the same way
feeling no pain i'm not the same without you
we've been here before know what i mean
your mind is open for me open for intake of all propaganda
there's more to me than what shows
cant you tell
looking for the vandals and they're nowhere to be found
on the senate floor they congregate
it was all a bad dream spinning in your head
commanding in another world
living twice at once you learn you're safe from pain in the dream domain
the magic we felt went away
there's more to life than that the expectations
while you sit there and think about it there's another
too bad people say what's wrong with the kids today
business the american way
no time no line the walls fall down
in hopes it will stifle the fear
master of nations revealed
the blackness surrounding the borders of hope
page dr david telephone please dr david
i see your face looking back at me
no happy ending like they've always promised
how many more lies will they tell me
today is just the same as any other day to me
some days its easy just like falling down
now it's time to get a life you gotta get a life gotta get a life
this is my life
i dial your telephone each and every afternoon
what do i know about you how did i find out
my voice fell useless you flashed a quick hello
it's a long way to fall
hand on heart

grain of sand in traffic jam and i'm late
dont know what i said living to be dead on the run
feel it numb the brain take away the pain
profit in the wind
id been around and had my share of what i thought my soul could bare but never seen what i saw in your eyes
i only know that ill be yours forever yours forever forever forever
circling panes of glass that
care to look inside i am i what may appear
so this is the way
i guess i never knew
every open hand's there to push and shove
i'll just pretend she never was real
i never have i never will
your buy from wrong
are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside
washing me rain wash over me
there's a part missing from my life
got to find my way home to her
jet city woman
the other girls are home were playing a new game
sensory perception peaking at this time
never was a smart kid never knew a good thing
im always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise
you said dont ever leave
london london the cries in the night keep bringing me to london
london london calling out to you
i see the world in a different light busy changing
sing my favorite song again and againi see the world in a different light busy changing
please leave me alone on this day
there's no sleep today i cant pretend
at the touch of a button
just let go and experience the flight
attention span in quickening
across the oceans
order of a new kind
i can hear the chimes ringing for you for me
and still the rider will unleash his chosen sin
beware of the night
the outside crowd
is this wrong i enter
does emotion hold the key
you're in a mystic space
oh no sanctuaryyou're walking halfway in
again you cry give me sanctuary
one thought one dream one world one meaning
i think therefore i am familiar to most
does language define us is reality words
roll out new scenery as per suggestion
we need to strip it all away
turn another turn
i'm bent on submission
to preach the new beginning
seven years of power
speak to me the pain you feel
speak
and johns a happy man
on the alter like a sacrifice
fighting fire with empty words
the way society
to saintly faces hallowed be their names she cant recall
my faith is growing growing tight against the seam
your precious cross is gone it made me wait so long
the hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight
we're being used and fed
the blood of christ cant heal my woundsso deep
it's their training solution
there's no turning back
distant signs of darkness on the way
throw down the chains of oppression that bind you
i remember there was a time when fears

the lady wore black
of the quiet shadowed woman
her mystic power calls to me
but for her love i'll gladly pay
beside my window
till the sister comes to wash my sins away
waiting for days longer
i'll hide away in here the law will never find me
save this world we'll all stand proud
you'll never get away
wet and raving
dont ever trust the needle when it cries
skin tight leather provides my pleasure
forbidden sin relenting
with fear as my friend i walk the thin one more time for you
cold is the viper stalking the night for the heat
free under the night sun
we've had what others might call love
i'll take you home
we'll walk in the shadows
time to cry your tears now cry
he's leaning back against the wall
oh theyve taken all i have but i just need whats left of today and you can wash it all away
here comes the rain
i suck up and buck up and fuck up
the game of us and them we play
it goes on and on this insanity
i'm upside down inside out upside down inside out
no i wont let it go
i'm going to melt the two men into one
i played by all their rules went to their right schools
i know now who i am if only for awhile
heavy with the past but somehow keeping hope
there's a path leading out to sea
how come i end up where i started
it comes to us all
wont take my eyes off the ball again
it's the devils way now
payin attention
payin attention
oh hail to the thief
but it's not
just like everybody
someone's gonna bring me 'round
you had to ruin it for all concerned
it's a drunken punch up at a wedding yeah
and if i sat down and crossed my arms
drag him out your window
takes all your credit cards
take it with the love is given
put me inside
if i squeal to the cops
dont know we're born little
steal all my children
i am born again
in an interstellar burst
i'm in the middle of your picture
i'm in the middle your picture
and glows in the dark
morning bell
yeah
cut the kids in half
anyone can play guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
i'm teetering on a breaker
so you're backtracking
what the hell we've got nothing more to lose
oh she said no go
yeah yeah
whatever gets you off
the pyramid is power
i'm taking you down when i go down
search the whole world
and the worms will eat you whole
and the worms will eat you whole
here it comes here it comes
useless rockers from england

just trying to bribe me

toilet trained and dumb

nice dream nice dream nice dream
nice dream x4
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises please let me out of here
they're not gonna happen
the best you can is good enough
the best you can is good enough
if you try the best you can
after years of waiting
after years of waiting
it is difficult to concentrate
but i'm okay how are you
i hope you're okay too
kicking and squealing gucci little piggy
from a great height
the crackle of pigskin
vanilla feel it crawl to me
darling hurts me
you can taste it but it will not form
but still
this is joy
and i miss your glow as i unsettle
well come and live with me
keep all surfaces clean
and radio has salmonella
he left this message for us
i'm better off
prove yourself
and there are secret doors
i didnt feel pain 'cause no one can touch me
a beautiful girl
now that i'm held in your spell
a beautiful girl can turn your world into dust
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
the ripples on a black shore
you've no ripcord
the answer to your prayers
and i cant put the needle in
too scared to know the reasons why
in the fake plastic earth
for girls in the eighties
it wears her out it wears her out
fingers in
for no real reason
dead from the neck up
a fit
a safer car baby smiling in back seat
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
concerned but powerless
tied to a stick
coming out to me
and i can see you now
patient
over my dead body
tip toeing tying down
that she bought from a rubber man
but gravity always wins
it wears her out it wears her out
you're turning into something you are not
you will be the one screaming out
no matter how it starts
throw your keys in the bowl
your ears are burning
and when i'm like this
when i'm like this
he wants to be loved and he wants to belong
and he steals and he bullies anyway that he can
let you out
i walk through walls
this isnt happening
and there's nothing in this world will keep it down
even though i might even thought i try i cant
i used to think
let's go down the waterfall
i used to think
if i did not have you
i say my prayers every night i promise
i will
little babies eyes eyes eyes eyes
any fool can easy pick a hole i only wish i could fall in
walk into the jaws of hell sit down stand up
stand up the rain drops the rain drops
and the mother say we spit on your son some more
rows of houses all bearing down on me
cracked eggs dead birds
all these things into position
i can feel death can see its beady eyes
and you put my brain in overload
the breath of the morning
for the folks back home
show me the world as i'd love to see it
uptight x7
i try to behave but it eats me alive
just like your dad you'll never change
where do we go from here
am i really sinking this low
they brought in the cia the tanks and the whole marines
i wanna live breathe
we are not the same as you
your alarm bells your alarm bells
shadows blue and red
everyone around here
it barks at no one else but me
hey man slow down slow down
trickster is meaningless
that we couldnt say
long white gloves
just cos you feel it doesnt mean it's there
to me x3
shit i still love you still see you in bed
when i'm not there
i'll dress like your niece
your tiny hands
i wish i could be good
trapped in hyperspace
i've been wasting my time
you're all the fucking same
i'm not a vegetable
i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
in red blue green
are you hungry
fleabitten motheaten
la x8
they turn me
and weird fishes
hit the bottom and escape
i am up in the clouds
i will eat you alive x4
anywhere i go
i resent that i dont have a choice
down your door
come on if you think
i'm so sad
you never wash up after yourself
hey the sun and moon and stars are yeah
she stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed
dont go you'll only want to come back again
i cant do this alone
we hope that you choke that you choke
i've seen too much
let me hear both sides
this is really happening happening
i cried out to break the spell
i'm sorry that i lost control
and sailed on shooting stars
i'm the first in the irish sea
i've lost my way
before your baying hounds
i'm a coward now
and i'm holding on for dear life
he's sitting there inside of me
just as you write my number down
this place is on a mission
i just pretended that i had
just as you dance dance dance
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
is that you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself you do
you do it to yourself
this is what you get
this is what you get when you mess with us
we have crashed her party
come on kids
packed with foam and blind drunk
what if there's someone overtaking
they all drive killer cars
they would've drowned you at birth
still there's no point in letting it go to waste
and you cant offer me escape
houses live and houses speak
too bright
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around
and one day
dont do it
lewis
save yourself the pain
mistreated
dont do it dont jump
lewis save yourself the pain it never really matters
she is mad at someone else again
there i'm home once the feet inside shout it out
you've been stuck in a lift
you've been stuck in a lift
only consolations
it is now a broken home
once a beating when i make my way out
they still taste of poison
this time i feel my luck could change
i feel my luck could change
i'm not going back
well what am i to do
i just dont know anymore
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
turns to stone
everything i touch
blink your eyes
your mouth moves everywhere
all their eyes wrapped around my face
when you've got to feel it in your bones
limb by limb and tooth by tooth
leadfill the hole in me
it's always best when the light is off
it's always better on the outside
i'll be there
i get up on easy love
but i 'm a creep
you're so fucking special
whatever makes you happy
couldnt look you in the eye
i dont belong here
what the hell i'm doing here
i'm a weirdo
even when they tore the wall down
down is the new up
down is the new up
black eyed angels swam with me
and all the things i used to see
i trust i can rely on your vote
in its right place
in its right place
the drying of your tears
a song to keep us warm
lyrics by p wagner
a pilgrim's path
restless heart
you're just a part of the statistics
all of this borrowed existences
we'll be gone and nothing will show
and with all that we've been through
it wasnt meant to be so real
as i walk the streets i feel no fear
alive but dead
to make me trust in what i am
now the night has gone better days to come
waiting for the outburst for an instigation i bet
to kill if you're not blamed no
a mass of hands press on the market window
while shackled to the line
this is god's land
in appalachia
just like the noose wound
this is the new sound
somehow immediately down with no reason at all
noone could explain
noone would believe it
hey
commin upon the stage i'll say ya somethin
the rhyme is allowed 'cuz you cant philabust this
yo i got to drop the logic
aint no fading
always in control
and death equals silence
mentally and spiritually correct
yo i got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic
music lyrics p wagner
'cause nothing thrills like scary deeds
we make your sheets alive and fill the space up
and when it's dreamtime i'll return
driven back in time
it's a beautiful world we live in
the way they comb their hair makes me want to say
it is the time of the changing season
and from the ashes we'll build it up again
lyrics by p wagner
dont try to get rid of me
between the lines
far beyond my belief
there's something waiting the deep
got no ambitions in time if only i'm so
ughh hey you it's just another bombtrackughh
but i learned to burn that bridge and delete
on my people they took turns
burn burn yes ya gonna burn
and now dope hooks make punks take another look
burn burn yes ya gonna burn
modified chorus
where young run foaming at the mouth with hate
taste the razor wire
and raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture
his thoughts like a hundred moths
never a broken man
bottlefield
bottlefield
this time the bullet cold rocked ya
who stood and watched as the feds cold centralised
just victims of the in house drive by
they say jump you say how high
believin all the lies that they're tellin ya
uggh yeah yea
a bullet in ya head 7 times shoutedscreamed
drop an dont copy yo dont call this
weapons not food not homes not shoes
rally round tha family
that you've done it right
if there's no change you'll bury all life
i dont believe you a word
like baldwin home from paris
leave nothing but chains
calm like a bomb
but with different last names
tha numb black screen
wagnerwagner
and i find it hard to stay awake
and the first thing that i hear is bad
i just cant get out my state of
it's only a few that make profit here
friend or foe no one's getting close
my choice your choice
then our skulls wont tell about our past lifes
if you keep your millions on accountings
it's telling me the things i should not do
dont you paint the devil on the wall
it is here it's waiting for your call
since 1516 winds attacked and overseen now
face tha funk now blastin out ya
our past blastin on through tha verses
that vulture game ta try an steal ya name but now
on a second race
but it is no use
'cause they're better they've got
perfect mind and body
on my lap its on your lips so track shot
they can be fucking with other niggas shit but they cant be fucking with mine
are we getting along we family we better be
they can be fucking with other niggas shit but they cant be fucking with mine
you drive the story to a point of no return
you wanted more than your concern
perception will come far too late
smash the mirror there's no way back
in the end the idea of democracy and freedom has won
nothing's like it was and chaos everywhere
they taught it and they practised it
on the so called enemy
and if you know these questions
and you will learn 'bout hate
oh yeah you need a
next time do better
your day is my night
and in the night
all my life i've been looking for something
with every secret that you make public
music by wagnerschroeder lyrics by wagner
the walls are cracking you cannot move
shadows are creeping the air's so still
this atomic age of renegades
they were renegades of their time and age
and groove from land to land singin electronic chants like
they change the course of history
we're the renegades of funk
we're the renegades of funk
to get down to the big sound
now move sucker
hey revolver dont mothers make
nothing higher than the stars
riders riders on the moonlight
riders riders on the moonlight
too bad but love is dead
call me the upsetter
we're all calm
fear and the mouthpieces
leave here turn back
groovin away in the heat of the car
tourist's madness hip grip round trip
when i am old enough to stay
there's a vision to become a part of it

musci by pwagner s efthimiadis
i never found a way to make it here to staymy world is a dark and out of touch
my world is a dark and out of touch
i'll miss you from the cradle to the grave
from the underworld oh listen now
from the underworld oh listen now
when they found a way against decay
if they cant find the way out if here
here's something nice and friendly
to be beatin on and throwin in jail
to mark off the scene of the slaughter
comon
to be beatin on and throwin in jail
to mark off the scene of the slaughter
just cuz we in washington dc punk police are afraid of me
comon
they're all around me
this is a part of the plan
instrumental

musci lyrics by pwagner
who cares about you you'll only hear
a life before my eyes
we're diving faster now
hey dont miss out on what you're passing
how i could just kill a man
i'm not gonna waste no time fucking around i got ya humming
how do you like my chrome then i watched the rookie pass out
how i could just kill a man
i'm out here risking my dome just for a bucket or a faster ducket
here is something you cant understand
here is something you cant understand
hating raping killing day by day
we never learn from history this world's a big absurdity
i've seen you with your mummy yesterday
yeah right so what not yet you know
told me what to find
and i can hear them talkthere are so many voices
i'm talking to the dead
mister anchor assure me
oily silence mocks the legless
yes testify
the wrecking ball is rushing
its right outside your door
who controls the past now controls the future
said you must learn for life
even if you change it there's still him
so if you've got the cash then i will satisfy your needs
none of us are free
i am your friend you live through me
you got to listen when the body talks
446music and lyrics by p wagner
the crawling chaos comes
manifesting the sight of the dead berlin and london and paris were graves
nobody's foolin nobody is to where it goes
bathin in the cities' aqueducts
wherever somebodies stuglin for a place to stand
plans i have made to build it up from this state
if i will
just hear the call for the inner search
and be your own hope and a fear cannot get ya get ya
and be your own hope and a fear cannot get ya get ya
the mirror in your eyes
in hell i am churning
the mirror in your eyes the mirror in your eyes
i'm trying to rap
thought you could read minds
but i
c'mon
i investigate
and that shit your spreading
in the narrows
taking 'em back again
music by p wagner c efthimiadis lyrics by p wagner
sentence of death is their law
do they open up my prison
this is no justice this is the price of war
weep with the children and starve with the prisoners
you gotta face it it's the end
you told them all they wanted
truth tells no lies
dyin and rotting will be your destiny
they're waiting for you await your doom
the bugle sounds and the charge begins
we wont live to fight another day
i wrote this one in '88 during a tour which is
i dont want to be l
but security's not all that counts
they say playing deadly gamese
show me i'm alive i'm waiting for a sign
has got a mind to start once again
time and place
time waits for noone
you can join it till you die
she's got everyone's eyes
amidst tha eulogues of bliss
we're already dead
how long you want to stay
the person we are is another step
why cant you see
whatever you may say
come on seein what's at stake
on the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
asleep though we stand in the midst
now freedom must be fundamental
euuurrrggghhhhh
when ignorance reigns life is lost
time time had slipped away
time time had slipped away
how does it feel to someone when the moment has come
you know it happens a thousand times every day
this chance might be the last for you
the stake is burning heaven is denied
they shoot the bullet from behind
where we explored a mountain range
no muscles just wires a technical pulse
our planet grew up helped by elder ones
what a strange and awful vision for us all
whoever was these old remains his blood is flowing in my veins
let the engine run overpowered
accept the final rest for now
sister demon my bridei want you i need you
it drives me again and again
i have seen her talkin to the dead in trance
talk to grandpa
now give us the time to share it
love after death this is forever i have no regrets
i know this is the only bigger truth
was not to see the past was to see youdont you dare
restless
obey or die
no matter what it is it wont be true
well i wake up in the morning
nah i aint gonna work for maggie's brother no more
well he puts his cigar
about man and god and law
but everybody wants you
got someone in his life that he hates i know
make my day
make my day
c'mon you sucker make my day
she clutches her cross
of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
tha needle and thread crucifixion
no moments to pray
i am nothing no one nobody no more
to tear away at the mask
to tear away at the mask huh
is the keeper of our neuroses
what his ancestors already knew
wake up your spirits and let them run free
in video games they do
go out hunting
repeat 1st verse
ha aha cmon
whose curled neath tha shadows
mic check ha aha
yes i be tha flame in tha cellar beware
mic check ha aha
this be my question
who got tha power
i be the anti myth rhythm rock shocker
fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
but i dont need a cigarette know what i mean
a smooth operator operating correctly
unawareness beware it's the reanamator
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up
a smooth operator operating correctly
music orientated so when hip hop was originated originated
'cause i'm an e f f e c t
a smooth operator operating correctly
livical champion ya relivical champion ya livical champion
yo
you know the mindsets a threat
throwing it like a catcha
in the new sound
more than a lifetime away
i spend time on too many things turn my tides too slow
then i will let my demons out
and all the years she held her peace and followed every rule
did not fit in their plan
they get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
tha dow jones skyin
livin been warfare i press it to cd
a fire in the masters house is set
get em on file
violence in all hands
i press it to cd
i'm coming back to you
dont you play this game of treason
so you better tell me no lies
from the theaters to malls on every shore
tha thin line between entertainment and war
buy their products or get laid to waste
view the world from american eyes

i cant help you watching out
i cant help you watching out
they need someone to bear all their sinsnot forever no eternity
what are the leaders without someone to lead
i'll wait for my chance
i'll wait for my chance
to warm up your ass
chaste flesh i'm gonna change it
i'm gonna give her
'cos this jam is like a tomahawk chop
'cos the words and the thoughts still hit
down get downand clear the land
never could trust a phillabusta'
c'mon the war is on
i challange dont sweat it
ughclear the lane
ughclear the lane
for us so we meet our death before time
on your deathbed feel the grip 'round your neck
in their heads for all time
entire culture lost in the overthrow
but these governments they dont mind the procrastination
it's brutality can never be undone
and then you wonder why i have no identity
shedding light on the darkness of greed
in the night i remember
i'm lonly ever since you're gone
the time has come to harvest what they're sown
the time has come to harvest what they've sown
just one breath
a river of blood your race is almost run
to forget has blured his eye
he was a well respected rich young man
so he lost the control of his car
death in the afternoon
hate is what you sow between all men
deceiver
what has happened to you life
you're in defense only appologize
i'll never be like you and you will end
deep in the blackest hole
when it breaks into the mind
when i'm begging you to stay tonightdeep in the night
deep in the night
i cannot see you no more
it is just it drives me to desperation
day come true 'bout the end of the world an
there is no more use in praying
on the destination day
sinking like a stone coming through different mental spheres
died without a sense
if they'd seen it all before they wouldnt suffer this way now
lyrics by p wagner
the clods of earth hide his whole life
autumn who's got the time knows nothing yet
dont you fear the winter come with me
when power is in wrong hand
why my life a mess no turning back
yeah deep in the night i'm lost in love
faces shine
locked wit out a wage ya standin in tha drop
project block
a hearse
sweat
tumor
forced to fight for law and order
when money talks they wont hear all the cries
years or more
there are echoes of evil
and then when this fatal moment came to be
now the future's out of sight
free me from this crying shame
enough is enough those who dont know
'cause if we stay weak we are much better to use
and if we want to have a tomorrow
believe me the first step has been made
please dont get me wrong
fall it's big money the all order and this is
a few make the race but we all must pay the fare
the time has passed them by we must all pay
you speak with a forked tongue
but you just wasted what we invested
saw the face behind the mask
over and over again
search for cure from whys
the whole scene's so unreali'm still an unbeliever wont leave you
they're showing me pale white
cause time works for those who believe
dont ever turn away
let's forget it when we've done us wrong
there's nothing evil here to stay
there's not a chance to find our way
that we needed to be there
that's when the trouble began
check ituggh
but speak in silent voices
'cause i know the power of the question
'cause i'm the bastard son
mad boy grips the microphone
and i wont stop 'cause i know the power of the question
a stare full of nails
uggh
i cried my eyes out
the skill in my hand
i wouldnt mind to follow you
it's such a comfort
but i slipped
having never seen the colour of my father's eyes
no one's here to catch me when i fall
and we'll settle for nothing later
something's happened to myself i could never give the answer
they have told me i've reacted like i was not from this earth
music p wagner m schmidtlyrics p wagner
so many years it's much too long that you have fooled
and you wont be in
we did never regret
she killed and smiled
she killed and smiled
she's alive and she's more jealous than girls in flesh and blood
they wont escape out of this misty night alive
i've been waiting for an invitation
and the mirror smiled at lonely face
i was turning just in circles with no end
our time is short
i reach out my hands to reality of life
music by p wagner m schmidt
fanatics ruled by sinister thinkingthey drill this evil spirit in their childrens heads
it was like a mirror in a pair of distant eyes
paranoia sister demon on my mind
the world is my expense
or ill drag you to your grave
and i protect it with fire
hey hey
the agents of orange
with a horse and a rider and a clever cunning killer
that disappears when the wind redirects
crushing you and your naive profession
that disappears when the wind redirects
i'm just a solitary man
i'm gonna leave you now alone
time to prove the evolution
rushing through these years of madness
remember when life had no scars
your life became an obsession
you dont know i want it so
i seem to be innocent
i'm coming around i'm coming around
'cept for sing for a rock 'n roll band
'cause in this sleepy la town
i'll shout and scream i'll kill the king i'll rail at all his servants
a street fighting man
a street fighting man
they invent the ultimate war machines
but coming near there's eagerness in their eyes
music lyrics by p wagner
submission
call me what you want now
and throughout my whole life i've done everything wrong
i've been taking the wrong track
this tv commercial has caught us anew
this isnt worth it at all
supersonic hydromatic superultrameganew
and not a drop of water that could wet my lips
and all my people died our fountains they ran dry
take me to the water bring me to a shore
to find the river where the water of mercy flows
that he would be a healer who could
that he'd be the messiah and
he was the very first to prove
i'll offer you the truth so you can
spoken 'crank the music up'
lost the culture the culture lost
we need a movement with a quickness
see right through the red white and blue disguise
and that is why
the teacher stands in front of the class
yet we hang from it
no more lies 8 times building to a crescendo
yeah
raping her for a shot now she cant trust a man no more
set above life and the industry is feeding it for cash
time will come when you fell down
you're alone during the stay
be aware i'll be your voice
i wont sigh when time will turn the page
now i'm a wasted man
it's just me myself to blame
i tried to tell the others what i'd seen before
after the accident my soul was drifting away
who decided
there has been so many smiles
we will get what we need
forget about the time
now my time has comeand from the first sight to the last
on tha radio nah fuck it
shcok around tha clock from noon
tha same devil that ran around managua wit a
that one inhuman illegal single woman tha one
shutdown tha devil sound
i've got visions and i cant
there in the hemispheres i caught a view in life
in a dark and spooky graveyard
oh midnight and she's all alone
and he passed away real slowly
now he took hold on her mind
oh midnight and she's all alone
you be tha spark
we are at war until youre free
long as the rope
youll never silence the voice of the voiceless
'cause it scares me i know
run with the wind feel the wet in the air
a pleasure for me and my distorted soul
i dont want to miss this place
the warmth of summer
the needle i'll thread it
movements come and movements go
and then came the shot
set the groove
networks at work keepin people calm
background 'black nationalism'
what you reap is what you sow'
a rising sun loomin over los angeles
cmon
their seat their robe their tie
shook all tha world bankers
wearin the masked scream
yeaaaaaah
its land or death
take my sorrow and pain
and till today it's tearing you apart
wasteland
knowledge is something for people with reason
now i'm the shadow of the night
relativity divides
welcome to the other side
the other side the other side
it is for everyone beginning and the end
he's gonna get you when you are dead
i tell you what he's waiting for
now they are trapped and they dont even care
who dares to stop these fools
yes tha rebels of tha grains stand
frontier
vultures playin markets
all the shareholders gonna flex and try ta
and abc's new thrill rides of trails
survive one motive no hope 'cause every sidewalk
i took a death trip when i tried ta cross tha
ya down with ddt yeah you know me rapped from tha
walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates born
we found no wrecks and nothing was seen
in this part of the atlantic
without a trace flight 19 got lost in the sky
maybe this was meant in tales 'bout the flood
last night when i drove home they were there this is true
yeah they study our life
previously unreleased
we belong to each other
we could play around in peace
wanna spit
yet at every turn i'm runnin into
so let tha guilty hang
so now you're pullin the moves pullin
for democracy justice and liberty
it goes something like this
everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
so i stepped back and started sprayin niggaz
'cause i'm housin
'cause i'm housin
mc's you know who you are
'cause i'm housin
relate to the matter as i drop the bomb
so sweet and defenceless
going down in fever
so just relax your spirit
it started back in time when something stole my mind
i wait for a sign from this old reality it calls me
there were these enchanted books pages that i've known too well
3 finding out
you tell me you like the taste
it's in my eyes
you're just fucking scared
it's in my eyes
music by p wagner
comes off him then
but when the night falls and she puts
in the darkest hour
if it was in vain i will wait for another time
i swear i wont go down again
running away from emptiness
i'm grieving believe in the change in me
your problems are unreal at one blow
is it still far to go invisible horizons
how can we be so smug
when the dressing room got hazy now baby
and the sound that abounds and
and then cant get enough
i done kick 'em out
but now you do what they told ya
uggh
come on
hey yo so check this out
that when i say go go go
i was born to rage against 'em
with the d the e the f the i the a the n the c the e
now action must be taken
come on
'cause eternity can be a long long time
like a downwards spiral heading straight to hell
'cause i'm stumbling and it's time to say goodbye goodbye
if i didnt have these moments
they all made their own mistakes
so let the night begin
so come and lay down by my side
there's light into the darkness
there's light into the darkness
all my life it seems just a crazy dream refrain
eyes that looked but not to see
i'm going back to my home
i'm here to stay
i cant go wrong
your mouth is open but i dont wanna hear you
i wanna be with you all night long
can i take you home
a silhouette lit by candle light
till you see your fate written there in her eyes
let the moonlight surround you
let the darkness surround you
the future's at the bottom of a tea cup
a beard full of lice
or pay the penalty
cause it's true what they say about familiarity
cause they wanted me dead or alive
by a spin of the wheel
i can see what i need you better believe
let the dream chaser take you away take you away
crossing all the borders just to take their share
looking for the future
we got everything we need for a peaceful time
day after day i keep waking up
but i dont want to say goodbye
what can i do
i want you by my side
your eyes cant see
so bless me come the down
and then she played me i was mesmerized
i've been blinded now i'm broken
till i kill the pain inside
your gonna make a dead stop
but you never learn
red lights in the mirror
death alley driver
blackmoreturner
want you to know that i'm gonna break through
you been on talking
how long can i go on this way
i think i'm gonna explode
got my soul to sell
gonna raise some hell
and said i'm at your command yes i am
hungry and wild she was born to the night
oh even the deadly shades of night
she keeps burning me burning me burning me burning me down
sidewalk cruiser in stiletto heels
cant see nowhere
and i dont know why you do it
two wrongs dont make a right
i know how you feel ooh
miss mistreated
in the dark the dancers shout
i look at you and suddenly
stars in the night
in your eyes
cause i never give up and i never give in
they're gonna wheel ya deal ya tell ya all the lies realize
i got the power
i can feel the power
fancies in the air
no clever words you cant defend
and all the lights have died somehow
standin in her ruby red shoes
lemme see ya rock
aint no use i'm breakin loose
come on let me give you a shot
lemme see ya roll
lemme see ya burn
by the fall of the show
that a sound just like the wind
to run with the wolf 2 times
paint me a picture
nothing is real
pull me down from below
should've touched some wood
oh i just might yeah
she's a bright and shining star
gotta take it slow yeah
caught in the ocean as i'm watching you breathe
i know the worst part of being alone
the tyrant's opened up the door
make it leap unto the spire
got no ties
hey mystery man
ooh snake charmer
there's no hope for you
fairyland
to wakeish you up
something sort of grandish
we could be oh so bride and groomish
toujours lamourish
so please be give inish
you're the spotlight kid
it seems like an age
what you trying to do
you gotta stand and fight
if you wanna get out of this town alive
just to see him fly so many die
no sound as he falls instead of rising
it doesnt rain with all your chains
we still hope oh
standing strong and steady
i am in your power
i know just what you're thinking
and you just cant see it
fool for the night
i aint gonna try and tell ya
you keep rocking with the boys
i'm sick and tired of the whole routine
it's the same old story with a different name
i'm a freedom fighter i gotta make a stand
spend a vision with me
a magic carpet ride a genie may be more
you're riding the endless caravan
a magic carpet ride a genie may be more
how are things in glocca morra
so i ask each weepin willow
i hear your cries rise oh rise
i love you
please be tender i'm in your hands girl
i surrender
i remember i remember
if this isnt love
because you're so adorabelle
blackmoredio
if you dont like rock 'n roll
well if you dont like rock 'n roll
if you dont like rock 'n roll
fly like the wind
i need a spell and a charm
kill the king
take his dead
and left out in the cold
it's sweet and close and warm
oh take me away i got nothing to say
a shadow has covered light refrain 2
then another assault and i started to faulter
straight down i'm swirling around
in a similar way
when the words didnt rhyme
if you suddenly see
chorus
look look
follow the fellow
look look
follow the fellow
'cos it's magic
'cos it's magic
only the stranger knows why
so you took me by surprise
i've been running on a really bad streak
got your name on my bullet and my aim is true
for myself my tears just fall in the dust
see the rain the falling rain it's rain
blackmoregloverturner
stone cold
searching in the darkness
stone cold
stone cold your leavin me cold
that same old feeling hits me again
i'm just a captive of my own fate
blackmoreturner
do you remember me on a street of dreams
now it's still a mysterydo you remember me on a street of dreams

refrain

the earth beneath your plow is a buddin
glory time's comin for to stay
on the apple trees
to begin the begat
and they begat the people
of the bourgeoisie
how they multiplied
and lord in love
and sometimes a bachelor he begats
and its the cause
wont save anyone near to me
cause i got no time i'll climb
out of my way
chorus
heard the tolling of the great black bell
daylight waits while the old man sings
when the bell began to sing
far from the circle at the edge of the world
giving feeling
ooh give it to me you got everything i need
ooh do it to me bring me to my knees
gimme that tite squeeze ooh baby gimme that tite squeeze
and my world stopped spinning `round
oh my heart is beating wildly
and not too partickle i fear

but with a little pinkie up
but when a poor man doesnt want to work

and looking back at me she's there beware
that a smile made them really care

fathers talking shit

sleeping here for free
for maybe 3 days
the human spirit prevails
over and over again
how did she know the roof would cave in
armageddon is coming so you better start running
like a bomb
of a police state on my block
all i wanna do is make it through without dying
she wouldnt move until the coast was clear
another night
let california fall into the fucking ocean
let california fall into the fucking ocean
looking from the bottom i cant see the ceiling

chorus
'cause when you go like cherieko i fall
i feed my chickens and my milking cows
every time i look at her my knees get weak
chickens wont lay and the cow's gone dry
heart's alive it's saturday night
heart's alive it's saturday night
cant fly away like flies on a hog
when i tell him that i think we're all
we all know people
but not gettin anywhere
floatin down a river
i'd do anything if you'd just let me hold you
well i'd take you 'round the world
anything anytime
and i fell for you and how
then we found each other
intro must be doin something wrong baby i dont know
but they're tired of hearing how i'm missin you
knowin that the cats down to three more lives
before you kill us all
chorus
it takes more than caviar to have a ball
will she remember me
i'll send a thousand flowers
one that they could croon as only they can
and then they nursed it and they rehearsed it
that let's us swing through space
i dont know why i love you
and if i could be a surgeongirl
ah if i was a gambler
is be your registered certified
day one
there on the bed
day one
but that would not do justice to the way i feel for you
so this is just another way of sayin the same thing
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill
yeah tonight i'm settlin alone diggin up bones
yeah tonight i'm settlin alone diggin up bones
buys an eight by twelve four bit room
king of the roadi know every engineer on every train
ah but two hours of pushin broom
something i wanted but now it's so clear
i will say i need you god knows i do
to make my love shine
and women that sparkle shiny and cold
but you became flawless
there's a few things in this world
but it holds some great memories
well there's my easy chair
there's no place like home
behind our bedroom door
as i was leaving
it drives me wild
he says guitar music entertains us here
been a whole lot of times when times were lean
i aint missed a thing
another womans name and it was done
and it rolled across the floor
no you wont forget the sound
keep walking till the hurting stops
they keep talking weaving their spell
straight and tall an mean the words you say
if you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
you will be a point of light
a small price to pay
and i think back to the times
back when one night was such a small price to pay
when the mornin sun starts showing
lord i know she's just a woman
a working day to long when everything goes wrong
the bills they are mounting thats when i start counting
just some of the reasons i cheat
so send my body home on a freight train
she tried to raise us kids without a pa
and dont worry none that i dont go first class
after all these years i can still hear grandpa laughin
and you dont drink no you dont drink when you drive
you're gonna get stung boy
somewhere in my broken heart
and when you finally do
and we set on the table and carefully we opened up the top
i guess we always knew itbut i love you was hard for him to say
we all thought his heart was made of solid rock
the family bible and the farmer's almanac
handed down the day she died
there was a plan for defrost
a friend of mine bought himself a shovel
he thinks hes closer the further he goes
and he cant dig out of the hole
its hell on the bottom
well i left my soul out in the rain
you know she almost had me turned around
everybody said i'd leave you
i'm gonna be here for a long long time
they can search the backstreet barrooms
how can i disagree
now this cant be paranoia
i got the truth
to a lot of trouble
and tonight we're gonna tear down the walls
we're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball
'cause
now you're just an old song nobody sings anymore
i didnt wanna let you go
givers and takers movers and shakers
i've had some good times and i've had a good life
but you cant erase my memory no matter how you try
could run out of ciggarettes or money again
then we can ge back into doin what we do best
when i beat on the door and i beg to come in
what in the world are you planninto do
but i fell in love and baby here i am
never want to grieve
i want love to come and make a prisioner out of me
i'm tired of being free
i heard a heart beat where once on sound remained
and though the lighting and thunder came
would i do every step the way you thought i should
would i
would i marry you then just to make sure they understood
you were pure to me as fresh untraveled snow
chorussaid you found something in another
my hands are shaking and i think
this love that i'm feeling for you always will be
i'll be happy to tell you again
chorus
and shake the hand of the future mister me
and he loves you any fool can plainly see
chorus
everlasting love never seem to last
but i wound up in jail on chrismas day
i promised him but never took the time
chorus
go to chorus
he said he was a cowboy when he was young
and i'd ride in circles while he laughed alot
my friends and i sometimes pre tended to be
a hundred cups of coffee five hundred cigarettes
he said where's the fire son
so i went to call up elvis and roger miller grabbed the phone
breaking up the pool balls chalk ing up the cues
honk tonk moon keeps shin in on my ba by and me
you got to get to it before it gets to you
so get mean and get slick
a silhouette moves 'cross a cinnamon sky
now he rides away on a horse he called music
and he sang ooh to the ladies
wondering if i'd always be alone
until i saw it through my baby's eyesheaven only knows she's not an angel
and suppose i cried and said i think i finally learned my lesson
and asking me to take you in
the way we did when our love first began
it's the last thing i needed
what she's doing to me
and my tear drops will fall when they go walkin by
cant hold back the pain
every line would tell the truth
when you see me walk on water
the older i get the more i discover
there's no way out and i'm telling you brother
if it aint one thing it's another
a lot of people making caastrophoic predictions
atonic supersonic
everybody's trying to find a new solution
and when the sun goes doen you're still gone
i shoulda' been makin love
and work into the night
skip ewingdonny kees
til the feelings right
thre's poetry
with a love like yours and a heart like mine
gene nelson john greenebaum paul nelson
they would hope and faith
that they would hope and faith
falling in love with a cowboy like you
a cowboy like you
chorus
for this old heart of mine
says
somebody tell me where i'll find
instead of buying it with gold
the sign says families welcome
watching and waiting but nobody comes
she just sighs and walks away
we held on to each other
don schlitzreba mcentire
cause if i'm the only one then who can i turn to
and you're not the only one who cares what you do
i'm not the only one who cares what you do
when i saw him there on that busy street
saying i loved him stillhe said how've you been
i gave my best smile
that you really dont know
the angel in your arms this morning
you've been with someone else
the angel in your arms this morning
asleep on the hay
i feel the blues coming on
it's so hard on my heart going from good into gone
baby's gone blues
chorus
it's not as simple as who's right and who's to blame
do you remember
well i thought i was swinging the world by the tail
and i thought i'd been loved
they'd all seen the headlines about bobby and his wife
when he fell in love himself he came to understand
the young man drove his car up and parked outside the gate
joe doyle rick peoples
but i know where he's at
should i ruin my life or my pride
and he'll laugh when he reads the part that says i'm leavin
oh he just didnt know
you try to think of something worse
well this time aint no different
the lights of laredo dance on the water
he knows the child would have a chance just
shine in a young mans eyes who stand on the
she can hold a conversation
to fall in love again
oh you'd better keep your distance
chorus
i stare at you and think about last night
chicago is your home
made of iron or stone
hey hey hey
lord it's still a mystery
and some nights i dont dream of you at all
but the mountain hasnt moved
and i'd get there before anyone else
hey that's just like a little girl i knew
yes i'm still that little girl
when you cant get a good night's loving
he doesnt even kiss me
walk back through the door put my suitcase down
i could keep going on like i have all along
then you call me long distance from memphis
but somehow it seems
that hide you from me
arent you tired of looking
you might be surprised
and all the things you're dreaming of
for those of us who dream of love
i'm lookin for a new love story
you found me down
you're taking the hurt away
thanks to you
leaves me up
and never realize
love can be for friends
a song's not a song without singing
you keep it by letting it gorepeat chorus
so what ya gonna do
oh you might meet someone new
loving you loving me
come and hold me tenderly
go ahead and kiss me when i'm feeling down
on a freight train leavin town
and i turned twenty one in prison
miles and miles just to listen to him sing
that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters
that your baby boy has walked where angels trod
that your baby boy is lord of all creation
the morning sun would find me
wild and free
showing through
our love would never be
when i'm with someone new
i say i'll let you go
and with tears streaming down my face
across the bar a smooth bartender
in a moment of weakness
maybe i should call and seerepeat chorus
my mind is on you
now it's my turn
havent had time to give
got a husband house and kids
oh no i never had a reason to
to some love comes as a vision
stephen
a kid out of school trying to find my way
but i dont know the rules teach me how to play
the fame and fortune arrived
all that money she makes every night
nickel dreams
just like me
in a world
you can find me
well now i want to tell you about the women
no matter whether it's her singing
chorus
but i dont mind there's nothing i can do
it's hurting me more
before you find your heartaches
and they're just trying to ease my mind
things that i never thought would come from you
o bet he can tell you must be someone dear to me
and went on their own way
and the kids are all grown
never any end
starting over again
been two weeks without a day off
it's the weak made strong
what new york city would be like
people love to talk
but if it's gonna be bad news
when you've climbed the highest mountain
and kissed by the falling rain
i want a sunday kind of love
cold and i need a love for all my life to have
it's plain
you talked me into moving in and giving you my key
you're bringing home flowers and a bottle of chablis
at least they are with me cause babe i got no use for you
take me back to sycamore park
sometimes dont you want to trade it all in
r sharp
take your love and hide away
roger cook bobby wood
you've been talkin in you sleep
you dont remember me
i'd gladly take you back
i thought love was meant to last forever
he's the kind you cant forget
jerry fuller
we're like birds of a feather
one way to sum up forever is you and me
that's all she wrote
to love me again
that's what he said
to open up my heart and just let go
between the shopping and my job i barely got there
and as i watched those innocent children
no you and the blues dont care at all
repeat chorus
branches of fern the table is spread and the kettle is shine
every sound he would rise with a start and look for the
lord so late and how much longer he'd have to wait
he said he would then conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
entered his own darkened door he knew the
i was the beggar with bruised cold feet
yuletide carols being sung by the choir
and so i'm offering this simple phrase
walt aldridge bruce miller
not the one we both heard too much
i must admit it's been fun
oh what can i bring
she'll hear his promise of forever
keeps getting wider
oh that river's sorrow
the great divide
came home late every night
i guess i'll never hear
dont go tellin her about right or wrong
when there's no sign of love in sightshe hears him say hey can i buy you a drink
but words didnt come easily
but there's one thing that wont change
through the four winds blown and gone
blinded by the memory of a flame
if you were holding me tonight
gonna love ya till the day i die
it's love that you're feeling
those little things to laugh about
another day
your good friends
his parents were joseph and mary
now kids the presents that all of you exchange on christmas
ok all together now
have i got a deal for you
you're gonna fall in love with it you'll see
i guess he held me a little too right
sandy knox anthony little
he'll build a house in the country
with his final remembrance of this earth
and i just held my breath in
but dont you say too much
repeat chorus
chorus
he's in dallas without us tonight
he's as real as the thrill i feel
lord he's only everything
love can take us up so high
i know we can make it forever
oh honey why did you leave me
how blue can i feel
and find there's nobody there
i'm sorry i called you
i just couldnt see the end till you were gone
now i know what i'm made of
i never thought i'd be
love me with all your might
or a flat up on park avenue
now lord knows you aint a saint
i'm here to confess
carrying along
and it's too late baby
how i ever let myself fall
but i cant stop now
go so well as we
repeat chorus 4 times
but i dont think love ought to be that way
it's tempting me so
i'd pick your favorite colors
in webster's book
that's an easy thing to do
ooo you take the worries away
you make me see why the good lord made me
repeat chorus
oh night divine
i overheard a conservation your name was mentioned in
and people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
i know that you've seen it all waiting by the telephone
you are the one the only one that's on my mind
now he got mad and he saw red
andy didnt have many friends and he just lost him one
the georgia patrol was making their rounds
to andy's house and back that night were mine
we'll each keep our own friends divide the rest in two
who's gonna be the one who tucks me into sleep
will i have to make new friends live on a different street
to you the glass might seem half empty
if you offer the best part of yourself
whoever you are
she lie
that a ticket to anywhere could be the cure
oh but just like before she'll have to pretend
took a whole lot of you
when it's all said and done
chorus
you always sit and listen
there aint no love like yours for me
like a feeling that surrounds us
freddy weller kim nash bill nash
they asked about you
and just like that
logic told them they were crazy
this christmas let me keep that faiththis christmas let this be the season
this christmas
chorus
arms that welcome doors opened wide
tore it to pieces this morning at two
i know i'd be okay if i could just throw away
tom shapiro sharon vaughn walter wilson
it meant a little less to me everytime i did it
come and gather 'round at the table
shining with love from our hearts
and we'll love and we'll laugh in the time that we have
travelers in the night
cause darling when god made our love
cause darling when he made our love
chorus
and like me they dream of the love that's true
please dont say i'm wasting my time
and never give up till you love me
his love flowed like a river
oh i hope i can live long enough
chorus
a habit i've held for so long
so the world has fallen at your feet
get myself up and flying
it doesnt seem quite fair
down through the chimney with old saint nick
here is a hammer and lots of tacks
just because you hate to give up
waitin for the deal to go down
bridge
oh i've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
waiting for the sun to shine
waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again
walk on
you know it's gonna mend
outside the rain begins and it may never end
no need to bother now
deja ya regresa a vivir
jose and durval
to meet

and not be any closer than we are right nowrepeat chorus x2

michael dulaney neil thrasher
seventeen years old she was out with her friends
her husband knows she's tired of holding on
we cant see right now
what'll i do
but if i never do how will i know
old man i might be going where you're bound
in your deep and nimble soul
somethin in my heart always knew
no one said it would be easy
that losing him would cut like a knife
you've got to find out where you belong again
right to the christmas tree they ran
in the town of bethlehem
grandma and grandpa arrived after breakfast
repeat chorus
how could they know about their son
that he will show the way
you said you were out with a friend
and i'll stayyou tell me your love is true
makin talk that's only cheap
i thought i saw my dream comin true
we could prove them wrong
could be we'll be
but i'll
so no matter how much i adore you
i cant have you but i never will forget you
one thin dime
for when you come back to me
oh they're always open
in each other's arms where we belong
from now on
a move that could have made the wind stand still
i said only in my mind
repeat chorus
only you
for it's true
out of the blue
hoping that i would someday find
you put me out and light me as you please
you cut me way too hard and way too deep
pins and needles
those little things
for the springtime
boston denver la aint your kind of town
down the canyons
and all that i aint got
that fell from the sky
he's tall dark and dangerous
oh you ladies warn your daughters
you could meet him at the store

all around just the sound of the
and the words just somehow slip away
i tell myself if i can just believe
reba mcentire
and i dont understand why i put up with you
here we go us again
you could tell me you love me
what you want
all i'm asking is for a little respect when you get home
but guess what so is my money
a little respect you're running out fool just a little bit and i aint lying
sun goes down on a silky day
oh you and me baby
and vowed that i'd never love anyone else again
it's just a ring on your finger
repeat chorus
there's a story to tell if the roses could talk
the years took their toll and the angels took her away
we wouldnt have to meet here
and i wouldnt have to worry
repeat verse 1
it was our last walk in the rain
so unaware i foolishly believed
for you goes on and on
chorus
if only we'd have given more attention
so here you are again
chorus
no one to answer to
you'd put your anger down
and i still need him so
even more then i usually do
you know christmas eve will find me
when you can`t find your way
i`ll be there
when all you find are lies
and they all said someone else would hold me
time is going to heal me
all the conditions are just right
i'm gonna leave you wonderin when you'll see me again
and have 'em on the line
let me tell ya again
sleep till 6
i'll say it again
steve davis dennis morgan

but it's you i miss the most

kendal franceschiquentin powersreba mcentire

chorus
so dont you lead me on if you dont really care
you can tell everyone
but cant you see
it's your call it's her
i cant take another minute

and it's been such a long time
where i lay

jolene

jerry salley melba montgomery
right on the edge
but talking to an empty chair

and in the morning
m heeney
oh these arms
and even now it's more then i can bear
but when it comes to my heart
dont you believe him
i cant see it
let your arms around me tight
till you return
walks through the door
crime is everywhere
never put it in the chart
but it kills you just the same
cause there's always someone trying
every second someone breaks a heart
a hard one to lose
everything but my heartlove is not an easy word for me right now
and you can feel your dreams
what i'd give if you were here beside me
i've taken love for granted
under the moonlight
now you keep staring
i'll ever be
do you sing her our love song
when she reaches out for you
nights were never made to spend alone
think of me
i really thought that i would hate you
i blamed you but i see my mistakes now that we're face to face
repeat chorus
pullin your heart out from under the knife
he never knew you like he'll be knowing you now
we didnt have money for food or rent
she said here's your one chance fancy dont let me down
she handed me a heart shaped locket that said
lord forgive me for what i do but if you want out
what my mama's been talkin about
it wasnt very long after a benevolent man
that would call me bad
but if you want out well it's up to you
i had it all right on my back
she'd forgive them everyone
uncle slim had let her know she couldnt ride that horse
as hard as it may be she has to find out for herself
there's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago
nothing much for us to say
but oh this sun is blinding me
you call to see if i'm ok
forever love i promise you
repeat chorus
oh aint no way to name it but i'm thinking baby
like the river and the ocean
that really touch my heart
you dont need to rehearse
it's takin me in your arms so easily
to hear the sleigh bells in the snow
better think about it one more time
that can kindle your desires
who who who
and boston finds better things to do
who feels the cold most of all
whoever's watching
i always look to the sky
still i stand here in total wonder
dont say that all things happen
so dont try to make it easy
you've done enough today
and i'm lucky to have such a guy i hear it all the time
and my friends say that when he's around
then across the room comes a casual glance
what we know we cant have
she was a rubbernecking a new rolls royce
so tell me why havent i heard from you
i'm sure the operator will be glad to put you thru
believe me that it's not my intention
we can take it so slow
then if you're up for doing some dancing
oh i knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
shouldnt i start living my life for myself
just kind of ordinary blue
said i wasnt gonna do it
playing real soft on the jukebox
which one of us would win
and how you keep forgiving me
like i often do
i know those nights i'd find great temptations
lay them down so carefully
get out of my life why dont you baby
the way you've gotten over me
so let me find somebody else
keep me hangin on
so you lie buy a little time and i go along
jim zerface bob morrison johnny macrae
i never try to get away on daydreams anymore
you never take to heart the crazy things i say
you must really love me
your letter found me here in denver
lord i hope this time you mean
i can see you waiting
oh you're really gonna love me
and looked your old friends up and down
i guess i'll be moving on
feelin better
you're no good you're no good
i'm tellin you now baby
you're the first time i've thought about leaving
i caught you smiling at me again
now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
darling could i just have one moment with you
it's true i'm right in the palm of your hand
he's a fast rushing river i cant get across
and the means to his end
oh lips so sweet and tender
take a bow boys
i had every album he ever put out
some things change and sometimes people go their seperate ways
i cant rehearse tomorrow any longer in my head
so i'll be sure
say the word
and i'll be yours
but there is one she cant put her finger on
now each day is one day that's left in her life
she was good to come and get him
wouldnt let her go wouldnt let her in
she was good at late night listening
give her that class ring
cause he knows
she's callin it love
the way she was looking every woman could cry
she's no womans friend
she's on top of the world
she's single again
she's the one loving you now
for getting up and leaving
arranged by reba mcentirewhat's written in sentences and not verse at the beginning is what
an organ yet beautiful enough to express their christmas joy
round yon virgin
christ the savior is born
sleep in heavenly peace
i fell in love again
but when the nights get oh so cold
chorus
harry shannon mitch johnson
needs a little fixing
so the banker fenced the yard in
honey we'll just bought this house
but they dont know why i've been loving
so so so long so fine so
when the kids go to bed
somebody should leave
i try to keep my actions straight
when my worldly head spins around
i wish i'd known all along
or just someone to love you tonight
repeat chorus 3 times
you're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that
and i dont want to be alone
i can always count on
she's made suggestions i dont
i sure hope i've said enough and just between the two of us
it was the sound of a teardrop
well i'd have given anything
kneeling down to hold our child
across the room i could see him there
and it cuts right down to the bone
but tonight there's no denying what a love like his is worth
cause you've done what you said you'd do
who loves me wrong or right
he loves me honestly
i fed the children
i've sacrificed more than you'll ever losei gave up so much
i've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose
i saw mama kissing santa claus
repeat chorus
took my breath away
f carter jr
if i heard it secondhand
ruby hice danny hice
oh you say you need a little room for breathing
i wish that i could tell you
is it true a heart heals itself with time
how do you say it i just dont know
but i wont mention it again
leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul
but i am not about to share your heartchorus
and when that day comes it wont be my affair
he said he loved me
he said he was proud of all my success
chorus
why you're not around
i wouldnt wanna be you right now
how you could fall so hard
i wouldnt wanna be i wouldnt wanna be you
i'd rather ride around with you
oh i'd rather ride around with you
there's way too many decisions to make
return the ill pill
learn to give and take dictation
read me your scripture and
simple soldier hand it over
looking in my own eyes
it's my aeroplane
it's easy when you're sad to be
not a lie
who killed as they came
a sea of grief
i am an indian brave
i will dance on the grave
no it wont be long
chorus
when the wet comes down

to those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit

how could i be so blind mis sighted
you're coming onto something so fast so numb
you say that you hate it
that was then was that that is gone
you're comin on with something so fast so numb

nothing's free but guaranteed for a lifetime's use
will this never end
so fuck me kitten
i'm going to make whatever it takes
a word a signal a nod a little breath
there's something going on that's not quite right
we'll stumble through the yard

now i'm not feeding off you i will rearrange your scales
happy throngs take this joy wherever wherever
all of the sudden these days
we are hope despite the times
looks like i went to town
get back with my wanderlust
it's overwhelming because
when they salute to me me me me
if your friends took a fall are you obligated to follow
i'm tired of singing trouble
anybody can get laid
dont lay that stuff all over me
leaving the things that you learned behind
nothing except for the years
i need something to breathe
over my grave again you will never see
i want you to remember oh you will never see
i'm looking for to lay to waste
what i choose not to do
what i choose not to do
i know what i wanted
i'm drowning
and no one's coming after me
nothing's gonna save me i can see
i'm drowning
the verdict is dire the country's in ruins
where are we left to carry on
where are we left to carry on
this light is here this light is here to keep you warm to keep you warm
while i'm away from here this song is here to keep you strong
while i'm away from here so stay up late to hear me sing
hold her and keep her strong
hold him and keep him strong
in the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
in the songs of the revelaires a must
the revelaires a must
what are you gonna do
why dont you stay
what are you gonna do
as the sun comes up as the moon
lost my way
to play
walk unafraid
then celebrate the contradiction
wall of death
and noah's ark might confuse you but
oh let me take my chances on the wall of death
put on my boots and going down to walter's
reddened their necks collared their clothes
reddened their necks collared their clothes
if i could only make her see my way
repeat verse
when i look into your eyes
i flail like the antelope
i jump on a high speed train
i flail like the antelope
no war no hate no past
for saying things i didnt mean and dont believe
believe in me believe in nothing
i've become the hollow man
you see it in my eyes
and he bled 'til sunday night
and accepting of the struggle
you want to see forever
a built in mechanism to protect you
i could have kept my head down
i hold my breath i come around round round
i'm not that easy
it's not that easy
i've finally got some rest
and so there are things that are gone
water from wine
a stroke of bad luck now the bird has died
i cracked through time space godless and dry
the town is safe again tonight
hyena god knows you're doin that dont you
hyena i see my road ahead
i believe in coyotes and time as an abstract
my spirit i will not tell
when i was young and full of grace
i believe my shirt is wearing thin
said leave me to lay but touch me deep
i dont know i guess so
you leave me to lay you touch me deep
i remember traffic jams
remembering it wasnt fair outside
i remember traffic jams
i wore the clothes you wanted
who's to blame
who's to blame
if there is some confusion
repeat
but everyone is humming a song
that i dont understand
prop up the omega man we're primed for victory
kick the clay that holds the teeth in
i've been there i know the way
cant get there from here
bad to swallow you whole
thank you ray
i've been there i know the way
brother ray can sing my song
the dirt of seven continents going
cant get there from here
cant get there from here
boxcars are pulling out of town boxcars are pulling out of town

dangerous times

knew it was theo from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me he'd smile like we were mates
and who are you calling poof you like wham man i hate that stuff
i cried she cried we cried our youth died
that's how the 80s broke my heart
too short so long
if i could just avoid me mum maybe i'll tell her tomorrow
i hate those that hate me
unload the bullets your mind is a gun
the boys got jealous cuz the girls got
and now it's breaking my heart because the dream's turned to shit
and if truth be told i wasnt fit enough to stay

again

they all walk past me
and when my ship comes in she'll be on it

i was naked when it penetrated
we all love you we always did
the boy who you reduced to tears
married to the life married to the school
no not me i'm a mega civilian
except for the occassional word
summon me onto another day
of love
she walks in
he has his future in a fist of steel
we're only making plans for nigel
we only want what's best for him
i dont wake up early every morning
if your home's full of useless aggravation
leaves me tired all the time
all the time
everything i loved got broken
have the universe at one with me
beat me up on the beach
like to square it with god if he gets permission
he's been to rehab couldnt pay his bar tab
this high wont see us through
but what's the point in wishing
lie to me
these things hide inside of my mind my mind
lie to me
is over my head
and other arms may hold a thrill
break it so i've got no place to go
were you stiching up the wounds that you thought i need mending
and yes you do hate me
close your eyes so your dont hear then
you were there for summer dreaming
picked a star before we lost the moon
the past is done
and you are a friend indeed
who must be in the know
from major to minor
that was down her cardie
and financed by her father
so i strolls of to the reception
pillow over head again
i want ya kids an getting married to ya
and he just laughs at my plans
before i fall in love
going to waste
real love and the love ever after

and all at once i own the earth and sky
miss jones and i
know no fear we will see heaven from here
love on my mind
so we dive
there's no u in tomorrow
she's waiting for
on sunset strip
and sullen on salisbury plain
about a silver lining
in maine the melancholia
there are bad times just around the corner
and the outlook's absolutely vile
land of hope and glory
and i just cant contain
there she goes again
he gets a kick out of losing the plot so it seems
all the memories that you should've had
in your bed
these dreams wont let you down
there are many many crazy things
the way you haunt my dreams
watching lovers holdin hand 'n laughin laughin
memories are all i have to cling to cling to
and the heartaches are the friends i'm talkin to
you definitely wont find a virgin
everybody's feeling fine
i believe in christmas
sticks and stones may break my bones
everybodys toxic in this town
call me in my lord i'm coming down
but names can burn a happy home
i've taken as much as i'm willing to take
the heart is broken there's nothing to break
leave the car
dont put your idols on a mantel
i sit and think about my maker
when you've decided
when a woman needs a man
to spread some love and ask for more
the falcon flies in two straight lines
we're knee deep in information
till they decide which god is best
roastin oats on open fires
mine is yours and yours is mine
while they are sleeping
everybody's feeling fine
what a swell party this is
hup crossed the bridge when the bridge was up
of a time when you were
in my heart
maybe it's a sin
shopping
what have i what have i
does it just fade away
she wouldnt notice anything else but me
she touched my face and called me
you win some you lose some
another friend to have a go on
always in my head is a space between us
theres a space between us
my gay friend
you said i was northern scum
i've been running nearly all my life
londons got its gimmicks
that's fighting talk where i'm from
dont hate me 'cause i'm handsome
if you stay you wont be sorry
kooky too
and if the homework brings you down
cos we believe in you
and here i'll stay holding on to you
to open up the gate
i find the sunshine beckons me
and all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply'
what did we do wrong why did it die
well if you want it come and make a stance
if you're willing to change the world
you're my rock of empathy my dear
mon cher
but we're the generation that's got to be heard
so come on
hair is the new hat brown is the new black
your conversation is boring as hell oh well
your clothes are very kitch
you're scared of the poor and needy
human league cover
remember me
embraced him like a lover would
and though they talked for just a little time
do you know how much it hurts
i'd rather jump and run away
in the wind i had candlelight
somewhere in between
i'm a love cheat
i hardly know you but i like your figure
and you're looking so sweet
you want me
in black and white
there's not enough minutes in the hour
just want to love somebody right now

in love
i wanna know

making me feel so short
gonna need more and it aint just physical
why dont you let me be
scarlet billows start to spread
bet you mack is back in town
to reel 'em in
i split myself both times and laugh till i cry
smoking kills
i know you're there to pull me through arent you

opposite of you cheers applause
her velvet glove knocks me down and down and down and down
why cold cold touch mmm what must i do do do do

other the arms that held me so tight

i know i havent been so true to you
all the other guys got their eyes on you
'cos i love you mm i love you
i think its got to go
oh my crazy arms are empty now
oh girl you really do now
so call that dying slow
women in houses i cant deal with their heat
same old expressions same familiar old themes
she said maybe you will i said whatever you do is whatever you do
i've been caught red handed i dont know what i'm gonna do
when i woke up wet with the moon in my eyes
a kiss to build a dream on
oh gimme your lips for just a moment
give me a kiss before you leave me
and my imagination
but there's one thing i'm lacking
and the chance of romance
to be left with a woman like you
gotten stuck in the groove
i know such enchantment can be 'cos it happened one evening to me
poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
was that a dream or was it true
but aint love a bitch
by the underground
oh dont underestimate the strength of it
aint love a bitch
aint love a bitch aint love a bitch
i swear i'll alway's be strong
when there's someone that you know
that it's all for one and all for love
more than the rivers that run inland
let's make it all all for one
and i can sing the blues
he played the vibes till nine and read from ten to four
hotel dogs are knockin on my door
rod stewart 197576
look out kids it's the f b i
he played upside down he played inside out
two night of singin nearly out on the end
smiling from her head to her feet
she said look what's your game
who's that girl watch that girl
i said slow dont talk so fast
when she moves me
all right now baby
it was hot
get away boy from my daughter
bring it down now
she's desirable she's mine
i said ' woman you're foolin around with a man that just dont fit'
but it was alright for an hour it was alright for a day
it was alright for an hour it was alright for a day
how precious did that grace appear
and all the world go free
did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowedlaid your head on a
and that coat which never lets you downit never never never lets you down
and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky
fly on my sweet angel forever i will be by your side
you better think again
aint nothing to worry about
she'll cover me for a little while
oh but one day soon
nothing to worry about
and things like third dimension
a kiss is still a kiss
never out of date
as time goes by
and man must have his mate
it's friday night i'm all alone still a bachelor
attractive female wanted
no compliments
in the evening some canteen
to mr hugh heffner confidentially
well maybe just a half a drink more put some music on while i pour
i simply must go baby it's cold outside
you've really been grand your eyes are like starlight now
well i really shouldnt alright
when i give my heart again
optimism's my best defense
baby jane i've said all i want to say
i know it's gonna last forever
touched my soul
she's got a hold on me
and i tell them i say
at last my heart has found a home
i beg you for mercy
in love with someone else
you're crazy if you think
dont you know it's torture
you dont know how strong
dont you know it's torture
a house in iceland
though not a single word was spoken
told me so well you knew
and you appear in all your splendor
you fill my eager heart with such desire
but time's on my side so nevertheless
see all confusion in my cloudy eyes
to never give up on a dream
you gotta break all the records set
to be free to be free to be free
who never gave up on a dream
when the summer shower is through
in the roaring traffic's boom
could i have a minute of your time
than to never love at all
let a light in your soul
when your eyes collide let your spirits fly
aint it better to lose in love than never love at all
as my money got low
nobody wants you
your ex wife who says
but if i ever get my hands
when you're down and out
the rain poured down the wind swept avenue
what am i doing
keep your body under lock and key
arriving at three
my regards to all your family
oh god i wish i was home tonight
gerry goffin carole kinga side of mercury 6052 371 1973
that there is truth somewhere
oh no not my baby
not my baby not my baby
oh no not my baby
words of wisdom but i wasnt list'ning
only a boy
dressing to kill
and all their rebelious vows
nobody can stop
i spied an old hobo in the doorway he lay
one look at his face
to look on the world
ron wood ronnie lane 1973vocals by ronnie lane
when i was stronger
makes you wonder where you are
when i was stronger
the radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
somebody somewhere
a lot of pretending passion
a lotta people aint got passion
all you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
even the president needs passion
from soho down to brighton
plays by intuition
cant hear those buzzes and bells
and he just does the rest
crimson dress that clings so tight
when she walks by
a parasite that fed on doubt
i'm ready now ready now for what i gotta give
to defend you
are you ready now ready now for how you gotta give
if i gave you time to change my mind
someone like you makes it easy to give
rebel heart i wanna discover
rebel heart you cant deny it
she said 'it's fairly obvious i aint attracted to you
when you did that to me i knew that it had to be
oh yeah
she was sitting reading baudelaire
red hot in black
hey boys mystery
took a walk along the avenue
across the street the river runs
with the words 'i love you' rolling off my tongue
with the words 'i love you' rolling off my tongue
with the words 'i love you' rolling off my tongue
with the words 'i love you' rolling off my tongue
she goes and goes
at such a cost
aint life unkind
home again 'cross the sea
to be with you who can say
oh lord to be near you to be free
and somehow you make it better
take away all my sadness
take away my sadness
there's a calm before the storm
comin down on a sunny day
yeah
but somehow i played without you
running out of time
inside your eyes
'cause i need you and you know
love stop making a fool out of me
as a trooper pulled them over
amanda said this cannot be
the old courthouse was crowded
in a cell below the courthouse
she bowed her head and cried
no matter what you do
she cried out desperately
forever
it's gotta be a quarter to four
you promise all kinds of fun
imagine how my daddy felt
i love you honey
how long has this been going on

all over my neighborhood
i know i know i know
the north pole i have charted

i've been consulted by franklin d
blue for the tears black for the night's fears
woman it's fading away from me
i can feel it in my bones
oh away from me
cause i only have eyes for you dear
i dont know if we're in a garden
apologised then realised
promises made in the heat of the night
collected lovers like butterflies
verse seven is never clear
quietly now while i turn a page
withered up my future my life is filled with gloom
looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane
to give your heart a song to sing
that you and i could never be
but most of all
we'd bring it on home with the right song played at the right time
dont sing so serious you make me feel so sadbut if i was true to myself
something deep down in my soul said 'cry boy'
that i been held to my lips now baby
maybe it's my mistake to show this love i feel inside
a hundred times i have you back
i love you this old heart weeps for you
readin playboy on a hot afternoon
she took all of my money

there were bells on a hill
of dawn and dew

or a fast back mid engine porsche
but maybe they're right i dont know

here's a fellow in blue jeans who's dancing with an older queen
here's a man in evening clothes how he got here i dont know
until the real thing comes along
i just cant make you understand
remember there's always tomorrow
dont let temptation surround you

the bright blessed day the dark sacred night

listen hereyou dont have to love me always cindy
i've watched your friends cindy laugh in my face
who must be in the know
from major to minor
with everything i owned on my back
nobody putting rings around my neck
if being right means being without you
if loving you is wrong i dont wanna be right
and am i wrong trying to hold on
i dont wanna be right
when i stepped in soakinbeer down the cola machine
although i must have looked a creep
she took me way way away down yonder
there has to be a reason
everyone needs somebody
a little miss understood
and if she walks the streets
is your figure less than greek
is your mouth a little weak
escaping from my wedding day
such a deadly silence
i ran to the door
'cause tomorrow i may be gone
just an invitation would have been just fine
i did not hear from you
maybe your protected from all that you do
so i walked on down the line and waited for you
i will cry
well come on honey and show me a real good time
tear it up tear it up
the memory of all that
the way you change my life
no they cant take that away from me
yes you are
the very last bus home in the rain
i'll be a sleek one of a kind
what am i gonna do i'm so in love with you
village children always fighting for fair share
just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
aint been to work in weeks
hey i'm a lovesick son
i might as well just be a cockroach on the floor
when she drove by in a black corvette

chorus
you know dan with his long legs flying
when danny crossed over the finish line
his lips are dry her heart is gently pounding

and it's been so long since i had a good time
smash some glass act like trash if i want
let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street
missed the saturday dance
been invited on dates
awfully different without you
they have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
i walk down your street and past your gate
all my dreams all my dreams fall like rain
never get to bed before sunup
always get my best friends drunk
tuesday take a taste for dinner
i dont mind stone cold sober again
and wishin that you
i know i know i know
hmm
hmm
and when i see them boys
under the big city lights
i got a beat up old mustang
under the big city lights
i'll be the darling of masses
under the big city lights
it's dynamite on friday night
i love all the many charms about you
through these misty eyes
in the pouring rain
just for auld lang syne
and the swirling pipes
to a woman that'll spend your bread'
i was accused
i wasnt ready for that no no
oh yeah i was glad i found her
i couldnt quote you no dickens shelley or keats
the finest years i ever knew
and i knew from watching you
you may lose them one day
i'm just waitin for the heartaches to come
standing in the shadows of love
now hold on a minute
without your love the love that i need
didnt i do the best for you didnt i
standing in the shadows of love
'cause you've taking away all my reason for living
with misery my only company
getting ready for the heartaches to come
didnt i treat you right now baby didnt i
without your love the love that i need
always reminding me that we're apart
and each kiss an inspiration
in my heart it will remain
but i would not change a thing
two hearts gently poundin
but i would not change a thing
you always said the cards would never do you wrong
long enough to get you by
you're still the same
never found a dime in a gutter
monday you can make up for that
stone cold sober again
i dont wanna see it end
i cant stand the silence
put in some trust dont give up on us
dont give up on us
yesterday was full of passion
hey did i tell you that my name was called disturbanceand i'll shout and scream
wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed
i'll steal away steal away
sweet lady mary's gate i swear i'll be bound
then she became a rock 'n roll music fan
five thousand tongues are screaming out more and more
dancin and hummin a rock 'n roll melody
and the famous singer sang and bowed away
you come to me with open arms
you wear those things that turn my head
look me straight in the eyes and tell me
just you alone filled me with ahhhhhhhh
you should care for me
i hear those trumpets blow again
and the ace of hearts is high
now i prove again
i'm gonna give my all again
standing in the cold rain
it's a heartache
it aint wise to need someone
love him till your arms break
yes it is
listen
but then i used to love her but it's all
it's not the street lights of some old street of dreams
but i've seen it shining in your eyes you know what i mean
how glad the many millions
it's not that you're attractive
the world will pardon my mush
but i can weather the storm
so i will weather the storm
i got a heater coultnt be better will be
and i'm sorry i made you cry no
i'm just a jealous guy
and the night before

and make love just like a woman yes she does

but wait a minute

and a nature quite forgiving

you can make me dance you can make me sing
is far too proud not to keep on tryin
you can make me do just any old thing
just keep on loving me darling
you go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
you go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
you go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
pleading with me to take you back
i heard you were living down in brazil
but recently my opinions changed
please please go away
and help me to make a new start

or he wouldnt get in touch with me
but i blew it without even tryin
that i gotta get back to work

paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
he said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way

spinning yarns that were so lyrical
but my heart cried out for you
you're a symphony and a play
many times i've thought to leave

oh how soon we changed
my arms are empty
i know i would die if i ever found out
i called up and pleaded
get yourself out go along with the crowd
somebody special is longing for you
waiting for you crying
who cant find love in this world
i'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
i'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
someone to watch over me
the honesty's too much
still trapped within my truth
and drive you to your knees
but then the passion flares again
i gave up the purest love
denies like you
she cracks like you
come back to me please
but she aint you
sonny
no matter what you say
until then my little friend i'll be unsatisfied

to be calm when you've found something going on
father

i dont care if shes underfeed
why waste time looking at the waist line
if they can talk talk all day
gone forever more

dream of you every night
are those your eyes
now i understand what love is love is
for the first time i'm seeing who you are
and for the first time i am looking in your eyes
surround you when you're far from home
may your guiding light be strong
i'll be hoping that i served you well
it's a yearnin for my own back yard
i'll be home before the milk's upon the door
should the blood run cold in my veins
down to gasoline alley where i started from
get back get back

get back to where you once belonged
oh yeah
i believed everything you said
and is life as sweet in my absence
you'll need all of your snakes
are you ready now ready now for what you gotta give
with the girl i had for years
i know i'm gonna crack
with this hanging round my neck
i'm down looks like i'm coming down again
and if you're goin when the snowflakes storm
in the brightness of my day
she was once a true love of mine
many times i've often prayed
what this old world's comin to

we got one chance baby
and i know it's been hard sometimes
give your man a big kiss
it may be the bossanova

what in the world to do
good morning little schoolgirl
was invited by a skinny girl
i was glad to come
was escorted by a friendly slag
the skinny girl made it clear
ever seen a blind man cross the road
four and twenty blackbirds in a cakeand bake them all in a pie
he's telling her she's beautiful
ten days of rain
we even talked of children
i can hear the freight train whistle
will she ever come back again
thanks for the memory
you might have been a headache but you never were a bore
we said goodbye with a highball
i saw you last night and got that old feeling
once again i seemed to feel that old yearning
well that's all right my mama
i can only give you love that lasts forever
that's all
that's all
c'mon sister i aint quite as dumb as i seem
you got me in a balltrap
you got me in a balltrap
on the midnight trampoline
you're giving me honestly
the best days of my life
and a day without you at this point my dear
i would have given you all of my heart
just to help me dry the tears that i've cried
but i'm sure gonna give you a try
georgie boy was gay i guess
cast out by the ones he loves
everybody loved georgie boy
out of a darkened side street came
a crowd gathered the police came
georgie was a friend of mine
so called liberated days
after all i've said and done for him
along the boulevards he'd cruise
arm in arm they meant no wrong
he just pushed his luck a little too far that night
'cos youth a mask but it dont last
bring over some of your old motown records
there's a soul in the city
luck is believing you're lucky
but when we walk that darkened stairway
echo to the alley down below
that brings this sensation oh no
i need no soft lights to enchant me
i'm happy as a king and foolish
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you my love
and the way you look tonight
with each word your tenderness grows
darling
while gently strumming guitars
this rambler had been finally dealt
yeah yeah yeah
yeah the wild horse runs free forever
but there's something i've been waiting for to tell you
and forget the truest love you'll ever know
and still my heart has wings
a telephone that rings but who's to answer
they seem to bring you so near to me
roll them dice and pour the wine
i might have been a hero
man keeps talking on the radio
i might have been prime minister
men are not a new sensation
i couldnt sleep
cher
bewitched bothered and bewildered am i
and now we're like sweet seventeen a lot
big bayou where did you go
into the gulf of mexico
big bayou carry me home
struck down by the time i was ten by an illness
i wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman
oh but but you know what i'm trying to sayreally what i'm trying to say is
i took a rose in texas
i got a limousine 'n bodyguard and chaperone
all the juicy little scandals
you saw me standing alone
and when i looked to the moon it turned to gold
now i'm no longer alone
then good luck came a knocking at my door
blue days all of them gone
the same old ritual the same old dance
anybody that'll listen
somebody's cherries need pickin body wishes
keep you warm like a summer breeze
what do i say
who'll be the one
calling way down the line
all i wanna do is sing
cause you're too late too late
janis and jimi cant you hear me
wrong side of my daddy
to change me now

but now i know that i only hurt myself
oh honey bring it to me bring your sweet loving
and i know that you you thrill me
well you thrill me
i wanna breathe when you breathe
ah can you see what i see
there he goes moving across the water
i've found more clouds of gray
she's not for me
in a leather number wrapped in chains
but i'm shy shy shy shy shy
and never see himself
they were so well suited
they couldnt look each other in the eyes
had hits with every song
sometimes i worry about you darlin
do you liked to be left alone
can i get a witness
i want a witness
somebody somewhere
grains of sand one by one
where do we go from here
where do we go from here
originally by bob dylan
i'd be lost if not for you
if only i'd have listened to all of my closest friends
if only i'd come home at night instead of stayin out for one more drink
but it's only love and love aint real it's only a four letter word
now you're scared to open and give your love again
open your heart and let love love again
darlin if if we fall in love tonight
darlin if if we fall in love tonight
that this heart of mine embraces
i'll always think of you that way
let me see you through
so if you're mad get mad

i'll stand by you
that i'm in the mood for love
why stop to think of whether
david bentley
i dont care if i ever know
on the pad before my eyes

oh these places had their meanings
i know i'll often stop and think about them
i tried to keep my sanity

i will always love you
oh no not again
maybe this womans just all i need
she put a little love in this heart of mine
rev it up
just where did it get ya
he hung you up so you cut me right down

sweet symbols in the moonlight
why must i just give you your way
might never be cross or try to be boss
it had to be you
two can make a light shine through
it takes two baby
you know it takes two
it takes two baby
long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed
that all i longed for long ago was you
how's that son of mine yeah

as any man can deserve to be
and it's so much more than that
be ready cause when i do
hey baby i love it
got to get me some south america sun

so i'm much obliged for the pure white ride
love hurts love scars love wounds
i really learned a lot really learned a lot
made to make you blue
but somehow i always seem to
just give me a chance
i wanna feel the breathless end
no they wont let you get away
who's right who's wrong
it's late september and i really should be back at school
you stole my soul and that's a pain i can do without
or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
another sunny honeymoon
think what a year can bring yes
most every night
judge say budge right into jail
i do not mean you trouble dont put me down dont get upset
please understand me i've no place i'm calling you to go
i'll say goodbye to coloradowhere i was born and prob'ly raised
through the darkest nights i've ever known
so the next few lines come really hard
no mandolin wind couldnt change a thing
vate all our cares
the zoo
sweet pushcarts gently gli ding by
and eat baloney on a roll
in a couple of hours i'll be drivin home to the one i love
and cant you see that it's mine for me
they'll never be another one like mine for me
but inside his coat his wife found a note
fired from his job and missing his children
phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment
wont you give it all up
oh lord please let this last
and now when there's moonglow
is my demeanor that embarrassing
why dont you move me move me
that aint really asking much
tell me what i've done to you to justify this ridicule
i want you
i want you
i want you
but i want you
i want you i want you i want you
i want you
1000 times blind see me fallin see me hit the floor
i open my eyes i cant see myself
be so hard and cause you so much pain
so mad so mean the pain remained unseen
and you get to go on so go on
you never were one of them they could have never been your friends
i'm digging a hole inside myself
never know these thoughts of mine
dont destroy me
but still i dont care
even if all else rejection
i see what sweats you
because to me it never meant that much
i'm going i'm gone
cant you find a better way to deal with this place
you send them all away
if i could make wishes true
it wont let you go
knives in your mind
i remain burned beyond recognition
i remain burned beyond recognition
but what do you do when you do what you want
why the hell do you act like 1
you gotta have a gun then you're just another pig to me
and now you're dying for it
i want nothing right now i want to pull it out
i think i'm gonna download my ind
i want nothing right now i want to pull it out
their tongues are hanging from out of their mouths
when ya kick me
let me feel that your hatred is real
when ya break me i am divine i am divine
divine divine divine divine divine divine divine
why give a fuck about it man do it do it
well i realize i'm a bad case
the closer i get the farther away i feel
the closer i get the farther away you feel
away away away away away away away away away away away away away
crime likes burning like a heylow
and the city is in my blood like a curse
i'm caving in and i dont know why
where am i going
i'm being followed around again around and around again
self doubt put your hands on my shoulder
i'm being followed around again around and around again
a pack of lies and spend night after hammered night
and it hurts to keep learning the same lessons and pain
i am a fool i know because it's all i know i am a fool i know
the things that you think
you see how hard they'll shove you
so hard to deal with the ones who arent real
your self respect
i got gun in my mouth blues
pull it pull it pull it pull it
i got hard and i stayed hard
all eyes turned up to the hero charismatic icon animal man
you're the only 1 who understands
that one thing that you might not know there'll be another messiah
i have all i need
i have all i need
dont hold me down
i cant live without
and now you're desperate and in need of human contact
i'll tear rip your mind up i'll burn your soul
you'll never forget me wou wanna know why
please just give me more chance i'll never lie to you again no
feel dark and cold alone it burns me
walk in to a crowded room i start to freeze
knife in eyes and point me at my prey
you alienate yourself
so you can criticize yourself
try some introspection
when i see you seeing me
it becomes hard to see the face
now the mask is cracking
should be flashing as you reapper
could you do some damage to the shape i'm in
leave your mark on me make an impression
how i lie and try to deny
misery depression elation all mine
you see what i mean
on my way to the cage
on my way to the cage
your world's inside my fist
i'm tripping on pain and feeling fine
come closer
its a pain
phone starts ringin you uplook it dosent matter who it is you dont care
hated alienated thrown down turned away turned inside
ohhhhh
these blues come down
i go back in my head i go ugly in my head
another mound
so much loss
seems like i am saying good bye again
so young
so sick of saying good bye again
good bye
ever time you reached down to me
i tell you that i am fine
at least i dont lie
it stands in my place
of what i've been and what i've seen
am i
'coz when you start to doubt yourself the real world will eat you alive
hard times are gettin harder the liars are acting strong
'coz it's time to go go go yeah hou
when you start to doubt yourself the
desperation crept in from all the things i kept in
i know for sure
i'm hear but i know i am out of there
you will do anything
hey i must have been out of my mind
i go all night
and hear i am keen eyed my mind is low to the ground
at the back of mind i hear the engines whine
i make the blood burn
i starve starve
and the house of cards that you built on the cheap shot guilt
or you fall down
so we better stop it now because we're tearing eachother apart
when i see you i wanna tell you but then i lose the words
and it tears me apart
so we better stop it now
when i see you
to see if i'm ok
and you'll know its the end of something
and know there's nothing
the laughter's died away and now i see the joke was on me
of something
i've wasted so much time
i'm trying to keep it straight in my mind
i'm trying to get it straight
trying to find something
and i'm tired real tired
turned inside out for all to see
you're a criminal
entertain me entertain me entertain me entertain me
i'm a live but i dont know why my thoughts threat me
you're talking to the living dead
what can you do to me what can you say
or just plain bums me out
dont stop rollin when you're rolling on the real wheel
sometimes it's all you can do is go and put a gun to your brain
bridge
you gotta keep movin in a positive forward direction
what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what do you do when you want to get over
what do you do
i've got a wantless need
what have i got i've got everything
i'm not feelin too nice today
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
the human wreckage the human wreckage
i heard the boys talk the talk to the boys
i wont try to patronize you
you push it out and your anger is blind and you see me as an enemy
take a good look wonderin what ya lookin at when ya lookin at me
you didnt need to do that to me
i didnt want it and i couldnt get away
i'm sorry i still feel this pain inside
i've got do something and i've got to do it now
lookin toward myself and all the people that i see
can you deal with it
all i need is a deep black sky
sittin here while the sun shines bright
and now you start to cry and say
nosferatu now you're way too old to kill
and the morning sun to shine
there's a reason for cries
pain in the end that's the roll of the dice
and the winds scream in anger
the winds scream in anger
i walk around in circles i walk alone and blue
beyond the sundown would you lie to me in vain
way beyond the last sundown
blessed are the innocent
calls to the world
in the power of heartblood
calls to the world
the fire the wire didnt stay
the winds of change blew so fast
when at night the winds blew cold
you who's burried at this lonely place
if you've been a cold killer who believed their lies
losers winners all the same
man will fight and still dont know
man hits wife and wife beats kid
the world the stars the rain
man must play and always win
i've seen the devils face
all the dreams all the tears
i've seen 'em up again
all the dreams all the tears
just to make your fortune
with eyes of a stranger you'll always be blind
cant get out you'll never stand on lies
someday may rule the show
i walk the line an here i go
beyond the morning's grey
for once in my life
yesterday come what may still
for once in my tears
little boy standin by the window
all my life i tried to understand
promise everything you want between the lines
four horsemen ride down lost highway
words unspoken driven blind
tomorrow to see
so time will rise and time fill fade
a skeleton once free
someone's pleasure is another one's pain glissando
i believe someone's lust is the price to pay
i believe it's time to go
wisdom and desire
to reach the skies of hate and love
into evil hounds of doom
of pain and despair
reach for the sky and get away get away
but you broke my heart in two
no dice no roll no spark no fire
mine all mine no ego no brain
no war no peace no rules no riot
has got only two letters but aint easy to say
i've seen too much that's the price you pay
on the loney road to mystery bay
told me welcome home at mystery bay
it's giving you misery and pain
for billions of years since the very first date
some conscience is fallin
the dark side of fate
and with every mile and every town
set me free insanity savannah
and it's all about the lies
but there's one thing you cant buy at all
but she couldnt give emotions
she was young and pretty but it never rang
overkill pay the bill the writing's on the wall
it's obvious you see we've found the magic key
be well citizen your future is now
the 21st century says hello
when your heart calls you a liar
well the mystery of beeing right or wrong
'cause life is just a journey
stay gold when you're lost in days of blue
old at heart
try to drink their shame away
in this world made of pain
the ghosts of the dead gave 'em the magic key
sol est rex diei luna est regina noctis
the sun is the queen of the day the moon is the king of the night
love and respect
sometimes your dreams cut like a knife
the raven sold his dreams in hell
the wheel stopped turning
i face the final curtain
i have to hide my smile remains
and some like to hear me sing
the sidewalk angels gave him a smile
he lost his wife and kid
and they left with a smile on the face
a little boy stands by the waterfall
another lie another battlecry
the little boy's now grey to pass away
then she gave you a kiss and turned out the light
one for the dreamer in a world made of stone
some give all when all give some
time will show you a reason why
and everybody calls your name
and all i know for sure my dear is that the truth is gonna burn you down
silent memories hurt my brain
the wrong way out but the right way in
city to city from show to show
that we might never see
through the fire we will ride
and we dance to the beat of the night
but nobody listens when now of puppets
sometimes your mind is getting
ups and downs
ups and downs
sometimes emotions grow
this one's dedicated
honesty seems out of date
it's a warning noone fears
and cares are buried under sand
asphalt deserts streets of pain
the one and only liar
hey mister cant you tell me
his ghost is ridin on the wind
the chaser the mud and the seed
a price no one payed
for pleasure for fortune and fame
we gods are left mightless now
we'll burry our tears in time
now
why dont you think
though shalt be done
where do we go
the birth of a disease
cant we take the night away
and millions died in vain
maybe i'm a prisoner of the everlasting rule
and i'll never be like you
and i'll never go back to silence
way beyond the distance
when the fogs cry freedom
in the deep of the night
seems like finally i would find
i take a dice and let it roll
where the rats were the readers
cold september day dark and grey
and fun
you got people always tryin to think
back on your feet that's the price you got to pay
i cant find a reason why
what the future days may bring
the wheels may turn but we should remain
lucifer said i'll do the best i can
lucifer
love is all you need to be
god i want you to take
and after they had won this war
i want you to live
from the home at the golden pond
it cant be tamed and cant be caught
but lucifer said relax it's alright
god answered
take me back back to light
lust is a killer lust is a test
so lust is a test
he was the rising flag of violence
mephisto just a painted face
he's the inner voice of darkness
another love has died
and i cry
i hate your good
so here's to you my last farewell
all i can say is i hate you
i hate your tricks your matches too
to mystery bay
and beyond the waters someone waits for me
like an eagle on his wings up in the skies
all the pain all the pride
eyes of lust and dreams of black
it is a fact that most crimes committed
lost in the darkness strangers on the loose
some say yey some say no but in the end
sittin in a streetcafe in barcelona
it's a nice day for a funeral
some hookers on the other side give me a smile
had a pretty good life here just plugging into my machine for the day then
ii temples of syrinx
we work together common sons
let the banners be unfurled
beautiful
and joyously screams out its pain
voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall
there's something here as strong as life
i cant believe you're saying
just think about the average
i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure
an oracle confronts me there
to claim the home where they belong
the dream is still in my head
my lifeblood
when these days have passed long ago
beating down the multitude and
cities full of hatred fear and lies
the natives smile and pass along
wreathed in smoke in lebanon
we'll hit the stops along the way
i feel the way you would
i remember
reaching to the alien shore
for you and me race is not a definition
for you and me sex is not a definition
take this heart of stone
remind us who we are
let your children rise up before you
let your children rise up before you
chorus
there is tic and toc in atomic
pride reduced to humble pie
miracles will have their claimers
the night turns thin
goddess in my garden
alter in my image
a secret face a touch of grace
complicate me
wonders of the world they wrought
we build our defenses a place of safety
a way to take us out of ourselves
a future of eternal light
or the will is too weak
between the sea and sky
cant bring the world to me
moving picture
promise offered in the east
i want to look at life
free the dungeons of the innocent
lessons taught but never learned
still dont believe we're fadin
maybe it's too late
i dont wanna see that
i said left out in the cold
chorus
fantastic dreams come true
get money get that dough
benzino got bitches that love to undress
hold tight shorty right dont bite
yo' strategy some pimp tragedy
bonafide hustlers 'bout that cream
scarface
up in bing town snatchin bitches off the mini six deuce
get that dough get that dough
dont give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll
i do the best that i can
in the silence between whisper and shout
the gap between actor and act
reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
in between time
bright images flashing by
down to brother can you spare
walking uneasy streets

when the dust has cleared
all the hope and glory
and sometimes i feel it's true
in the whole wide world there's no magic place
in softest voice there's an acid tongue
by tor knight of darkness
rejoicing echoes as the dawn is nearing
cant get away cant get away
even when i close my eyes i cant help but see
or let the pain remain behind you
the weight of the load
with an iron will
it's not the heat
ceiling unlimited
of idle minds and idle hands
eyes on the prize
laughter is infectious
optimism spreads
reflected in another pair of eyes
shouting guards and smoking guns
dont feel the hunger
to run in our streets
it only burns my skin
nowhere we can rest
as the red tide covers the shore
noble yo funk doc my man musiq check it out aowww
no ice with no blue and tires with no shoe and
musiq
tell me how you feel about me so i know how to deal with you
when the only person gettin hurt is youuuu ohhhh
that half a pound i loaned your pops he aint flip
what is on yo' mind tell me what you wanna do
i can learn to co exist
i can learn to close my eyes
but never ever win
sunlight dances through the leaves
you're wanting to return
till the twilight where the sun is gone
i reach my final day
we go out in the world and take our chances
faith is cold as ice
that's the way that lady luck dances
the small gets big it's a rig
what's the deal spin the wheel
and roll the bones
and shouted at the sky
scars of pain
when i think about the people
hungry child in the desert
make them sensitive again
we're not insensitive
it's a victimless crime
it ought to be second nature
it's hard to take the heat
and the phases of the moon
with the things that last
i'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that i was in a jam
originally by the yardbirds
now the trees are almost green
how many times do you hear it
showdont tell
you can raise objections
show me dont tell me
let's try to keep it short
i dont know he's right in the centre y'knowhutimean uhh uhh
reason why the player who away a few say that too
chorus
no entry let's keep a hood rhymin shit a party people
same ruler movin cowardness out of this
there's a rapper i know many interested in
although sometime the reign may slip
throw your hands up throw your hands up
waiting for the winds of change
looking for
what you live is your own story
as the waves crash in
where are the words to answer you
who cares what a fool believes
what i beleive is true
what are you trying to do
have you lived a lifetime today
trust to your instincts
spit it out
trial under fire
spit it out
stick it out
an insulated border
subdivisions
drawn like moths we drift into the city
somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights
you gotta work late
told the boss i was sick
to the united nations
target mass appeal
that you can dance to
he can put a target on the market
they know the fantasies
that's entertainment
of life
i wasnt praying for magic
among the silent temples
i stood there like a mystic
in the peaceful haze of harvest time
no one to stick with you till the end
someone on whom you can always depend
i want to be king now not just one more pawn
chorus
leaving my homeland
that you've come you have come for those
chorus
young people speaking their minds
paranoia strikes deep
stop children what's that sound
we can circle around like hurricanes
to the rhythms of the night
a host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance
you can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
in heavens unearthly estate
in the early morning half light
sometimes i'm wrong sometimes i'm right
and i'm not prepared to fight
mind going down into a dark night
solid long ass hair her fingernails they was
she was brollic brollic brollic uhh
they was brollic brollic brollic uhh
knowledge but niggaz get me mad when they bags aint
we the hottest i aint got ta lie to y'all
all the stages we passed through
in a state of grace
through the backstreets of youth
somehow we have stayed
pack up all those phantoms
keep on riding north and west
sunrise in the mirror
to the canyonlands
benevolent universe
is that you've never been right
for me and you
like a rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock
like a teardrop in the ocean a diamond in the waste
half the world waits
half the world talks
half the world tries
hand over fist
i could walk away so proud
is the strength of the common touch
holding my fist to my racing heart
originally by the yardbirds
well i would never make her sad
i said i played this song so many times before
yes i've seen your face before
is it ever gonna ever gonna change again
and all those wasted years
and borrow for a little more
bombs and basement fallout shelters
in the wake of the endless flood
like the heart of the earth would burst
torrents of tropical rain streaming down
mmm oooh oh
my girls sell units like michael in the 80's ugh
stop gettin high off of jealousy
scared to show or tell
repeat chorus
lahdy dahdy in the party nigga
that sometimes catches everyone
between how it is and how it ought to be
between how it is and how it ought to be
i think i'm going bald
dressed in flowing hair
i'm aging every day
girl i need your touch
i'm so into you
verse 3
well i can see what you mean
you can take me you can make me smile in the end
chorus
hey baby the hour is late
i said i like your style
looming low and ominous
not the faulty units in this mad machinery
but he's a lot more afraid of your lying
and the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them
lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire
live and love and dream
to pass an evening with a drink and a friend
time stand still
i let my past go too fast
freeze this moment a little bit longer
experience slips away
the river
and the space he invades
catch the spirit catch the spit
and it dont stop to the beat baby
you got the wrong rappers nigga you better tell em
straight apprehended handcuffed and cant stand it
use to tell my homeboys front me a sack
chorus too hort slink capone
go to class all day you aint gettin enough
you never could make me realise i need em
call the fbi somebody please tell em
now all the little kids cant let it go
if i take her to my house she wont say no
short dogg dont forget the funk motto
moms aint mess with the motherfuckin phone
i've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul
media messiahs preying on my fears
that's why i believe
every step is for respect you either keep it or not
daz a crazy g from the lbc gettin way too crazy
verse two jayo felony
c's walkin on the moon by 2004
they say felony is a way g
pullin whole cards hard niggas playin for keeps
in presence of a real ridah that represent the c rag
they say felony is a way g
he's way too crazy
all that we can do is be reminded
truth is after all a moving target
we disengage we turn the page
praying you'll let me back in
i cant do this myself
of who i've been known to be
the sovereign way that you
what i've become
fading away like an hourglass grain by grain
in a vapor trail
vida de mi vida
corazn natural
vida de mi vida
lgrima perdida
clinging to the wreckage of the lost ship fantasy
and throw it in the cyber sea
on our virtual wings
unstable condition
and the balance distorted
process information at half speed
a tired mind become a shape shifter
no more of his excuses
to the beautiful and the wise
pound the drums with martial beat
ambition for illusion
whassup nate

well you better start changin
well you think that you're right
we are here on the earth
we are here on the earth
and somehow we 're heard
the faces are twisted and grotesque
they say there are strangers who threaten us
and fear walk hand in hand
riding through the range of light to the wounded city
turn up the music and smile
i could live my life
chorus
whuuuuut
if you dont believe nigga get hyper and try it
tai chi kung fu fighting odb hands quick as lightenin
serious men deep in thought misunderstood held the fork
swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind
you was unable plus earn advance
it's strickly thickly dirty and districkly
i scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown
oh i will dine on honeydew
held within the pleasure dome
just another victim of the things he has done
the odds get even the stakes are the same
just another gypsy with a plastic guitar
minimal expressionist post modern neo symbolist

chorus
we want to see all your glory all your glory
read the words that touch my heart
consumed in a single desire
to keep their spark alive
maybe something a little more sane
a rising summer sun
the underfed
lying in the darkness
and i see red
i can see
tears that fall from eyes that only cry
pray and pass the ammunition
we can only bow to the here and now
it seems to leave them partly blind
you know i like em when they're nasty
that was you that i seen on tv last night
someone who can go with the flow with the lights down low oh

10 strangiato theme reprise
lakeside park
crackling driftwood flames
singing songs together
when i teach what i've been taught
just how close i came to missing
you didnt listen again
to keep oneself intact
caught in the camera eye
i dont want to face the killer instinct
the balance can sometimes fail
it's not a matter of laws
for the sake of security
the dancer slows her frantic pace
the writer stare with glassy eyes
some are born to move the world
sr check 1 2 check 1 2
whhhhyyyyyyyyyy

whhhhyyyyyyyyy
you'll make your moomy so proud of you to and
chorus
macy gray
when all around is madness
but these things can still be given
no reason to be sad
imagine a time when it all began
but this was something more
imagine a place where it all began
all the powers that be and the course of history
it's a test of ultimate will
from first to last
more than high performance
first you've got to last
turbulence ahead boy you must be sick in the head
chorus meth tr
you chicks bounce to the music
hit after hit well get who you wanna get
y'all niggaz gon see now party and bullshit
watch this man i got this hot nikks
what still in the game platinum plus
y'all niggaz gon see now
party and bullshit
a little slow now a little stout
dreams transport the ones who need to get out of town
calls her neighbour on the phone
so far so good
exchange of energy
do they make contact
music making contact
with one another
visions of splendor
cinderella man
purposeful motion
sometimes in confusion
the more that things change
chorus
closer to the heart
it was long after midnight
i'll be around
dont go too far
i'll be around
this magic day when super science
the air is charged
scorching blast of golden fire
i went to the crossroads fell down on my knees
you can run you can run tell my friend willie brown
but it chooses the uphill climb
cut to the chase
about the way things used to be
you may be right
six stars of the northern cross
to be destroyed
on my ship the rocinante
spinning whirling
when our weary world was young
i bring truth and understanding
the people were delighted
in quest of dionysus
i will soothe your primal fears
and the gods watched from afar
in a cloud of doubts and fears
some who did not fight
but i have no shape or form
i feel a silent scream begin inside
on a world of doubt and fear
we can run alone and free
making arrows out of pointed words
nothing to explain
for you and me when all such things agree
he'd love to spend the night in zion
because for strangers and arrangers
there's no swimming in the heavy water
chorus
watching from satellites
absolute
and our seven years go by like one
there is barely time to go outside and play
one sniff at the hydrant
on the edge of sleep i was driting for half the night
i run between the shadows
anywhere but here
just a shield of rusty wire
rested and fearless cheered by your nearness
a picture book of the rivers
she's got a sister out in vegas
wondering what our dreams might be worth
a starry highway traced on the map of the sky
on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
driven to the margin of error
driven in driven to the edge
but it's my turn to drive
yo yo yo yo
and dju know that the nigga cant freak like me
tell me what it's gonna be
you know that he aint no freak like me and dju dunno
redman
then i'm like yo
dru hill def squad if you askin us
i can raise my eyes to
like what others see
and my third hand grace
not content with being cool
in the secret wells of emotion
sometimes our big splashes
we are planets to each other
just between us
chorus
in the house where love lies dying
no matter what they say
in everyday glory
no matter what they say
if the future's looking dark
running on empty
face up there's still time to turn the game around
i need some feedback
you get all smoothed out inside
like a stone in the river
and i believe in love
beneath the deep white silence
chorus 1
i lift my hands just as i am i'm letting go of false control
electrical changes are charging up the dawn
and the next it's rolling over me
you can almost see the circuits blowing
you can almost see the circle growing
one day i fly through a crack in the sky
and blow for blow i'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors
they want us in jails with bails too high to bond but am i the don
gotta hold the cake my grandmoms had dreams
see the thinly related to everything in the street
we bust feelins dump bodies in crushed buildings
i'm one in a million get on the deal already
pun and prince we're walkin on kings like a son of a bitch
make em wet they pants
chorus 2x
my brain floatin away above you niggas like i make time pause
i see the middle kingdom between heaven and earth
yet we keep looking through
better peoplebetter foodand better beer
better the pride that resides
cause you used to bring me flowers
baby our love's not meant to be
i dont know just what to do
here we govertigo
dont touch that dial
dont change that station
hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom
the boy lies in the grass with one blade
autumn woods and winter skies
like the music of the spheres
too many things on my mind
big money hold the prize
on a tumble of the dice
sometimes knocking castles down
big money make mistakes
i placed no trust in a faith that was ready made
the way the big wheel spins
taking your chances you'll have the right answers
trying to change the mode crack the code
unit one's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits
i grim faced and forbidding
to a soft spring rain
the focus is sharp in the city
alive in the streets of the city
i dont have an explanation
you're not sure what's going on here
gravity and distance
every muscle tense to fence the enemy within
every breath a static charge
i in the valley
and they're open very wide
gives my heart no peace
i live from breath to breath
iii no one at the bridge
the wheel in my own hands
but there's no one there to hear
i catch the scent of ambergris
pacify my troubles with
my heart will lie beside you
draw another goblet
another doubtful fear
hear the dancing waters
life is just a candle and a dream
i'm in motion
why such different fortunes and fates
such a lot of pain on the earth
the golden one or scarred from birth
only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengeance
shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies the necromancer keeps watch with
spectres numb with fear
from labyrinths below
electrical storm in your veins
dreamers turn to look at the cars
made surrender seem all right
nothing noble in your fate
'cause i am your lady
'cause i am always by your side
the sound of your heart beating
sometimes i am frightened
somewhere i've never been
they call me the seeker
'cause i never smile
yeah but look at my face aint this a smile
electro magnetic force
my heart goes out to you
nothing changes faster
than the speed of love
a companion unobtrusive
emotional feedback on timeless wavelength
chorus
they say the oaks are just too lofty
so the maples formed a union
beneath his hat the strangeness lies
you wake up lost in an empty town
come explore your dreams' creation
take uptake up
if i die tonightit would be ok
if i die tonightit would be ok
cause i finally found what most i've been searching for my whole damn life
any girl in the world could have easily known me better
the more we think we know about
or the african sun
and we are entertained
chorus
to reflect upon our own
a quantum leap forward
their world is fashioned
not as market campaigns
sensitive open and strong
each and ev'ry day
my knees are startin gettin weak
time is a spiral space is a curve
you just dont get it
hide in your shell let the world go to hell
it's just erotica hypnotica
to keep his nature pure
he's a radio receiver
he's not concerned with yesterday
he only introduced me to a wider reality
who plays a hero's role
when i heard that she was gone
everybody's buying
hero not the handsome actor
without memory or desire
the morning says the answer is yes
dream a walk in the wilderness
in a willingness to risk defeat
the greatest act can be
it went right by me
well i guess we all have these feelings
between these two directions
some of them burned on our ceilings
it's not a place
it's a gift for the giving
that rocks the cradle
come and rest let my love be your bed
chorus
talk of a time without fear
while a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn
the wheel against the rules
here i hide in the heart of the city
i'm not one with a sense of proportion
if i could wave my magic wand
my temperature's rising
thrill to be alive
the point of the journey is not to arrive
the point of the needle moving back and forth
turn up light and sound
is not to arrive
jump to the ground
a brilliant red barchetta
adrenaline surge
shoots towards me two lanes wide
i leave the giants stranded at the riverside
what's her name i cant tell you no
we just end up as nothing but friends
what's her name i cant tell you no
after midnight we're gonna let it all hang down
after midnight we're gonna let it all hang down
'cause i aint going down anymore
some call him fear some call him righteousness
let me tell you something
by eric clapton and rick danko
all our past times should be erased
you know i dont count the loss
since i first met you baby i never knew what i was missing
you turn around and find another ticket
seems you've got to ride another horse
nothing in this world can make me stay
chorus
anyday anyday i will see you smile
and the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
like hearts made of diamond love will prevail
i'd do anything anything you can dream of
well you dont treat me baby like you used to do
but i aint got nobody to bury me when i'm dead and gone
you use me to get you anything you wanted
and it's you pretty baby
chorus
now i know that i'm one of the lucky people
and there's no more memories to remind me
i told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
by richard manuel and rick danko
i looked on you as my friend
before you accuse me take a look at yourself
if i dont go on and quit you
i'd gladly do it because
chorus
life is what you make it
and if we cant make it through tomorrow
night after night we steal away to where
by eric clapton
black summer rain
when the sun rose this morning i didnt have my baby by my side
but you have lost your good thing go ahead and have your own way
it was you who made the tears fall down
guess i couldnt see it
oh i never should have trusted you
i wanna be
i am left with a bitter taste
i wanna be loved by you
trying to love me and some other man too
private eye is on my trail
is it true that you think of me too
by j j cale
and i dont know the shape i'm in
i love you babe with all my heart and soul
i'm tore down i'm almost level with the ground
with no freedom to laugh there's more reason to cry
almost lost your mind
chorus
chorus
nobody's right till somebody's wrong
looked into true eyes never like this
it's too late she's gone
third verse
feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
playing in the streets i was unknowing
feeling so ashamed
we'll be walking
walking is most too slow
oh give me one one more kiss mama
knock knock knockin on heavens door
chorus
now you've gone away and left me that makes me feel so bad
you wanna love another man
i've been trying all night long just to talk to you
you can lay your worries down and stay with me
layla darling wont you ease my worried mind
chorus
i'll play along and along and along
lead me on lead me on
lead me on lead me on
let it grow let it grow
only ask and you will get what you are needing
let your love rain down on me
if i give my love to you
said it's all right take anything you want
i was born with a ragin thirst
'cause it's sure to end in tears
from the salt of all my tears
i got to stop now and figure out my time
this old road keeps rolling on and on
that would carry me away
i feel like i'm drowning in a river
one more time to ease the pain
drowning in the river
you dont know how much it means to be here in your arms
oh burn it rock it moving in the socket
and you know that you cant get away
lonely nights blue guitar
fallin down under par
i met that girl and the trouble began
got no answers got no cure
by jerry lynn williams
one to take each and every day
and our world will be right
if she ever gets back to stay it's going to be another brand new day
if i ever get her back to stay it's going to be another brand new day
chorus
chorus
'twas there by the bakery surrounded by fakery
by lowell glenn and lowell fulson
well if i've been a bad boy baby i declare i'll change my ways
well i give you all my money
than to stay around here
i got up this morning and fell out of bed
someone like you
for getting me back on my feet again
she aint too pretty she aint too tall
is good enough for me
that spoon that spoon that spoonful
but a little spoon of your forty five
first verse
to you
chorus
i'm with you my love
i've been waiting so long
if i tried to settle down
if i dont play the fool
and the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mermaids
her name is aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
you know i love you darling dont want to be alone
chorus
some of this generation is millionaires
you can never find at home
i pass by the juke joint
making love against the wall
could it be i'll have to borrow someone new
because sooner or later we have to go down in that lonesome ground
come back baby you'll find a change in me
you make it to your house
and you have to haul her home
and you have ta holler go home
the next woman that i marry she gonna work and bring me the dough
they tell me five minutes time underwater i was hid
my mother always told me quit playing a bum
i'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
for your love
i'd give the stars and the sun 'fore i live
how many times must i tell you babe
repeat second verse
someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
someday you're gonna be crying

gypsy woman said to me one thing you must bear in your mind

i know a cat named way out willie
doctor and a lawyer and an indian chief
by eric clapton
the love light in your eyes
it hurts me so bad for us to part
but someday baby i aint gonna worry my life anymore
moving slowly as the wind on the sea
that they're calling wandering sadly
someday i'll get back somehow i'll do it
blues blues wont let me take my rest
oh i got the boogie woogie right down in my very soul
keep on keep on keep on keeping on
i love to see you strut
boom boom boom boom

when i know i'm going to blow another fuse
that's right
i can see it in your eyes
somebody must change
but i cant find my way home

and i'm moving on out so catch me if you can
shine it on my heart
and if i could be king

cocaine

well i guess when you met me
i'm with you always
i'm comin home to your love
by alfred fields
take these stripes from around me chains from around my legs
tried to flag a ride
on the riverside
she said to herself now that's my fool
man i cant break a rule cause every man is some womans fool
we're gonna ball tonight
i'm coming i'm coming
hold on hold on
in a river of trouble about to drown
you've got to hold on hold on to the feeling
dont tell me our romance is through
holy mother cant keep from crying
i cant wait i cant wait i cant wait for you
my voice is still i fade away
when i hear the sound of a rock 'n roll band
'cause you know pretty babe you got honey in your hips
i got the black cat bone and i got a mojo tooth
you aint nothing but a hound dog
and baby i know
you made me feel so blue
by leroy carr
i could see the green grass growing on the hill

just when i thought it was over you come back
chorus
oh hungry i'm hungry i'm hungry for your sweet smile
missing you i dont know what i'm gonna do
but i aint got you
third verse
first verse
i cant hold out i cant hold out too long
you've been told so maybe it's time that you learned
it's time time for me to let you know
though the pavements are one huge crowd
ceiling is the sky
what would you say if i told you that i'm falling in love again
you know you've hurt me too
'cause i am nothing without you
and you get lost inside your tears
and tried to make me understand
and if it seemed a sin
tradition rules from the start generations running round in rings
i watch as he stares into eyes that gazed upon me
i lock my door pace back and forth my teeth are grinding
keeps a smile around a while
al li son
tell you again that i'm fine
let me know you're alright
then we go about our separate lives
anytime you want jump back too me anytime jump back to me anytime
chorus 1twice
at first sight thought that i might turn and
i took a one way highway headed west heaven bound
your suitcase i'll keep you
your questions later love me long time
i just want to be alright
cant get this shit off my mind
i just want to be alright
and when you lay your head down to sleep may i be the one who fills your dreams
and you dont care what they think
that you turned your back on me
why cant you see
it's good to be bad if it's better than bored
foresight is so often blind
girl eyes tend to hypnotize
here's to goodbye
cant i stay an hour or two or more
twisted hero leaving him more lonely
a stone has blocked my hourglass no progress made no
ooh i dont want anybody else
i dont want anybody else
chorus
piness so real
when strength
and reality
burn like awicker cabinet chalk white and oh so
need me take heed feed your ego make me blind
but i feel all wrong it wastes away until it's gone the
you sweat bullets spill the drink and you leave
you're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
you're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go
and when she's perfect you sweat bullets spill the drink and you leave
hey it's just me set yourself free
if it was you and me and nobody else would want me to want to be ready to go
hey it's just me set yourself free
hold me like you'll never let me go
chorus
you strike a smile in me
broken record talk tonight skip that needle back and forth on your mind wearing out unconvincing lies
i make the grade i save the day
then i close my eyes and quickly drift away
it's my nocturnal emission
i wake up in a cold sweat got a bone to pick with reality
let the candlelight die
things were cool and collected 'til she found him erected with another
she flipped he flipped the bird
i dont need a girl dont need a friend my friend lonesome's unconditional
to a radio song that's patient and willing
maladjusted just untrusted rusted sometimes brilliant busted thoughts
promise not to lie if i'm looking you straight in the eye
i passed by some familiar
that i had no choice whether
the home that i used to live in
had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
that she'd come to rescue me
i'm not gonna blink cause i wanna see
sexy walk your eyes are closed your heart is open wide
cheap shot hocked straight to the ear drum is it
down the road a good time for a dime and a
dime under the corner cushion wishing it was
so do i community immunity is the shot i crave
gonna see my name underneath the stars when i walk the boulevard
sunset strip bitch
reach she pulls dyed black hair back and signs fuck that
supersonic boy sweating sin
i'm sorry for and i wont have an answer
your eraser to remove my brain of
nomics still and quiet like they taught us
you got me so i cant sleep at night
girl you really got me now
solo
you really got me
go on and press your face
i watched them getting high
dull damaged and blind
sometimes its hard to open your eyes
i do not like it when you shut me out
i just want to find a beautiful life
yeah i just want to be where the sun shines down
i dont care what we do
it was a shameless use of charm
true love lost
they were helpless to the rush
true love lost
how i ever got to where i feel
i'm all fucked up
i am all fucked up
i want to be happy now
is going to be like this
big bell bottoms and groovy long hair
we'd listen to the radio station
aw mom not that show again i dont wanna watch that show
i dreamed that jimmy page would come from santa monica
you can hear the music on a am radio
with lots of places to run to
out on four forty one like waves crashing on the beach
that all the magazines seem to want to glorify these days
she is perfect in that fucked up way
and everything will be alright
happy in another life
you know it makes me smile
say the things i need to say
i like to watch you play
you know it makes me smile
i feel i'm runnin out of time
you are never alone
i wanna make this world
that some folks arent helped by relaxing exercizes
in cases of difficult tension
a really good friend of mine
who has gotta lot of tattoos
they would talk in those
it is obvious now
grown man
talking that babytalk
he does not give a damn
he talks like a baby
when you talk like that
i am not going to let it
can you hear me
my car's all ready and my bags are all packed
he smiles without his eyes
always knows what's goin on
you will never need to see the grey anymore
please dont tell me that
when you are happy with the blackjack
i see you climbing up the hill
yes i know it's not real
fix what's broken
love is all you need to fix what's broken
all you need is love
you were damaged when you were young and now you take it out on everyone
all you need is love
way down in the hollow
we used to sing
cast my memory back there lord
sha la la la la la la la la la la la
she gets hung up on the wind
i dont wanna know the reason why
she says she says
it's like that dream where it feels like home but it dont look right
i wish that i could hurt for you when you are learning how to fall
i hope you never know
never being good enough
and i dont know if he'll let me go
it keeps me awake sometimes
oh why do you have to be
i remember now
anything to you
see her come around
she starts to fade
i dont even have the strength to pick up the phone
i heard those stupid people talk about you again
i see you walking slow and simple underneath the big black sun
i can be normal like you
now that we're older
now that it's over
yeah right
now that it's over
yeah now that it's over
i used to think i was born to know trouble
now this is where i want to be
in my own ass
i want to be now
that will make the folks back home all bitch and whine
he'd sell his soul to make the monster dance
he knows that the world is in love
he knows if he ever even gets to play
i would wrap you in my thin white arms
i wish i had one more life
i dont wanna be wasted i dont wanna be blind
how i wish i had one more life to live
i dont wanna be wasted i dont wanna be blind
nothing gets through for you
that's when they'll disappear
quiet angel forget their lies
in the jealous games people play
out of my depth
watching everythingjust
over my head
i cant find the words
to make my monsters go away
some professional help
make them go away
yes i am slowly going

and i've seen you take 'em down
in your bed of roses
dont want no handful of thorns
even when you smile i see the hurt come through
i know they will
better days are comin around
i know it feels like
i can feel the magic floating in the air
it's washing over me
in a way i know my heart is waking up
caught up in the touch

now i cant help but think of you
now you're mr successful and i'm queen of the treadmill
but i cant do that anymore
but i cant stop living
a woman needs a little something of her own
trying to hold it together
a fine day indeed
a love that flows will always grow
and on and on
red hot and no blues
got no more bad news
should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
just to walk right up to your door
maybe you maybe you need somebody just to hold you
please say you love me
what would you do if i did something out of the blue
and that's for nothing
the eagle wants a canyon
the river wants an ocean to run towards
i could lie and say i love you
someday he'll change
where's her nerve
and i try to imagine myself in her place
i would be stronger than that
i would be stronger than that
i'll wait for you
everyone dreams of
soon we will wed
if i'm not in love with you
why do i miss you so much
lovers lost in sweet desire
every time i think about you baby
and the dreams that you dare to dream
birds fly over the rainbow
chorus
she'd like nothing better than to steal the breathe from me
for all the world to see
the girl who has ev'rything
i want more
up where they stay all day in the sun
ready to stand

take another little piece of my heart now baby
but that's no longer true

i dont understand
here i am
she said all my life i've been pleasin everyone but me
teacher's pet pageant queen
waking up in someone else's dream
there'll be answers to the questions
and all i know to do is keep on walking
you will find mighty arms reaching for you
and they will have the answers
down the road
chorus
'cept your neighbor who drives you crazy
and you whisper to all of the girls run run run
but dont worry baby
find our way you will face the truth
but i still reach for you each night
we've got barefoot ladies and tricked out mercedes
and stereos blastin in the parking lot
baby dont turn out the light
baby i need for you to know
who'll take me as i am
you wrapped your arms around me
come tumbling down
sometimes it lifts you
that's how love moves
it consumes you
you've caused me nothing but pain
you're the hardest lesson baby of my life
you always let me down
i keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way
and these sandals on my feet
the sunshine's everywhere we go
i got no cable tv
down at the starlight bar
and marilyn stares down from the barroom wall
the secret of life is in marilyns eyes
the secret of life is try not to hurry
down at the starlight bar
the way that you laugh and breathe and smile
what you're missing over there
i melt and spin and fall again
there's nowhere else i'd rather be
the way you love me
i'd wish you could see the way you kiss
it's not right
the way you love me
ooh the way you love me
there's a better place
lives are scattered
he'll wipe away
every knee will bow
i know there's coming a day
if this is the end
our love has just begun yeah
you're coming with me yeah
i just want you back
if you ask for my love i will give you some
your way back to our door
dont go nowhere
hoping to be numb
chorus
i tell myself i can do it all
it all comes down to love
make a wish for every heart that breaks
take you down to guts and the rubble
you know it all comes down to love
to fight without sayin a word
dont know if it really even matters to you
when it doesnt feel like we're even in love
it will be me
so much to think of
you may not see it now
it will be me
i can almost speak for him
my arms can almost feel the way he'd hold her
just about now
this is not about where i'll be a year down the line
as if you'd never let go
surviving somehow
something in your touch
tell me what should i do
and only for a moment
i'd climb right up to the sky
oh baby
that's what i would do
baby just to be with you
oh i need to hear you say that you love me baby

with a lot of truth
who i am
just to find out

if my heart had wings
i thought we had all the love to go with for the long run
and the dreams we left behind

'cause i always saw in you my light my strength

so you lay down on it and you do it some more
it's in your face but you cant grab it
completed what was assigned
exponentially
he's counterfeit
i didnt feel a thing
because the plot thickens every day
layin face down on the ground
no one listens
it's as easy as drinking wine only now it's blood
i wipe all your tears away the evil ones i kill
here it comes again
one minute here and one minute there
one minute here and one minute there
there's something i dont want to see
i cant stop winning
have a drink
you cant borrow tomorrow
to you i say
the wind is soft tonight the tide is low
every leaf every stone every speck of dirt
helpless
patton
so hang up that phone
oh if i'd only seen
oh if i'd only seen
oh if i'd only seen
introduce yourself right on
i will not touch you i am just a man
and far too lonely than he ought
and every night i shut my eyes
kindergarten
bells not ringing
born late
we're on the ground
your future
cuz everything is not yet lost
i i can help i can help you i can help you help yourself
mumble a jackhammer
and swearing you'll never be
just like sand
what can you say
it itches in your bones
so think of me
let go

the rest you know
cured
a justifiable means to an end
and i think that's swell
i'm a human bomb
for my pet genius
you're perfect yes it's true
a donor by habit
it aint bleeding enough for two
but i cant bring him back to life
and my mouth is full
and i fought the thing
as he waved goodbye
there was no gleam in your eye
could you blame them
coming coming
if so then i wont go alone
they'll keep you in
he knows for sure but that he cant decide
oh now i can really feel it how could you ever stand it
it's just a difference of opinion that much i can take
and i'd rather be shot in the face
if only i did not have to think
yeah i sweat a lot
would anybody tell me i was gettin stupider
a drink needs me
maybepregnantorondrugs
i'm here alone on the telephone line
what do you want me to be
someday the rains will come
smaller and smaller and smaller
bite
bite
you can only hear the beat for so long
these are the tools you'll need further down the road
a little joke that's understood
the heat is gone time is gone
i'll win this race
surprise you're dead
from my teeth and my tongue
what's it to you
what's it to you
and you think that maybe you can fly
just close your eyes and take that final step
before you find out what's inside your head
just close your eyes and take that final step
cant you see you're so beautiful to me
standing in the rain
crying in pain
the words are so familiar
we're gonna kick you
so wear the hat and do the dance
there's always an easy way out
the gentle art of making enemies
you put up one hell of a fight
cuz i'm the best fuck that you ever had
well just follow your heart
where it is always dark and wet and warm
only our deepest hidden senses senses
takes the least amount of effort
all circuits are busy
recollections drifting
or is it the love of someone else
it is the real thing
and you feel like you're too close
cherish the certainly of now
just clench your fist and close your eyes
it's the jewel of victory
you're growing a life within a life
just clench your fist and close your eyes
you did one thing wrong
dont look at me
he starves without missing a meal
are you getting a breath of fresh air
my underwater love
we care a lot about the gamblers and the pushers and the geeks
we care a lot about you people about your guns
and it's a dirty song but someone's gotta sing it
you're right you're right
a row teeth and an encouraging word
your hands are getting sore
if you could take your feelings with you
we cant keep up this pace
push the accelerator
compared to you
you're lucky to have me
so now you listen
i like to make a mess
keep me everlong
do you have a new body
i just wish you could've been a bit bolder
love doesnt kill you
it's just too bad that it's too late to let it show
hey dont try to tell me it's okay
chorus
closer than you know love each other so
they'll be laughed at
future outcasts and they dont last
you get the worst of it everytime
has a price on it no one knows
chorus 2
they come and go through the back door
made of sand
it's better than it was
but it's better than it was
it's better than it was
everybody's had everybody's had everybody once or twice
repeat
charlie the methadone the methadone man
try to stop the world spinning 'round
i pushed her away with the things i'd say
wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light
sunshine
riding down the freeway i've got to stay free
dont give up on me
emily
trying to find what was rightfully mine
emily works her fingers right down to her aching bones
heaven lie and tell comes back like up at a check
why do you get so emotional
why do you get so emotional
i dont know about you
i dont know where i'm going to
we're sticking close to the floor
refrain
those days when our hearts were as big as the sun
just like a candle burning bright
we wake in the morning and work all day
each photo on the mantel
each chemical advance
i said bye bye bye
you forgot why you came here today
i will never forget your name
'round the corner right on up to the shop
or i'm supposed to leave it all behind
you only get to see this once
knock it down knock it down knock it down knock it down yeah
and i'll try to remember that this is just a lender
hey man can you make that twenty
i promised i would pay you back
written by tony scalzo
you need to feel the loss
chorus
much less remove her from my mind
i can still recall a time you were not so far behind
never let 'em see you sweat
you can place a call to me
through the window dimly shines
i had a few more hours of night time before i'd rise
and as i sleep tonight i'll dream of you
you come along with a code that i cant crack
chorus
they put alot of effort into making you feel like a clown
lyrics and music tony scalzo
it's a nowhere road
you take it to the highway
the wheel of possibility
it was hard to find
i cant afford to go very far
'cause it's raining all the time
yeah i'm all right
inside out upside down
when she goes walking by
slow drag you've been messing with my mind
you're nothing to me
sonner or later
i'm gonna take my time all right
sooner or later repeat
they love to tear you down
telephone calls
i've been thinking
havent had a break in twenty years
i've been thinking
and when the car broke down they started walking
you can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
knowing the way
mine tell me now is it so dont let me be the last
if not i'll just die
remember the way that it used to be
you're the only one who can see the real me
chorus
why'd you have to go away
people ask me
time beats up on
she comes just like a daydream
and like the stars they shine so bright
turn on my tv
there are no lies
i picked up the paper
give me muddy muddy water
it's none of your business
i'm feeling good now
turned on the tv set
which way to the top
just like time doesnt mean anything
but i'll be wide awake
get it now while it's happening oh yeah
but you wind me up so wind me up again
gotta seperate the unreal from what is true
oui je comprends yes i understand
quand le vin est tire il faut le boire
c'est un cercle vicieux
chorus
i believe i'd buy whatever you would sell to me
i believe i'd buy whatever you would sell to me
twice i visioned i was falling down
with a white violin
kyrie eleison christe eleison
to the land of nevermore
recite soliloquies
let nothing bleed into nothing
if i surrender
divine forgiveness
i'm your master soon you'll see
never see until you feel
mislead delusions color real
i'm going out
how can you refuse
i'm going sugarless
exanimate a penance
silence loudens tribulations
deep in your mind look for the answer
entrapped in this one way passage
deep in your mind look for the answer
before the dawn of history ancient races tears
you shade the light from the seed
where the mortals have been banned
your cities disappear
like open secrets overheard
look at yourself
from the still uncertain heart
if you want to know
look at yourself
when it comes down to the wire
my friend forgive me
catatonic state it sharpens life's depressing edge
from the bleeding corpse of pleasure
darkness calls me with her laughs
of idolence there lies the shadow of a man
mystic journey to arcana travel starry
up in a tree preying on me vulture of
exuke this medium of bondage far beyond the
he will inhere the malignant fear in man
while facing transformation
was it the thread of a common bond
eye to eye
and the miles still divide
i believe i know i need to let go
and you think you wont but you know you might
face the fear
morrigan you come again
peasants to kings your heart surely turn to dust
far beyond the realm of dream your wildest dream
in a time long past tomorrow sleeping in the
paradise
bound to earth treasures sunken heart to
through a crack in the garden wall came
shame
i will wish upon a star i believe in you
his mind has seen think you may he lives
without a name
angels in white you have sacrificed witness
light you wield must blind another
close your eyes what do you see
oh
feel the cold winds all around you
to our island in the stream
i know this begot by a kiss
and may your rotten conscience never grow old
and returned the silver pieces that you've paid
instrumental
dont you think that i remember
it hangs like a memory
like the sound of your voice falling
so where do we begin
and with hope in our hearts
sign on the dotted line
what are you looking for something your
set the thames on fire
parallel lives running parallel with you
parallel lives running parallel with you
parallel lives running parallel with you
you abonded me
they should be held so high and not looked
prelude to ruin
your destiny the sisters all of three
wintery wind the eye of the storm witness
go sailing out of view
teach teach me to see the light
when i need somewhere to run to
beg answers unasked
behind outcast eyes hides
behind lifeless eyes lies
open wide you're to decide to turn back
laughter's echoes with the blatant wind
in the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
tabernacle is forbidden never looking back i dont dare
and if i couldnt buy you diamond rings
if i had nothin
verse 2
girl do you swear to tell the whole truth
would you be here to pay the rent
who i'm choosing is all the way with it
would you be here if i didnt have a boss
and struggling
if i was crummy
as he looks to the window
young and restless cant conceive
the bard and the banshee
the laughing magpie spreads his wings
i know it's getting late
we've grown so tired of trying
and nothing's easy anymore
holding on to faith
i'll take what's mine
so why do i create just to be swallowed
believing all the basics of everything that i could find
come what may
on my way from salem i lit a fire
ride the great beast abandoned girls
darkest mind
burned alive for a crim never done
she took me by the hand
the more i look
the more these walls confine me
i strain to catch my breath
dont keep on telling me everything's okay
let's straighten it out
chorus
monica umm when i dont even know what's wrong
let's straighten it outusher we need to straighten it out
as he's done a thousand hours before
it's all a matter of time is there reason
nearing his hour he climbs to the belfry
of them all
i wont play your game
unborn wench at war tear him inside
camouflage the battle scars with oxy ten and
but you only said goodbye
but i heard the distance in your voice
we can only say goodbye
all the things we need to say
the switch is triggered once again
run rabbit run hawk in sky hides in
the moon ignites a flaming raging child
it's time to make a change
tied to a fading memory
we stand at the door to a new beginning
feeling the weight of unseen chains
without going through the motions
living life in still water
taught his boy all the tricks
his father act with fury
for your health and strength
and die by the sword
wed daughter of the king
and pierced his father's soul
there's a blind desire there's a drive
is it performance is it expression
there's an empty room there's a blank page
black magic night witches holiday
in hellish praise
a solemn belfry begins to toll
at walpurgis night
on convulsive seas of false urgency
isle of debris
run to the end of the world
come the clouds before the rain
and the man in the mirror looks on
and the man in the mirror looks out
all i really want
thoughts i dont recognize make me realize
with nothing to inspire
burned on the desire
am i here screaming
or here beside you
his mind never rests
there's a chill about us
rains falling hours crawling
all around this shade of gray
listen
whispers to me instead
to share the thoughts i could not share
through nights that never end
au fond de mon jardin
and did nothing at all
and did nothing
anymore anymore
and i cant explain
and i still hold on to yesterday
deep cool
we jump into the fires of hopelessness forever
we've swallowed the pills and the pain
way back in may
but now she's not around
you really light me up
seven days in the sun
you really light me up
she looks just like a beauty queen
i'm crawling on my knees again
you make it better
you just take the pain away
muffled screaming
would kill me just the same
the taste of bitter glass
apologies have passed
it's pulling you deeper
the cat is out
tears roll down
and wave goodbye to love again
so dont you try and fake it
anymore anymore
anymore anymore
tell me something new instead
tell me something new instead
she said
yeah i wish i could be like you
i cant dance to disco
white suits and gigolos
i cant dance to disco
i cant live for disco
i cant i cant i cant stand losing
you can call it lack of confidence
but you'll be sorry when i'm dead
i cant i cant i cant stand losing
buying a magazine it's time to get myself some therapy
it's funny but i dream for yesterday i'm blistered by the burns that life has made i'm staring
she's got a new dress on
chorus
the more we change it all seems worse
unchain myself
voices draw nearer
try and get a hold son
see it so near it seems so far
lettin it out lettin it out lettin it out
close your eyes and drift away to some place new
the cold has got a hold of you again
blue true blue true miss you
lift me up to where the clouds are snow
cause you're the only thrill i feed
cause you're the only pill i take
find new trees on better ground
black sabbath everyday
growin old with you
chorus
got to pull myself back in
feel no obligation
you tear yourself apart
comfort in sound
a new belief
picks me up when i crash down
feel it as i shake
just a piece of something new a taste would keep us sane
blows a fuse inside our minds watch the data as it wipes
introverted in our ways trapped inside this plastic skin
sinking deep under dont think we'll recover
im not insane
ask the questions i have read
alone
if you could see live with my pain
see your face in stone
celebrate x2
burn to grey
it's the essence of a love
feelin like it's over
drift forever lost in
space we're getting better all the time
safe we're getting better all the time
see me wait
i cant see another
just see how it is another
you pure the air that i breathe
emily loved him
you came and healed my disease again
here she comes lifting me up to the moon
it's like breathing underwater but i just cant let you go
see the smiles on ice cream faces
killing me now it's so hard to breathe
tearing my down piece by piece
you and me it's pulling me down
you would
crawling
all that you face
moving around a town
pushing up
you said you could you should
a light
so dont you give in
dont think that i can help myself
dont think that i can help myself
polythene girl
make love your goal
when the chips are down
a force from above
i'm so in love with you
with tongues of fire
holding on to you
lift the world from off your shoulders now
you take away the grey
you take away the grey
pulling you under now
you're pushing the senses through
what are you going to do
always
always
let's talk about us
a china heart will always break
try to get high
it twists and turns you
chorus
just see how it is
chorus x2
trying to get out cause it wont change money doesnt mean that much to him
they try to hide their guilt away with a smile that says that its okay
tune in you might hear him
keep my feet on the ground
further up as i float
believe in me believe in me
and constant rearrangement
set me free
set me free
falling through these clouds of silver
crashing onto cotton waterfalls
cause i'm your rubberband
you twist me around i feel like a rubberband
sending it all right back
i wanna lift myself up to the sky
they're hoping that it's better
i'll shine like the sun
wanna leave it all just for a while
i wanna lift myself above the clouds
climbing up to free myself
twist and turn
do you really know
i dont need this
you love to watch me crawl
i'm spinning out of my ferris wheel red
feels like home it feels like home
lying face down on the floor reaching out for something new
we burn to face the storm
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
oh ho ho
wash the stain right off your feet
live the system walk the plank
oh ho ho
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
am i just like you
am i just like you
i'll never leave you dry
how do you feel when there's no one
holding on to words you might regret
a taste of life to pull you through
waiting for the sun
today it all feels fine
i can see the ground
to this empty street
shoot holes in me
things are changing at last
chorus
cause we've got to forgive
forgiven i wish i was forgiven
high i hear you say
forgiven
forgiven
find new ground
all together
cant you breathe it in
getting to know you well getting to know you well
wish it could stay like this
trying hard to find a reason
i'm getting to know you well getting to know you well
clean mind no overtime
the drug that keeps feeding me
lets feel a new high kicking in
come together feel the heat
do they feel the same way
it takes us all away someday
i wanna be here
as i stare at the trees
i'm going out for a while
reaching up high into space
today
and it's a long way up without a ladder
behind a face you see a child
takes me back to better days summer days the everglades in june
my brain my poor brain
drinking myself to sleep again insomnia i'm drinking myself to sleep again nightnurse pills to keep me sane
all by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again
how come it ended up like this
cause i dont want to drag you down hold you down
you're watching clouds come over you
ten feet below the ground
two different views
the bittersweet sugar of life
cut loose and crashing in
you gotta set me free
bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu
a taste of something better
bu bu bu bu lose the fear
cos i'm feeling that i cant go on
as emptiness invades
and you're the reason i wake up
nothing is real
dragging you down
cause this could be the only day
this could be the only way
chorus
chorus
my perfect day my perfect day my perfect day
cut me free again and watch me bleed
cut me free again and watch me bleed
dont you see we're in skin deep
oxidize
oxidize
oxidize
for life
yourself
shame on pain
the touch of a hand
the bubble begins to break
something happens i drift away away
it just explodes as i drift in
we've got to keep on believing
way up im reaching out
a better life to say goodbye
the love has gone
the summer's gone the colour's gone
the summer's gone away
she's my death she's my death
come a little closer to me
think about it sweet sixteen
kill kill or be killed for
the more that i believe
i'm lost inside a dream
paralysed
take a ride
tangerine x4
new intentions all around
i wanna dream with you
so let's take a drive underneath the sun
ache
turn over everything
lying awake
bringing the love i need
bringing the love i need
she's trying to hang on here in tinsel town
breathing as we're sinking to the sand
tomorrow shine
i will wait for her love
heavens above us yeah yeah yeah
forever we'll be tumble and fall
but i dont want to be a zero
cause i dont want to be a hero
so come on give in
picking up the pieces of a page
cause i dont want to leave it all behind
i'm getting deeper oh yeah
you gotta be what you try to be
hear me now i say
reaching out as i leave arms wide open tv me
i wish that i was still fifteen
you know you dont understand
get up shut up
i've got a pain in my sick brain
shut up it hurts
two red eyes and broken veins
i will be there if you believe
i will be there if you believe
i cant see it
to give myself to save my soul
laundry stops by the lock on a sunday afternoon with all that fuss
take a ride to charing cross join the masses as they shop their lives away
i'm waiting for changes
we're making all kinds of shapes
somehow we can straighten out the bends
we can find some place new
our place to shine out we can do it anyway
you reel me in dont throw me back into the pool
while the old world slides
you just make it shine
open up the sky
holding on to dreams
i'm turning upside down float into the ground
we could be free
so you could breathe
i wish you could just see yourself
live another day now
if you're a little late
see see what i can see i will believe in you you and me
sitting in today watching traffic buzzing by and faces nosing in
waiting for a taste of happiness to lift me free and carry me away
it's killing me today addiction pulls you down you know
the words we say old flowers fade away
down on my knees crawling though the streets again
you're my evergreen regents park in spring
it's getting better all the time now
i can feel it again
staring at paper faces expressions like empty pages day after day
cant shut you out
cant take you down
as the wire cuts into my butter skin
blown a hole right through my dream
standing on the edge of the world
and in between now and the last time we met
had i had known that it might have been me
i'm 22 for a moment
a kid on the way
15 there's never a wish better than this
and i'm just dreaming
i sing above my vision i sing above my face
every day a saturday a summer waking morn
a lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean
with lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep
but her back seat wont ever tell
or bringing home my first baby
my '65 mustang rides along
dont need to play no new cd's
she's my family tree
like dad did when the '65 was three
so what is your problem
i'm closer to you
you're all i'll ever need
the higher i go the harder i climb
i'm closer to you
and she didnt even mean a thing to me
i hit my head upon the chamber door
i'm alright alright i feel alright
here in the borders of america town
and know someone's looking out for me
i can still make my bet on the basketball game
we all spin around
you'll be my only friend
and in a sense you could say she snared my attention
so now i'm stuck in this pineapple parking lot
angels never come for free
though it's hard to hear him speak
though his arms cant squeeze you tight
he caught lou gehrig rounding third one day
bella's birthday cake was burning
ever yearning forest fire
bella's birthday cake was burning50 years gone
it could change it will never
it could change it will never
it could change it will never

that she gives him he'll take her for granted
cause he's a doer and he'll do her
takin all of her pride as he goes

little monsters in the boat parade
early one morning at county line
took off in the mustang for the 395
hired a fixer to keep things blurry
i didnt intend to kill the dealer last night
i'll meet you down behind neptune's net
chances roll away from me
still chances are more than expectations
chances are waiting to be taken and i can see
day by day i resort to you i do

and if it makes you soft inside

you know i'm not the guilty one
where do we go from here
i guess you just cant see
white like that
i'm white like that
i like it when it's green
i like the world today
today
i just want a life of my own
i cant see see straight i cant be straight
love ridden i've looked at you
no not baby anymore if i need you
only kisses on the cheek from now on
and i'm scratching at the surface
and if you wanna make sense
why
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
they call me on and on across the universe
through my open ears inciting and inviting me
my cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength
we started out sipping the water
and you remind me that i wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone
and the games that i can handle
dont feel just to smile until i've had one
i am likely to miss the main event
here it comes a better version of me
i've gone a
asking no questions
is decaying in front of me
i've gone a
to walk away
i've been careless
'cause i need
to the one
the consequence at hand
so i'm beggin you
i've sinned against
the devil wants to know
i ever knew of love
i ever knew of love
and the gashes i got from my heartbreak
look at look at look at look at me
and i will try hard to hold onto you with open arms
swarm the belly swelling to a blaze
that i'm what i try not to be
gonna renounce the mill a little while and
i just want to feel everything
and
i seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
chorus
without my hand on his throat i fight him always and still
disprove your faith in man
or i'll drown in the wonders and the was
uneven wind complain and blame
to get away get gone
how can i deal with this if he wont get with this
sacrifice because the price is paid and
it's time the truth was out that he dont give a
face as i figure how to kill what i cannot catch
but the last one i had who was getting my hopes up
i am
huh i decided to let it pass
you treat me that way
you know i just wont entertain you
he excites me
if i get a chance i'm gonna show him that
he excites me
he makes my heart a cinemascope screen if i get a chance i'm gonna show him that
he excites me
if thats what i am so far
and at my own suggestion
and when the crowd becomes your burden
take me on the train
jonathan anything
i dont wanna talk about
dont make me explain
i told myself coming would keep me intact
handle me like family and that'll be enough
i love watching the watkins when there rocking with garza
go to lar go to lar go to largo
and now i'm hard too hard to know
not 'til this guy what a guy oh god what a good guy
the ants weigh more than the elephants
you wanna make me sick
you'll beat me with your bitter lies
i never did anything to you man
appear within your view
i see from greater heights
you'll never touch
dont fear your dreams
you'll never hear
i realise what i am now
you'll say i need appeasing
and it doesnt seem fair
became dialogue as a diagram of a play for pun blood
and the bind
i have to stare at
turn on my heels
i'm undecided about you again
saying there's nothing to it
o' sailor why'd you do it
and in its wake appeared the touch and call
saying there's nothing to it
wont you go away
when i was looking with calm affection
i was feeding on the need for you to know me
youre all i need and maybe some faith would
baby that it's all gonna be alright
lost their breath
falling down
unweighed down by
and my winter giving
to pray on or wish on or something like that
i got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
but he was just a little boy
while you were kissing me once more than once
and from the first to the last time the signs
i bet your fortressed face
it ended bad but i love what we started
left to run the races lame
i dont even like you anymore at all
hoping he makes a good family man
if i got bored trying to figure you out
stay away away
and you can hear our sad brain screaming
until you next step out of line
that will keep us steady
you'd think i was a siren
no apologies
somethin similar
and i've been cryin blue
and i think if i didnt have to
the weather outside
but i'm trying to understand
hook x2
hook x2
what a cunning way
to my knees
i wanna be ready
space so sweet
i just wanted you
you made me
but you dont care
and i dont go to
dont come around
and i cant abide
and this voice cannot be
to be so defensive
i got my feet
stifled by your deviant ways
and you endeared to me
world inside you
and you'll wonder
sweet relieving
must i release you
days like this
and there's too
i used to sail the
under the waves
leave me the white
o'er a strange inversion
'cause there's
i'm trying to find
the child is gone
but daddy longlegs
but you must
full is not heavy as empty
make the endeavour
so dont even ask me
so keep on calling me names keep on keep on
here's another speech you wish i'd swallow
i would've warned you but really what's the point
around you
please forgive me for my distance
a still life drawing of a peach
i'm a tulip in a cup
but i admit that i provided a full moon
nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
and i could liken you to a lot of things
nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
it just had to be
it just had to be
i only see what i'm looking through
that when it's clean it's so clear
i had to break the window
and i really do believe i really do believe
of course that was all they saw
what's happened to the girl i used to know
and look how much i've changed
searching just to find the love we both
how did we end up here
convincing ourselves we were
and i followed it all the way from the night until the morning
just to get to where i am just to get just to get back to you
and though i'm not a great romancer
same old song the radio always plays
i hit so hard when i fall down
and it's your life so go on run away
i got the gun and i'm not scared to use it
and if there's anyone still standin thinkin that their runninshit
i write rhymes drink beer fight smoke bud
she'd burst
since time began
i'm tired and i'm bleeding for you
fruit flower myself inside out
you oughta go north somebody told us
'cause there was no land of promise
tied to your strings and twisted
hold me in this tiny room sedated here i'll stay
that i am tied to your strings and twisted
given a year to pack up and die
the punctured exlife slithers
a would be life is now defunct
red sails in the sunset
oh carry my loved one home safely to me
make straight for the shore
jameswe were always friends
are you still in school
i went on the road
caressing bent up to the jug again
intangible of price
dont go waving your pretentious love
i came upon your room it stuck into my head
dark entries
searching for something
i got to thinking and i got to see
so dont talk of friendship do it to me
she was sad as i looked over
and her tears mixed with mine
she was cryin when she gave me the message
no reason to stay
rockin the glass i wont leave you my reflection
round round round we go
yes i am boy yes i am
well i'm going down that mississippi river yes i am yes i am
when i know how you get down
you didnt want me
why cant you accept it's over
i'm free to do my own thing

ages of you
a wond'rous woven magic
and a coat of many colors
along the rutted road
beneath a flowing beard
to the east side
well we're movin on up
i'm just about to lose my mind
restless nights
to take the one and only road i know
the eagle rocks the bear tonight
restless nights
flowing down in a long sea of red
never going to get it back

chorus

but in the process steadily gettin fucked
puppy love
i'm standing here and hoping for you
and now i'm holdin
i'm keeping the faith that you still love me
i never see you cry

chorus
we're going wrong
this town was cool for one night
this town was cool for one night
this song appears on two albums and was first released on dreamland express album and has also been released on the country roads collection album
that dances on your head
to start right now would do no harm
if i ever had a chance to love you
till the final curtain falls
dont wanna hold you down
and i cant get enough of you baby can you get enough of me
i was made for lovin you baby you were made for lovin me
start over now
i've got nothing
and in our lives
it was my face and i am through with it
come with us
i long to know that moment divine
how do you feel
follow me follow me to my bedroom
follow me follow me to my bedroom
when i get on top and i make it real hot
and you tell me dont stop
candiate for office you vote for me
to make it to the big time then pay off the cops
crooked crowns sentenced to die pay the bloody price
honor even in death digrace is defied
lightning flash one swift blow
what's that scar from on your throat
hear the echo of the shots that ring
right or wrong cant be undone
vast delirium multitudes of attitude
sometimes i cant understand myself
nothing is true all is permissible
if you had a cure for the epidemic of today
are you willing
are you willing to forget what you dont know
are you willing to forget what you dont know
always running from myself
stopping tomorrow tonight
cant see me in my blindside
how many beatings do i have to take
how many cells must die before you're legally
how much wasted energy is flowing through your head
how much wasted energy is flowing through your head
down in the deep black hole of my heart
outside the gates of redemption inside my happy home
self destructed i never anticipated
now i stare out my window the patients on the lawn
you've done everything with nothing to do
wish you had a little bump to smoke
one more time
the whole world in my way
captured mind details
hidden recesses lost in my mind
bloodless pale
captured mind details
chorus
allied forces go to war bloody battles by the score
when you find yourself scorning the trust and
violator your conscience will command no it's not a dream

why cant i get back
as long as i make it back
destructive signs
chaos no point to prove
i symbolize all you despise
evil and wicked dreamer creator of sins
usa russia chaos from pole to pole
surrounded by his marked believers
the scorched ground opens the beast of metal appears
the air is charged with power metal
even i dont know who i am
they're gonna catch my disease
they'll squeeze my blood through the skin
my bed's the ammo and no one comes to my door
good news never last too long
dreams are not the same as life
darkness falling to play pretend
more than the world inside my mind
in a land that no one comes from
you feel yourself falling in a hole
can you see life fading away
is there a dark side of your life
wears me down
my ears ring your favorite sound
that really dont exist
warheads
now kill the power become partners of sin
alone in our decision to unlock the door
alone in our decision to unlock the door
why didnt i get a call
how soon they're gone away
and everything i see is now
when the whole world saw but me
everything i know is in the past
fade to black
i am falling feel the pain
falling faster no one here
everybody's watching me
watching over me
still i walk
again seemed right
this rhyme picked my mind
still i walk
standing on the edge of time
standing on the edge of time
same old song with a different beat
and the book of fear
cheated angels turned away
the little people spit down on you
and i'll recognize
instead you stay alive
you fucked up everyone's life
a blacker demise
you fucked up everyone's lives
can you be hallucinational
can you be hallucinational
i think you're hallucinational
i'm hot so give me what you've got
we're all alone my love has grown
is it good for us or harmful does it enlighten or repress
no one cares but you
up seems like a real good offer
they almost always
i just had to make sure
you knew i was sincere
you knew i was sincere
they almost always
you knew i was sincere
i guess i dont really care
then i cant get by
no i wont be buying it
engulfed in popularity with everyone he knows
the claw hangs just above your head
shooting up shooting down
the reaper is near
to the pit dogs they are prey the people look away they look away
your live passes you by i live you die
it is the game of temptation it is the play of the heart
chorus
chorus
it's on me
a shotgun up against my eye
i cant see
just very violently killing time
slamming faster just to hit the ground
tying on another big liquid noose
when it's hard to hold them down
when the water keeps on rising
if it's cheaper to kill
if i dont keep moving
if i dont keep moving
and i know you cant tell
ascends from beneath metalshock to reveal
chorus
if it were oh just gone
not an apparition not the holy ghost
it walks right beside me
it lies then on the floor
as i move from door to door
it lies there on the floor
seeing is still not beleiving
i'll turn away from this mess i'm burning
i bet you never thought you'd see me dead no
a monster
the trouble with you is the trouble with me
natural enemies
your introduction into
envoys are delt their hands
bustling nations horde their rotting wheat
torture from the hooded nations
tell me something what you're trying to prove
thermo global fear
turning to the right feel it getting tight
instinct never worked anyway what i've seen i just cant say
the risk runs high but i've gotta try
pretentious asshole time to move aside
a need inside me took me by surprise
ooh my october thorns in my side
now i now just who i really am
i burnt myself
i'm hiding in the basement of my mind
swollen shut black eyes burning bright
if you're strong enough to bleed
promise keepers nothing cheaper
newspaper blanket covers my view
what they all think of me now is
i'm sinking taking everyone down
i'm throwing in the towel now
a handful of grease in her hair
well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
repeat chorus
she'll be mine
that consume you in her universe
as the last trace of her
a young maiden with a demon in her soul
she's miss lizzy she feels no pain
these legendary murdersshe left not a trace
nothing you should dread
tell me that i'm failing
i come to your for guidance
another hole in the bucket
now pack your shit and get the fuck out
blind deaf dumb
guilt preys upon the human mind
when conflicting with the machine
the promise cast the hopeful lured
like pulling teeth tie the string and slam the door
like pulling teeth tie the string and slam the door
like pulling teeth tie the string and slam the door
forced down the yellow pills then i stepped into the screen
now i know my place in life as time devours me more each day
there's no love lost
business booms when cold lead flies
selling rock candy and suicide
tribal primal criminal
you have what i stole
laughing cause you're funny choking
tonight we take the stage again
the time for gashing has come now
come to me viperand see
moody violence
erase my memory
i'll see it through the day
threats fly through the airmail e mail and express
screwed my head so tightly
sweat it out in walls that both my shoulders touch
slit wristed run over and hanged
numbers in your mind add up to
the winners cross the line
numbers on your back and numbers on your head
till after you begin
win lose or dead
know a little about nothing
when it's in your heart and you cant feel you fell
when it's in your hands but you cant feel
this time
close my eyes and hope that it's
all you gotta do is try
fake it all in stride
all night long i dream of the day
another reason to bleed
if i get any closer
nothing satisfies but i'm getting close
weight keeping me down x2
puzzles suck laughing in my face
not what it seems
ring in the witching hour
want to forget about
can you go another round
and you dream about yourself
and the stars will all come out
i'm your fool
but had no use
is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
the life the love
i'm getting tired of starting again
confess
if we can get around it
you make me dizzy running circles in my head
i break right through
we're face to face my friend
i may be crazy little frayed around the ends
i'm begging for ignition
breathe for me when i'm gone
waiting to collide
burn out beyond
never burn again x3
no way you'll silence me
dont say what i dont need
something borrowed something blue
i'm not a fool
you're the one bothers me
i'm all sick for you
i can hear them say
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
you didnt pass me by
give me one last wish give me one last wish
when i've had enough
hey let's call it even
dont you deny me dont you deny me
all on your own
it's your cold day in the sun
he's scared cause i want it all
life begin to fade into the black
spending hours endin days
the reason you left me to survive
come alive
i'm looking in and i've got nothing to lose
stuck in the middle no ones making a move
try runnin around the candle
try one that's with you
it's something bigger
and that was all
yea yea yea
i may be scattered
whisper for the days gone by
nothing like the taste to sweet decline
what a way to go they have no fear
been a pleasure 'bout the pleasure's
this beautiful bruise's colours
you're every mood mood
now that i've found my reward
blew it all away
i'm in hells gard hells gard will be true the world
i'm in hells gard hells gard wait it all the world
i cant let it out
i'd share a piece of mine with you
just lookin for shelter
absence of faith
all i want is to be home
we're hot inside each other never let you go
did i lose you
that's not easy to say
your rehearsed insanity
one day this all will fade i'm sure
i've taken all and i've endured
now i might help any other
every time the dream i'm sharin
breaking in the muted skies
in your honor
for you to feel alive
made of iron and of stone
to confess his crime
good friend of ours
and i guess she had a lot of money or something
i i dont think he'd ever met her before
she bought him all this stuff
and he's standing there with his dick
think i need a devil to help me get things right
i think i'm done nursing the patience
why'd you have to go and let it die
why'd you have to go and let it die
why'd you have to go and let it die
beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
there's a place i know
and i cant change back for you
pleasure or pain
just some words without meaning
down and out again x3
every now and then
down and out again x3
one more time for the last time
no home no life no love
no king or queen of any state
running through hell heaven can wait
no turning back dont turn that page
no tomorrow no dead ends
you're tearin me apart
every day every day
are you in there
i'm hanging on you ooh
turn so tight
screws inside
as low as you go
low as you go
imagine the day i'm drowing that they can reel me in
pick up where i left off
cause thats your language too
always lost and win or lose with you
counting every minute till the feeling comes crashing down
getting lost in you again is better than being numb
someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down
if i share powdered milk with you
gather round'
i've been loosing sleep
just lucky we're alive
dont wanna be your monkey wrench
one last thing before i quit
truth or consequence say it aloud
kudos my hero
this is a black out
my head and your heart
i never heard this warning
i'm not scared
i'll be coming home next year
into the night we shine
everything's alright up here
phase it out until the older ones return
i'm here
i'm here
who's wandering back home
sat alone
ready on your mark
keeping us from harm
do you read me
i will be the guard
are you there
this time it keeps on sinking us
there's a lie i think you'll find
keep hanging by a thread
turning like the wheels inside your head
were building a relation
it's been thrown away again
whatever kind of phony body chewed it through the night
i need to know i need to know tonight
razor of mine
i need to know i need to know tonight
when there's nothing to say
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
i wish you only knew how good it is to see you
i'm finally somewhere in between
can you make it look like we want
repaired by a love of broken things
time will turn us into statues eventually
oh time will turn us into statues eventually
promise not to say another word
scattered on the hill
goddamn these stars to your room
so stranger stranger stranger things have happened i know
you forgot but i remember this
early morning without warning
meet me in the summertime
come inside by bed
sweet virginia countryside
loving licks and cherry wine
you're a real short ride wow right
shape
shining once again
the more i see black
sinking under
to remove
i listen

this is the last song
we pretend
to you
one more test
somethin never meant to be
feel like this
but you're the only one

you're not the one
who could make me
send in your skeletons

what if i say i'm not like the others
i'm the hand that will take you down
you're the pretender

yeah who are you
fingernails are pretty
this is a call to all my
without a simple reason why
you laughed the while you kissed my head
get lost instead
it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you learn to live again
shame on me for the blues
cursed by love so dire
i wont go getting tired of you
another one returned that i'll never use
burning like a flame inside of you
i'm not getting tired
i wont go getting tired of you
is this just desire or the truth
touchlight as a feather
i've been waiting silently
i cannot forget you girl
in the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you
i will say goodnight
if you'd accept surrender
i'm on your back
take that to the man
pissed about the 5 ham

each time i hear about the hand you've been delt
will you be happy when we're sharing a cell

winnebago we were one
never far from being wrong
leaving all my senses numb

thirteen times five
a stroke of luck or a gift from god
these are the rules i make
you come to me now
all around me falling
you've got to learn to love yourself
and hollowness

she sings
after two drinks he's a loser after three drinks he's a star
try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend
and in a world where good's not good enough
it's gets so funny that we get confused
let's get stupid just entertain us
i'm sick sick sick of saying nothing
magic happens
dont end up in the gutter
walk away cause you're breaking up the girl
you're breaking up the girl
you're a different kind 'cause you want their minds
you go from day to day by filling your head
he's just a face on your pillowcase
i've reached the end of the rope
oh babe i cant hide it
i've cut all my losses
i just dont care anymore
you fill my life with misery
i'm more in love with you
she didnt care to hang around
and in your hot pants and high heels
you hold a candle in your heart
go baby go baby
you hold a candle in your heart
in the hysterical realm

i'd be nothing you could hurt
i want to understand so i can forgive and be willing to love
they say the world is round
i'm waiting

but grab yourself sweetness where you can
free as a bird
this is not my idea
you thought i was a little mouse
i'm only happy when it rains
i only smile in the dark
pour your misery down on me pour your misery down
i'm only happy when it rains pour some misery down on me
kaboom
as far as i can tell
to feel good in the morning
get it right now
kaboom
it doesnt matter who you are
in the morning
dont worry baby dont worry baby
please dont ask me why
c'mon use it let's get through it
we'll be alright
the queerest of the queer
i'll show you how it's done
a fake behind the fear
the numbest of the dumb
i know what's good for you
why you listening to them anyway
cause you've got soul inside your shattered heart
you shouldnt listen to them anyway
stay alive my love
no you're never gonna crack
and you know what you believe to be right
run from the noise of the street and the loaded gun
we keep repeating history
i wont feel dirty and buy into their misery
give me a choice
we love you
he made you
shut your mouth
in our land here
you got some
if you can do it
you could go far
with everybody moaning
try not to panic
i wanted to say something
i have been broken
so nobody wins
silence is golden
satisfy this hungriness
if we come together
how would it feel
if we sleep together
that you gave your mother
now all i want to do is sleep
while everyone is sleeping
you're so like a rose
you go down to the park
you say i have changed
i hold all the cards
i'm able to soldier through this 4x
that you cant break
dont believe in hate
that you cant tame
you stupid girl
come down from the altar
you're going down down down
it's getting cold
kill the new religion
and suck the poison
how low can you go
supernatural maybe
is it inexplicable
and i'll feed your obsession
this thing you'll never doubt
now i'm lucky like a falling star that fell over me
i'm waiting for my moment
some say my biggest weakness
when i'm not sure who i am
she's not the kind of girl
so sick he cannot move
i wont be the one who's going to let you down
and i know when to touch
if you cant feel the life
iand yet unprepared
tell him what we said 'bout paint it black
the sun hit my eyes
holy rock 'n roll
i will love you till the day that i die
i was oblivious i was losing to you
no tenderness
farewell
farewell i will love you till the day that i die
come on shirl
i'm fragile
dont trip my wire
i'm fragile
i'm a freak freak freak and baby i'm on fire
this is nothing new to me
you're bound to lose the game
you think you're untouchable
you say it to my face
you think you're untouchable you take a fall
i cant use what i cant abuse
i cam to shut you up
i nearly died
i nearly died
i cant stop when it comes to you
we could fly a helicopter
trying hard to fit among you
i go mental
rip it all to shreds and let it go
nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud
why do you love me
oh man aint that the truth
why do you love me
i get back up and i do it again
why do you love me
i'd keep my promises if only i could
c'mon sugar let's go out tonight
all i believed in
just like i told you
and i'm falling over
bleeding for you
i wont take it like the other girls
do what you want to do
i'm afraid there is so much to be afraid of
i'm about to dive
deadwood but you hold on to it
then comes marriage
killing the fire and you kill my desire
make it sound important
sometimes didnt say what
i never would have pegged you
nothing you learn will stick
you're so good to me
i got down on myself
and you cant say the word cause i need to know
to the rooftops
through the storm
just take the car
a masochistic lamb to slaughter
to help me with my self esteem
you still dont know what you think of me
nothing will come sucking your thumb
bury me above the clouds
kiss me blind somebody should fix me now
fix me now i wish you would fix me now i wish you would fix me now
fix me now i wish you would fix me now somebody should fix me now
things dont have to be this way
chorus
and sacrifice my self
if you dont let me down
are you ready to get deep down
let's go driving and toddling around
get bizzy with the fizzy baby
but that's all right
i think it's fair to say my dear
girl dont come i think it's fair to say my dear
give out the same old answers
this was so unexpected
i knew you were mine for the taking
i'm leaving you behind
sweat it all out
so a hammering in my head dont stop
in my happy home i read the signs
i dont think i like you much
all i want is you
i think i'm paranoid
bend me
and everything you think you had baby
do you really think i'm made of stone baby
took too much and now i'm done
is wrong
were you strangling me
i'm so sorry
i was taking care of business
i'm so sorry i regret everything
there was a lot of business giving there
i like you best when your on your knees
and i just have to look away
so no of course we cant be friends
so no of course we cant be friends
not while i'm still so obsessed
my blood is pumping through my veins
i hold a force i cant contain
chorus
i couldnt control you
i
a mind of your own
well you and i
there's times i think you just like to fight
and show to me it's okay to be
for the sake of conformation
there must be rebel blood
sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
but if you're gonna leave your mark
rubber squealin gears a jamming
grab a bite to eat
aint goin down 'til the sun comes up
aint givin in 'til they get enough
and there they go again
and the house he lived in grew up room by room
fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands
now he's goin home this time to stay
and asked her if she needed a ride
and i used to think the night
three days later we came up for air
and a goodbye note that read
if your paycheck depends on
but when your dollar goes to all of those
and they love to play it loud
for your frustration
well i wrote our names a thousand times
burns for one without a name
and the light in the manger
and the blind will see
through the stable door
seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
oh it's a b double e double r u n
come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
a song that we all knew
another's voice joined in
to see us find a better way
it's for us to find it here
chorus
he sure cant spend it now
well now the
big money's where it's at
take a look at this bank account
why i always run away
on where we'd settle down
another bridge goes down
what i'm doin cant be undone
such a strange combination of a woman and a child
and a couple dollars change
operator wont you put me on through
on her lips i keep tasting
is like a woman sometimes
i wish i could hold her
there's no exceptions to the rule
i've never been nobody's fool
you could almost hear those prairie winds blowin
outnumbered by plenty they were almost too cover
well i still remember the day that it happened
well now they're all sayin cowboy bill was a hero
even when she gets muddy
she's the cover of a magazine
if it's a mountain
with my cowboy cadillac
she's my honkin tonkin
so god looked out all over creation
nothins changed since the dawn of creation
and one hell of a ride
and she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
trips to paris on the leer
i seen the bright lights of memphis
and we can walk together
at the house on the edge of town
it's been a year since she ran away
and all the boys there at the bar
down in dixie land
sometimes it just comes down to
they'll come looking for some one to blame
that's gonna do it for you
she's shown no more
if you cant swim the tide
then sometimes
maybe even save yourself
baby make it okay
it blows and nobody know what it's gonna do
and i would hate to have you find me again
it blows and nobody knows where's it going to
the other day i saw a car like you used to drive
and when the song was over
wondering what might have been
and i dont ever
it's a mans world
for the good times
i know time is money
i've got the champagne chilled
repeat chorus
'cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire
standing outside the fire
hopin that somewhere down the line
take the keys to my heart
all that work under the hood
baby makes my motor yearn
'cause if your gonna hang tight cut loose
we love to hear you stomp and sing
'cause we all came here to party
'cause we all came here to party
and burn it down
'till the sun come back around
when the magic happens let it all hang out
and to burn it down
we know you like to party
that girl is a cowboy
she's the guy i call
i made it home although
there's just something that a cowgirl has
'cause sometimes the best cowboys
since that autumn night outside the county fair
and not too many people came
someday he'll tell her about the money he hid
wheat fields as far as i could see
even a boy could recognize
that summer wind was all around me
to watch a storm with all its wonder
when i havent seen her face
she had to ride the heat of passion
something so sweet though incomplete
some of our stories fade as we grow older
and i'll tell this story this way time and again
to fix the door and patch the wall
they she just went crazy
and the words that she had said
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
reaches out
i do this so this world will know
and no matter what you do it's still the same thing
never changes me
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
pushin horns werent easy like the movie said it was
and the water was risin so damn fast
and he rode for all his horse would ride
still singin strawberry roan and little joe
for a moment wasnt i a king
and his rope's pulled way to tight
he's got a fever fever fever fever
what he loves might kill him
he gets so tired of hangin on so tight
i said the donkey shaggy and brown
i cooed him to sleep that he should not cry
the gifts that they gave emmanuel
on a cage made of rushes and twine
maria had nothing to bring
and out of the cage bird flew
by the very first nightingale's song
but somehow i couldnt help but have my doubts
he said son it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
and i just pray some day i'm half the man he is
they were finally where desire dared them to go
lord the night will only know
and they watched her fall in silence
bound by their behavior
with his reindeer and his sleigh
and they're loadin down his sliegh
yeah the old mans back in town
he's spreadin cheer around
before i came on stage
for bev roberts out in camden park
if it werent for the code of the road
no rules young fools comin from the old school
back before the buses and the
the picture they're painting
steam on the window salt in a kiss
tempered and strong fearlessly drawn
oh the red strokes
and a dreamer's just a vessel
i'll never reach my destination
choose to chance the rapids
there's bound to be rough waters
so i will sail my vessel
did she just ignore the signs
whirl like a hurricane
it's time that
she keeps telling herself
the city's lookin like a ghost town
she's pacin by the telephone
another love grows cold
but on the wind and rain
as the storm blows on
he wont do this again
now in pennsylvania folks are traveling
when i was so afraid
it was your voice that gave me wings
and any time i doubt myself i think of you
it was your voice that gave me wings
this may be california but oklahoma's in her eyes
it's plain to see she's tired of hanging on
he started screamin hallelujah
well i could hear those church bells ringin
just like i came in
right to the bitter end
and deb said she might bring a friend
i wonder what she thinks of me
and i say what a great time it's been
and since we've no place to go
the fire is slowly dying
let go of my hand
longneck bottle
you know she wont understand
i've played every field i suppose
heaven knows
baby i have found
blood of life in this town is gone
just to see what it was all about
it aint for better but it's for good
cuz what aint goin down
everywhere that mary went
and so the teacher turned it out
why does the lamb love mary so
maybe it's for the best
spinning inside my head
and its grey skies turned to blue
i'm mr blue
i wont tell you
i wont tell you
make their special dedications
caller on the line could you please hold on
said honey who you talking to
or 'till the night time disappears
well it's up to you i'm here for years
for the last two weeks no one's been home
seem to be the only friends i've left at all
oh my baby no esta aqui no more
'cause when she left she tookall my dinero
she left me here with nada
some things can be good forever
two hearts can be one together
they line up at night time at the bar
the memories and the pain
or the money they spend
now the lessons been learned
the moon was bright as a readin light
and boy you sure missed the track
they've never seen a hawk on the wing
they aint a'gettin nowhere
nobody gets off in this town
the high school dances are always a bust
no nobody gets off in this town
and we were still dancin along
so i went back to see her again
it's the most wonderful time of the year
there'll be parties for hosting
it's the most wonderful time of the year
i've never got down on my knees and asked the lord above
i've never been nobody's fool
when their eyes met they both began to smile
he'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things
to know she's needed
our family never shared
lord he must have
that blood is thicker than water
but i cant understand
and see what god's
but there's somethin 'bout this time of year
hung up the phone sat there and wondered
what she's doin now is tearin me apart
and they rave about our view
what she feels is so warm and real
so i made up my mind to learn my lines
when the rain is blowing in your face
i've known it from the moment that we met
i could make you happy make your dreams come true
workin on a full house
she loves me tender when the goin gets tough
lord the perfect combination is her heart and mine
lordy mama we'll be two of a kind
with a smile and a kiss
lord i need that little woman
we're playin for fun but we're playin for keeps
i was feelin the blues
and i swear to my soul
oh now i've gotta say
that i think i've gotta stay
just the other night a hometown football game
that just because he doesnt answer doesnt mean he dont care
for the gifts in my life
intrinsic intrigue
that'll surely light the flame
is all she knows of her destiny
what's in a name
oh welcome to the game
for unto you this night a child is born
peace on earth and tidings of great joy
but you cant keep a good man down
on a horse of a different color
and he never did get too proud
he'll never wear a business suit
and they bought his name
he's still the local hero
we're proud to say
that promises get broken
but you cant say i didnt warn you
and you can try to fool your friends
oh you know when i look into your eyes
well that's just my way
i go out walkin after midnight
i'm as lonesome as i can be
cant think straight since you found her
some made it for romance
it's gettin to the point
we bury the hatchet
we bury the hatchet
if we could ever remember
we bury the hatchet
we shall be free
when this world's big enough for all different views
when there's only one race and that's mankind
what child is this who laid to rest
the silent word is pleading
haste haste to bring him laud the babe the son of mary
and your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage
then the night exploded and you begged him no
'cause it'll never go away
he's a'rattlin 'round inside
lazy yellow moon coming up tonight
you and me going fishin in the dark
i've waited all winter for the time to be right
where the cool grass grows
we'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
and he offers salvation
he points to the bible
these rags that i'm wearin
he knows soon in heaven
well these rags that i'm wearin
and when i looked up you were standing
for a minute there
and the cars all started honking
are bright as they could be
the last one to know
'cause i've got friends in low places
everything's all right
where the whiskey drowns
and everything is alright
go tell it on the mountain
they found a lovely manger
he came to redeem all creation
to save us all from satans power
oh tidings of comfort and joy
they found him in the manger
from the hills to kaycee wyoming
as we all sang along
and them pickup men are at your side
he would not slow down
and just ledoux it
be more like chris
good ride cowboy good ride
i keep tellin you hard luck woman
and wipe the tears from your eyes
rags i really love ya
make the yuletide gay
once again as in olden days
that wind blew pyramids to egypt
what it's like when dreams become reality
without a risk of being burned
if you're down here doin
if you want to get the truth to admit it
how it feels to hold him
how you ever gonna know
so i sat alone
as they opened up the doors
i took your ring from my pocket
now i dont have to wonder anymore
but you might need this fool around in case you fall
so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
and she must face the world without me
and avoid that circumstance
if tomorrow never comes
in another's eyes
this picture perfect portrait
tryin desperately
this picture perfect portrait
they couldnt move west and they couldnt go home
so they got married and they had a child
she watched her boy grow into a man
as the shots rang out down the rio grande
she learned the language and she learned to fight
deep within the emerald isle
i can see your rolling fields of green
i tell them to make ready
as in silence we draw near
we were forty against hundreds
if you walk out that door
so without you
like it's just another night
i guess your prince charming
and the party's just begun
there's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
yet in they dark streets shineth
and praises sing to god the king
i talk to people who arent there
from leavin you behind
i stay up with the late late show
mama would wait for that call to come in
well it was bound to happen and one night it did
the desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
sometimes i tell you
come so close
and everyone knows
sometimes my heart
on each day that he's given
maybe it's the music maybe it's the crack
maybe it's the athletes maybe it's the dads
everybody get together
maybe it's the brothers of the mothers or the guns
it aint gonna get better
maybe it's the future maybe it's the end
dark brown eyes
rodeo or mexico
tell a girl like that goodbye
as i woke up to the
just to change the way he feels
he'll win the next go 'round
and her back's against the wall
he'll win the next go 'round
just to pay to play her game
he'll win the next go 'round
she was born to a mother trucker
life's gonna run you over if you dont get goin
then she reached down and she kissed
you got to keep it
is keep it
movin with the motion of a melody
until he lets her go
and a voice
or daddy looked a lot like him
or i'd hear what was said
i never heard the sleigh bells ring
santa was much too thin
but if you need to be satisfied
but i cant walk away from you
but i've never been in love like this
oh i'm shameless
she's every place that i've never been
when it comes down to temptation
he'd never seen that dress before
he's at the foot of the mountain
and the craze thing about it
she's gonna make it
glory streams from heaven a far
city sidewalks busy sidewalks
strings of street lights
ring a ling hear them ring
our cheeks are nice and rosy
it'll be the perfect ending
and the pumpkin pie
and it was strong
you found everything you needed
fog turning to ice
how could it snow in july
and i think i figured out
she wants something with a ring to it
is with a wedding band
i can see you got your eye on this old cowboy
'cause whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
to put up with the life a cowboy leads
when that old rooster crows at dawn
this is a song that nobody knows
a tape of my failures
this is the dance i do every day
i listen and i wonder
it's been tossed about lost and broken
raining down against the wind
i'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end
when you come back to me again
oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight
tell me which one of them will you be tonight
i say black you say white
sendin up sendin up sendin up a white flag
sendin up sendin up sendin up a white flag
that highway calling
see the morning sun
if there aint nothing wrong
they would never recognise me
and god aint never
just when you're lookin elsewhere
lookin for forever
wild as the wind is
wild as the wind
i made a promise to diane
and her heart is all i break
wild horses keep draggin me away
sleigh bells ring are you listening
he'll say are you married we'll say no man
i been all night drivin heifers
then i spent a long time thinkin
but tonight outside my window
i need you like a penny needs a wishing well
there aint a number high enough to end this phrase
so i lie here on the couch
so you move me on
out of myself and into the fire
oh 'cause you move me
'zat you santa claus
my legs feel like straws
but i cant explain why i'm shaking that way
though i went through some nights
when the valley was low iit didnt stop me no no
i just laugh i know you do i just laugh
once i had a secret love
at least my heart's an open door
i'd say love would keep us from pain
and i'm so scared
you've brought me to my knees
it's late
you know
i'd be there instead
if i'd only seen it sooner
for that moment with you
i cant help thinking it's american
dealing out justice
you knew i could not resist i needed someone
cant believe i'm the one i was so lonely
loves me better
and our love's so deep we cannot measure
my heart was broken i was not open to your suggestions
i think it's amazing
my heart was broken i thought that loving you
i think it's amazing
i said celebrate the love of the one you're with
my american angel he doesnt want to fight doesnt need to fight
through all of those battles then you came
because i dont think that i could love and lose again
hut in passing will grow older everyday
did you know that life has given love a guarantee
until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
as around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
until the trees and seas just up and fly away
however do you want me
until you're ready
a positive change
i know where i stand
once i built a tower now it's done
buddy can you spare a dime
gee we looked swell
someplace better than where you've been
gome in closer sweet release
from all this gloom life can start anew
i'm never gonna dance again
to the heart and mind
we could have lived this dance forever
it's a shame
holding my breath as they knock knock knock on our door
take care of yourself
throwing yourself under cars and trains
you were a mother and child
mama dont you let him stay please
i should know by now the way i fought for you
they all have the time for you
they dont understand
harmless affection
but i'm so scared
all dreams and wide eyes in the big big city
how could he ever have known
i've still got nothing
outside these skyscrapers
i'm coming to paris
you just dont care
and there'll be no crying soon
e que os desafindos tambem tm coracao
when i ask those questions baby
i have too much fun
we never would have made it past holding hands
would i have to let you go
the world is full of lovers
closed the door and left me blinded by the light
chorus x 2
'cos if you aint got time for me
what am i guilty of
and i can make you happy if only for a while little baby
could you please be so kind
let's just say that maybe
looking for some affirmation
chorus

i will be the one who loves you
but then laughed as you cried
i wont let you go my baby

i think there's something you should know
is take these lies and make them true somehow

that he never could bring to you
and get to your heart somehow

sadness in my eyes
i've waited for you all those years

oh i count to ten
why cant you do it why cant you set your monkey free

mother's pride
and at the shore she waves her son goodbye
no difference in the end

because i gotta tell you

getting hard to find a decent song to play

she said he couldnt wait for the things that i've seen
in endless sky
same desire different time

hey mama is it true what they say
and dealing in dirt
but mother i'm depending on you
mama i'm depending on you to tell me the truth
some bad talk going around sayin

'cause these are the days of our lives
i still love you
with sorrows to impart
big men feeling small
people sinning just for fun
since my soul conceived
though they do pretend
away from saddened eyes
unclean minds mislead the pure
far away from me
from my destiny
but i've had my say
and everything must change
what kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage
i hear the sound of a memory

i just want to go to sleep
to chase the rainbow that you're after
tonight
i gotta get inside of you
hey you're just too funky for me
tonight my goals in sight yeah
would you like me to seduce you is that what you're trying to tell me
everybody wants a lover everybody wants a lover like that
my memory serves me far too well
but something i just cant explain
oh my memory serves me far too well
how my poor heart could have
come on back to your baby
george michaelmick jaggerkeith richards
so they're not so strong
but you once said
she's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me
searching for this woman i love
she aint going anywhere under one love
i was in despair you see me till she found me there i will live
when you're awake
oh the tricks your mind can play
and laughed before
seem to be happening again
and wild is the wind
with your kiss my life begins
wild is the wind
clings to the tree
she thinks of when the boy was young
it's a cruel world
but i was terrified
it's a cruel world
lover dont love too much
so it's better to turn the page
i cant stop dont you know that i want you
take you home
it's so easy to forget myself where
that sparkle in your eyes has gone
i cant realise you ever cared
you're not the anges i once knew
4 minus 3 equals zero
cause i'll be nothing without your love
never was my cup of tea
to spend the night
looking into her eyes i'm thinking about future plans
but if i'm ever gonna mend this broken heart
you look like a real good place to start
life is a gamble a game we all play
no matter what you do
adalida pretty little cajun queen

she'd go away when the grass turned green
holds my baby blue tonight
chorus

chorus
i'd be your fool
well baby you're wrong
how could you do what you gone and done to me
and you're the way you are
but that's what you get
thats what i always say
like im such a happy man
but these circumstances aint funny
where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal
i've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal
ive seen that look on me a thousand times
held under your spell
i just couldnt control the tears
i dont care what they say other lovers do
that's what they invented dancing for i just wanna dance with you
repeat chorus
but all i left her was blue
now i'm here alone after leavin her lonely
and i dont want to be here anymore
so i dont want to hear it from you
far away and clear
when i caught you cheatin me it was my worst time
its the last time the first time
this is the big one
i tell myself
it goes without sayin
and some aint been easy to find
gone he played the fair in dallas one year in the cold october rain some
chorus
chorus
there's a difference in
from the back of my deck
'til you share it with someone else
something's always missing

i think you better leave
grandson fo a schooner man
sammy is a dad to be
fever took his better half
at first she's gonna come on strong
with that guy you used to be
like it's going out of style
remember when i was dad's pride and joy
nothing on god's green earth will make her stay
so tell me word for word what he said
you got stars on the water
just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water
let's stop the hurt before it starts
a new coat of clean on his pick up truck
yeah honey that's me
that's me with a capital m
well that's just great
what goes around comes around they say
you know i am
that's the breaks
i said i dont love you and i aint never been your fool
i dont mind the darkness alone in this room
that htere's not another living soul for miles and miles around
and they'll know just what country means
this is the big one
i tell myself
if you sit here i'll be glad to share
arent they would you like to dance
when she dealt the cards i dealt my heart
and as the credits role a sad song starts to play
you're a feeling i havent forgot
what love is all about
i dont know how to handle
that's my name
with a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go
i work twenty four on and twenty four off
the king of broken hearts doesnt ask much from his friends
he thinks of troubles that he's gotten in
he recalls how his heart got broken
who will always save the day
but when you're needing something special
and the dreams you have dont come alive
maybe i could tell the difference between
standin at the edge of the sky
my baby's gone and she dont care
if he hadnt i sure wouldnt be here with you now
i'm glad they had the nerve
thank god he had the nerve
if somewhere down the line the wheels come off
i dont think that i'm afraid to die
and the only thing i have left in the whole wide world is you
but a million tears and million beers have just about washed me up
and it would take more than the crew cuts
i remember old elvis when he forgot
i dont want you under my roof with your 86 proof
different drummer
i've chosen a pathway i may not endure
on the road less traveled
chorus
was it ever this easy for ole jesse james
the new messiah
there's a new kid in town
i drove her out i must've been blind
that's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
my friends have all got whiskey and they dont mind if i share
i'm goin down louisiana way
we knew the time would come around for me to go
no fault no blame nobody done no wrong
wish you well
it just wasnt in the cards
and i'll start feeling i forgot her
and i'll start feeling i forgot her
oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour
well my mother in law says she's
the whole neighbourhood goes
and with tears in my eyes i lied
at the thought of her lying somewhere else
to a mansion on the hill
to both knees on the ground
it's hard to take a fall
and one night comin down
he's got a fool hearted memory
a thousand times
let ther be not one soul left untold
for christ's sake it's christmas
our love keeps us together
i've heard all those come on lines
frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop
go on go on you were sayin how a fool can only fool you so long
even when you see no reason to
gives no clues at all
more or less unimpressed
jerry chesnut
and the sound of laughter runnin out the door
havent you heard momma is gone
and either way i'm a loser
i've followed and folded i'm wilted in place
with your heart broke and running from the reason
heart broke who kept me from leaving
works until the daylight's gone
sing a song about the heartland
sing about the way a good man
her good bye hit me in the heart
her good bye hit me in the heart
her only bad habit is me
she's perfection she's a ten
she has just one weakness i see
chorus
lookin back over my love life
the walls that surround us are slowly crumblin down
it just needs a little home improvement
lock the doors up tight turn on the code a phone
let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent
i'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
someday she's going to be my very own
better baby your baby with a love that's strong
repeat chorus
you trembling body tells on you
the only brick left holding the wall
there's a hundred dollar bill on the table
let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
cause tonight i'll be honky tonk crazy
one here please just one more beer and i'll be on my way back to the blues
my wife left me five years ago
i'm a little bit over the hill
i guess i must be gettin slow
i love you need i say more
i'd rather tell you
is more than mere words can describe
i'll love you forever need i say more
she's nearly out of control
to play something'n real slow
i lose track of time
is to get out on that limb
chorus
cause today my world slipped away
and may all your christmas's be white
down on neon row
to neon row
and putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
i've told myself a million ttimes it's over
really make this work
oh how foolish i was to ever wanna leave
chorus
ive got some ocean front property in arizona
chorus
i remember how she'd hold me
oh no one else could take her place in my life
there's one thing that we both agree
tomorrow well that's another day
gonna get it right one night at a time
i lowrk hard every day to bring home all my pay
woulnt have known what to give it all to
it'll take you by surprise
she'll walk away one step at a time
like me your feeling lost
why your love can never be mine
there's no denying'
i'll ride hard all night long
there aint no doubt
cause i'm a top flight hold ya tight get ya there by daylight
sweetheart last night i know he got the very best
chorus
so why hang around when i can fly
so why hang around when i can fly
in the moonlight of san antone
willing to take a chance
but i make my livin on the go
strung together by the center line
they all start to look the same
a fourfour beat's the only time i keep
right or wrong i'm still in love with you
from that moment on
everyone was happy
i took you to a party
as far as all my friends can tell i took her leavin well
cause she's not around
if there's a plane or a bus leaving dallas
you cant get here fast enough
baby just come back
leave dallas in the dust
he's making a list and checkin it twice
santa claus is coming to town
there gonna fill the toy lad all around with christmas trees
every night she opens up the door to heaven
and you come runnin through my mind and i let my memory chase you
sometimes a man can get lost in a world of his own
some old train came passing through
when i drove her to the depot
suppose to haul my blues away
true like the sun comin up each mornin
my love for you is true
girl my love for you is true
there aint no wrong or right
with reality
a women needs a man
'cause that woman i had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
so little joy in their lives
a love like yours and mine
we really shouldnt be doin this
the first attractions was the hardest hit
well
chorus
she might never show
chorus
you're like the warm sunshine
love was never really love without you
i've fallen for you and that's a fact
so what's goin on in your world
just tell me that you're happy
how long have i been a memory
i can tell when we make love
there may not be snow in san antonio
i love to hear those christmas carolers sing
sayin catch me if you can
where the sidewalk ends
where the sidewalk ends
i guess i'll stay here
i'm not afraid to go
we said good bye
there she is again
what's your point of view
some folks think it's him
i turn towards the mirror
which side of the glass
for a man who's halfway gone
angels and devils share the same tables
then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin
even settled down a time or two
i knew a girl in mississippi
the way you got my heart a jumpin
i cant see texas from here
so if you see me looking down i'm trying not to show this frown
chorus
and as long as there's still breath in me
to keep you warm
you touch my hand and the burdens start to fall
oh by the way i met a friend of yours today
yeah i'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years
a shoulder for a shoulder
'cause i need someone like me
about this love that's so real
i wasnt fooling around
we could talk and talk and accomplish nothin
knowin what i know
so i'd just as soon go
we both said some things
i wont get halfway through town
if i know you you didnt mean
here in my heart
i've never been one for doing
'round here for years
no smoochin or a muggin
than you aint livin
and your smokin them four bit cigars
or even new york city
if you can do anything else do it
whatever you decide
this place might look real good right now
if you can do anything else do it
if you're thinking you want a stranger
picked up some roses and champagne on the way
as for me i'll always be lovin you
as for me i'll always be lovin you
wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
i'm never gonna let you go
than change you for somebody new
but if i'm only dreaming i sure dont want to wake
and i dont know why
doing all i can
cause i'm in too deep to pull out now
and i will always love you so
she'd leave so easily
wondering if she'll come back
she'd make her threats
i'm back to bein me
for the first time in a long time i like seeing what i see
the who i was before i was your used to be
a heartache drowns as the whiskey pours
i hear tell there's people out there who dont know
chorus
but this time the feelin is strange and different
and i'll be the first to proudly shake his hand
and i fell in love again for my last time
i guess she caught her train and that's a crime
then out of the blue clear sky
aint love a funny thing
out of the blue clear sky
i know i've been away too long
but it's alright baby
she said dont bother comin home
with a cowboy like him it could be anything
baby i'm long gone
carried away
it's my strength for holding on
west virginia down to tennessee
i'm carrying your love with me
will blow like a cold winter squall
i've shivered all day and when i look in her eyes
chorus
c'mon along and we'll go down
i'll take you honky tonkin in my old pick up truck
it's dance time in texas where the wine and music flows
i'll lose my pride i'd even step aside
do the right thing baby do the right thing
does fort worth ever cross your mind
does fort worth ever cross your mind
you better tone down
start behaving
i watched from my window as she slipped from the house
i'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again
when things get bad at home you dont feel like being alone
but it's the best way to get by that i've found
and he said
i took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
had all the chicks to myself
nobody's ever seen it
and it fooled me hit me
but she lets down more than her hair
when we go out somewhere
she's a lover in disguise
she's got that kind of lovin
hey i'm in love
this is all i can say
but i cant speak for you maria
when i sleep with you maria
when i sleep with you maria
in marina del rey
like the ocean tides
she lights up the room
we move to the end
you're still lying with me
it's christmas time
i hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin blue
it burns for you today
please drive her on home
ou you treated me this a way
dont that ol army cot look lonely
you aint gonna see me
1st chorus
2nd chorus
my heart wont wonder very far from you
but they wouldnt believe how good my luck's been
and everywhere she goes
and i lost her behind those swinging doors
my old flame's out burning
so why not now why not here
baby you know that's right
together forever
so why not now why not here
a beautiful sight we're happy tonight
when you're in town later one we'll conspire
and what the cost was
taking up her time and tying her down
chorus
she said oh wont you come home and talk to a stranger
and if you'd just come around the house
write this down
chorus
i'll swear under oath
folks will be reading these words long after we're gone
but i hope you realize
to make the feelin grow
but you cant make it fall
the crying' is over
must be somethin i missed
everything she left behind is yours
everything's gone
as i went down the list
everything's gone
you know the me that gets lazy an fat
i'm in culture clean up to my ears
that flush on your cheeks
i wish
you look so good in love
this healing is taking forever
to mend my mindand put me out of my misery
keep dancing this dance all wrong
new steps dont come easy when old memories hang on
now i'll do anything
it hurts to know that i caused you to leave
how it happened i dont know or care
and if still loving you means i'm weak then i'm weak
if the love that we knew dont bother you
honey you're the cloud i'm on when i'm high
when i know i've had much more than enough
i cant figure you out
living like a kid
without a second look
i've lost my mind on what i'd find
yeah i didnt know i was lost at the time
party girls between the sheets
it's all for the best that i cant figure out
everything i want to say
more than to tell you
so tell me why
jesse valenzuela doug hopkins
she had a way just like you do
to make me feel just like a woman should
falling down in my mind down in my mind
oh it's not easy to let you know
looking up i saw nothing
a competition smile
i'm never going back to college
for just one good day job
vocals jesse valenzuela
and the things she wont say
since i've had you beside me here
anyplace but those i know by heart
i'll follow you down but not that far
all the lines you wrote to me were lies
like when you left and i was last to know
i write your name drive past your house
life aint no picture show
i'm thinking that i could change her mind
telephone's ringing by my bed
i'm plain wore through waiting for your call
and anyway i've got no place to go
and not to sleep around
to take its placehey jealousy
i was never really even
didnt really wanna live it over
anytime the pickins look too easyhold me down
and dr feelgood comes around
when those doors swing open and all the drinks are passed around
i aint in no big hurry
but i've been filled with worries
i can i can i can sleep without you
i lie awake half the night
all the bugs would crawl in my sleep
this car i'm driving cant drive me fast enough
monday morning takes me back to where i have to be
i bought her films yeah i bought all her magazines
the last horizons i can see are filled with bars and factories
with words we build and words we break
i seen the sun come up
you know that this small world
take cover scotty
her response is getting stronger
with my books and with my tapes
get in the car and drive through town
read my palm and tell me
it seems i do my best by accident
every turn i take is comforting
streetlights on the night air's cool
in a day then i'll be leaving
in the shade below the eaves
she sees all the cars around the parking lots of bars we've played and stayed
in a day then i'll be leaving
fools rush in
we're bankrupt here for now
missed pull out ramps
what the hell did you expect to find
when the music is that loud
only pieces of the night
every sou katie blew
so it's root root root for the home team
cagey casey knew what to do
oh that was how i met
with that slave dealer's daughter
she could be anywhere at all
i want to wake up next to her
i didnt ask
who gets what they say
still thinking about not living without it
i dont know all the answers
it's real to me but not like these fools
i dont know what to do anymore
slow down virginia

bill leen robin wilson
c'mon sweet amnesia
these suspicions have been long drained dry
when it comes down

i tried my imagination but i was disturbed

867 5309 867 5309
a thousand words were spoken
want you to know i'm just like you
when the world gets in your way
nothing's changing anyway
honestly
now i feel unknown
hey you never made it
someday you never made it
and i wont take long to burn
you drown in deeper oceans
but your eyes look away
started thinking 'bout the things we used to do when we were young
i'm already there and i'm ready there
cuz that's a sad excuse
amigone
miracles gone wrong
that miracle's gone wrong
amigone
another second time around i've been runnin from ya

but you cant be
yeah you have become
let me remind you
you're here with me
until we leave this behind
until we leave this behind
until we leave this behind
and i try to make this kind and clear
and something only you can give
and somehow stop this fight
now your world is way too fast
god it's good to be alive
what you fear is your desire
chorus
i'm feeling strong oh so distracted
you got to mix it child
yeah when you call my name
cuz you were the same as me
you know the lies they always told you
comin down the world turned over
what you became to me
that was your womb
comin down the world turned over
comin down the years turn over
see the young man sittin in the old mans bar
cuz you're livin in a world that you're best forgotten around here
the world slapped in your face
waitin for his turn to die
waitin for his turn to die
i wont let you fall until you tell me so
and she leaves without a sound
would you come my way
said you're burnin up inside and no one seems to tell
oh you hurt me
cuz you're burnin up inside
trying to be heard
while the other half dreams
and you were my fear
'cause we're never gonna win
i wish i had a saxophone
dont close your eyes to me
and i had silly dreams
close your eyes to me
come on and show me

you whispered in my mouth
yeah you're gone and you aint coming back
'cause you're gone and you aint coming back
brand new goo goo goo dolls
that i've had in my past
see me in a different light you're so blind
we've paid the price and now we're both alone
oh you're so distant
everything you are
i'm drowning in your dizzy noise
everything you are
inside it's safe
outside the trees and the cars in the back
give him a hand give him a share
and you stand there
the moment you decided to let love in
this game you play
there's nothing we can do about
the moment you decided to let love in
why dont you listen to me
why dont you listen to me
i've got painful sliver from thinking too much
oh i can smoke and drink but i cant pay my rent
you're not supposed to be that way
and anything you want there's nothing i could say
and the black and white world never fades to gray
love is sold out
love is sold out
well there's a way you look at things
bright as you are dont get burned by your lucky star
now it seems that i've gone too far
messed up yeah
messed up messed
i realized i was fallin off the face of the world
i'm at the wrong end of the looking glass
a million miles away
oh such a distortion
yeah i'm fadin and i call out
yeah i'm hiding in the fallout
inside your head
by anyone
that's a shame
is more than who we are
ow
i asked her if she wanted to dance and she said
she asked me if we couldnt be friends and i said
la la la oh oh woah

there's no way out
all the places that i go it's ching ching ching
i stand around and i think it's gonna work
still where she was comin from
and i know she wears glasses

when you feel foreign to love
you know you never know when they'll come
on the lie

energy here in every metal heart
what you get is what you need
backstreet suckers
dying
close your eyes and just
a smell of sulphur lays over me
i must leave this state of terror
you're gonna die like the other men
guitar solo
we turn the music loud burn in the heat
we keep until we are dead
the one we adore
writing tales of pain
but masters of the fight
highlanders' victory
my king won another crown for scotland's pride
you gain a crown we pay the price
die in pain and anger
but history is mercyless
a journey which will lead us to the legendary world of the knights of the cross
i see a dolphin cry
you're a precious girt
choose who is worthy of you
opened me the gate
sorcerer
back where i belong
ascend the throne and
hard time have been passing by
fanatic assassins
this land is ours
so much room for you and me

time's runnin on
cries in his pillow
gathering all the victims
when he stabbed comyn in a church
all at stake
to the castle where my bliss dwells the wings take me
you cant escape as the sun turns to black
we all live in a state of hate
norwegian soldiers on our land
4 times
we did stand
armed and ready stand my rights i must defend
crown no doubt
rebellion on my mind
no presidents no majesties
nobody can deny
it's not thepromised land

shadowmaker shadowmaker in the dark of light
i'm the emptyness between two lovers feeding them poison till they hate each other i'm smiling as finally under tears they part and nourish myself from their broken heart i'm sowing bewilderment between those who trust i'm kicking your dearesst dreams in the dust where hatred rules i will dwell call me devil then you live right in hell living on the dark side i'm living in your head you're feeding me despair and i shall drive you mad i exist in you in the shadows of your brain i belong to you and you know my name like a child you grew me every day of your life if you say you know me it is a liei'm white and pale because i live in the night of your happy days of your lifeline so bright i'm growing stronger from the hate in your soul i'm growing stronger till i take control i'm living on the dark side i'm living in your head and i shall drive you mad
shadows of a moonless night
could right now be over and away
cold winds blow
smog alert
shoot her down i said down down down
309
by day
kiip away from me
night is cold and black what is it that we are fighting for
storming the brain storming the brain
oohohoho storming the brain
with nothing to drink
i can jump through the fire
kill rape eternal glory
no more human sanity
makes me cry tears are in my eyes
falling down tonight
my husband fled my luck went down
i've been true i gave my heart
the king is calling i must obey why do we have to kill
god knows we gave it all a damned day i saw many fall
fight and kill we will win the battle of louden hill
fight for your land the battle of bannockburn a lesson they did
when i feel my end is near
the last judgement will decide who was wrong or who was right
alex king you did win the day
face to face on the battlefield
mingeling stream
the final war
fools i will lead you down
the grave is open a digger's smile
the raft of death now leaves the landing
and so is even the king
forever we fight
instrumental
i feel my end is near
i love her more than life and this is what she takes
god is love hell is open
forces of darkness than shall not rest
enchanted by its melody
and to erase the past
dream and put your mind at ease
it's cold and wet
desaster's burning high
tyrant
under my flag you'll never loose again
come on baby i do it just for you
you cant escape me i find you everywhere
we wanna rock you
we are back now
we wanna rock you
watch out watch out
new and four here we are we come to rock
what you feel is it real
every night
guitar solo
it's my wedding day
evil thoughts and evil doings
empty bottles and empty glasses
bloody dreams and nice white rats
beat the english at sterling brigde i will guard the scotish throne
nightmares haunt my lonley nights
wrapped up all in black
cant you see him frown
tonight he will stay
dont be fooled when he cries
nobody comes to show you a line
yesterday no yesterday no
no no no no
there's always fire 'round the night
wipeing out the wise below
shape your eyes and watch them burn
heart attack
what you have to do
bang until you die
'cause the power and the glory is an aim in history
gonna kill someone who's nice well i told you my aim's higher
death in action brings the promised land
longing for god to reveal
stories of horror of life and death
wanna see your face no more
crazy scene
satisfactions growning less
templars are blamed for conjuration
make your confession
jesus raised it to his lips
know the hide heaven chose
by god's grace i'm the king james the 7th obey or death i bring
killing time hang the victims hang them high
blood leads to glory for god's sake
whrer the islam dwells
i sword to save the king
forbidden fruit
when she longs for me
the moon of madness is shining
they're marching for freedom
ref
searching for love
now they reach the end the end of the way
reflecting the suffering of war so clear
almighty king
akkon has fallen into richard's hands
dont play for keeps dont play to win
night after night
2knights of the cross
worship the lord
kings and queens
pretending integrity
leader of the underworld
his eyes hypnotize
drunken women drunken men
and metal maniacs bang to death
headbanging man
with shadows i dance
do not cross my way
i am invincible i never lose
here's this flower
we'll never break as one too strong
1000 hours
a kiss we'll share
the length i've gone are just long miles
i look down and stand there and cry
i ask you now what does this mean
i sit alone in my bedroom
cause she's 2000 light years away
she holds my malakite so tight so
dream about her
your screams and cries are never going to work
i sit in the state of a daydream
and why i could not seem to get along
could not seem
my mental stability reaches its bitter end
so i loose my head or i bang it up against the wall
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
but you turn your head and i end up talking to myself
there's no return from 86
there's no return from 86
all by myself
repeat several times
and i dont know where the heck it'll go
promises promises it was all set in stone cross my heart and hope to die
dont want a nation under the new mania
i'm not a part of a redneck agenda
one nation controlled by the media
i wonder if he knows i think he's crazy
when the old man was in school
six feet underground
before you know it you're struck down
are we we are are we we are the waiting
and screaming
never trusted anyone
on being a pessimist
i'm gettin pisst
are you leaving soon
i just need a little time
tension mounts and i fly off the wall
killed my composure and it will never come back
i've got a knack for freaking everything up
i lose control and i'm all wound up
sometimes i give myself the creeps
i went to a whore
grasping to control
as i sit around and watch you pout
i'm seeing faces
as i sit around and watch you pout
sick and tired of all this wild shoot
these handcuffs are too tight
throw me to the dogs
where the city sleeps
ah ah ah ah ah ah aaah ah
i walk alone
i walk alone
i'm having trouble trying to sleep
freaked up and spun out in my room
my mouth is dry
no one loves you and you know it
it brings me pleasure just to know you're going to die
you know i'll be there
so i'll see you there
i'll go anywhere
you i'll be there
i wonder down these streets all by myself
until you're in my sight
or is your boyfriend there
and through my veins temptation flows
like a severed severe pain in the neck
i'm all busted up
i better tell her that i love her
before she does it all over again
we're living in repetition
prototypes of what we were
self righteous wealth
it aint no big deal
will i see it again
hecko or is this goodbye
what the next man thinks of me
it's calling my name
we feel the same pain
just cant make sense
it's just like our brain
it's just like our brain
in my fist i clutch
in my fist i clutch
roaming 'round your house
may i waste your time too
with nothing else to do
reminds me of the times we shared
it's all i've got and i'm giving it up to you
you come around every now and then
what's the special occasion
it must be nice to know you got it all figured out
we
all her doubts were someone else's point of view
are you locked up in a world
vigilante
is she dreaming
the dawning of our lives
vigilante
of destruction
it's the life of a petty thief
unless you're getting caught
well you know you make me wanna
say you will say it right now baby

that needle in the vein of the establishment

i'm feeling phyced
ripping up my transfer
you're mommy's little nightmare
welldestiny is dead
not subserviant to you i'm just alright
throw me back into the gutter
destroyed giving up the fight
well slipped into a coma once again
i take another drag off of my cigarette
so when you think you're all alone
and i know that i will suffocate
putting his hand on her thigh
i'll trick her so she'll do it
take back take back take
you pushed me once too far again
cold cocked and i'm taking back what's mine
on a night just like tonight
cant you see there's something wrong
wake up stupid something's wrong
your gonna miss me miss me
she gets so sick of crying
she gets so sick of crying
an extraordinary girl
she's a scented magazine
going once
what's in a name hey
from here to colorado

bridge
but isnt it a drag
i've had this burning in my guts now
this time we'll blast it all to heck
i've had this burning in my guts now
in telling you to freak off and die
i'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
no self comtrol
i'm on a roll
drain the pressure from the swelling
i'll tell you why
give me a long kiss goodnight
welli toss and turn all night
i'm in for nasty weather
much more than that but

that's when i say
so make the best of this test and dont ask why
he's at it again
i'll be back
and let the bastard pick apart what's left of you
and it makes great television watching the world end
things this real seems so pretend
i'll be back
of moving insects so surreal
of moving insects so surreal
of moving insects so surreal
how many feelings can you steal
ha ha you're dead
ha ha you're dead
this girl has gone far away
i'm taking all you down with me
and think about the times you spent and what they've ment
so close your eyes
to me its nothing
fermented salmonella poison oak no
like the puls of a drum
and the cheapstakes losers
beyond the shadowas of a doubt
and the cheapstakes losers
and bleed the company lost the war today
i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
bang bang goes the broken glass and
part 1 the death of st jimmy
the stems and seeds of the last of the dope
he says we're fucked up
x2
and he had plenty
get me out of here right now
left me here alone
they're all out without you havin fun
i got a rock and roll car
part 5 we're coming home again
around and around
i started fuckin running
home
home
chorus
decisions have been made the die has been cast
breakin rocks in the hot sun
i fought the law and the
i fought the law and the law won
with you around you'll only add on
i lock myself inside my room
my mind is growing hazy
its been disturbed by my thoughts
keep your sources away from me
gonna be an omnivore
i wanna be on tv
look back on so often
i question what i can give
i was there
or cause me too much sorrow
and all those nice things
how long will he last
if you come around
i guess i just cant listen
the center of attention
to know you is to bait you
always move forward
blessed into our extinction
i found my place in nowhere
i had a young and optimisitic point of view
i've got a bad attitude
i find it hard to be myself
as i dropped to my knees
i'm pathetically left here alone
and now my girlfriend is getting mad
the kids are alright
and i know if i dont i'll go out of my fuckin mind
to make me feel this way
about the words you'd say
'cause you are the one that i want
how long now
how long now
i say no matter how i try i realise there's no reply
burning day light
a thrill seeker making deals
last up at dawn tight wad hill
burning daylight
i had nobody till i met you
tired of waiting for you
so tired tired of waiting tired of waiting for you
for you
too much too soon
so god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory
too late and now it sucks to be you too
too much too soon
i got a new start on a dead end road
i've been waiting for a long time
i'm so much closer than
i have ever known
where i'm going if i get there
here comes the rain again
ring out the bells again
summer has come and passed
thinking out loud and acting in vain
do as i say not as i do because
call it as i see it even if
do as i say not as i do because
i'm a walking contradiction
cant quite tell just what it means to me
caution police line you better not cross
verse 3
say warning live without warning
i've had my share of sand kicked in my face
you brought me fame and fortuen and everything that goes with it
we are the champions
i want to take you through the waste land
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
prevailing nothing made sense
heading westward on
is it salvation
taking off
she went away and then i took a different path
i must confess
i heard you crying loud
no time to search the world around
was ever there
i think that i just forgot
was it just a dream that happened long ago
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
looks like he left you
you're feeling bad for yourself
you find a way out
still i cant close my eyes
i cant stand myself
even when the sun is shining
where have you gone
why does it always rain on
as for me i am blind without a cause
so there's nothing i can do but take the pain
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
if you want to be a hero well just follow me
promise me no dead end streets
your mother allowed you for just one white lie
that you're lacking an excuse
now i want more
i'm a snot nosed slob
nothing good can last
it goes to show
and knew
and now i think i'm sick
and so i give
your watching me
such an endless dreary time
to this day i'm asking why
so when are all my problems going to end
said that i'd meet you at the berekley marina
the jesus of suburbia
get my television fix sitting on my crucifix
part 2 city of the damned
city of the dead
it didnt say much
no one really seems to careeeeee
from the cradle to the grave
i dont care x4
part 5 tales of another broken home
i run away
running away from pain
until it gets into my thick skull
you finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love
but he could play the guitar like ringing a bell
oh my that little country boy could play
saying johnny b goode tonight
my daddy threw me in therapy
we get told to decide
instrumental song
where have all the riots gone
it's not over before it's too late
your father's rage and your mother's love
i'm leaving you tonight
dont make me ask again please
nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese
and i smell like shoot
and i smell like shoot
you're freaking lazy
today's the macy's day parade
when i was a kid i thought
a brand new hope
the one i've never known
it's all that i wanted
the dog ate the document
i want to be the minority
singled out
the only way i know
down with the moral majority
now he sleeps upon the haight
he ran the drug cartel in tinseltown
when they're low
and we're gonna get high
just because we get around
talkin bout my generation
talkin bout my generation
you're running out of gas
living on command
call me habitual
call me habitual
cause no one knows
i'm not afraid to beg
i got no pride
or you're gonna choke on it
because they turn to shoot
for input twice the size of my one inch mind
that special kind of feeling
i'm on the wagon again
forget all the disappointments you have faced
juliet's crying cause now she's realizing love can be
my immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
why does my life have to be so small
and it's time you knew the truth
i wish i could tell you
i hope that when time goes by
oh i'm an outsider outside of everything
everything you know
oh yeah yeah yeah
it disturbs me so
fill the void with i dont care
fill the void with i dont care
and i stepped in line
and i stepped in line
i'm on a mission
castaway
an expidition
watching the cars go rolling by
take me to the tracks at christie road
take away the strains of being lonely
i dont know you
you're the cloud hanging out over my head
of our lives
if i promise to go to church on sunday
but respect is something i will earn
what's happening to me
icon is the last chance for hope
deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray
nothing but hell to pay
want to do isnot togive up
nothing but hell to pay
your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray
and drown in the airwaves
give it to me now
for i'll be damned to spend my life in hell
it all amuses me
or am i playing on the stairs
my whereabouts are now unknown
every time i'm fallin down
hand up your soul to my wrist
rushings of my depression
cause i love feelin dirty
and i love it when you hurt me
but you cant choose
for out of this place
i've gone thru pain
this may sound a little rough
dont wanna fall in love
wishing she was by my side
so i'll say it in a song
keep dreaming of her
i woke up in a cold sweat
will i understand
i was just like you

with your complaints
i've played the thief
that i'm to blame

and i'll never have again
in just one day
well that you you just cant come

i punched my fist right through the glass

with a push and squeeze
i cant believe what ya say to me

chorus

galileo galileo galileo galileo galileo figaro

any way the wind blows
you better go back out and find her
but everybody darlin sometimes
another one's despair
breakdown

as if your eyes were their eyes you can tell
look at your women crying
for the love of god and our human rights
i went numb when i learned to see
your power hungry sellin soldiers
look at the lies we've swallowed
we practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials
and i dont need your civil war
hey you caught me in a coma
but my body's callin
while friends are calling back to me
in a world that's full of shit
cant stifle all my screams
'cause there's nothing to see
but who am i to tell you that i've
an all this crass communication
but nobody pulled the trigger
there were always ample warnings
it's so easy to be cool
that another man would need
he got monkey finger
feetdown below his knee
come togetherright now
where's that leave you
takin your last ride
with no control in your life ahead
somethin's changin somethin's breakin
sick of this life

but all i really ever get is greed
right next door to hell
flowin through life not collectin anyone
maybe too late to find a way when the
my only home is the wasteland that i cross
you've been fighting for much to long
we are hear for you to see
we are going against the tide
word of a legend reborn
fighting for the oath we sworn to spread the
and i always will be
and you always will be
nah nah na and you always will be
all fed up with lies
oh oh
at the end of the rainbow
here we are mighty glorious
the endless victims looking up in fear
kill with power ready to ride let's go
you made me see right past myself well beyond
evils here the lord of hell gives you the proposition
i'm just a child of the damned
follow the signs of the crimson thunder
where do we go
let our voices be there to guide you times thee
he swore the oath to fight alone
but fight without honor and you're destined to fall
but fight without honor and you're destined to fall
that life is a game you'd rather play or flee
you have to spell out what is wrong or right
let me know if wanna go there is a place for you and me
fade and see the morning sun arise
and never found again
truly know the meaning
snow is falling down on this glorious land
you're gone to the home of the brave
deep in our hearts you will live again
so this is goodbye i take leave of you and
endless mourning days will turn to years
that a silent wind can blow the candle out
far beyond that shining star
nothing on earth stays forever
now
into the wind embraced you'll fly away now fly away
down on bended knee i pray bring courage to these souls
you're gone to the home of the brave
deep in our hearts you will live again
but none of your deeds were in vain
when time has come to fall from grace
what's right and what is wrong
we run this race but we will never crawl
we saw the writings on the wall
burning burning with desire
and now the time is here
burning burning with desire
angels of mercy guardians of time
the call of the thunder the sign to begin
heeding the call one and for all
stealing our souls we're out of control
behold the might of the hammer
oooh
but everyone says different things
people tell me a and b
i want out leave me be
i want out to do things on my own
our courage will unite
in our hearts eternally we keep the flame
flame burning
on wings of glory we will carry on
in the toil of the battle
and there is nothing left to fear
you fear the dead of night
it's getting far to late my friend
do you remember how we used to say
turning diamonds into rust
your deepest fears begin to loom
you're running out of time the higher that you climb
to absence of season and time
immortal riders protectors of the earth
from the ruins of hell we shall rise
to absence of season and time
immortal riders protectors of the earth
from the ruins of hell we shall rise
fog's rising out in the fields
the autumn wind blowing
lost and never found
can you tell me why
maybe one day i'll return again
until the end of time
oh oh oh dont you step aside
oh oh oh dont you step aside
by the radiant moon he will strike
when the prowler sneaks up from behind
horse made of steel
this time the prowler will win
riders of the storm one with the wind defenders of creation
let us choose our own destiny
we had the red cross sown on
jerusalem was freed we thanked the lord for our glory
steel meets steel
the quest of the war forever sung
crimson thunder running through their veins
by divine intervention
brothers in arms are fighting tonight
a handful of brave men appeared
behind the defenders the king marches on
knowing were the power will lead
this magic of metal unites us it's making us strong
this magic of metal unites us it's making us strong
heavy metal troops on the rise
trying to live by your own goals
blaze for the ones who stands strong
all join forces with all the powers that you feel
condemned auto da f
behold the freedom cries
oh oh oh
shadows are falling again
he became the saviour that fought for her life
bringing us forward defeating the pain
when the dragon lies bleeding
i see there's a stranger among us
silently whispering my name
still holding on to the dreams torn apart
oh i thought you were there
in the twilight zone the shadows mourn
i'm falling into the breach
the time has come it must be done
out of the night came the shining
i'm a stranger in this land i'm falling
let the power be unchained
the metal age
standing strong the brave and the elder
by the force within let the war begin
all your wisdom made me seek the truth that lied
when you rolled the dice
our time has come get ready fight
walking the way of the warrior
this is the way we want it to be
surrender your soul to the gods of steel
walking the way of the warrior
the midst of the fiery rain
fierce almighty legions one by one
sending them back to their grave
the mark of the shadows still burns
nothing's stronger than
brothers in arms are fighting tonight
born in the fire they look to the sky
into the dungeons they must go
the enemies will renounce or die

just before daylight
'cause my heart's to numb to feel
when you're gone
and i'm left alone and beaten
though the road's still long and the light is still far
when the revolutions dead
something has been going on and i dont know what it is
give it up
waiting for the bright light to break through
i'm dreaming of a white christmas
without you

turned into vultures bewildered eyes
and i have no words to say
rise and see rise and be for me
rise and see rise and be for me
and prays for forgiveness
carnal truth against out beliefs
who finds the road to redemption
once we may ask for forgiveness
deliver us
but we dont know the score
the seed is sown
'cause we will still be alive
build up things they call protective
follow the sign
in the sky a migthy eagle
black you stripped me
they dont understand my last testament
in vain i scream against the wind
what you have done to me
how could you hide
someone to believe
a little thing you sure will know
let's get it up
where we'll suspend another night
to push this right in the face everyday
someday someway i may see a wonderland
strong and invincible
masquerade masquerade
in the streets on halloween
sltting there with gleaming eyes
no way to escape the power unknown
you'ii be missing the day
what has happened
redeemed or enslaved
listentake care
yeah it's halloween tonight
the truth will be the same for evermore
the truth that is in everything that is and has
feelings come and go i've never known
all that makes you move
and there you lie
there's no tear for anything
unrelenting forces blasting through the air
sounds you've never heard that take you high
one more world is help and one will destroy
to a world one know but would's that will burn
and fate did show the way
look at me who are you
look at me who are you
take me down
please go down please
dont promise any crap
to survive your mindless sound
tales full of exaggerations
welcome to the torture chamber
if you're feeling alone
mr torture sells pain
every sense is torn and ripped apart
dial 18 double 0 mr torture
can you be alike
as wild card of my kind
laughing at us is not fair
but one day i realised
music is like sunrise for me
to fly over mountains
what was inevitably
too late
my life for hours you must find the way
in the sermon of night
the last key you have to find
banish the evil
keep on trying when i give away
you merely should think of the good times
you'll never be alone
your future is pay
now it's time for hapiness
sister that day your soul gives in
oh oh you may no take it to
will there be tomorrow will there be the stars
for a little bit of faking
by seducement and cold rapture
tv sentenced to 16 years for
will there be an ending will there be a start
follow your heart follow your truth
'cause a good love's gone bad
and i wipe your tears away
but my claws wont do no harm
drone pleasure drone
get right out of here
look back and there
we've got the power
intended media mind control
push
more than a half of your lifetime
the stars look down on mankind
revelation
charity or hatred
defend the sense of life
revelation
well i think it's really time
it'll surly make our cildren feel
they would never ever have through
you cant see a thing but still hear their sounds
the longer you wait the deeper you fall
dont know where else i have been
in a time in the future
just as i will always know
i held so close and near
and we've seen its vast armies forms
please save us
we stand in the edge of the world
save us from all ignorance
in blind faith
under the silent rain
secret playing
so many mmories
sole survivor of a kill without alert
fear greed and hate
now i'm crying
takin care of my own
take me home
i got that feeling to make more than conversation
climb to your dreams
but you're not a pawn
do your best and do it right
heading to the wicked side
slowly creeping up quickly coming down
druven to our final fate
ooh who is holding the key why cant we see the dark ride
i know what's ahead
blaze across the sky
sun is going down
he lost his life as he went for mine
sun is going down
blaze across the sky
sun is going down
would you catch the bullet that was meant for me
the malediction i have got
solo both
for you i'm just the invisible man
broad is the road leading straight to hell
i'm your pain and friend
i'm the shade in the shadow
you may oust me there in the shadows
i'm the shade in the shadow
so strong and clear
and calm his shiver
time for the freedom
he called your brother
time for the freedom
and even never realize
all colour's slowly turning to gray
why do we hurt the ones we love
break down the mountain stone by stone by stone
much as you want
and we melt into
higher much higher
or was this a dreamthere in the depth
we damn the night
figures in white
we damn the night
dont think that if someones made dumb to the core
start at your side
back from where the rain grows
they split on your name
there's a reason why
tell me why
i will never make the mistake and give it back
and i reveal what i have loved before
so much more than you will know
getting stronger makes him mad burning sin
you'll always walk alone
no left without right
serve each other
hey lord
what is it all about
see warfare even there
and leave his woman choked in mace
turns into a sun
on earth will be dead and gone
i dont wanna hide
i wanna love but i always hate i wanna give but i always take
no more whys and wrong god missions
i will have my way
fulfill my dreams until i'm cured
make the call again
unchain your obscenity
i live for your pain
cause i
im your redeemer
but everyone says different things
people tell me a and b
i want out leave me be
i want out to live my life and to be free
could not tumble nor fall
my faith has grown
i could revage my jail
i could revage my jail
but if one day you just be gone
but if one day
i wouldnt know how to ever get by
i'm alivei'm alive
so many things are waitlng to be done
my mother's old grey leather gloves are singing loud the blues
no one tells me what to do 'cause no one knows what i've been through
i'm monumental
tonight we are stars
stars inside the nights of ache
stars immortal light of ache
aint good enought to show me
if you owly sad that it's not too late
i cant get any closer to your heart
the lord of evil was given name and place
to plunder with your eyes
i see the hidden without light
time will be a turning wheel
i will show you friend and foe
you want it all
we are king of a million tears
stand up you bringers of mans fate
release me believe me
say you want to live forever
binding their greed and fears
you're not gonna say that much anymore
kings will be kings
how far can one fall from down below
paws will bw paws
iron
brains out
chorus
till the world prepares to die
we got blind we cant read the signs
i will hear it very loud
light the universe
when will i see it all come true
my secret alibi
can we expect it beinthe nice as it seams
i'm being followed around again around and around again
only gets colder
i'm being followed around again around and around again
dont love me you'll hate yourself
yeah
beatin that woman to an inch of her life
the one man says
with their baseball bats and brooms
that woman to an inch of her life why you beatin that woman to an inch of
you never thought they could be so mean
so mad
to go out and do something great
how you are
the best revenge is to always survive yourself
when i look into your eyes
the days go on with emptiness
i dont care
i see what sweats you
because to me it never meant that much
no more messing around with my mind
you must think that you are mighty clever
because they wonder how you're feeling
soon the monkey's eyes become your eyes
are you ready to give it up
are you ready to rock
are you ready to hit the floor
it wont let you go
heart smasher
i wont be calling for long
every day is a blessing
i am one time i am right now i am what's left i am right now
i am one time i am right here i am what's left i am right now
it's pulling you down the drain
you get what you get
no safety net
living quiet or loud
bars on my windows because your not so good at crime
getting your mind off some guy's record
freedom
i'm a crazy lover
chorus
your name and smile a thrown out file
i live in self denial
i dont know why i want to hurt you
sometimes i'd rather be blind
yeah yeah disconnect myself disconnect myself
too damn bad if at the end of the day the only thoughts
they've tied my hands with rope
stare up and shout threats at my nakedness
when you kick me when you rape me
it's why i'm here

d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d do it do it
just do it just do it
and i cant get close when i get close to you
i am the garbage that i throw away
down and away down down down down and away
dont push me
some nights i walk mile after mile after mile
dirty grey city dropping rain down in my dreams
paranoid to the hilt
like i feel it like this
like a fool i'll believe it all
i know first hand so well all the hard times you direct
i dont live to love you i just want to walk the line
baby baby he lookin so cute
see me put yourself in my place
makes you think you're all alone
hate your guts and tell you they love you
it's unbelievable what they'll put you through
hard times got hard times hard times
lookin out my window sun comes up sun comes burnin down
it's hard to get high
i'm that hard man
hard sense makes sense
seeing fear in their eyes
bars on the windows locks on the door
i just wanted to kick
my dreams they all die
i am the rough that corrodes my will
as the years go by i cant deny the flame that burns inside me
and you want to slow down but i just have to fly
hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
when they tell me that i better
same old talk is dragging round and round
brain like halo
i wanna go
because they always find some meaning in it anyway
paying the price of fame
i need you here
i am the product of your restraint
what the hell did you expect
in darkness
and in need of human contact
you feel so lucky
i'll turn you into me
dont you get it yet
i'll turn you into me
oh i am a liar
i swear

they took me to see an old friend of mine
hot scream and repeat
frozen
hot
so unreal
then it's us then it's you
so obscene
on my way to the cage
fear me
i've got your world inside my fist
on my way to the cage
with all your cigarettes and fancy cars
and on the crucifix his mother made
my life my life in the suicide ranks
all in the breaks of dawn
my life my life in the suicide ranks
i open up let the darkness come in
when we gonna make it work
and when i think of you and all the love that's due
this could be our last chance
soon we will be older
and i cant stop thinking
always in the past
you could sharpen knives on the famous lives
always in the past
the shrieking of nothing is killing
but the little green wheels are following me
ashes to ashes fun to funky
my mama said to get things done
now once in awhile when i feel no shame
this is the badmans song
and they say faith can move move mountains
with such a thin drawn between friend and foe
if i care for nothing
is bloodletting go
if i care for nothing
bloodletting go
it's in the way you're always hiding from the light
and these are my plans
blue yellow pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
play to the crowd
no more sleepy dreaming
and shine a light on me
i keep coming back i'll get back to you
in my mind's eye
does she see my inner child
does she go all dewy eyed
driving me like a truck
it's all too late
you lost your honesty
what has happened to
while all the world is sinking
act like a generation
closest thing to heaven heaven
closest thing to heaven
me i dont long to belong
bigger than you hurt
when you got blood to bleed you got a life to lead
cold
broke the vows of silence
broke the vows of silence
from the sins of science
from the sins of science
mans too old and wise
two is a dog and me playing
go get a life and ease the pain
some dreams you dream alone
sink to your grave
i should have said
dont drink the water baby
i said welcome to the me world
it's elemental
patience be sure
and no action guaranteed
wake up you're holding on to nothing
a curse in every way
but you toe the line
your pen is running out of ink
you're rending members out of sync
turn your back on mother nature
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
all for freedom and for pleasure
some will swim
doing what i oughta
some are found
heaven knows the weight of this crime
melt in your arms
when the light from above
listening to the band that made us cry
and we will carry war no more
but you know by now your one restriction
where the hell have you gone
new star
shining like a new star
how can i be sure
and i cant operate on this failure
there is no why no need to try
sons and daughters of the gun
douse the candle dim the light
redefined rearranged rearranged
dont excuse it use it well
nobody sees them driving us wild
another dead beatle
oh salvation shine a light on a different world
did you know your mother was the sea
did you know all mothers come from heaven
raoul raoul raoul and the kings of spain
i always knew you were a scientist at heart
schrodinger's cat is dead to the world
but i cant understand the different you
my very own
we can say that we're lost
and when we're crossed
in the middle of nowhere think you'll like it a lot
they wont be going no place
they wont be going no place
if you could be mine
these are things i can do without
kiss them goodbye
i'd really love to break your heart
would you eyes be the size of sorrow
daylight saved
strange bright colours of madness
god might claim
sketches of pain
break them now and dont get fooled again
or son of sam
cut off my nose
will you live or will you die
to spite my face
anything is possible sowing the seeds of love
anything
everyone scream about it
and the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
like mussels in a shells
notions fall on stony ground
we buy for love
we love to
pretend too
he calls out in the night
and he's dependant on youand it seems so strange
oh dangerman oh dangerman
like a dream like it never happened
where tears roll down
but i can bleed
the way is clear
could you please explain
the hurtingget in line with the things you know
breathing but not preceiving
going far getting nowhere
no one sees and no one cares
the way you are
going far the way you are
can rearrange
and not for one
what this fear is about
you see the torture on my brow
watch me bleed
and when it's all been said or done
you love on your own
blinking every time a cold wind blow
my love wont leave her ways of foam
who killed tangerine
someone's left the tv on
she hates goodbyes
woman in chains
trades her soul as skin and bones
keeps woman in chains
and now he'll dream some magic queen might try and save his life
feel the fire go cold
this is the year of the knife
he's in casinos with aces to spare
dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime
till the time maybe right to say goodbye
i thought about it once or twice
wont escape my attention
dont break my heart
something happens and i'm head over heels
i'm lost in admiration could i need you this much
thought of your future
this is my four leaf clover
won the war lost the battle
through the myriad of schemes
through the maze precisely
all for the love of the humdrum and humble
i believe that if you thought for a moment took your time
casino spanish eyes
i've been down to the kitchen
i wish that i could change its hue
and lies spread on lies
could you be could you be squeaky clean
johnny panic and the bible of dreams
kick out the style bring back the jam
i dream of heaven
with elegant crimes against the state
watch how they grow
dont blind them with science yeah yeah
days when we sink like a stone
ladybird fly away our house is on fire
ladybird fly away our house is on fire
the hope and glory of life ever after
laid so low for so long
made a mess i guess i have should have known
where tears roll down
'til the last days on earth
if you should fall into these opened arms
i told you
my super ego where i go he go
take fear and loathing and put new clothing on it
lord of karma
no pain no gain no pain no gain no pain no gain
and night is the longest day
ghosts all gone
ghosts all gone
no expression
'cause i find it hard to take
made to feel the way that every child should
me and my big ideas
conversation drag its feet
it's that thing we call control
there's just me and my
i'll be your toy
engulfed by you
and nothing is too dear
we can work it out
given that you pay the price
following in the footsteps of a soldier girl
what makes man so fickle
should be banging a tambourine
thunder and rain
oh listen mr pessimister pessimister
in their eyes i am something to see
'cause i'm used to sleeping alonelike a hole in my head like a rock in my shoe
last thing i wanted was you
pushing myself and this old maching
so i'm packing up and i'm headed west
when she thinks no one's around
the night can be so cold
any woman who's been hurt by a man understands
but now i got better things to do
but now i cant put forth the effort it requires
leslie satchermelba montgomerylarry cordle
if there's a cure
if there's a cure
saturday night and i'm gonna make myself a name
dont worry about me 'cause i got a wild card up my sleeve
but underneath this cool exterior
i got a passionate heart
but i never could do anything
come streaming out when you feel enough
when the ghosts are gone from inside of me
i want to pour out my soul 'til i'm empty
everytime you say let's try again
put aside the anger and the blame
everytime you say let's try again
pull the curtain back and let some moonlight in
tomorrow that old cloud may come around
oh tonight i'm getting even with the blues
dont be the first in every line
chorus you want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
brace yourself this may come as a shock to you
we cant wait to hear about your round of golf
will never be brought up again
comb it over like that
facing forward
and his strength is what makes me cry
got a house i've got a car
be yourself
this heart of mine
i'm no good beneath the reins used to makin my own choices
i face the wall you faced the window
chorus
yeah that's right i'm being stubborn
i'm sitting in traffic
i wanna do it all
down in tijuana
watch the yankees play ball
when i wanna do it
i wanna do it all
i wanna do it all
if i were you
because you wear a wedding band
angelolarry gottlieskim richey
a little banged up from the fall
i'm alright
shot down but i'm still standing
you could have sat there on a park bench
you could have been a broken dreamer
just the same
but i keep hoping we might get back
we live here together
to make our love burn with desire
in a town where no one locks their doors at night
'cause midnights gone but i'm not
but i cant pull the trigger on that changing world out there
it's been so long i cant recall his name
give me a quarter
he's just an old neon flame
chorus
no fear
i used to run away from love
i woke up at 3 am
not wondering how to shake
and i dont feel the dagger
i'm just getting used to not getting over you
my friends tell me they know things
and that's not what i wanted to see
believe you're mine
but oh it's not what i wanted to hear
oh it's not what i wanted to hear
you hold me like a prayer you touch me everywhere
looking in your eyes
you see me the real me
i skinned my knuckle
you can dress me up
tell a dirty joke
and if my mood is right
the way i walk against the grain
but the train dont run through here no more
but he really worked me over good
repeat chorus
there's a whole lot of love
making me wanna move on
'cause every girl i talk to
is going through the same thing
and a waitress with an empty stare
you say there's so much good between us
from trying to pull my spirit
you say there's no good reason
there is no in between
every beat every part
with my heart
every beat every part
that's me not loving you
the only thing you're holding is the truth
you never would forget the love you could have kept
and if it ever broke down i'd patch it up
i wish it had wheels and i wish it had wings
keeps hangin on when it ought to give up
long as the road dont run out
there's a place i'm going to
there's a place i'm going to
fireflies on a screen door
i gotta feel a deep pang
it aint sophisticated
it's gotta bend a heart strang
you sit in silence in the shadows
while others long to steal the spotlight
now i sing this song of love for you
lighting up behind the barn and not knowing why
he's never gonna be the same
and he'll be living in a different world
take a leap of faith this time
is are you always gonna want me in your lifetell me what you're feelin deep in your heart
you do or you dont you do or you dont
not we go but this goes and not cause not anything
a wrath of misery
dont take it away
they live for him and what he believes
day by day a day of reckoning
what we feel inside
i'd deliver us from this hell
long live the dreams
of suffering
will they ever be saved
from agony agony agony
from agony agony agony
cant you hear me breathing for you
cant you see me dying for you

death will not forsake them
death rolls in like the seasons change

why must i fall victim of hereditary spite
conceptual intempt
the chosen wait impatiently
the revolution holds on strong
killing everything in sight

lyrics ramirez peterson
a vast group locust attack 2
finding our way through hells hole
ya got to make it today
i cant talk to you
gripping you withfear
you feel like you never did before
you felt the flesh you realized
all that i have can not be taken
wake yourself just wake yourself
iam a prisoner of fate
in his evil place
or i'll burn you to that cross
desecrate your soul
i am the one
lyrics billy james
battered abusive
just to be loved
the next generation
my words they speak to you
how can this be
with conformity
filter out the truth
let it go
fatalistic figures hold your fate
they'll rip you off
dedicate the world to pay the cost
malpractice
your friends showed you the way
the minds at peace an concious
lies to you will truth shine through
crucify me sanctify menow
our hearts bleed with fearlies
you broke the rules before you know the game
i only see the one going down it's a nightmare
no escape from the things you put me through
lightning skies
a dead mans eyes
your life was sanity
lyrics souza peterson
to climb this wall
chorus
till i am back in my cell
and in the end we the people pay
at any price that it costs
there's nothing we can do but
come into my world and take a journey with me
totalitarians in a perilous nation
free on anger free of pain
can you hear can you read
i never was the one the one to say the things you say
preach
pay the burnt bridge toll so practice what you preach
violent burning sea
of borrowed time again
see what's become of your
chorus
before us
lyrics billy james peterson
my words cant describe
rhyme without reason is why children cry
and i feel
salvation we'll share
once he was the king of his world
always early and feeling so late
ride ride on through
and you know it's never the same
is life so bad without you
the clinch of the jaws
she will never change her ways
no giving in to repent
put an end to hypocrisy
i'm gonna keep on fighting
they called the murders minimal
freedom freedom falling
hate
blind to see
where the hatred still grows
endless cycless
a man before a boy
bodies lay to rest
solo james
the day's vanished in the night soon the children pray
the cry's answers wonder why why it's time to die
but you were way out of line
who made you anyway
your fears start showing
who's to say
will they respect you when
who made you god today
paralyzed depression
honor the code and defending the line
where my feelings are going when they wither away
i know we are free
just realise where you've gone
some so scared the children fled
i've always saidburn the bitch
some paid the price of thier crimes
the meeting for the haunting night
see their dreams come to life
bring back the terror in the night
the fortune and the fame
taken by reality
like was like a fantasy
the time is now
cities turn to battlefields
shadows cast loud and clear
for the past it's too late
nobody would listen to him
then what's in store
when the books were untold
cause the preacher tells visions he sees
silent insanity
your sanity
oooh what'cha gonna say
the ritual call to me
lyrics billy james
heads held low
chorus
preach their sermons of ignorance
is the hope for humanity
the meaning of life ends in agony
rise as we wait annihilate
premonitions of tragedy
cops they dress in black they bid their lives
he's just the president
the wars that we must fight
over crowded cause we share the same veins
you will not be
always together as
from the father above
alwaystogether as one
red man proud and giving hell
full moons rising from the sky a warrior's riding
ride with the wind
the price you have to pay
a trial by fire
this is what the people say
a trial by fire
following bright stars
deep in thoughts
should i keep wandering on
from the dream i must seek
nothing can touch me now
nothing can stop me now
ash to ashes dust to dust
that i really want to go
is there more in life
can not live for the rest of my life
dnr do not resuscitate me dnr
no going back
1
here is where i'll stay
the others are slowly dying
to cross blood red
of ancient times mayfly names
dark words of power
dead civilzation
corrodes disbelief
any other way
purify his weakened heart
all i've got
when we're young
you cant hear what i say
as troubled as it seems
and always be
is this humanity's destruction
cryout will they see another day
no sign of hell
victims of tomorrow
the life that you have wasted
that i'll soon be there
heed these words i say
the time has come
change of seasons
testamentpeterson
ending life
envy life
shouting out their names in vain envy life
envy life
there's no random at all
there is no forever
shadows glow from the full moonlight
welcome down to the abyss
seems to intensify
face in the sky
shifting ice plates below
the process repeats
man will find the climate change
the process repeats
fall of siple doom
hope it is over soon
to the bitter end
silence the sorrow
are like stories from the past
prisoners of the venom master
is filled with the slither of snakes
psychotic spell a gift from hell
just my will to go on
now in the hour of death
put me down and kick me in my face
the sword so swift
waiting
blows from life
beating and bashing
deep in the pit and lying alone
is now your past
the world tomorrow
into the pit
he died on thorazine
made john doe take his own life
or you'll end up just like john
in evil and of sorrow
let reality slip away
man who i ami'm distorted lives
i side with innocence
i am a stronger man
they'll take away
their social tribes
to this idolization
they're bleeding so black
chorus
you must be comfortably dumb
forced to eat the lies
decay and blindness remain as the only truth
she gazes at the seashore below
in love with the spirit of death
wild winds so strong they blow
and rape my pride
you love everything you're shown
justify all your casualties
burn in the name of the elder faith
baths the horizon in a poisonous kiss
kneel before the blood on the stone
it shall come one night a darkness
in a neverending dance of death
water turns to blood
it is the sign of hades
chorus
i took to the skies
you know i cant stand the pain

to night they shall feast
yeah i want it bad
'cause i'm already gone
you can do it anytime
honey turn it on
gives me a heart attack
and you're one crazy mother
too much smack will bust your ass
living in the gutter rattlesnakes eyes
she said come closer i got something to tell
love is the devils toy
chorus
rise
feel the force you posses
dance in the dreams of the dying
some bad ass child taught me how to try
a new love sensation
new love sensation
when i cant stand the cost
got no reservations
tainted adrenalin drifts away
change change
save me from tomorrow
when i flipped to the last page
you're pushin me over the edge
i'll lick the honey from your thorns
someone always loves you
chorus
is what i need
some bitch told me that she was easy
give me love
give me love and power
chorus
i need i feel
state of love situation
i'm too young to be old
reeperbahn delight going down honey
i didnt believe that much no not anyway
because i've gone
it's only love
i feel uneasy
something i can live without
chorus
of my own intentions
i did it every way that you wanted me to
sin against the light
and try to understand
love is the law and the law is love
i never listen to reason
why should i feel
but i cant count that high
chorus
am i just too low to high
northern kings are sleeping
beneath the midnight skies
thou shalt see no tomorrow come
yet thorns shall grow
the so life giving daylight went
to the gates of triumph
the enemy of christ
falls the proud valleys of the north
with diabolical summoning winds
the wolves howled at the moon
a sea that from now always
she gazes at the black horizon
she is the pleasure concived
i never wanted to be what you needed
who needs entertainment
i'm just scared of being right
realms by night with the crow i shall fly
unchain me from this cage of time and of space
bring me your love
uh la la la
uh la la la
i never wanted this to happen to me
you got my mind
uh la la la
bring me your love
uh la la la
uh la la la
uh la la la la
but you wrote me of anyway
this only gives me frustration
when i was young i didnt know what i wanted
their torches they light
dance in a circle
relentless i've seen the movie
united state of apathy
paying the price for the cost of living
get a little introspection in your life
take it way beyond belief
pre chorus
all wound up and nowhere to go
sometimes i feel like i've been branded
warwick james
if i bleed in buckets
talkin bout me degeneration
then i'll be alright
if i dropped my disguise
i dont believe in god but i do believe in love
wild wild and wonderful
sometimes i feel so alone
wild wild and wonderful
whose side are you on
warwick

i've been thinking about you
you've gone wild
hold on and you will see

gorgo
how long will the rain
i've loved many and trusted few
and there'll be
chorus

crying in her mind's eye
you want it etc
to a god unknown
buying a brief burst of heaven
who sin too deep
pained by beliefs
but i dont
i got masturbation and cable tv
trained to drain
like a serpent but got no where to slide
play with fire and you'll get burned
look in the mirror and you wont see no one
yeah you're some kind of angel
lay down the law
lay down the law
take you down in the city
breaking the back of love
burning in my veins
but they're sinking too slow in this
sad eyes staring out the window
a little lost sometimes
what is this feeling rising over me
'cause i dont know the day
from no mean city down to bullshit town
i'm halfway to hell and still alive
god it's too late to save me
beat up chevys kickin
i wont believe no gospel train
and no holy roller
dont need no preacher jiving on me
so come on join the resurrection
a world of difference is just the same
i hung my hang ups on a meathook
looking for a way out

van allen belt surrounds it
some hills are never seen
up to the heavens above
our thoughts are traveling faster
twenty five pounds of pure cane sugar
ninety nine pounds of soul oh oh

ninety nine pounds of soul
tried to stay away form this year's
come be my conspiracy
well what you think about that
in another night
it's not out of spite
i need a helping hand
here with me
let's start this misery
but deeper still are my convictions
the more that it shows
not alone
touch
and give me some cause to rejoice
and dont pretend this is not an ending
chorus
in an age of illusion
bring on thou words cannot describe
i'm positively spring time

a little sugar for your mind
be thankful of the laughter
and we can all sing along
feelin even worse than it seems
living like this is no better than dying
could i ever have been so blind
could i ever have been so blind
rain on myself
just like a diamond cursed
and show you victory
drop down mama just dream of me
well you know by night i'm gonna shake 'em down
i guess the bloodstains on the blanket dont lie
i raise my glass up to you

curses and clues
poisonous and deadly
i love the sunshine that you bring
baby tell me why
and the girls start stalling
the blood means nothin but
sorry no clue
dont wake me
i got a 44 and a lead of temptation
let my words take your hand
to be right by my side
thru an evil eye
your cold heart wont let you cry
she sat silent at the table
only the sun and the changing tide
the gratuity included you know
i'll take you to school
but when you're down
dont want to see no more
march me down to the seven seas
is that enough for me could be
he left his needle outside in the rain
very dull knife
repeat 1st verse
politicians rise and fall
and you show me things that arent easily said
dont want you round my backdoor
i'm gone and you cant catch me
how to roll the log tonight
and i dont beg i pay i dont barter
some like their water shallow
burned my eyes
chorus
youre dressed in black
before i turn to rust
there's no turning back
it gets cold outside
there's no turning back
oh josephine

the second i kissed you

and leave me so heavy
i should rest baby when i can
but you can hear the sunrise crying
a song for you alone
and you cant find love on locust street
no matter what i want to believe

chorus

if you go down in the streets today baby you better
make my honey
wind your watch and bless all my prayers
that you have given me
lay me down
you got my soul singing my soul singing
wrapped up in my disease
dont you want to stare it cold

well regardless of the truth
look at what money can buy

when all i want from you is to sting me
well regardless of the truth

when all i want from you is to sting me
out there breeze is finally blowing
this thing lightin got your thunder want to crack'n
on the wings of maybe down in birds of prey
taste your love along the way see your feathers preen
that i've been reading
no not me
said the clown to the fool
spill your deepest memory
for the taking
had my wallet same old pocket
i've broken my heart
there's gold in them hills
let it loose now let it go to the wind
wake me when the day breaks
you spill your secrets on me
lover cover me with a good dream
tell ya baby they they out to know
time alone oh time will tell
think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
run come crucify the dread
bloodshot eyes are gone
a broken little memory
and a puzzle in front of me
so that her light will shine
i'll think of you
that's all that i wanted to say
all there really is
tomorrow we'll be happy
straight into the sun
feel the weight of his chains
put forever in your mind
eyes full of sun hands full of sea
did it make you stop and think
welcome to the big time baby
it should come as no surprise
chorus
whoa mule whoa mule we'll both get there someday
my own true love is a raven haired girl
full of dangers unrelenting
you've been learnin baby i bean learnin
chorus
ask me why another read song
three thousand more in two days
i aint got no lovin
trying to squeeze a little blood out a rusty nail
and all you got left is your skin and your teeth
i know one thing for certain
i said you shook me baby you shook me all night long x2
big or tall it's gonna hit you all
some just jive
chorus
made up my mind to break you this time
but it's coming back home to you
when it was
when there's nothing left that you can do
keep in stride
everybody wants to be free
it's all right sisters
it's all right brother
keep your head on tight
starting to know me
you can lead a horse to water
you can lead a horse to water
someone i would call now
long gone before daylight
and a night full of no fears
eyes burning on the quicksand
yes i've found myself a strong horse
in grace
and on a night like this
nothing could be worse
love you're news to me
true love is cruel love
when love makes you wake up soar
sweet love tasty blood
why you hold me with your violence baby come hit me
sweet as the summer
down from the rooftops
poor donee
and i was in it when your faith was dead
but will i be clean
has gone away
my i never thought of seeing you here
is blah blah blah blah blah
bright lights from giantwheels
i would like to take you
you dont want no joy for a while
cause she will not bother at all
and her lovely celia inside
it feels like we've never
made it together since
the baker in town was murdered one day
the gruesome killing of the bakerman
la lalala lala lalalala
i'd paint the grey sky blue
but i want you to know
some of them got closer then others
i disconnect
that's all i get
i'm talking and talking
i shiver and i scrape at your door
no my blood dont flow anymore
your back's not straight like before
could we
one uneasy morning
music svensson
i put the tv on
one day i'll be older
this puppet's lonely without you
i wanna do it right this time yeah
cause i do my dance in the round
or if he moves will he fall
for iron man to spread fear
heavy boots of lead
i know that i've done you wrong
that's what friends are for
as everything's behind me
but it wants someone back
i traveled east and i traveled west
oh you oh you it's got to be you
he makes the darkness seem bright
i'm just trying to learn
if you live you will learn
and lost what i earned
and i dont know what i've learned
music svensson
i'm just like youclose your eyes
losers are your weakness
i didnt see it coming
bad bad blood on your hands
my mistake
oh oh oh no
a man that surely deserves me
just say that you need me
reason will not lead to solution
pretend that you love me
say that you love me
the gap i have in mind
but i dont need this
your life style to me seemed so tragic
mr crowley it's symbolic of course
you rip me up you spread me all around
another you so i could love you more
you're losing your mind again
of my sleepy head
you nasty sunny beam
you nasty sunny beam
you nasty sunny beam
there' no escape
that's what i call life
how we invented the fear
because the blowing is dry
someone to be in
you can not hide
you'll lose it all
he's not only my dad
lies under the table
well maybe we have lost our way
sickly running from
you should know that love will never die
give me believe that my time will come
so if it's true that love will never die
to live
i'm just wistling on a song
i'm just wistling on a song
see the world unshown
the execution of your mind
you want to see them burn
not anyone i know
seems hard to understand
with no one here to sing for
but i wont show i'm still poor
symptoms are so deep
and i breed to be a better kind
new beginning again
so i'm leavin everything behind
do what you want to do what you want to
the heart of mine
cause no one has replaced it
ready for a new town
he loves sundays
driving all the old men crazy
the boys are back in town
words sveningsson
tomorrowsomeone's thinking of the her
dont leave
please i'm almost done
come on come on come on
come on fight me come on
music svensson
i know the score
i can hear your cannons call
'cause you're the storm that i've been needing
'cause you're the storm that i've been needing
no not now
now that you left me
i'll be gone
i just dont think so
do you believe
while you get me wrong
to the wilderness
i'm gonna work
hey what did you hear me say
i've changed my mind
we'll pay them double
what's good you hurt it
with your talk of four leaf clovers
so heavy and stained
could be feathers and down
nearby a park bench in the sun
why wont you wrap your life around
keep holding me down
hey please baby come back
'till i said i love you
i heard about a great big swindle
i'm one of a few survivors
and we wait
it's quite a slow disaster
said my dress was very cute
people having fun
music svensson
it's high but such a bitter view
the filters that i use
i hang around
wordspersson sveningsson koyana
all because of youand now i've found a partner
the dinner we'll be eating
dont use that bat
vacant and free
listen baby
hey get out of my way
i shake loose of your laces
i sure need a good companion
come take me high above our time
oh take us higher
all will wait for us
been turning on that very point
the pain inside
so i figured out
what he does bothers
you say dont worry
me and friends in daddy's car
pack our things and go away
crashed down in amsterdam
well it's been a long slow collision
break your heart
for the good times
good times bad times
it comes in waves
it comes in waves
no way of knowing if i care or not
no way of knowing if i care or not
i'm alone
and now it's always good
that's the truth
check it yo
in thirty form
when i stop breathing
caught in the vortex
behold we are coming back
i'm tellin ya i can not wait for this band to come on because i've got a few
i'm tellin yai cant wait for this band to come oni'm gonna feel that
this out
you know
sun so bright that i'm nearly blind
feel the warmth of the sun in the room
i'm yours you're mine
i retreat into self pity it's so easy
the sadness will never go
how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter
let me in mate
break up home there's nothing bound and left
break up home there's nothing on the knife
kick that mother fucker
so we rollin with the chemicals and we got the new sound
you know me rollin with my click the one inch punch
unrehearsed let the bubbles burst
the rivers run and deep right through my thought
and raise the population of this town
all the time i should be there with you
out of control
out of control
like a setting sun
where do i begin
knew you'd be here tonight
spun me 180 degrees
dont wanna rush it
come on and dance with me
come on and dance with me
your soul dont burn
you got
swastika eyes
you got
is this sweet and pure and true
i'm dreaming this and i'm dreaming there
like i'm hearing you

you know i almost lost my mind
lend me your hand
like i'm hearing you
repeat
voodoo people
where do i start
a treasure to your heart
all of a sudden i start to remember
a fire burns
but the map leads her astray
dancing cool and blind
something outside you is always to blame
at least it's good to be out of the wind
and it stacks up badly that it never makes sense
instrumental
you walk around just like circus baby is it true
you know you shouldnt really bother baby i'm here too
now their warmth is forgotten and gone
i never dreamed we'd meet here once more
i start the car for ten mile beach
i start the car for violet town
how are you getting home she laughed
anaesthesia's numbing
so many things need fixing everywhere
i dont know how
on the ground in the air
stretching out to catch the slender message
the civilized gentleman is gonna be nice
she reaches for him in a jealous moment x3
i saw him looking down the
time meanders discord and music of the birds
on my verandah almost seven years
she she needs her time and space
wants another
you're just an antenna you're just a wire
she say that's the way that's the fate i am resigned to
i wish somebody would tell me the score
they kill their enemies by loving them to death
they let me go on one condition
but priest aura
the end always the start
it's just not my day
bedroom mirror wall
the energy is low
the curtain comes down and the circus leaves town
some tangle of life limbs
the moon was being trailed
it's the last night of the war
bought and sold
there's such a big demand for blood money
it's flowing under the land like blood money
six lonely lifetimes since i've seen her
her block of ice heart tunes out the noise
i woke up this morning
i was late this morning
there was nothing left to think about
look at that business woman
she'll never understand
maybe you'll find her maybe you wont
i wasnt expecting this
none of this is what i wanted
the consequences now apparent
dont replace and dont upset me
sinking slowly in the sand
if i only wasnt steel
with two angry eyes and one sharp black horn
on this very day a hundred years before
oh columbus i never should have let you go
it's going to come somehow
the man had something strange about him
how can i describe what i'm receiving
it's such a waste of time
it's such a waste of time
me and the puzzled travelers
we swarmed like carrion birds
cut in two that's the kind of ship i'm running
separation no one looking in through my intrigue
cut in two that's the kind of life i'm having
separation he's circling waiting to make his move dead face
separation i'm just gonna have to hate you
you ever been in a desperate way
i get involved with a prisoner
and i know you're falling behind
but then the dealers deal in the darkness
where the desolate places meet the oases
in gardens in the orient
and days will glow in distant time
an infant with the voice of a crone
software sings and hardware hears
hold me closer ladyboy if you look you can see that it's just you and me
guitar pow zing
laughing at you anyway
first thing you know is you dont know a thing
make sure your will is good and hard
streets of burnt out shells insurance jobs
i dont owe you anything
a symphony of frequencies delivering
overcomes too much
earth mother earth hurt sweet mother earth
now i'm out of touch
if you need to cheat
it's my craft
i dont know when but i wish i knew where
and its teeth are glistening
look at the map add up the cost
never any bother considering the regret
christ i must have been a sight
next stop is louisiana
empty birdcage in her room
on second street
i drove alone
it was clear that she was loveblind
it was clear that she was loveblind
we've been sent to sing a lullabywe've brought oils gold and wine and bread
when the night came down
smile for the many you shocked
that i have ever seen
i will be over the moon
away from this earth
white
many dark nights and scramble for attention
universe of distant stars chilling in its failings
all the eyes are staring down and glitter like small children
marty's evil chuckle
ancient craft that waltz the maze of metal shells beneath me
translated from swedish by thomas norin
her father's smart plays his part
but i go on living in it till you say yes
walks in expecting him finds something more
you close your eyes the moon starts to rise
and all the things they told you
and when you broke they scrambled for a piece
and it's only a day away
as if you would tell me so
i've never ever been here
burning you turning you
beyond the city and evening dust
because there's far too many
when the news sinks in holding on to our skin
you must have heard about my little problem
factory billboards on outskirts of city
i hear a mandolin in the springs
your big ideas and your little wonder
you will be far away
new christ beneath the drumkit moon
we need more wine and gold
oh lord i trust your intentions
uncurling human tragedy apparently a parody
she's broken down it's raining i said i'd have a look
you better break it up
no certainty attached
city in the country from the clouds
we're gonna drop right out the sky
here's a number you can try to ring
faith faith breathe
ok stop stop spoken
how near
all my memories all my feelings
but next day when you wake
but it'll take something better than this creature you left
i want to take it back take it to the bottom
take it back take it anywhere i go
will come in to take your place
i embraced a machine i went through the routine
i was hired and fired yet never inspired
i gave money to ghosts i insulted my hosts
terra nova cain i need you again
terra nova cain i need you again
terra nova cain i need you again
i met a bunch of fools in oklahoma
i'm hell bent for the here and everafter
mother send no flowers for my passing
upon elephants so well i do remember
creation transubstantiation
screaming to be free
but the top half of his body is a corpse
then doesnt wait for your reply
he can turn wine into water
and says the magic words
and some of it's done with mirrors
bet you they are his plants
acting fine drink the wine
rats danced on the persian rug
oh baby did you look so nice
well i'm waiting for you in the square
just turn the light off when you go he hates the dark
he takes your arm and then he eats you up yeah
am i s'pposed to be a clown or a buccanneer
dawns early light
still you looked to fold in two behind the shade
ripple up in flames
still 'til all the little details are exposed
a strange turbulence fills the air
down comes the rain
lightning and thunder cause the walls to shake
they only make me feel like dying
that their hands dont make me hang
skipping 'cross the water wading through the sand
it's like the fog you walk towards but never seem to reach
green shadows greet another day
they say hey everything will work out fine
my disenchanted friend
and this hotels a zoo
you might be underground but you're overinsured
but barbarians came and set fire to their home
they must have known it was the end
some days you cry
holiday for two
oooh dont move
the miracles americans come falling the miracles come crawling
he only wants to make them all his own
washed into a sentimental gloom
years it's lost and then it's
leave you feeling more in the pink
she holds me by the stars says look at these scars
the of land drags the life from their glands
the shadows contain no more cool
fills my head with light
even when they're closed
as i stand before the relics
when you touch my skin the feeling is electric
i'll prove her existence in everything
your war dance i guess got this place in this mess
who's there to say that we're living this moment
something out the corner of my eye
and timing is off things get jumbled up
distant alone beneath the platinum stars
time is past in the field of mars
and they tell me i'm inside
at home they think we must be fools
focused through my hand
take your time make your way
you have love and sweet devotion
lonely in his capsule with all of heaven calling
our documents are useless or forged beyond believing
i tell you it's the only way we'll get this road completed
and leaves you slumped against the night
a torn head
fly home
that certain ideas
but you know i never wanted to
dreamtongued man from the golden land
on a silent and sensual day
you got a face like raphael
this is it oh
this it it oh
what was waiting there he never could have known
dream up a scam and then rake in the clams liquidity
to a wolf from a lamb for just half a gram liquidity
nothing nothing coming through
clock provides the time
litter under camouflage
it's just that i'm not quite sure
by the virtue of faith
everywhere anywhere is nowhere when you dont care
and you stand there with ashes blowing past
and men and gods begin their dance for their time has begun
the more that you want it the more that you need it
i've got a nickname for you i call you weakness
as a message from the future
when the wind will refuse to die
one big man with a good connection
and you want to bite the hand
how i loved your diamond eyes
i wish i had helped her more than i did
and everybody just walk away
you cant be a lover if you want to keep on using
night feels just like day
i guess you can count me in
tiny baby so naive
i brand your acolytes as a pack of liars
you're so fifty light years ahead of your time
this is hardly paradise
take a letter ophelia write
march together slay like nero
i dont wanna be that superhero
they've found another martyr rather it was him than me
i said i'm never never coming back again
red hot spaceships with soil so rich
so red squares and wavy leaves
only two people
junction fever must have closed down the rail
must be empty inside the shadow cabinet
it's hardly used i think
that the sun never comes
random choices will they ever learn
but they never can be caught
i hoped you'd realized
gotta get in deep
chorus
carries you aloft and you're getting soft
i heard about maria she hated the rat race
under shifting dimensions horizon returns
following the nebula
here for now here for now
man carrying a brow
the echo of another time an age of beauty
imagine the feeling before that last jump
travel by thought
travel by thought
i was working in an orchard that grew the strangest fruit
a hotel suite in a rich mans town a hut in botany bay
what else did you give to me
right speaker
wrapped in the arms of the night
just beyond the door
trinkets sing on a desert wind behind here
they say it's static electricity but
but out of the twisted metal of discarded fortune's curse
i think about the loveless fascination
something that's shimmering and white
i dont want to know
borrowed grapes from stores of gold
and easy to burn
i hope it's a message from someone obscure
it's just a joke
and we both know why you're here
deep in a room which i've never seen
you with another so easily sleep
who's the one with the vulture's shoulder
who's the one with the modified cortex
howling growling they want your blood
the callous future with a nervousness soon
you got off light
but you're just too civilized to fight
i must have put the horse before the cart
you took the rest of the day
it's a shame it's not a game
you turned up backstage at the palace
at least it's artistic i guess
i'm gonna stitch you up when you come unsewn
and they fly she pointed up into the sky
i forget my role as i stare into your soul
collect our coats a window gloats
when she used to know him
priests with hair and eyes so clear
you better take an arrow you better take a sled
you gotta freeze until it burns
you're gonna burn until you learn
all those pretty pretty months were so deceiving
here in an instant could be next week eyes cannot see
irrigated deserts built giant golden thrones
won battles without hope and saw men turned into gods
walking down the street i'm walking down the street
you're so easy to adore
you're so easy to love
so beautiful to see
wonderful as well
you're so easy to admire
the way that you love
long distance century buzzes and fades
the glittering minutes jangled decades
long distance century buzzes and fades
as it goes down inside
she says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky
a silver lamp lit sign
i'm gonna spring your trap
closing in that snow and musk
it's never as good as i hoped
oceanic lights are cleverly dim
deluxe locations just near completion
nothing left to stoke that fire
all you own is on the floor
the first of these daughters appears in the vacuum the void that's created an absence of light
when north meets the south when right meets the left when parallel lines begin to converge
seeing things just rest a while
take this gift and let it grow
red on pink the sun will sink have you even heard
put your head into my hands trying to be brave
drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
so the fire is almost out and there's nothing left to burn
but the fire is almost out is almost out
i used to feed the fire
and the fire is almost out
come closer and see
into the trees
again and again and again and again
oh elise it doesnt matter what you do
there're worlds to part
wide eyed in front of you
and the make believe ran out
any more than this
if it's the last thing we ever do
for always and ever is always for you
and the smile and the shake of your head
just a falling bird
an atmosphere that rots with time
bites my hand
an echo
as he plays on his knees
sudden hush across the water
and the sky
can i cry like this
accuracy
accuracy
in the caves
tonight i'm going wild
and all i want is to be with you again
no this is not about running out on you
yeah i know i should care if you come with me
i want this to be the end i dont want to start again
it's already been and gone
i held you
one endless moment
i kissed you
i never let you go
i stare at the window
he waits to hear her say
he waits to hear her say
he waits for her to understand
how did we get this far apart
the hours go by
i sense the quiet despair
go red and blue and black and white
theorise and talk yourself
oh kill me kiss me once
we just dont know how
and it's not love
they're not regrets for me
you know we've reached the end
but there are long long nights when i lay awake
in a sea of gold down next to you
but summer sun sea of gold
we were so in love
we have to keep this night alive
that can make me cry
like a polar bear
she sends me everything
so fill my head
this wave never breaks you said
never die
the time always comes to say goodbye
how to think
always fade
i try and
and now there's nothing i can do
but i know that it's no use
keep on laughing
she used to just stand there and stare
and i remember
and i used to sometimes try to catch her
just try to see in the dark
that my head on the door was a dream
that my head on the door
some kind of trigger happy intercourse
i couldnt help but notice your icy blue eyes
sharing it with me in club america tonight
you're such a wonderful person living a fabulous life
curled like an embryo
a monument to the ruined age
as cold as silence
it's perfect
wondered if it ever would
never guessed it got this good
wondered if it ever would
she is trying to be the one for me
i never read the stars
i am trying to be the one for her
she will never be the one for me
after all these years
one that makes him numb
with nothing left to say
forget everyone
eyes so white and legs so long
you're just an object in my eyes
lick your lips
you're just an object object
a prayer for something better
stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
pushing her white face into the mirror
the soldiers close in under a yellow moon
over and over
a hundred years
take me
take me in your arms
and i promise in less than an hour we will honestly go
and i breathe in too deep
ans i'm staring like a child
like an animal in pain
and my head's all the wrong size
why i'm keeping this going
i just keep moving my feet
and all the words that i know
distant noises
i really have to see you
and all the other voices sing
where we belong
but real lives are the reason why
and i know we have to go
one last time before the end
held close in your fear remembering you
how you used to be slow drowned you were
the words to be true but always just breaking
always away
i cant climb out the way i fell in
and it's all so safe
piggy in the mirror
a second
oh it's a plastic passion
it's a plastic passion
it's not a case of share and share alike
and wait
in the play for today
echoes round the sweating bed
one more day like today and i'll kill you
hopelessness and prayers for rain i suffocate i
the innocence of sleeping children
the less we show
dont change
innocent forever
he gets inside to stare at her
exactly the same clean bed
one by one her senses die
the water bows
it couldnt be a story
breathing like the drowning man
how proud she was
me
stay if you want to
i want you to fly not stop and start
me i dont say much
and sleeping less every night
like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
please do it right
too many lies
i will never be clean again
in the quiet ground
lie lifeless
dancing at the funeral party
gives my hands the shapes of angels
cover my face as the animals cry
fall fall fall fall
i kneel and wait in silence
and feel my heart pushed in
i cannot hold what you devour
get your fucking voice
dead
never felt so cold
i never even tried
they pass away the day
stares down at the ground
it's the loudest sound i ever heard
and wider and brighter
we're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
is the only way to land
you're such a strange girl
you're such a
how time will heal
make me forget
believed in you
you promised me another life
another day
water as you is hard the shallow drowned lose
it's lower now and slower now the strangest
and i'm kissing you hard
and i've forgotten how to speak
i dont care
every day i lie here
i close my eyes
i dont think i can know
alone
and then fell over again
before i feed the stench of a love for a younger
stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
and round and it's coming apart again over and
heaven than ever feel whole again
how the end always is
but it's much to late you say
there's loads of other stuff can make you yell
well it just goes to show
oh just burn down the house
and everything that makes you cry
how wrong you can be
burn down the street
i clench my hands
and rip at skin
drained of everything but pain
the movement is sharp and clear and pure
it never seems too late
oh this night will never let me go
lose another blind game
your voice is dead
lost forever in a happy crowd
bit because i feel it all fading and paling and i'm
time down on fascination street
the times it hurts just to breathe
or watch yourself burn again
fight fight fight
slowly fading blue
and through the dark
swollen lips whisper
fades away
burn like a
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
i dont care if monday's black
but friday never hesitate
to see you in the middle of the night
and i'll lie to keep her happy
put your hands in the sky
you and me alone
and looks down at my breaking face
drink it dry
slips her dress like a flag to the floor
head in pain
this room's so hot
i'm gasping for air
deaden my glassy mind
every night
but if you do that you'll be missing the world
on a day like today
yeah this is really it
you have to get up get out and get gone
no people
no people
everything's coming to a griding halt
hey you
when i see you sky as i kite
the way you shout out loud
my arms so tight
it makes me pull my hair all out
and i forget when to move when my mouth is this
the first time i saw lightening strike
it lit up the fish like rain
hey hey hey
i left that house on fire
you want to know why i hate you
outside a glittering building
how beautiful you are
and gazed so deep into your eyes
the child's eyes uttered joy
i dont know what's going on
with you with you
to me at all
a breaking heart
mouth so sweetly telling lies
when i'm with you
you dont feel anymore
smooth as
as empty
that butcher man was some
but i just cant get away
and nothing more
yeah but i really love it here
still wrapped inside your rubber as i wriggle at your feet
a tv refugee
prettily waving
i watch in fascination
the night
i called you after midnight
and both play dead then cry out loud
and stood outside your door
if only tonight we could slide
and the rain would cry
silence
just walk away
without you
why cant you see
dress to inflame
but i know
and you just laugh
it's not you
it's always the same
again and again and again
they're finally all the same
is this how a star falls
was that it was that the jupiter show
she just drifted away from me
spinning on that dizzy edge
lost and lonely
and found myself alone alone
i remember the time that you rained all night
remember the time that the sky went black
with a gun in my hand
killing an arab
i'm dead
the dead man on the beach
a nightmare of you
i have to see
a thousand voices whisper it true
oh tell me it's the same boy burning in the same bed
say it's the same you and it always and forever is
the time is out the day is dropped
it's not the same you
or it's me
two drowned fools
dance together expectant too puctual but
heart of december the blindness of happiness
prettier than ever i really beleived that this time
i'm shaking like milk
but i dont care if you dont
another girl
you cant even see now
let's go to bed
a part of shiny wet
and turning on his heel
i cant find myself
out of time letting go
in the heart of this stranger in love
and i'm not sure where i am
to the other under faded setting sun
so happy and so young
whenever i'm alone with you you make me feel
however far away i will always love you however
room and there is nothing i can do when i
turn on the light the spiderman is having you
all the directions were wrong
again tonight
but maybe someday
again
if i could do it again maybe just once more
we've got to show how much we love them all
it's strange the way we cant say no
or maybe it's the promise of belief
and keep changing your shape
jump right into your mouth
all night
and the light begins to fade
a measure of life
make up in the new blood
i captured it so perfectly
the same sharp pain
and dreamed of death
shake dog shake
you're like a slug on the girl
and i shiver and shake
we writhed under a red light
and into the room
i walked away and grew old
we all die
the secrets i hide
six different ways inside my heart
it's that american voice again
save 1 pound 52 on recommended retail price
a turntable
your heart wouldnt ache
when i told you what i
so please send me icing and decorating sets
all look the same
mammnnarghaassstmmetc
please try to understand i have to see you have to feel you
i laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase
can i use some of your lipstick
so alone into the cold new year without another word from her
you never know how anything will change
but she dare not turn around
i'll get it down for sure
yeah i'll break it out again
tonight i'm so alive
from square one start and bit a for it push
a buzz a buzz a buzzing like them killer bees
but it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
she's grinning singing spinning me round and round
waiting for the sun to shine
couldnt ask for more you said
and i love it
what can never come back
every mirage i see is a mirage of you
if any of this was really true at all
the day i stop
remember the first time i told you i love you
forever mine
just held your hands to your shining eyes
there is no if just and
one true love
how each of us believes
however unwise
walk across the garden
scared of what the morning brings
round and round
never comes
over my shoulder
those days would never end
impossible things
i'm in the room without a light
hanging like this
to try to move at all
it's torture
sick of it all
drowning like a fly in my drink
the ways you try and run me down
of selfishness and jealousy
remember i loved only you
than to remember me
you are the only one
to say to you never quite managed the words to
we suck him down with our first breath
i dont want you anywhere near me
blinded by fear and hate
get my fucking head out of your world
and on and on as the night drew in
i'm always wanting more
more lust more lies more head more love
i want the sky to fall in
i know deep down inside
into someone else's life
the night is always young
and the night is always young
i'm watching me scream
i'm watching me fall
i think you need me here with you
please go
i'll leave you it all
you stare at me all strange she said
the others die
but living on in others in memories and dreams
and others die
but living on in others in memories and dreams
where the birds always sing
make me hungry again
you make me
make me hungry for you
mud trench
heaven heaven

i can see
there's something warm

to be by myself

suicide standing sucking in her cheeks

and i know about the taste of pain
stoney cold and a twistin moon

nothing is gained when people fight
it's not a great plan but we like the agenda
i wish that i could fill the space
so many rely on her i'm one of them and i know it
she stops my rain she calms my storm
demons haunt inside of her 3x
pictures to prove it i've got the proof
i've got pictures to prove it i've got i've got
what we dont have anymore
i'm not just blowing smoke
there's no questions asked they just wanna kick my ass
crooked was the path
with just a smile wink or nod
a legendary character
well in the end they knew his name
nothing comes from nothing come on royal oil
stabs like dagger make you stagger
nothing comes from nothing come on royal oil
simmer down now i've got to got to simmer down
simmer down it's got to be this way
simmer down and we'll live alot longer so
and the name of the place escapes me
maybe i will i should write down a reminder
i cant wait to set things straight
sort it out
that's how we had it planned
said i'd see you around
what went wrong i dont know off hand
did i wait too long to write this song
sweet emo tion sweet emo tion
that bug bit me
since time began
i tried to fight
when i felt its tooth
i've really grown to like this place
no no no no no no no this cant be true
thank you sir can i have another
i like this beer and your friendly face
means so much to me
i'm glad the cave is where i live
but i know someone who has
you've got to rise above the rest
i've just never been tested
i've never had to knock on wood
i was here before they came i'll be here long after
i was here before they came i'll be here long after
ignorance it set your standards
you think you've seen it all
all wrapped up in that army crap
at the age of seventeen how was he to know
and he counts the days
left right left right left left right left right left
tin soldier what is he fighting for
just across from wayne's junk store
and sure our time was poorly spent
rico's here the party's reeling
still haunts me like it wants me
looking back now not sure how
at each other's throats all through the show
thank god here comes a station break
do i really wanna step in here
and over coffee we could chat
we are is at any rate
and that is where i'm at right now
original song by slapshot
try it and you like it and you know you can take it on
get yourself back up before its too late or a life of pain will be your fate
and i'm wondering where did you go
and i'm wondering where did you go
i lost control i screamed i cried
where'd you go where'd you go
so do something crazy for me again
and i was crazy at one time too
noise noise noise from down below
in the daytime what's he doin upstairs in the attic
they're tough things to obtain but dr d he did
no problem when i am saying it
but i'm sober and older and could've held on to my youth
i never watch what i am saying
i raise my beer and i swear god it's been fun
i know you heard know you heard know you heard
really dont by any shape or form
harmless fun no damage done
i guess i really dont know how to party
nah probably not
we're gonna stay that way
drunks and children they tell the truth
i get housed i get soused
i raise my beer and i swear
take my hand we're off to never never land
i cant cry without you
exit light enter night
357 magnum 9 millimeter handgun a k 47 and an uzi sub machine gun4x
take what i got see if i'm strapped they cant get to me
what the hell can one man do
moved to florida jeanie's town
he busted out in a cloud of smoke he just left like he came
five through the nose bold and daring
we question one accessory
you made the scene and set the mood
when he left he showed up at my door different than he was before
back back and we're glad he's back on track it's good to have him back he's back
when he came back he showed up at my door different than he was before
hypocrite taking shit leave me alone
and other dark remarks
we tried to teach you didnt learn
you made you're bed that's where you'll lie
never lose my wallet
and only time will tell
never lose my hope
i used to talk to cab drivers
i used to never cry
am i getting older
now now now i never thought that i would see the day
i used to never cry
threw out the useless and now it's bone dry
i feel alive in this dive so i'll drink to that
the place is packed i needed that
the place is packed i needed that the bottles cracked
a motorcycle cop was waiting he had to fill his ticket booth
someone needs you know no doubt
sunday morning not too far
i still reach for you
why we hurt each other again and again
i'd like to leave
and though i somehow know i cant explain
it was there in the words unspoken
breathe down your neck
i'm not asking a lot
so back off your rules
i'll say it again
yeah if i make it i'd be amazed
your heart breaks
and you'll be left behind
it's quite an excursion
those least qualified
but when i'm in my car
well they say the road's a dangerous place
i feel like i'm god
bet he wont say that any more
take my baby's body to the city dump
off with her head
come back with sixteen or more
but ask yourself first
my own words choke me
i know i've played this game before
but only coffins and bones remain
blackball your evil ways
and throw a molotov cocktail at your car
i'll dance around the pretty flames
i see the way the salesmen stare into the sun
saving yourself
you dont want to change the world
and since you aint what you say
the gangs stake their own campus locale
hey they dont pay no mind
your never ending spree of death and violence and hate
hey man you talkin back to me
it's more than you can stand
right beside your bed
out on your own
no one hears you fall
come out swinging
all are gone and none agreed
cause then i dont have to try and make
it's cool to hate
yeah i hate everything
i hate the trendies
and i hate the geeks
we had forever
through it all
my hopes and dreams my
through what comes to pass
while i stand here acting bold
now i dont see
like an eye that shows impending doom
time passes like the wind
in the dead of night
in this night of sacrifice
your misery in life
get on it wouldnt wanna be you
embrace the pain and see by taking it back you turn it around
me and my old lady
you know she dont give a shit
suck each other dry
if i escaped i could fill myself
i cant stay
left behind was me
i take a hit and zone out again
mota boy
but i guess it could be worse
mota
so live like there's no tomorrow
then you will know what nitro means
waiting for a warning
faster now you know i got no brakes
back and forth
once you said you'd stick to it until the end
i'm just trying to survive myself
but i aint no fucking savior
i'm not the one who made the world what it is today
still we grow and then the problems they become our own
we're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
i gotta let it out tonight
take more shit i've had enough
now excitement seems to grow
and you make your getaway
i believe it's my god given right
life life
time time
you're gonna
fire always makes it better
none of this is true
with that big gun in your little hand
as you sit here all alone
jester in the corner
for the evil in this world
pay the man
shut up you talk too much
but everything he lacks
he needs some cool tunes
friends say he's trying too hard
the world needs wannabe's
now i know i'm being used
when she's saying that i'm like a disease
now i know i should say no
our rendezvous never seem to end
for all i know it dont mean a thing
i think she wants me only
the things you say
as he walked around
you're out there makin bacon
you're gonna be bummed that you went that way
unless you can throw it away
cause i've been true
making it seem
how does it feel
and just be straight with us
sometimes i speak aloud to hear what people have to say
lean on me while i lean on you
through the rain i see you in the sun
through the pain i see things as they are
if it were up to you to decide
and for all i know
no way out
heavens so far away
and call out your name
i'm getting edgy all the time
there's demons in my head
if you reason dont you know
until you realized that there was no one there you knew
have you ever felt like there was more
sleep forever
so if you walk away
everybody stays
you wish you could be someone else
once you shoot it in
all the way down
or a playground if we choose
discussing who was gonna live to be 21
but now while you're here
so i keep on falling
to prove your friendship to me now
such shallow words for broken minds
dreams quickly turn to reality
cause i'll be waiting for that day to arrive
because i dont want to see anything anymore
when will the world listen to reason
egos will feed
you gotta make yourself see what you want to see
she was only six years old
guess you must have really sinned
and i wonder how many more
i get a feeling you're so vague
beat me all the way i'll take it all night
little men come when everything goes
who'd start all the wars
in a world without leaders
in a world without leaders
of democracy
from your own hands
and a lightning rod hammer step
you know i saw his woman
they're shooting anyone who even tries to run
martial law aint no solution
it's an excuse for power that's more like an alibi
i dont even judge
smash is the way you feel all alone
but none are together
dont be surrounded
something to believe in
where they lead
the better off you'll be
hey now well i'm knocking on your door
breathing you okay
well you'd be correct
though you hear me
heaven knows i've seen it all before
maybe no one's aware it goes on
so you'd best go along
make your heart beat faster
will you even wonder
its young men in the sand
all the memories are too few
and i'm left to carry on
that still lives on after life it takes
swallow so many lives
he just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

an angry man gets drunk and beats his kids
the same old way that shannon never had
and welfare moms have kids on welfare
we are free
it's a mentality that kills the best
i can draw a little picture
i'm not that kind of man
i think of all the times that i tried to lend a hand
but she wants more dinero just to stay at home
cause that girls got expensive taste
she tells me every day
if i could say
talking it out dont make it right
if you'd just stay
hitting me oh god

and i'm gonna pay

the fields of eden
between a rock and a hard place
and a hard place
and our rogue children
between a rock and a hard place
she comes and goes
at such a cost
still i'm gonna miss you
a swirling mass of gray and
and a parade of the gray suited grafters
lets drink to the salt of the earth
i'm a shattered
laughter joy and loneliness and sex and sex and sex and sex
i'm shattered

shadoobie my brains been battered
she comes in colors
speck of white so fair and pale
she shoots her colors all around
coming colors in the air
if you start me up

pleased to meet you
when the blitzkrieg raged
i shouted out

oh my my my i'm the lone crap shooter
the girl who once pushed me around
it's down to me yes it is
the way she talks when she's spoken to
under my thumb
say it's all
one hundred thousand disparus
make sure the pass laws are not broken
undercover
keep it undercover
done up in lace done up in rubber
undercover
i'm just waiting on a friend
i need someone to protect
wild horses couldnt drag me away
faith has been broken tears must be cried
at her feet was a footloose man
you cant always get what you want
my favorite flavor cherry red
i saw her today at the reception
you cant always get what you want
i was a falling 'till you put on the brakes
hey hey there aint no stopping me
hey hey there aint no stopping me
the next i was down there well left out of the ride and
high and dry oh what a way to go
honky tonk woman
she blew my nose and then she blew my mind
hot stuff
i cant get enough
'cause music is what i want
make you sing and make it tell the whole wide world
to everybody in jamaica that's working in the sun
you cant hold out you cant hold out
slow or fast slow or fast
fears will pierce your bones
i cant get no satisfaction i cant get no satisfaction
i cant get no i cant get no
when i'm ridin round the world and i'm doin this and i'm signin that
she made me cry she done me wrong
because i used to love her but it's all over now
it's not easy living on your own
to take his girl for granted if he can
and it's hard it's not easy
as she goes to sit on her own high chair
it's only rock 'n roll but i like it
i know it's only rock 'n roll but i like it like it yes i do
would ya think the boy's insane he's insane
oh well i like it i like it i like it
i know it's only rock'n roll but i like it like it yes i do
would ya think the boy's insane he's insane
oh well i like it i like it i like it
lying on the floor
he's been an outlaw all his life
at being thrown to the lions
before it rains anymore
she charged into the ranks
but it's all right now in fact it's a gas
i frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
jumping jack flash
let's spend the night together now
let's spend the night together
let's spend the night together
love is strong and you're so sweet
i need some time
you make me hard you make me weak
i want to kiss you
i've been waiting in the hall
aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
shuffling through the street
i guess i'm lying to myself
lord i miss you child
button your coat
adrift on this ocean
that's feeling lonesome
let's love it to death
that's feeling lonesome
she goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
what a drag it is getting old
life's just much too hard today
your heart is like a diamond you throw your pearls at swine
well love is love and not fade away
love to last more than one day
i'm glad i opened your eyes
have you seen your lover baby standing in the shadow
no colors anymore i want them to turn black
it's not easy facin up when your whole world is black
i wanna see it painted painted black
we were sure we'd never see an end to it all
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
to dust i guess
belle of the fawning
i'm without anyone at all
this gun is loaded devoted
'cause i want you bad ah
but babe dont worry
the dead things
if it's the last thing we ever do
for always and ever is always for you
and the smile and the shake of your head
resigned to scraping paint
if you want love you must be love
cause for the moment we are free we seek to bind our release
it comes with mine
it all goes wrong
she digs the wives in our babies
to disappear in her
annie goes if you couldnt guess
what's the matter
the lame and the droll have needs
to let their feelings show
what if the stars would hesitate
what if what is isnt true
what if the clocks would hesitate
what are you gonna do
does that mean you've got to lose
does that mean you've got to lose
does that mean you've got to lose
and a child to my heart
we must never be apart
in you i feel so hungry
'cause you're the one that i adore
and i cant help but feel attached
we'll let the world spin on to another place
i'll be under the stairs forever
all of my senses ashamed
because you are
because you are
i let the travel begin
where the willows weep
become a mystery to gaze into
and whirlpools sleep you'll find me
in your head a thousand stars
and i could take you a million miles away
i want to believe in you and i heard you
may godspeed be with you
never meant to hurt anyone
that you had left behind
never meant to say anything
i wish i was blank
i wish i was blank
love is my song
the dreams we saved
there's clouds in my shower
but heart's untouched by heart's unloved
bleeding the orchid
and when i wake inside you
hope to meet you there
the rays are gone
dont say i hadnt told you so
and i cant escape the fact that i still bleed
i had my self
unleash the armageddon
descend the darkened stairways
as i awake the city sigh
for nothing in return
miss you since they found you out
of the sights you have been shown
love is suicide
nobodys
to bring the light
bring the light to me
light
a flower song clear and bright
dont let them steal you from what's yours by right
light
bring the light
then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
bury me in love
some things you just cant hide
she will bury me
dead eyes are you just like me
it better be by june
'cause i'm waiting on this moon
gotta get it while you can
she hold her hands behind her back
ya we're coming to your town

'cause i can tell you once were pretty

of my secret power

and love her when your love goes unrequited
with longing and grace god given
just rotten apples to eat
to discover that magnificent ghost
i'm just pushing the paint around
now you know
i swear to god dont leave me here
love is ours
creatures i have stopped
saturnine
you are waiting on the side
so that you'll never find
come to me let me hold you still
i'll never let you go no no
and i need you
you're gonna walk alone
you're gonna walk alone
from my siamese dream
well it's silent to the dream
and i've failed your summer ways
and i feel no pain
and you lie to yourself
i hear what you want
shot full of diamonds
if by chance
siamese twins
to my disease of my needs
she gave it all away
my mind has wings
to the center of the earth
i want to live
and all the spiders wonder what we've got us in
of a vintl storm
i have seen everything
i'm glass
in a blood stained jar
i betrayed rock 'n roll
glass glass glass
staying after school
for anyone who's ever lost
he cant be wounded
ooh i believe in one love
jesus
jesus i ran away
what would you feel
to save my soul
heavy metal machine
is it just as well
let me go
a heavy metal machine
heavy metal machine
who is sorry now
i dont wanna be like the others please
my love is oh so strong
who is sorry now
the endless drags of a death rock boy
a secret star that cannot shine over to you
and if you're giving in then you're giving up
his guests bleed sick
through the hole in the wall
feed in the words
no boy could spell you out
so we can know you and that you're alive
through the hole in the wall
honeyspider
the ways of sin
when you decide
but what am i supposed to do about you
i aint free
i'm down
see you dont you just want to
what you want is what you'll get
gimme nothin
billy spits
i am one as you are three
try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
see you i am one
radio
cause i'm home to die on my own
i'm alone
plays my favourite song
to wait for ghost night
if there is a god
are you one of us
are you one of us
and then the young die
june's outcast
i was alive
in my body
i need you tonite
i need you tonite
innocence
any way
any way that you want
ooh hoo jackie blue
ask a winner and you'll probably find
ooh hoo jackie blue
nowhere we're nowhere we're nowhere to see
to make yourself feel better
and although my secret's gone i'll try to carry on
amongst the tall trees
i lay my head on her bosom
you cant even stop
cool as ice cream
can i sail through the changing ocean tides
even children get older
set the frame
while lonesome hearts just have no use around here
i wouldnt change a thing
so far so far so far
you're the other half of me
dusty screams through doors and imaginary floors
let them cry out through your rusted scars
let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you
let them cry out through your rusted scars
bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
so fuck it all cause i dont care
to places i dont know to care
we are the real
anything believed
we are the ruin
as real as any ghost
i dont want to be alone at all
i saw you there
do you know the things that i can do
heaven seemed insane
do you know the things that i cant lose
well oh baby my hair's on end about you
the star above you crystal blue
'cause i'm alive
they'll say you'll lose your nerve soon
on my belief in you
i really dont wanna look stupid when i'm sleeping
as he walks across this earth
and all i gave to you is lost
wishing i could make believe
spy the fragile heart so cursed
up to meet you in the sky
always knew i couldnt save
have the people changed
and i am a master of a nothing place
no one can separate us
i hold secrets flame
the joy of love
for all our faults we carry on
i'm in love again
i'll be there and i
and my heart is a spring
i'm in love again
and bleed my soul to you
there's really no excuse
from ethers tragic i am born again
does it make you happy you're so sane
and i am practicing
the zeppelins rain upon us
you know i'm not dead
you always find your way
begin to tear us out
you know i'm not dead
i'm just living for myself
you dont know what to do
but even if you've gone too far
everywhere you are
by yourself
it's in the thought of you
but ever should you put it down
in this place where the angels sleep
could you find away across me
lord above
you're all a part of me now
and i will prove
will our time ever be enough
you're all a part of me now
so i pull my collar up and face the cold on my own
wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
freak out
who wants that honey
who wants that honey
who wants honey
i wont deny the pain
and should i fall from grace here with you
lily my one and only
will she or wont she want him
oh lily i know you love me
only you
and i feel no pain
and i feel no pain
lie
this take dont give a fuck
all the sad faces drown
it's up to you uou know
dispatch the last alarms
crashing down again
crashing down
with no return
crashing down
it's beautiful and secretly the gifts still hide
there'll be toys for everyone
i'm a clone i know i'm fine
no more problems on the way
six is having problems
i'm all alone so are we all
i'm all alone so are we all
crushing up the stars above us
c'mon let's go
i wanna love
tears were once my only way back home
is for another chance
who am i to need you now
you were never meant to belong to me
all that matters is love love your love
cupid hath pulled back his sweetheart's bow
your world be shattered with nary a note
should have took that last bus home
it's three o'clock in the morning i'm on the streets again
with the sugar sickness
you love him for yourself
you love him and no one no one else
you love him and no one no one else
just like a snake
the love i share true selfish to the heart
your feelings
something could change
i guess it doesnt matter anyway
i know i'll leave when it's my time to go
and cut you like you want me to
i send this smile over to you
what's a boy supposed to do
disarm you with a smile
my love
and what i choose is my voice
send this smile over to you
their jackals lick their paws
it takes an unknown truth to get out
if this is living
ah it's lonely at the top
i dont want to live on charity
dream dream filling up an idle hour
you say i'm empty
you say i'm tragic
anyone want to be you
anyone want to be you
you've lost control
can anybody anybody be true
love you
coming around
yesterday the sky was you
i stop i hesitate
i taste i love
it's not enough just a touch
it's unsung and i say
goodnight always to all that's pure that's in your heart
my soul is so alive
that when they build their cross of death
lay down your arms to me
with god and night
if you have to go dont say goodbye
if you have to go dont say goodbye
say now listen here
since i gave up
the ones that love
frail and bedazzled from all the glare
bonjour
bonjour
and you're mistaken it's you that's faking
and you you make me so i need to disconnect
and i give it all back to you
that it's ok it's love
love it's who you know
as the prodigal son
you light up the sky
i am divine
i'll give to you
if you want me to
with you
now it's that time again to take revenge
was i good enough to break you
and run away with me tomorrow
while the harlots of my perils
that cursed you and your reasons
always old i'll always feel this
you're the gods forces
i would love you still
you're the emptiness of i
you're the ageless seasons
ooh
behind my dad's
i remain true to the name
the dream was a sham for saving what you cant and now
and the mouths of babes sing revolution
and great lovers will one day have to part
as all things must surely have to end
and i knew the echo that is love
day is ending
i turn to the right
we're happy in my blue heaven
losing in my choices made
anyone can see
my dahlia dear
and take you there
and i cant help myself if i dont know
and if you pretend
i know where he's taking me
as long as i remember who's wearing the trousers
see the stars they're shining bright
let's fill these hours and kill desire
headlights shoot north
i'm never lost
not worth reaching to anyone at all
i've gotta go so far away
that i'm the one to blame
lost your head now you sleep on the floor
things we said we dont need anymore
obscured
the shades will crawl
feel so alone
time has ravaged on my soul
fallin out of sleep
once upon a time in my life
it's a pity we're apart it's a shame you broke my heart
we are reasons so unreal
but now i wonder who i was
perfect
trust me instead
fill me with your little whispers
inside your head
i just want to have some
bring me down
oh wont you stay
dont we see
i'm torn broken and frayed
and in my mind
porcelina she waits for me there
you make it right
outside where i'm torn
outside where i'm torn
outside where i'm torn
yours alone
like never waited for me
the secrets of your dreams
and with this ring i play so dead
so speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
breathing underwater and living under glass
and with this ring i wed thee true
to the revelations of fresh faced youth
i forget about where it all began
before i even learned to talk
i knew my loss
the sky's cruel torch
with blushing brilliance alive
a summer storm graces all of me
you make me real
strong as i feel
strong as i feel
and i could bring you the light
i'll burn my eyes out
i'll tear my heart out
today is
that i have ever really known
of saving face
to cleanse these regrets
i want to turn you on
the more you change the less you feel
the place where you were born
believe in me as i believe in you tonight
we'll make things right we'll feel it all tonite
and she's sick of the same old s
and she's tired
pledged your faith
i will wait for you
do you ever wake far from home
for your tears i'm still singing
to this love alone
but i'm sure it's all accomplished
to this love alone
when can we laugh and take all the credit
tired eyes
a home
what will they do to me
revolution
so tonight
i wanna fight
let me prove something real like i should
anyone can hold a promise
many times
listen here
if you dont
around
around
i know your wish
of my peace
around
to feel love
while she's turning back
vanity stands naked at my door
you know you want it all so pure
vanity cries why
to fill the meetings
forget my names erase the page
as i walk your street
and once again you'll pretend to know me well my friends
we only come out at night the days are much too bright
my baby my sweet thing
on dead highways her black beauties roam
but it's not easy when you're alone
she says she wants to marry me
and your kisses chase
white spider
gotta get away
you've gotta strip your skin
wander slow
white spider
for i am painting
around my heart
shadows scream
start today
we're giving it up to the moon
winterlong
become my will
winterlong
we're giving it up to the moon
away
away
we are creating
by grand design
you cry unharmed
reveal this broken man
destroyed in the wake
if you love i will love
still i was lonely and she was by my side my one and only
cause i'm a sister and i'm a motherfuck
and this is how mary's garden grows and this is how mary has her ghosts
i'm in the face of your dreams of glass
intoxicated with the madness i'm in love with my sadness
she's my one and only
i just want to get there faster
tell me tell me what your after
and i dont know what it is
and i'm not sure what it is
the slow dawn away
even though you lied to me
so long my mother
all your seven dreams
sorry snail
flower save the hours
and she led me on down
so now i'm all by myself
i'm all by myself
and i'll betray myself
hush now dont you speak
one last kiss from meyeah
so let the sadness come again
dreams of hangers on dreams of getting well
and thru the sleeping streets night bound and heavy
every action taken every moment sealed
without purpose or will
soot in my hair
you know that she'll be there
dont confuse my only life
blew i love you
well i forgive you
though we want it
got to have it
i'm coming from
soul power
soul power
soul power
soul power
as i bleed
i dont care
and spaceboy they'll kill me
we wont be long
i am mercury liquid pure
i hate the sound of your shit because it means no good
god is hurt god is cold
we are in one hole
fractured divided shattered into a billion fragments
arcane echo
pretend you understand that
and ocean miles
speed thrills
the first time that i ever saw you
the last rose of summer
forever blind
you and me
you're all that i dream
for the both of us
for the first time
please take me home
i hear all you're failing
in my eyes i burn alive
we are stars
dead suns rule dead air
we are
so rise the lost toys
and nobody nowhere understands anything
so fake it
and no matter what they do
what takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are
all you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be
what it wants is four more years
lost i go into your hiding room
everybody seems to know when he's around
i think my journey's just begun
do you think he'll mind
that scarred and bruised and left me blind
who am i running from
nobody comes nobody calls
if you're looking for me
i'm alive with something inside of me
and i dont think i'm coming down
and if he sees it i know i'll know repeat
i have no control
acting as your slave i drink for barricades
i dont need them i'm there
if my skin looks tired and old from living
they press down on me
i hear the driving of the nail
sits there examining her thighs
repeat chorus
when i was a boy funny things
and she placed a hand between our lips
as far as you're concerned
no no i didnt i could i'm sure i would if i knew that
you know the one that takes you to the places
well i never pray
from one day to the next
where all the things meet yeah
no no no no no
ever been down
we could steal a car
we were just heading for the sun
there you were on the floor cut up
oh blue show me something new
blue dont forget the word i warned you
i have come to set the record straight
so close to force him begging please
knowing i'd regret this very day
butterfly
butterfly
butterfly
you get your kicks from seeing me on the floor
butterfly
in that dream of mine
in that dream of mine
in that dream of mine
you see through me
and waving we rode that parade for awhile
and ride the wave along the mitigated mile
i can see the tables turning
obligation
i watch their backs as they leave single file
through the haze that is my memory well
the ground's a little weathered where i stood
i'm nailing leaves to the ground
watching them sorting debris
we came back to the same place
i know it's there but i cant see it
and if i ever drive you mild and suffering this open kiss
ever drive you mild
no cop no stop cruising to the corner shop
but could you let me in cause i'm with the band
it's just a change in me
all the love i have is in my mind
i watch you look at me
more or less
oh my my
it's just a change in me
i can see a million faces in the condensation
are you coming back
now mumble that each breath i take
conceding lying cheating
you'll have to drag me everywhere you go
know me at all
so i
down into my obsession
i'm trying to be what you want me to be
and if i could be what you want me to be
i would leave you but to leave you wouldnt matter
is an ovation to her ego
in her everyone is everything and everything is mine
spill my last drink
in a neon wilderness
i'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
cause people dont take chances with their hearts
it doesnt matter how it ended or began
she never wanted to talk
but that's the way it goes
for a few hundred years
rescue's on the way
i will go anywhere she goes
for the ominous man
in between life and death
i've seen this road before down on this floor
forget the lovers you've know
i'm coming in on my own
under fiery skies
cant you hear this beauty in life
too afraid you'll like it too much
you've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend
i'd rather die than see you fly
dont bother to call
it's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind
it's only one
every word so intimidating
i curse the days i've wasted here
it's so absurd
i'm feeling very moses like
i'll tell you parables of making love
so children grab your m 16s
now go and tune your guitars
'cause springtime is for dancing
i was the penny to previous
a universe gravitate orchestrate i am fearless
and every minute i'm losing one by one
she'd often let me play with them i'd set 'em up in different scenes
and the dish his lovin spoon were never found
reverend girl
head upon a window pane
see you in the next one have a good time
eyes they open wide
spirit of '76 trombones lead
a black bead rosary under her pillow and when it thunders she clutches it tightly
and a porcelain girl danced a music box ballet for us
he wants everybody he wants anything
he's choking on apologies she's channeling a superstar
she got my love
i can feel her love
she climbed so high
you are the only one
you know i've got a place to go
i wonder which cup you'll drink from
but just for today
change this life
i dont believe that love is free
life
another drink and i wont miss her
it's all right it's all right
there'll be no tears cried
make it all seem fine
aint got no lullaby oh no
keep on pushing 'cause i know it's there
we're taping a king beaten of his crown
my country 'tis of thee sweet land of irony
hello it's me it's me
and i'll throw the fire back down
just drinking
i'll crank it for you all
the fear of bargain basements are gone without a trace yeah
tune me in tune me out
it's getting me down my love
but i know i'll see your face again
all this talk of getting old
and i'll sing in your ear again
i'm never coming down i'm never going down
oh my god i've dodged the unexpected bullets behind accolades and
now i'm guilt stricken sobbing with my head on the floor
my best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
any other day not disturbing
but not enough for the life of me
in the very best ways
if life were a moment that once stood still
we'd be lonely blue and lonely
do you understand
we just know
we just go now
we gotta go
it's not for today it's for you and me yeah you and me
i know you've won goodbye i'm gone
sitting at home in my bed too long
how are you gonna take it
come inside come inside
down down down we go till we reach the bottom
lookin back on my life
woke up one other day
in or out of sight
there is time
couldnt be that good
you changed me
there among debris find casual in casualty
it's not pretty underneath
i still feel strong
about my life
and life is a game
and now i'm trying to tell you
you walked in alone
the sky is lavender with ivory clouds that threaten drops of finger paints
stripping flowers at pedal pace
i grew up while she she grew out
victory doesnt taste the same
see how they twist and shout
and up my back a shooting pain
signs are right
come see the water break my fall
i'm calling out to some one
backing up your screaming guitar
do i gotta be straight on the line
but i gotta be straight on the line
it was in our hands from 6 to 10
and the world dont stop
yeah save me
the pills under my pillow
through the remains i have been sorting
you're gorgeous running out of me
sleeping seems to be the greatest medication
we're on the train
i felt surprised
well could you go any slower you're such a church goer
you're a slap on the wrist you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
you're a wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
you're a slap on the wrist you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
all the precious faces that
i poured the guilt right over my eyes
and i wanna know
and i wanna be
and i wanna feel
then our heads exploded overload when we decide
shield your eyes dear mother from the pain that hovers
but what else could i do
if something inside you
these things that love could be
thank you
you shine then you're gone
you shine then you're gone
get it on
whatever you want
load up
one more
thank you
come back come back again and again
to me you're like a setting sun
and to the world i'm not that clever but you would stay with me forever
and so you write on your forehead or better yet you engrave
or for the lord above to guide me
what happiness is
have you ever felt
but i dont want much
very soon the room was spinning
then came one that said the only thing you ever gave were bad directions
it burned like a cancer when the answer did occur to me
keep it moving people
reminds me of what i have run from
i hope you understand
where we could see what we should do
cause i am
why am i going to
who will be the one
cause it feels right
who snuffs the smile that once had shined so bright
i want all of you
anything that i can do
down your arms to fingertips
ah ah ah ah
from your knees up to your nose
i am in love with you
if she'd get the nerve to stay
we're always off and on again
would it be worth it to wait
borrowed lyrics sung with feeling slumping
unrelentless thoughtless selling
once a gift good bye but now remind me to replace
a mouth that's open wide and speechless seems like such a waste
she took me into a wind blown alley way
there's nothing that this girl wouldnt do for me
sure i've seen it before
oh but it seems that much to me to me my love
believe it till you see what livin has done to me
sure i've been here before
could you see me knocking down your door
scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles
if and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends
as we rolled
through the dim light
endless life
life's an ocean
say that i will see
it's slippery slidy road down
yes there's love if you want it
dont sound like no sonnet my lord
i stop to say hello
oh by now
now that the thrill is mine for the moment
for your abuse but not intended for internal use
you slither in these sheets
goliath sits and watches
'cause springtime is for dancing
i'm laughing 'cause they dont know who i am
acting as your slave i drink an open grave
acting as your slave i drink while she forgave
if you dont dare you will not try
the best lines they'd flow right off my tongue
souvenirs for the very first time
spoke to me barely if at all
'cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life
but i'm a million different people
i cant change i cant change
trying to make ends meet
from one day to the next
been down
when i was fighting tears
cruising with my nemesis on high seas
a bully enjoying his vacation
and waving we rode that parade for awhile
and ride the wave along the mitigated mile
i can see the tables turning
obligation
i watch their backs as they leave single file
through the haze that is my memory well
the ground's a little weathered where i stood
i'm nailing leaves to the ground
watching them sorting debris
i should drive you wild
all the biggest plays i missed
i awoke to a threat that was empty and a grandstand of i'm not through with you yet
hello we're so out of here hitchhike to canada with backpacks full of cigarettes and beer
round the mess of a man you've uncovered
love leads to loss
has died a little
but look what it did to me
it would be the same old stories but you're hanging onto every single word i have to say
for these ties you may have severed now you'll stay with me forever
i'm not waiting for a friend beside me
just to find out
and i wanna find it with you
i dont know how we get so out of touch
though i prefer red they tasted all right
turned out my all was just medium
penny is poison but i dont mind
if there's a crease in my face over time there's plenty more where that came from
impressing you with what i've done
swallow this scene there is laughter
when we were real we were in love
we are a crusade
4 am
never mind the thunder
off in the distance runner uplift your
she has faces up in her bedroom and they gaze down on her guarding her slumber
a dresser top a jewelry box colored tassels tied in knots
like the picture taken twenty years ago that she keeps in her portfolio
the evidence sits in the vcr
now only night lights flickering
as we proudly hail our taxis out of the fight
i know an old lady who swallowed a fly
and all that we desire is sweep the stage of fliers
there's not a missing link no matter what you think
once the bane of my perversion
a volume knob controls the scream
shake your head of leisure get your head and body into seizure
stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice
his girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
while the others roamed
to be lonely blue and lonely
and i listened to her song
i'd leave it untattered untouched until
that's when the river ran dry
fight with little purpose
only meaning to scratch the surface
thirteen miles on 31 are drying
lovely gentlemen
then drowned in her indifference
you cut the cord on which your life depends
another villain on the cover
see how they twist and shout
we all love a millionaire
and what you said about the audience
now should i repeat the second verse
through the remains i have been sorting
you're gorgeous running out of me
sleeping seems to be the greatest medication
got the home field advantage and all that you can manage
you're a wonderful waste of time
you're a wonderful waste of time
you're a wonderful waste of time
who will be the one
who will leave your bed this morning
honest
will you wait for me
you are everything
every day and every night
i love all of you
would you listen to me say
i am in between my girl
as sure as the world is round
is it worth it to search forever
to pre pubescent girls appealing
techno pop kids stardom's rockets
repeat chorus
i wouldnt want to leave upon your tongue a sour taste
kiss me idle kiss me idle
if and when we meet again we once were more than friends
tonight i took a snapshot guess i got a tender spot
park near the backstage pass a lot of underage
yeah it's good to be guaranteed
your parting lips that wrapped me up
i said that i am not quite ready
my life is riding in this chair of wheels
you think you know my problems
the light is slowly fading
you know you cant control me
i said but i meant
i meant what i said
we all need redemption some more or less
she can see reflections in her own eyes
no escape to the life of the average
i will never let you down
i'm trying to keep
i'm trying to keep
always the source of confusion
can i take you to an oceanside
keep your chin up keep your back straight
i'm an amorous man
jury reject the alibi's seemingly watertight
i could never let another day go
every word so intimidating
all the words that you punctuated
well i know it started as a fist fight
so when all these imitations fail
on how to live on only water bread and rice
and the same black line that was drawn on you
subway steam like silhouettes in dreams
who's hangin onto nothin
bang on her drums drums
a carnivals girl
it's just so easy
well angel watch my life
and there's only only one heart on that highway
turn to rusted steel and it's
i cant handle a care
in their rains we slayed dry like a fire would
when we rolled rolled on like a big drum
another one in the dark
when she shot down the moon
we stood just feet apart
you know the hardwood floors and all that penniless rough
well you must be have to be one of these
where did you ever learn to treat me like that that that that
no windshield
here dont change
no windshield
and not hold a gun in the face of the earth's abduction
and we'll make you brand new feathers
is the face of another
and my wings they've turned to leather
you were never really on your own
who picked you up who gathered around
but you dont have to be his girl
you dont have to be my girl
you can always be your own girl
you'll have started on a new one
of a warning
you said you rang them for me
they'll throw me back forever
than a nail and a hammer
sometimes it's hard to tell the wishing from the well
they say you're only sad and lonely
i remember that everyday
i've wanted to be
as i look deep
over barricades i climb
the temptations made me blind
i wish i would i wish i might
get set let's go
and they're pushin up clay
that's tears
or something to cling to
then dont make us wait
chorus
down in
for a warm embrace
everything i need
i'm not looking
i've got
everything i need
chorus
i forget what these pills
where you get in
after winter and spring
stick by stick
i had champagne
chorus
and she wont come around here
well i dont get it for the life of me
she dont come around here
looks like you aint done nothing
out of my mind
sure didnt want 'em in his world
she's got to be this towns best mess
man i'm only gonna lay awake and watch her sleep
hand me down
make some room for a new harlequin
you feel good
you feel good
maybe i just never did
i wish you happiness
for what you've had
now nobody brake any bones
you might change
so terribly wrong
we're just praying for a little light
the beginning
is if we sream every word
though nothing nothing will keep us together
and we kissed as though nothing could fall
but honey what are you talkin about
even shot robin hood
an oh my god
as sweet as nectar an overrated candy dispenser
right from wrong
and the bad from the good
i believed
underneath all these lies
by these street lights
i always thought i'd see the lights close on me
that you're saying
so you can see
and i know you're somewhere
then you can begin
help is coming
cause' you wont know when
chorus
when all the abuse follows you down
that aint a rip cord
it's the invisible breath
i would never get to hold you
that you've been drinking from
when i needed to sleep
straight through the ghettos
that always bring you down
the imitation of good faith
chorus
in the engine
movin slow
you might keep clean
i've been a ghost
'cause i i once heard
and mighty blue sea
'cause i must be close
i've been the bull
i know you've been sad
you're so sweet
chorus
i knew all along
as you abandon me
get back in line
may take two to tango but boy it takes one to let go
last slowdance to this romance on my own
i'm bringing down my suitcase now
i had right now
i always thought i knew enough
when you're packing up your things to leave
they're including everyone
this is murder 101
we'd only just begun
and keep it all inside
but i wont let you fall
well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
there's got to be something better than
somewhere here in front of me
it feels just like a beat up truck
yeah
raspberry beret
i put her on the back of my bike
the kind u find in a second hand store
they say the first time aint the greatest
raspberry beret
raspberry beret
i just might stay down
i aint sorry baby
i've been down so long
but you're usually
and then i saw the lids of my eyes
if she's been havin the same old dreams
the river ends right as she goes
your whisper's a scream now
little girl in your white ice skates
could sell
but it aint ever far from the backyard
now i heard it from a junkie that my old lady
come on and give me just one kiss
sleepwalker dont be shy
just dont leave me at the window
the sleepwalker in me
when i'm dead asleep dreamin
you shouldnt blame me
oooooh as if it wasnt hard enough
an epidemic i cannot outlast
you want to make it so much harder
this bed just cant be made
now some flowers they never bloom
and we can buy that diamond ring
and just about any other thing
with somebody else's money
to swing through the skies openings
i know they're listening
we can buy anything
he's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links
it's so cold and blown all apart
and anyone with anything has already begun to think
he's killing me getting free
they shoot arrows up into the skies
now if there's a smile on my face
now there's some sad things known to man
decided to go
along
his best friend come along
with his girl
you always said that you needed some
take a load off fanny
go down miss moses there's nothing you can say
he said ``i will fix your rat if you'll take jack my dog''
who sent me here with her regards for everyone
she hadnt even paid yet
she's gonna pick a star in the night
man i think i'm gonna buy myself a rolls
out here among us
out of every every box
there's three ways
that's left
then you can just burn up
loosen off that pretty french gown
spread your wings and let me come inside
it's gonna be alright
i will show you the light
some people dont care
just isnt enough
anymore than you're givin
like myself
and i worked with my brothers there
the vanity to believe
i'm so happy that you're my friend
when you cant move at the top of a ferris wheel
man i wish i could once be you
oooh ooh ooh oooh
oooh ooh ooh oooh
everything's goin bad
everything's goin bad
that nobody's slept in
but none of them matter
but nothing's ever as good
i need someone whose price hasnt been met
i heard a shot
i want to start again
you come around here
homicide is emotional
now you aint gotta stand up tall
and the morals that they worship will be gone
we wont get fooled again
pick up my guitar and play
yeah
pick up my guitar and play
32 feathers in my brand new indian headdress
where's my baby i dont know
no 29
of the store where they let me play the organ
it's a thing named it
but i must have sold my car
it's a thing named it
the dotted line
you might be sailing 'cross the sea
with rubber lining the walls
i know monkey see but monkey's dead for you it would be wrong
i'm insane
and he calls when i'm stuck out in the rain
we could walk but we'd never get there
get outta my lane
get outta my way
it's just a full day's drive away
you know that that's a bitch
because alienations for the rich
and i'm feeling poorer every day
and her voice is a backwards record
or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
they dont need me here and i know you're there dont need me
ana ng and i are getting old
become a robot clang clang
hey
here's hoping you dont hoping you dont
and when i get there
beneath the planet
not to put too fine a point on it
like the longines symphonette it doesnt rest
but really i'm not actually your friend
blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
say i'm the only bee in your bonnet
make a little birdhouse in your soul birdhouse in your soul
say i'm the only bee in your bonnet
blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
all the empty places in the world
i dont feel three hundred
and the microscope reveals the scope
on the only nice part of me
daddy'll sing bass
you cover your windows with lead
yawn as your plane goes down in flames
so what's gonna happen to chess piece face
for the planet of the apes
history wants you they made a mistake
it was like a tv show the way she stole that car
particle man particle man
they have a fight triangle wins
hit on the head with a frying pan
triangle man
they look out for number two
which is not to say i like it
reads the sign above your station
at allwaiting at the bus stop
and it's a lucky thing
piece of dirt the whole world has slipped away
i wish that i could jump out of my skin
somebody put their fingers in the president's ears
we tried to help them fight no one appreciated that
purple toupee and gold lame
it was not not not so great
put your hand inside the puppet head
was only bu bu busted in
quit my job down at the carwash
put your hand inside
chess piece face and the big duluth call her every day

he's breaking up my home
and they're coming after me
is he a dot or is he a speck
usually kind to smaller man
does he feel totally worthless
see the constellation ride across the sky
just a guy made of dots and lines
can you hear what i see in the sky
the city lights think nothing's there
just thrill me through and through
and just make up your mind
'cause i'm getting sentimental over you
the dumbwaiter's a monkey
forget about it 'cause she's a
from the top of a tree
she's actual size but she seems much bigger to me
nationwide believe
hangs in portrait
words fail
as they step aside
in your mind you have her on a pedestal
all the money
she's actual size but she seems much bigger to me
when you're following an angel
the secretary says he's on another line
does it mean you have to throw your body off a building
calling you an angel calling you the nicest things
and then i knew that i would have him to thank
had seen a modest sum grow geometrically
chess piece face's patience must be wearing thin
i thought you said you scratch my back and i'll scratch your record
and the one thing you cant hide is all the fear you feel inside
and sadly the cross eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs
aquarius abandon hope for future plans
hide away

your embrace and my collapse

prosthetic foreheads on their heads
to wind a piece of string around
it's a new leaf overturned
our only home is bone
lives beneath the ocean and that's where i will be

i'm three days from new york city and i'm three days from you
and you fell on the floor
space walk it's like a space walk with the corresponding weight loss
how the windows lean into the room
in my prison cell i think these words
but they're like the people chained up in the cave
why the dancing shouting
no one knows my plan
and crashes into everything that tries to make it stop
but every little thing's a domino that falls on different dots
wont talk to me at all
and i dont want anything
into what would be
and the mirror on the wall
now there's everything dont remind me of yesterday babool babool
a rich man once told me
and i asked old what's his name
you'll still have to call me sir
we could be sleeping in the flowers
how ungrateful i must have seemed
you declare that i have drowned
tell my boss that i've been fired
bugs stay off 'em
bugs stay off 'em
and we'll sleep all afternoon
and you
look what you gave
snail shell
and knew that there would be a way the act could be repaid
side effect or drug trip
not back on it joe still on it

subliminal stare into the subliminal
who can snap my fingers

they follow directions
they hear the sound
no there's this to know
no the people know
and they're revealing
the bells are ringing
they follow directions
what is it brings you down
we'll strike it rich a monster switch monster
the big big whoredom scares me
should have changed that stupid lock
the trees all waved their giant arms
and she's thinking of going home
then we'll meet at the end of the tour
and the picture abruptly changedat the end of the tour
this was the vehicle these were the people
the engagements are booked through the end of the world
we're having a good time we're
hi we're the replacements hi
we're
and the note would say when it rains it snows
when you turn around to look it's gone behind you
or is it worse because it's always waiting where your eyes dont go
which describes how you're feeling all the time
it describes how you're feeling
which is fine
there's only one thing that i know how to do well
whistling in the dark
and then i happily walked away
but i'd rather be whistling in the dark
and that's be you
whistling whistling
whistling whistling whistling whistling
whistling whistling whistling whistling
yo ho it's hot the sun is not
a gigantic nuclear furnace
the sun shines night and day
at a temperature of millions of degrees

no ones laughing now what do i say
maybe i'm wrong but i dont know how to back down
i put it in with my animal ways
wintertime all alone in your bedroom
when you come it's like a thousand julys
baby's eyes look just like mine
it just seems that things it could've been different
from inside
time moves faster today oh

bring me the sun
and the strong survive and the strong survive

and the strong survive yeah the strong survive
deep inside of you
slide of her dress shouts in darkness i'm so alive
i'd walk with my people if i could find them
and we were broke and didnt know
deep inside of you
oceans of love
nothing i cannot do
now that i've hardened
that's where i shine where i shine now
i'm coming for you can we get this all together
nothing much matters to me so i dont see why
talking to myself pass by i miss you
there was a sound but i dont know how it goes
farther from you every day
we're laughing in the back of chauffeured cars
phony grabs with the manicured hands
time ticks by where'd you go
and i keep on forgetting myself
cuz there's someone younger and we're feeling older
i keep on forgetting myself where'd you go
hello hello hello
i cant get clean again
i cant keep it all together
you let me down i said it now i'm going down
you more than i do
cause inside i feel a wind that starts to blow
my smile will not mislead you
i dont know where my life should go
my bones break
let it bleed bleed yeah yeah
say it's not there but across the sea
blown open wide
i'm going to knock it all down
can i look in faces that i meet
can i graduate can i graduate
i'll tell you things arent quite the same
and i guess that i just dont know
i lost myself and those around
i wonder what are we fighting for
when there's no one there to talk to
dont see lightning like last fall
how's it going to be
how's it going to be how's it going to be
oh you do you do
you make me want you
you want to know how deeply my soul goes
a candle burns to fight off the gloom
riding on the road with friends
do you think you are invisible
but she's got other ideas what is good for you
so have you
so do you
i keep on motoring i keep on motoring
you could cut ties with all the lies
i know something's wrong
and i do not think anyone knows
that ledge my friend
i know just how you spend your time
the world could end we wouldnt hear it
all your friends afflicted
i know just what's on your mind
all your friends afflicted
i dont want to go to london
your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
losing a whole year
the whole goddamned day in bed
and i dont wanna play no more
it crashes through the windows
visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
i would like to build something
the surface is everything but i could never do that
i go home to the coast
and i've never been so alone
but i i can feel this narcolepsy slide
into another nightmare
how'd you like to be alone and drowning
i never let you go
i never let you go
if there's a reason it's lost on me
that's a good idea break a promise to your mother
that girl is like a sunburn i would like to save
who can show me how to have a good time
i'm crying in my beer again
and in the darkness candle light across my face
this is a lonely tale
cuz it's gonna be one of those christmas days
merry christmas
it's been a long time been a long time
i'll make do with none
i'll take on anyone
to walk with the mighty
well the dragonflies float on
so i go out looking for the right one
is anyone sick of being nervous and annoyed
fooling anyone
she says love i wont feel sick
come on scooby doo
you're ready and you're willing
keep on smiling what we go through
i was taking sips of it through my nose
how do i get myself back to the place where you said
and when the plane came in she said she was crashing
i'm scared i'm not coming down
the sky was gold it was rose
the one in the summer where we used to smoke pot
but girl if you would let me
urban life decays
there's a knock to his fist as he swings
the joke's on you
so glad you let me stay around
jumping through the hoop of your ear
and it's not the way i want to go
you touch the tattoo of the sun
i've never caught you in a lie
and nothing left
and i felt all right
the clothes she wears mis fit
cause i know all the dirty things you like to do
i walk haight street to the store
i only know because i carry you around
and i'm hanging on your words
the words they use so lightly
i've seen car wreck kids walk away from it
i'll make it all my home
tell me something i dont understand
when we were close
you must explain why this must be
but you dont understand my point of view
no not at all
i have your face in a photo in high school
another lullaby go sing oh
it's who we are now who we are
living great days with the shade of the wind
forgive me
where does time go now on the wake for young souls now
and the bruises that you feel will heal
well i never claimed to understand what happens after dark
till you're walking down shaking that ass again
now you're wounded
you're screaming i dont care baby i dont care
ever since you've been gone
my friends said i should settle for any port in a storm
hey 'cause i know that the rainll keep pourin on the pane
girl it's been a long time since i've seen sunshine
i know there's got to be
i know there's got to be
leave all these rainy days behind
i'm a slave to the sun it aint cuttin me no slack
aint no glory in this livin
her daddy would holler and run to the door
we were rebels chasin time against the wind
we'd never be the same again
it always ends
punched a hole in the wall of his world
karen she had a long time dream
talkin about bein just friends
finally own a car that doesnt break down on the freeway
all i want is a life
i'm sick of the crumbs i want a piece of that pie
say exactly how you feel
embrace the gift of time
in every breath of who you are
we'll lock the world outside
timing his past teachings they fade
then i said sir you dont understand
we've felt the hand of the devil felt his breath our my skin
have we lost our wings
i dont know why you gotta be angry all the time
i never quite made it back to the one i was before
peanuts in a bottle
back when a hoe was a hoe
i miss back when
i'm readin street slang for dummies
and when you said i'm down with that
coke was a coke
i was fifteen when my daddy died mama worked two jobs just to get by
he might have been sober but i brought the whiskey
that's all between the river and me
there might have been blood but they never saw it
i'm just a blank sheet of paper
what he wants to say
he's almost asleep pen in hand
and i'm still a blank sheet of paper
somewhere and lock the door
repeat chorus
so she cant be really gone
what more proof do you need
the two of hearts to mark her page
and one day to lay her down
you cant tell me nothin
the same thing for rolling smokes
if mama was here i know what mama would say
carry on
with a handful of faith and a heartful of love
sometimes i feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book
but tonight i'm with you and you can carry me through
dont let me sleep
gold with the setting sun
tears in their eyes
faithfully comfort me
walk me along the bay
reach out through gathered storms
then i looked at you and knew i never knew nothin and it broke this heart of stone
i dont know why i act the way i do
the things i've done for foolish pride
girl i know there's times you must have thought
you're living in my house
and you took that life
i'm supposed to tell you
and you took my kids
my pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat
just dont mention memphis
and i'm hanging with you 'til the sun comes up
when he was eight years old
ten years down the road
same old boy
make this my last request
tailgates down
but there's some things you cant do inside those city limits
stay out of the beans
just country boys and girls gettin down on the farm
from sunday morning to saturday night
down on me
everybody just wants to get high
the new sob
he's back in the crowd
but til they are they wanna see the big dog fail
every single day till we made our get away
arizona dancin 'cross the desert
the conversation always turns to you
and see you down the road
albuquerque waitin out a blizzard
i've been let down so many times
i fall in love all over
when my world goes crazy
i fall in love all over
oh we just get closer
gotta hold on easy as i let you go
when you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand
i think i'll take a moment celebrate my age
find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
make up for lost time here in my next thirty years
for the years that have passed
cause a few simple verses
goodbye goodbye
without a minute to spare
lay your life down for your country for your jesus for your friends
straight through that guardrail up into that white light
going over in my mind
and i know i'd stay
there were nights so long
instead of thinking about you again
used to chase that boy home from school
about the times you pushed and shoved me
i left her standin with my high school ring
maybe even cry a little but
one of these days i'm gonna love me
it's open season on my heart
i reached the point where i get stuck
it's open season on my heart
strong as it ever was
you'll find better love
strong as it ever was
chorus
put your lovin on me
just who i am
i might have a reckless streak
aint much i can promise you
we were just as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
well the very first time her mother met me
she said please dont stop
i was stopped at a red light just yesterday beside a young girl
last monday mornin you left with no warnin
my head is poundin in this border town fog
so full of your memory
livin on refried dreams
let's get it straight now
i'm a renegade
it's just the way i was made
i'm a renegade
i still love her
i hope you realize this is a one night stand
so senorita margarita let me hold you tight
and everywhere in between
and we go rolling down this highway
hot sun dancin on a river
we take a ride and head on down to airport road
she's gone but she left me with a smile
i know it wont be easy but i've got a plan
i'm gonna miss your touch
so if you'll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best
and we'll work our way up slowly to fool hearted memory
before i come unwound
i pulled into the shopping center
keep having this dream about my old man
we say grace and thank the lord
i dont know why they say grown men dont cry dont cry
rollercoster ridin
now when she wiggles through my door
i oughta get a policy
i oughta get a policy
whatever she is fixing
back home
brother he'll be waiting with the
and somewhere in an honest laugh
from time to time
and the circle is unbroken
back home
to them i always say
cause if you want it all
can you feel it
you've got to lay it all out on the line
cause if you want it all
well i was caught off guard
wrapped up in a blanket till the break of day
then she broke the silence
we said our goodbyes
i didnt ask
i am but i aint
i do but i dont
but i dont
bring you up when you're feeling down
i guess you get used to somebody
i guess you get used to being loved
i know i cant hide
i kept the brim pulled down
it's been a long time
i may not be the best of singers
i may not drive a fancy car
now honey dont it make you wonder
i know how to love
i cant rise about it
'cause i like it i love it i want some more of it
she cant get enough of me
you know some cowboys like me go out like that so i need you
i wanna wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
i wanna smoke that cigarette
night after night
it gets me so high
all these truckers out here drive with one hand on the wheel and a cell phone to their ear
baby i love you
i love you
you can find me in my wigwam
make your little heart bubble
i can kill a deer or buffalo
my baby she's a chippewa
she likes to go skinny dippin in the heat of the day
she cranks my tractor with just one kiss
and asking you to do what you've been doin all over again
and now that we're together
i just gotta let you know what it is that wont let me go
girl he's gonna lose you sure enough
if i could only touch your cheek
about what tomorrow would bring
i just never could quite tell you no
it's worth all that's lost
just to see you smile
i'd never count the cost
what i've done here tonight
just good bye i wish you well
a man changed and alive
just good bye i wish you well
i'm gonna grab my old guitar take a pencil from the jar and fill in the empty space
i'm gonna drink this bottle of ninety proof and sing this song for you
just a small reminder of the hell that i've gone through
i dont have to worry
verse 2
look at me so free
i'm so glad you're here today
i'm gonna hold my head up high
chorus
the way i feel inside
oh i want to taste your kiss
free the desire in your soul
let me take you to a place like no where else
oh oh let me love you
asked him when it sank in that this might really be the real end
and i gave forgiveness i've been denying
and i took a good long hard look at what i'd do
i went rocky mountain climbin
to live like you were dyin
so baby maybe we should just sleep on it tonight
and give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
tonight
reminiscin through the pain
it's an every night occasion me and your memory meet
i'm still walkin down memory lane
down memory lane
down memory lane
and betty fixed joe dinner every night
cause life is sweet in a border town
maybe monterey or acapulco
and when the local news was over
but only if they both will reach across
and he placed it in her hand
some people say i'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked
i spread myself so thin and i'm just barely hangin on
oh is you
chorus
he said you dont have to call me mister mister
but the trouble with never is never never works
there's something different 'bout this girl
he went down that lost highway
all of them were calling him the king
dont you know things change
dont you know they change
i just keep waiting for something to happen
i shouldnt be worried about it
but i shouldnt be thinking about it
but it's ticking away
the boulevard is not that bad
count the headlights on the highway
i'll take the last train i can find just in case i want to change my mind
i'll take the last train i can find just in case i want to change my mind
i've got a two steppin mind
i've got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart
if i walked around at all it was in bits and pieces
if i doubted the power of love baby now i understand
when i see your smile fill my soul again
when i see your smile fill my soul again
in the fights they had he'd cover up his ears
when the sins of the father are the sins of the son
said he'd be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his mama say
dont you listen to them cause they've got no claim
walk like a man
and watch the wind blow by
so let me kiss you now little darling
and all i want to do is watch the wind blow by
says she's never ever felt so alone
beyond the picket fences and the oil wells
we carry on
as the dark surrenders to the dawn
now all you want is gone
welcome to the club
whose heart was in a hit and run
you've got a glow that's not a suntan
so off you went in a new direction
tell me what room was the holiday
but it's not what she took that hurt
'cuz it's not what she took that hurt
'cause a man would never leave her this way
so i dont want to be here in the morning
so i dont want to be here in the morning
my camels buried in a big straw stack
i caught the first bus that i could hop from there
and plan our dreams where the peaceful river flows
aint a thing that i can do
if i dont break down and bring it on myself it'll hit right out of the blue
dont pray in school but have safe sex
they probably own the village voice
who are they
and i wonder if they've got a soul
they're probably living in la
just like it was yesterday
i just had to call you i had to hear your voice
and girl let's give it one more try
but i wouldnt want it any other way
love's never let us down
you know i love you more each day
hell she took everything but the kitchen sink
i was so naive to have ever believed
i oughta call somebody but i aint got a phone
then an old familiar feeling
we watched it unravel
i forgot that you dont love me anymore
i didnt break your heart you see
i didnt break your heart you see
you got the wrong man
as long as you are by my side
that kinda magic is so hard to find
then you
you done all the takin
flip the switch on my doomaflatchie played my piano like liberace
ya flick my bic
and saw her face she called his name
little hope i'd ever get back on my feet
is a reason to believe
i could tell my old milk cow
get down on your knees and pray
when my lover aint around
all together now milk cow ride on home
you're gonna need my love someday
lightnin flashed across the sky
legs hangin off the bayou bridge
rock and roll and faded blue jeans
well i was southern born and raised on the good book
well they tell me i'm old fashioned
and that's just me
i'd say i'm living in real good company
when they start talking she starts walking
'cause she never lets it go to her heart
once upon a lonely time
back to drinkin in no time
to play a game you'll never win
cause she's made more than one man blind
down all night
confetti falling down all night
she's my kind of rain
she's my kind of rain
songs about free thinkin and drinking sure light my fire
between texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in
and i've been out there searching
and i've been out there searching
i wont let you in
i dont wanna go to sleep tonight
repeat chorus
1 800 change your life today
i'm free as a bird and my spirit's flying
when i said i love you for eternity
you can rest assured
motor blew on her coup de ville
she said hey charles but he just laughed
somebody must be prayin for me
prayin for me yeah
she was killing me in that miniskirt
and when i looked i couldnt believe just what i saw
time can make a feeling fade
oh not something like that
with the truth she wasnt jokin
with the truth she wasnt jokin
i'm so proud when we walk in the room
when i go out to a party with you
chorus
cause i love her
a make me a different e man
a make me a different e man
show me that there's something more
maybe she'd come back
hidin the pain
i headed up to the rockies got a job at this bar
we spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire
in telluride
in telluride the snow falling down
cause i dont wanna lose at love again
stand up against the odds
we take a lot of chances playing some foolish games
there's no doubt you're in deep
your heart beats at double time
might as well face it 3
oh you like to think that you're immune
i need you here beside me to chase the night away
chorus
i stand and watch the lights go down
and today is just tommorrow's yesterday
maybe someday we can put the cast away
love can heal when it's sad
there's all kinds of people in this worldyeahhh
oh i'm waiting in the storm ask me how i feel
when you think that i'm uptight why dont you ask me how i feel oh
playing games with my heart
i know you won`t admit it but you`re broken hearted
you play with fire i guess you`ll never learn
who`s gonna help ya
back where you started
but dont give up
it doesnt have to be this way
be tender with me baby
hot whispers in the night
yes you better be good to me
that`s how it`s got to be now
be good to me
you`re every beautiful thing i`ve ever seen
and i`m not above cheating for you
i`d even be your fool
and you've done all you can
go on tell me that you love me
but i can stay secret from prying eyes
i'll keep it confidential
something's gone i cant explain
when you do what you do it dont mean a thing
it's the touch that you lose and the words you dont say
when you do what you do it dont mean a thing
it feels like forty days and forty nights i've been
i could meet you where you are
i will always think about you
and making love is all there is to eat
file it under foreign affair
like spirits living so far away
like pain like tears on the face
see him surface in every shadow
you'll never know the days the nights
goldeneye i'll show him forever
now i've got you in my sight
i`ve changed my mind
and now my life has changed
i can`t stand the rain
everything was so grand
but me i'm getting stronger
that simply doesnt bother me
dont care now who's to blame
tired of all these games
i dont wanna lose you
but when you look at me that way
you're not pretending
i dont even wanna say good bye
i`m scanning the horizon
where the first born died
for some recollection
with my perfect memory
but it won`t stop
music's soundin good to me
music's in your city too oo oo
come on baby higher
hey hey hey hey
c'mon daddy higher
oo it's just the devil in me
dont let me down
just got used to having you around
just got used to having you around
too restless to explain
and i will find no other rescue
just as if everything were planned
ohhoyeah never in your wildest dreams
ohhoyeah never in your wildest dreams
this one's pumping for you as the mad thing starts
text in translated sung by antonio banderas in spanish
two can make the dream so real
one can have a broken heart
you know it takes two
something really kinda neat
i`ll never be untrue
let me be the one you come running to
last night we tried to touch but we never got close
look me in the heart
cant you look me in the heart
saw your eyes open wide
take a ride in my love machine
i never want you to go
so get on my love thing right now
and there's a heart that's breaking
in your world i have no meaning
and if i cant breach this distance
i aint missing you at all
the people keep the city clean
call it nutbush city limits
salt pork and molasses
what you're puttin down in old
were falling in the dust
i can see us in our dreams and we're dancing
you just go separate ways
silent wings
well i guess i`ve been a long time
tryin` to make a song fit
and she`ll never say yes
you know it never was mine
some place a millions miles from
the future is this moment
you dream about the highlife
'cos paradise is here
well the men come in these places
a dancer for money
and the men are all the same
workin for the man every night and day
'til i hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
now i love you just the way i loved that
when you were a young boy
if i lost you would i cry
and i love you baby river deep mountain
but i need you to make it work
we`ve got to show some respect
from the woman that you see inside
we're travellers here spirits passing through
now the darkness falls
something beautiful remains
time will ease the pain
making up for lost time
and i know it's just the wind
living`s easy when you make the rules
you find the lock is on the door
no election time
sometimes i think i`m going crazy
when you give up believing in the
like you know what it means
baby i would rather be dead
yeah i knew him all too well
before they knew what hit them i was out of sight
but this time i got caught
aahhhhh thief of hearts a burglar in the night
thief of hearts
it doesn`t mean that you can do as you please
you look to me
and with you i could till the right man comes along
save it for a rainy day
you gotta stand by me
i confess i`m a fool for a man
but your defence dont help my case
so put your books aside
he would rock me with an optical illusion
just too hot to handle
you're the book that i have opened
like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart
like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart
and no ocean can keep us apart
as long as you're there beside me
in my heart there's a fire that's burning
when the moment is right
we don`t need another hero
and i wonder when we are ever gonna change
or end in the dark
try to change the habit of a lifetime
when i don`t want your kind of love
so let me see your cards on the table
whatever you want me to do i will do it for you
because it's love that i feel whenever you're really near
and deep in my heart i know that it's real
whatever you want me to do baby baby baby
that it`s only that thrill
what`s love got to do with it
there`s a phrase for it
what`s love got to do with it
i dont deserve this kind of treatment
why are you so blind
when i give you love and it's not enough
you know who is doing you know what
you know who is doing you know what
they built cathedrals for the glory and the fame
golden hills and silver street made out of sweat and blood
when the sun is going down in a sea of misery
my veins are full of elecricity
i never cool down i never cool of
dont bug me
i would bang
visions that you see bring you close to me
i'm alive forever my words and my songs will live
i've touched your soul
all my life i've lived and i see
and i hope that they understand
there's no borderline
a new temptation for a generation
walk in the cyber space
feel the temptation
dont wanna live for ever i cannot stand that pain
send me an angel of death i will die
send me an angel of death deus deus angelus mortifer
and kiss me and feel my last breath deus deus angelus mortifer
all the bad dreams will go
you must know every time there's somebody at your side
your helping hand from heaven sent
a new day is born
words i said things i've done
i feel the wind embracin me
you are the one i never wanna let you go
i i feel the calm before the storm
i'm on the point of no return
started slipping away
i feel it back in my bones
let's fight against the final fate
justice for all is a lie
my inner thoughts are writen down
live and love and die life's a battlefield
what i'm crying out
life is just a broadway show
do you think we're blind
i wanna better
you're buredned by every new child's birth
like livin in the dark
we dont face the hard facts
like livin in the dark
imagine we could get a vision that never dies
imagine we could get a vision that never dies
make your heart dying
drive'em out let'em fall you can resist their call
dont break your soul you'll find a way out
and i'm praying when it's there
welcome brother welcome brother moonlight
is there a healing for a world ravin mad
c'est la vie
dance in the starlight and light up my life
dance in the starlight light up the dark night
oh our love will live and grow
a nightmarish invitation
and i dance with the dead l drive out my fright
way down to hell
dance with the dead on their holy night
why are we sure we can survive
why are we sure we can survive
i will go insane
is it love what i feel
but you dont want my dreams
flying through rain and storm
dreaming dreaming in the cold night
i've got the kingdom of the night
allright allright
they always win
we kill them all
hold the world in their hands
take the world with fear and fright
moonbeams dance they are my guide
let us sail with your ship up to the moon
queen in black your glory will shine
queen in black your glory will shine
feeling so excited
larger than life
supersonic aeroplanes
all your looks let me live and survive
everything is clear where is your fantasy
here i can dream and think
oh i invite you to my wonderland
remember she's fire and water in one
what i need i'll never get
just a little look back
what i need i'll never get
it's a little war i get used to this fight
like a little war the more we fight the more we love
like a little war
like a drug like a derailing train
all our misery
i will never ever love anyone at all
it aint over till it's over lost in love
this is a nightmare
motionless i just gaze
shadows of eternity
i will reach out for the signs in the sky
lost in the darkness
i'm not the one to take the blame
i'm not the one to take the blame
love and pain
there's no rest sometimes i feel bound
belive in me our dreams will come true
i feel your love i see your smiling face
and every stone is flowing away
builds up the wall and you will see
hold you touch you
i wanna live for you
go on and kiss him goodbye now
na na na na hey hey ey goodbye hey hey ey goodbye
i can never get enough of you
take my hand i will save you from the fall
take my hand and i'll lead you through the night
when i call for your love
i know you are waiting for my call
a magic island close to you
are colder than ice
oh let me lead you through cold and darkness
eyes at night lifeless they stare
i hear the tales of glory island
hear a noise out of the dark
go into rapture now the spell is going on
hello you you let your magic shine
hello you let all sadness disappear
let me ride on the wings of my god
ride on the wings of god
one by one
the tears of the trees
a screaming noise more and more
they've captured my mind
in my dreams my fever
in my dreams my fever
now when the lamb opened the
the third one is a black
the third one is a black
the leading horse is white
when the moon falls down to earth
when the moon falls down to earth
when the moon falls down to earth
a beast awakes undercover of the night
belong together for all eternity
when the wolf prowls
when the wolf prowls
the world is looking in their eyes
the world is looking in their eyes
can only increase
only the future can ever be rearranged
cause on the day that i die
i invite you to the ride
let us fly
and all dreams come true
where only eagles fly
and all dreams come true
'cos i've got only one soul to sell
if you touch the world's horizon
if i could i would protect myself give me voodoo vibes
you life in the dark
watch out all i wanna be
watch out
alone i'm weak and innocent
i am just a waterdrop
i'm the flowing blood of the world the elixier of life
the night is glowning bright
shouting out stupid slogans unthinking no doubts
the root of all evil encriaches
but now i know it's not too late
and now i know what i never knew
now i know the million lies
it's the reason why i feel alive
why not
the prince of darkness is floating in the sky
how should i pray to escape l tell me how
will god remember me
we set the world now aflame
it's like opium of the masses
on the back of the innocent
by the place of our birth our fate was sealed
there's a wind in the night let the clouds dispell
the calm before the storm
and i see the childrens dancing and i llok in to their eyes
busy living
an empty place and the silence all around me
without you i would die
never bring you back to me
gimme just a sign
wont you give me one more night
and you will understand
come and take my hand
get out get out and take my invitation
we will cross the world of your destiny
we'll cross the world of our destiny
his old hand is searching slowly
young souls rocking agein
young souls rocking agein
for evermore tears in your eyes
you must know that i'm still in love
yes i know i'll always love you
i need your mind expanding stuff
a million needles like burning rain
will hide the sun and the sky
everywhere my shadows fly
look in the mirror of pride
and they stay
about blood on glorious shoes
you feel like you're going insane
face to face with their death
fear the holy cross
yes i know
yeah they fan the flames of fear
the biggest walls
day by day
forgotten are these promises
sounds like a handicap
hear the flashback radio try the flashback music show
i dont wanna change you i dont say i'm right
your world has made me blind
aint easy when the world imprisons me
hold me back before i fly away
voices i hear your voices and obey
like waves in the sea
all we do is stare
a new life has begun
a world as new
it was to be a neverending fight
but they've forgotten their beliefs
travelling on roads
this is a rock'nroll paradies
so many different faces
music changes every mind
and history shows what men can do
i would rob a bank for the money you need
gimme your love dont treat me like trash
this is what i want you have to pay the price
for the liquid power
feel the water on your skin
to help me take the blame some rain
heaven in black heaven in white
different
different thoughts could make our life so colourful
i'm sceared my panic rises more and more
heavens 7th train no way back again
heaven
i was the slave to your pain
you were my saint and i always followed your words
helena helena
come from high above
i come and go there's no hide away
i'll keep stayin for all time
tere's no wind tp set it in motion
to the shoreline of beginning
journeys beginning
someone's pushing me there's no way back i fall
it's a temptation to go insane
see me and hear what i say in my paradise
restless lights shadows hide
i cannot run i cannot hide
look look the ice wind will blow
the nature strikes back without grace
alright
alright
alright
this community of death
shadows are crawling
and i pray loud
dont drag drag me down dont let me fall
a minute's attention
i saw her tears i saw the gun
i saw the bullet on her head
i feel like a new born
forever i will see my soul
love will prove what friend are for
what went wrong we long
cryin out our song
nothing on my mind day after day
no advice open up your eyes dont you realize
just livin for each day and we need need need
carry my dreams to a wishing well
i couldnt live in your perfect world
i knew i'd loose you if i'd go and find
aware of a world i have never known
whose prize do they have to pay
exploding destroying
mistreated mistreated
to a foreign land
could never hold you
heaven dont let you go
my state of elation
i will fly
i will rock
i feel no control l undying drug called rock'nroll
the passion for rock l the passion
yeah i was young
just to stay alive not to be a star
just goin straight to reach the end it's not far away
time after time
stamping with my feets
it's like a fire
smoke will fade away
sarajevo
save me
save me
my life is your life
i will dive in the sea of love
i will dive in the sea of love
i will dive in the sea of love
this nightmare wont disappear
i can hear the voice of the shadowman
i watch that demon face
can you see what's going on with me
are living in that twilight zone
would i be crazy or would i cry
walking in your mind with a second sight
the wall has fallen down tonight
ships are sailing cross the water
we feel the freedom
ships are sailing cross the water
dont want to live on my own
i think i'm dying when you take my hand
why dont you stay by me
wrapping paper everywhere
and as another christmas ends
it looks better on you anyway
no way around it
be here before you know it
i get into getting out on my mower
this old world is full of simple pleasures
i can make you believe any lie
been making the bars lots of big money
and also for those
and helping white people dance
she got a scholarship to yale
but all i wanted was a car
now when i look outside sitting in the drive
so you say you wanna tie the knot
and a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations
and food for the reception you'll need someone to cater
away in a manger no crib for a bed
bless all the dear children in thy tender care
if you know what i mean
well dont get me wrong boys this is pretty good
but if a bus load of women really good lookin women
and little jenny pikins showed up with fried chicken
a little baby boy
born on christmas day

so hush up little baby
someday i'm gonna be famous do i have talent well no
i can throw a major fit
2nd chorus
and say it's just so tough
no matter what you do
she stares out the window fightin back tears
but it's gettin tough
chorus
fall in love used all the old cliches
so come on over tonight
just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat
yeah come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing
i'll just throw away these feelings
well darlin i dont think you understand
but dont stand there and tell me
in the hot summer sun all day
yeah we're laughing all the way to the bank
and gary was a garbage man
i'm glad you stopped in it's sure been slow around here today
i know you played in somethin but i'm gonna need some help
and i threw the winning touchdown pass the night that we won state
'cause i'm one of the most famous people in the country
cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
we'll understand it all by and by
tell me how many flowers have to die
is really up to you
you wouldnt believe the number of times i've been asked that myself
cause my time at home is usually spent packing
and we cant see those folks unless we're never home
a few months later i remember lying there in bed
i met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
and i hope i'm at least half the dad
i'm holdin on to you
chorus
just to hear your voice
and we never said goodbye
but before you do i want you to know that i
maybe i'll understand why you had to leave
and i hope that you find love along the way
free as horses running wild
and you're the biggest mystery
carrie underwood
you heal
i still live with my mom and dad
i drive a mazarati
and she fixes me a snack
and i got a set of six pack abs that'll blow your mind
and i lose a bunch of weight everytime i log in
i'm sittin on the fender of someone else's truck
and i love to hear the pickup trucks as they come unraveled
puttin up their dukes
i'm sittin on the fender of someone else's truck
and we'd pick up where we left off
a way for you and i
and change the way the story ends
has a secret agent bird
that dapper little guy
he's santa's secret spy
he was there to save the day
secret agent bird
it feels like it's rainin you
but i am baptized anew
but i am baptized anew
santa looked a lot like daddy
repeat chorus
santa looked a lot like daddy
she's a saturn with a sunroof
and everything i need
and she's feeling kinda tipsy
she's the voice i love to hear
she's everything to me
sleep in heavenly peace
with the dawn of redeeming grace
people passing
as the shoppers rush home
soon it will be christmas day
and she caught me cleanin fish
chorus
and oh we're do we go from here
twice i've gotten caught
always stayed a onetime thing
to only make once
i got a hundred bucks that says right now your hair's up in a clip
like you and me is history
we all commit a little bit of perjury
yeah yeah yeah well all right so she bends the truth
one that came with a company car
and the grass sure is green in the yard
and just to be safe i insured 'em
2nd chorus
and now i sit and i stare at a blank brick wall
till my trophies at last i lay down
and exchange it some day for a crown
its shame and reproach gladly bear
i promise you
where the love light gleams
right then that's when
you know i like it
repeat chorus
well i love her
when i get home
and the weather's perfect
yeah i'm gonna miss her
when you see a priceless french painting
then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
i'll pour out my heart
getting out of being feminized
the son of god discloses
and he walks with me
is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
it doesnt get better than this
me in that tux fightin butterflies
oh it did
one more push and a baby cries
oh lighten up where's your sense of humor
'cause it never woulda worked out anyway
you really ought to thank me i was doin you a favor
and it never woulda worked out anyway
yeah i miss those times when we were still together
when i look into her eyes
and send it back in time to myself at 17
she wasnt right for you
just assume you're wrong and dad is right
mom and dad will kill you dead
ps go hug aunt rita every chance you can
well i'll never forget the first time that i heard
and she was just about to cry until i took her in my arms
and i want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin and it's numb
oh you and me we could be soakin up that sun
how much longer is this gonna last
chorus
when a man and woman start growin old
love is never ending
bridge
is make a mistake
believe me
and darlin tell me would you like to dance
i'm thinkin there's no chemistry at all
catch me if you can
hows my dust taste in your mouth
bet i can run faster'n you can
just go on back to the krispy kreme
to the teller down at the bank
all i've got to say is
when you cant get reservations
and tell me cant you see you're everything to me
your jeans are playing peekaboo
i know the perfect little path
babe that aint what i want
i'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
it was time well wasted
but we laid on that couch
this world spins too fast if you let it
but i sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were makin
is it too black or too white
are there too many stars in the heavens at night
too country
a little bit of bedrock limestone in between
should you change your mind
'fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in may
well stanley wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
is all because two people fell in love
all that is will be or ever was
sittin on a bench at west town mall
didnt like a thing that i tried on
and i dont guess we've been anywhere
and that makes sense 'cause i know she wont be ready
that's when she walked in
chorus
and then one evenin
but the music played
and run my fingers through his mane
yeah when i get where i'm going
all these questions i cant answer
when i get where i'm going
refrain
she put him out like the burnin end of a midnight cigarette
we found him with his face down in the pillow
2nd chorus
there's an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer
i can still see everything just fine
that it was only yesterday
who needs pictures with a memory like mine
and here to stay is a new bird
chorus
when chapel bells are ringing all around
you're still there
it's like you're out of town
baby you dont have to
but i can be in love with you
i've been wrapped around her finger
i'm takin him to dinner sunday night
yes sir i love her very much
i think it's time to put a ring on the finger
i must admit i still dont understand
right now it's at home sittin on my tv
you've got more candles than a midnight mass
change the channel and drink the beer
baby there aint no doubt
and it's there i read on a hillside gravestone
and you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
who said we'd never leave harlan alive
where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
and he's long haired no job and just 19
the popparazi are gathered outside
right before we leave the ground
to hell with the odds we'd rather not know
and we can try out the four wheel drive
moonlight on a duck blind
repeat chorus
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
you wanna try it together sometime
so dont be spillin your stuff on me
so dont be spillin your stuff on me
a cigarette is all you get
a cigarette is all you get
a cigarette is all you get
and then comes a breeze in the evening
a worm's life can be easy
i gave the doctor my description
i've heard the rattle in my bronchi
and i'd come upon some rotting remains
and if i try hard i think that i will see
but still i'd like to think that there are better methods
here comes jane you know she's sportin a chain
and they love each other so androgynous
and tomorrow dick is wearing pants
and all i've ever seen will be forgotten
i hope they wont be too quick to begrudge me
and yet i'll recognise
and she'll be coming backsoon
but i will tolerate them even though i hate them
i am the cheap i'm right here now
i ring the bell and i do the dealing
we'll just go and not give any warning
come on and free up your hands
c'mon and give yourself a hand
i know you want to
he gathered up some people he had made
so he saidonce there was a boy
but god said nothing
and that was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
he yelled at him
i i i oh here i stand before me
my vital organs just churn away inside me
here on earth i'll have my cake
old st pete's gonna serve me my pie in the sky
how come all my body parts so nicely fit together
well looky here now my oh my
you're sayin c'mon baby
i like the way you play your tricks
i like the sugar it contains
i want to par tay p par tay
that's quite an after taste that you've left now that you're not around
it just makes it nicer when i do arrive
i consider what we could call the good life
i cant say i liked robinson crusoe
the sort who often fall ill young or pine away
went in books and even lectures
ha ha i'm outlived by that thing and stupid things like that
sometimes when i lie awake i hear the rainfall on my tent fly
who put the doggy in the doghouse
dont you try everything while i'm gone
keep your eye on things while i'm gone
keep your eye on things while i'm gone
he said that it was from when
mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm
but when i look down at their bodies
when we met it was in the hot green jungle
dawn would come and i would start to feel my own sunrise
the things to come may be somewhat unfamiliar
and then i'll squat down for a wash to end the day
our driver gestures out behind the palm trees
overachiever might be putting it mildly
fear struck and he threw up inside his helmet
all night long
i think i must have a double who's been frickin with me
all night long
and sometimes i despair the world will never see
sometimes when supe was stopping crimes
she'd stuff the bodies of dead little birds
swatting flies
i hope you'll understand
we could be happy in the country
we could be happy in the country
you'd shake their bony hands and so dispell the gloom
and demons come to plague me as i lie in bed
and then i hope you'll come over to the other side
she could not control them they kept her up nights
what does she think when she foretells a disease
we wont spend the rest of our lives together
people might think that we were on our honeymoon
if your toast gets stuck in the toaster
for example stop signs
between the toaster stop sign and my tonsils
he gets them drunk and gets their money
killing from his office desk
losing lots of blood
bail him out and buy him gin
they'd give them potions
they thought they were visions
i dont know which should be my favorite paintings
what if the artists ran the tv
but i hoped a trip into the country
and here were many years of winter drownings
that charlie sedarka was a playing the piano
you're nobody in this crowd
he said i appreciate beauty if i have one then
eyes were everywhere
the hour
and everyone's a prisoner of
and one of them is poisonous
what is your destiny the police woman said20 amnesia
dont let me lose heart
but it's only business
mister gorbachov came cap in hand 20 amnesia
chorus
you're sitting in the garage contemplating suicide
well how can i corrupt you
big nothing
the smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough there was too
big nothing repeat until fade
he used to be your victim
your mind is made up but your mouth is undone
until you're well hung
other times they thought they heard laughter
crickets played on a tape recorder
you were sharp and ideal as a bobby pin
that you are not impressed
did he leave your pretty fingers lying
my aim is true
alison i know this world is killing you
cause i cant stand to see you this way
all grown up
chorus
you wrote
baby cant you act your age
confession may delay
chorus
those days are recalled on the gallery wall
so she finds that the mixture is hard to deny
and our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
now your eyes are red from crying
almost you
for money like that
being swallowed by a clown
just american between tears
oh she seemed to be crying for year after year
on tv they prosecute anyone who's exciting
one had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend
newsreel commentators said cheerio gi brides
you turn to the sinister when you get the boot
oh heaven preserve us
and he asks her where she's been
i cant say more it would be telling
please dont put your silly head in that pretty soldier's hat
please dont put your silly head in that british soldier's hat
dont want the woman to adore me
just give me a promise that i'm supposed to keep now
i dont listen to a word they say i'm gonna love you any old way
to hold on to that girl i had to let her go
i walk the worn out floor
except she's picking your heart not mine
she used to meet me at the mens room before she learned how to be snide
and when she talks
well i asked my little baby for a kiss
did you teach this little child these curses on my soul
the tight lipped leer of judgement
swallowed sleeping pills like dreams
well here's a boy if ever there was
looking for the man who sold you the dummy
you go hand in glove
almost beaten to the punch
this battle with the bottle is nothing so novel
and now you find you fit this identikit completely
all the laddies cat call and wolf whistle
everything is so provocative
trying to become a fixture
i came alive and left for dead
she'll be the one when the girls have gone home
sheep to the slaughter
the prince of darkness stole some tart
she's got you playing russian roulette
all little sisters like to try on big sister's clothes
sweat it out for thirty seconds on home improvements
love for sale
if you want the thrill of love i've been through the mill of love
you can put your money where your mouth is
because he is the neighbourhood
you know i've never been corrupt
love went mad love went mad
a self made mug is hard to break
lamb dressed as mutton
lovers step shuffle and gamble
lovers slink up lovers charm
now love's limping on a lover's crutch
and now you look like a lover but you're only a tourist
you say that you love her when you really loathe her
somebody's soft touch
lying for a minister of state
with a tight grip on the short hairs
retire sharp and short
now there's newsprint all over your face
if i say i love you then i must be delirious
having a heart attack round your ankles
i could tell you that i like your sensitivity
and i'm doing everything just tryin to please her
i just dont know how you stand the strain
her bloodless face ran red inside but was she
well how can you miss what you've never possessed
sometimes people are just what they appear to be
hercules lives
i walk in their brilliant parade
miss mary i try not to doubt you
and dress you up in blue
moods for moderns x4
soon you'll belong to someone else
moods for moderns
falling for you without a second look
all the pavements for miles around are littered with your footprints
why did you have to leave me
what is it that brings you to this part of town
must you keep telling me that you've got a new love
told me how much you dont want me
mccartneymacmanus
now i dont have to tell anybody
my brave my brave my brave face
the simplest things set me off again
my dark life
you dont know
your dreams
these
enter the pious elite
it doesnt bring in
as he tipped her in
position
all the cream of
your looks are laughable unphotographable
my science fiction twin
with every intention of surrendering
with tattered pictures of her daughter
better stamp his little feet
they asked how in the world he does all these things
but when the day is through
my world just seemed to die
you break into my dreams
i know it's over
you can take all i have left
dont tell me you dont know what love is
three
with my pen and my electric typewriter
that unhappy blade you both invite
chorus
chorus
chorus
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
he said it was nothingit's over and done
innocently spun her rolodex
for other eyes
if you look like you my pretty miss
to forgive her anything
so where did all my pride go
please dont leave me waitin too long
chorus
oh i got a little heart inside me beating
hey sweet baby oh dont you know that i am yours from head to toe
well heaven knows what fills the heart and makes you feel so alive
her rival would always wait 'til the eighth or ninth bell
the radio plays a lover's symphony
you played me for a fool find yourself another fool
and i'm gonna move all out of your heart
stop wasting my time
i'm gonna find another heart
too crowded for me getting mighty crowded
roll up for the ghost train
laughing and singing dressed up like dice
step right up and show your face
roll up for the ghost train
oh i just want to hear girls talk
stick that you're dedicated
enter madam x painted in a shocking pink spangled dress
are looking in on you
and to live my life in miserable poverty
little white flowers will never awaken you
with the last breath of my heart i'll be blessing you
and if i'm strong i might still break
and i'm lost in imagining
fracture the spell as he she becomes my enemy
he she was the light that i'd bless
toughen up toughen up
the talk is two faced and the rules are rigid 'cause it's strict time
strict time
if we could spend an evening now then
that's when she'll arrive
though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
listen now
can you believe it's happening
your suffering face
it's just my alibi i'm all broken up inside
in the steam fading on my bathroom mirror
while nat king cole sings welcome to my world
and they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
or let him go
and think of all the pleasure that it brings
and they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
the carnal and cunning she couldnt express
so she dyed her hair and adopted another name
but while the chance appears
between cruelty and beauty
suddenly you're talking like a duchess
beat up strangers who talk funny
but sunday's best
sunday's best sunday's finest
put them all in boots and khaki
instead i'm having sweet dreams all about you
in the hour of distress you need not fear
that made you want to run away
why dont you lay your head down
and it's really just a silly fragment of paper
you'll be taking my life in your hands
reach you
we can talk like we're in love or talk like we're above it
think back now when we were young
unwrapping presents that i should have sent
what if we never learn from our mistakes
close the door dim the lights blow out the candles
unwrapping presents that i should have sent
so happy birthday again
how wrong can i be before i am right
and the balance of our love
he's living under threat of arrest
i see you lying so wide awake
give me temptation
how come everybody wants to be your friend
that's what you get if you go chasing after vengeance
anybody wanna swallow me
well if you only knew the things you do to me
see your friends walking down the street
i just wanna be your victim
see your friends despite all the arrangements
and i'm thankful that i didnt open another bottle of inspiration
but sooner or later you're gonna face the big light
there will be tears and candles
it's too much to say
now i know somehow i dont feel so alone
and sometimes he sings to me a mocking bird in the twilight of infamy
meanwhile in the motor car kingdom
instead of these comedians
to another faceless backless dress
schnapps chianti porter and ouzo
for the secret life of frank sinatra
you know what my guess is
but back in the bedroom
but i still refused to believe
eternally yours
you see i had to be the first to leave
when you're lying in your coffin
when you're lying in your coffin
when you're lying in your coffin
while all the time in the camptown theatres of piccadilly
they'll be sending him round from door to door
it's like another world or it had better be
touch and go
choose your hypocrite
the crowd would hoot and holler for more
i was scared i was scared i was scared i was scared
i'm going to take a little trip down paradise's endless shores
i'm going up to the pole where you folks die of cold
he's planting a trashy paperback book for accidental purchase
for their tears
hurry down doomsday the bugs are taking over
hurry down doomsday the bugs are taking over
where passion is squandered and money is spent
it's not the days when you leave me
time we broke up
with your contempt for any modesty
in a love field
where things can be arranged
she's so tense but it's never mentioned
and i'm still mystified
you can see those pictures in any magazine
she was selling stolen kisses to travelling salesmen and minstrel singers
bare wires from the socket to the bed where you embraced that girl
when you've squandered all you've earned
get off work and see my baby
there's a stranger in the house nobody's seen his face
there's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
the flirting kind
the flirting kind
for a man tone deaf
chorus
the irritating jingle
he's yelling in her ear
it's the small humiliations that your memory piles up
are tranquillized and tamed
'cause something deep inside me wants to turn you black and blue
hope you dont murder me
dont send any money
or just possibly scare you to death
a twister or dupe will bamboozle or hoodwink you
and woebetide anyone so woebegone
your trouble will vanish
just sign on the line could you possibly write it in blood
now can they recall being young and idealistic
and have mercy on the creatures in this sad burlesque
'cause she's this year's girl
a bright spark might corner the market
all this but no surprises for this year's girl
tiny fingers you almost feel
oh she's almost human beneath that cuban heel
tiny fingers you almost feel
they put the slum into slumber and the boot into beauty
i can count you out
chorus what do we care if the world is a joke
whistles out the tuneless theme song on a hundred cheap suggestions
in a tango bar in stanley or in puerto margarita
while fountains fill with second hand perfume
chorus
know that their name hasnt travelled very well
sunshine and lovers pass by
dream of that spanish citadel
we dont have paris and we dont have rome
it let your memory come around
tonight the bottle let me down
hurt you or make you feel blue
with a lifetime to go
and suddenly you really fall to pieces
long suffering friends of your fatal charm
i pray the lord my soul to save
well i hope that she sleeps well at night isnt
and then expect you to say thank you straighten up look proud and pleased
they'll stand there laughing and tramp the dirt down
pictures plastered on the ivy creeper between your old toy soldiers
turning the town red aah
or a temporary wedding
crowds surround loudspeakers
i was committed to life
i'm up late pacing the floor
just like a nitwit
you make a member of me
and i'm the great dictator
i knew right from the start
all those he's better than
and they gave me rose' wine
how i love you
and now i'll never be another unwanted number
mama says that he just doesnt care to remember
when he wouldnt leave
unwanted number
he's prepared to read your mind
i wonder how he knows
chorus
well it was all of sixty five years ago
very quiet and still
everyone was looking for a little entertainment
dear lord i sincerely hope you're coming
waiting for the end of the world
i'm throwing the dice in the air
and you go and try to walk across the lake
you better watch your step
they say it's good for business
when you're kicking in the cot room
you better watch your step
they beat him up until the teardrops start
chorus
dont get cute
she is watching the detectives
you snatch tune you a match a cigarette
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
thank you for the flowers
she said that he looked like the devil
though i almost had a weakness
now i've lived with heartaches
i cant stand up for falling down
even though i've seen the movie
one's named gus one's named alfie
she gave a little flirt gave herself a little cuddle
he's a fine figure of a man and handsome too
he's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after
in my reluctance seems a surprise
they're never worth the crying
tell me how i can advise someone that i dont even know
so i'm writing to people that i may never meet
i once held her
i never knew what i had
who gives you all of her love
kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit
kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit
when so many people pass me by
a foolish man for a lot of my life
laid on a decorated dish
i'm trying my best to make it dark
i dont think i can live without you
i want you
i want you
i want you
i'm afraid i wont know where to stop
did you call his name out as he held you down
i want you
i hate the buttons on your shirt when all i wanna do is tear
and i wear it like a badge that you put all over my face
and a handful of eagerness says what do you suggest
i know where but i dont care
to do the things you're doing now
but i dont want no one but you to love me
you know i'm not that kind of guy
i'll go out of my mind if i'm losing your touch
i'll go out of my mind if i'm losing your touch
a head full of daydreams his hands full of material
the imperial bedroom the regal boudoir
i know
i've been very gloomy
saying try to find another lover
lets start again
you can keep the shrink
like a lady in the chamber
you can pull me up again
you thought you were so smart
chorus
you were the spice of life
these things have to be faced
dont want to be treated like some poor grateful clown
no pool no pets no cigarettes
with one head for business and another for good looks
chorus
you're very colourful with your compliments
i thought she was young
it's under the table
i dont have a clue
chorus
dont blame it on me
coast to coast hand in hand
when they step on your face
and you say that it's you that she's thinking of
when she's barely awake
and next minute you can find yourself kneeling
you were just in the way
pull the curtains on me and you
came home drunk
where they pour coca cola just like vintage wine
it was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use
now he's a brilliant mistake
i was a fine idea at the time
if i am blinded i'll have my voices still to guide me
my world just seemed to stop as i stood there so close to you
so you think that you have seen her
service stations
automatic
now you've given your performance
you want to kiss her
a girl with a trick and a man with a calling
hardly speaking sotto voce
and the noise infernal
well how could you believe i'll take you seriously
well how could you believe i'd take you seriously
are you ready for the final solution oh oh
ready to experiment you're ready to be burned
so here they are in the departure lounge
it starts with a slap and ends up with a kiss
though he only taught her three little words it
clean money clean money
'cause he is the neighborhood
have you made your selection
and hang you up with some amber beads
there was a clown strike
but all that seems a simple step
or are you terrified of failure
you dont have to tumble for me
somebody's watching where the others dont walk
who's making lover's lane safe again for lovers
clowntime is over
chorus
the mums and dads
the long arm of the law slides up the outskirts of town
some things come in common these days
you lack lust you're so lacklustre
possession
and then you put me down
the fool that i am
you're pouring water
then you leave me in the cold
you're pouring water
civil disobedience from a soldier with a dirty rifle
'till you dont know what's what
just cartoons and titter tatter
'cause my head is killing me
oh dont hand me johnny's pup mama
you think i'm psycho dont you mama
you think i'm psycho dont you mama
turn it down a little bit
pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up until you can feel it
pump it up when you dont really need it
oh forget the reason
i think that it's time to turn over
the pointless heartache
doing anything my radio advised
but they dont give you any choice
and the promise of an early death
radio radio
hide your love hide your love
play one more for my radio sweetheart
i'm the one that needs you i love you constantly
he will break your heart if you go with him
from my heart little girl
i just dont think you care
completely surrender
knowing my love is shared
and the talk gets so topical
now it looks like you're either gonna be for me or against me
i stood there stupefied i thought i recognized
and then i left you alone
all the way down repeat to fade
send me a message my sweetheart
ceiling
hiding something they cant show
as he went to fetch his keys
and why the numbers ran from twelve
no vacancy as you take your key
and all the lies upon the tongues of all the girls upon the rails
i suppose you're a winner
your goodbye was even colder than ice
then i'm gonna hang right up on you
he's so mad about this girl tonight
but no where is sad as the girls in the night
champagne rolls off her tongue like a second language
he muttered words he'd never dare to say if she could see him
she went back to a pitiful compromise he'd go back to his family
down in the basement
is it pleasure or business
feeling nothing and caring less
are really only ancient history
you didnt do it for love you didnt even do it with stealth
and the lucky girl leads a life of leisure
though it may be second hand
the way that i could benefit from death and disability
from the arms of his bride to be
who's the butcher that you harbour
whose name shall we cherish
say here lies the great unknown
said we cant afford to feel affection
but i wont be told that life with the one you love is sordid
and it's the greatest
you've never been this far
when you want him double jointed
and you wish she could step down from the screen to your seat in the stalls
listening to the murder mystery
why must i apologize every time that i sit down to write
i'll go one better i heard myself say
and almost change your sad expression
there's nothing left over
can it be so hard to calculate
so ask yourself
can we still be friends
but there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight
if he's out on a date then her life's in ruins
he snaps back just like elastic
now you're a danger to yourself
the butcher the baker and the bassline maker
dont pin a medal on me yet
she's not the only flame in town
you'd be less tender and more tinder
you're not the only flame in town
you'll see me off in the distance i hope
lie down baby now dont say a word
i know it dont make a difference to you
felt tragic without reason
a teenage girl is crying 'cos she dont look like a million dollars
madman standing by the side of the road saying
an unwanted birthday
telling tales of the underground and
of the policemen in the fountains
he paid to have you painted in the company of angels
the stamping ground
the barman pretends that he's saved you a place
going home with the same jokes
say it's very nice to know you
the stamping ground
still hang around
after i said how can we continue
you knocked me out
then you better go to him
words start to fly my glass jaw and i
so if you're going
that's everything
the mere idea of you
the family circle gathers 'round from very far and near
the kissing cousins step outside to cuddle and confess
come the sentimental feelings for the lure of vitriol
this is the life
between mum and the walls
when they let you in you'll find there's no way out
when they let you in you'll find there's no way out
of broken hearts
there wont be anymore it wont be like before
oh they'll never never take her love from me
but i knew her love would never set me free
in the window up above for long
do you recognize the face
about the darkness
this house is empty now
the night that i wont forget
and broke my heart in two
chorus
they're laughing like drains
oh the jack of all parades
and you cant keep your peace
and the world walked 'round my mouth
or the jack of all parades
so you'll just have to come out and face the music
will we both incinerate
the children sit upon the stairs
like an old bus ticket or a photograph
dont let them see you crying that way oh no
dont let them see you crying that way
cant trust the promise or a guarantee
candidate talkin on the radio from the cheaters jamboree
'cause the man 'round the curve says that he's never heard
better take another measure for measure
memories dont mean that much to me
i'm just about glad
they called time and vodka and lime
but her lamp was just beginning to dim
chorus
she's telling all of those lies
sometimes he takes himself so seriously
i want to be a kid again about it
there's a stone washed damsel on a junk food run
it's a kinder murder
she could have kept her knees together
the knickers in her handbag and the one false eyelash
sniggering in your beer
a lot of loose exchanges precious little respect
if i ever lose this good thing that i've got
all recognize my handwriting
the moguls want a human sacrifice
i hear the clatter of a typewriter
they took his pride
we're not going to sail tonight
so hush now my darling my sweet little one
you better leave my kitten all alone
i'm gonna hit you
that girls gonna miss you
you better leave
no your father wont know
a pistol was still smoking a man lay on the floor
let him dangle
though guilty was the verdict and craig had shot him dead
but the word never came the phone never rang
let him dangle string him up
have we come this fa fa fa to find a soul cliche
whose tongue now is tasting last week's flavour
you better not do anything reckless
these are dangerous amusements
you can send a little letter to me
not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
you wanna throw me away but i'm not broken
my poor belated chastity fell foul of grown up games
chorus
in chocolate town all the trains are painted brown
and they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces
the sedated homes of england are theirs to vandalize
i would have waited all my life
actions speak louder now than words
when you dont call up
when you say ok but i gotta cheek to be
here we are living in paradise
saying 'we'd always knew you'd make it
but i'll be at the video and i will be watching
that broadcasts a popular song
you feel guilty desiring such an innocent face
especially at twilight
i'm having the time of my life
and now they're not the only ones
you're so lovable
chorus
the toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom
the movies save on conversation
three little words roll off your tongue
oh what a letdown when the battle was finally won
instrumental
but if they knew how i felt they'd bury me alive
why d'you wanna be my friend when i feel like a juggler
or did you think she was a different girl
is her hair hanging down
oh why did you decide that
now that she's hung up like a chandelier
and each time i feel like this inside
sweet harmony
what's so funny 'bout peace love understanding ohhhh
chorus
oooh ooh
oooh ooh
when he goes through your head
little heart
who do you think you are
must he be burdened by all that he's taught to consider his own
repeating their offer to each girl they meet
why dont you love me like you used to do
aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin in a long long while
will you take care of me
come on down the price is right what's your name
they commit blue murder along union avenue
you've seen the film you've read the book
i dont want to hear another word about young lovers
saying 'you belong to me you belong to me'
i'd promise you now and again that i'd honour the contract
and so you parade where appointments are made
and now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria
you bowed down
but with the bird in his hand
mother just gives her some pills to choose
you little fool
how i've been tempted
you looked so deadly
darkness would become me underneath the table
and if you dont believe me
you need protection from the physical art of conversation
when you're half a woman and you're half awake
bridge and chorus
it's any place where there's music and a free drink from him
with just a shabby doll
there's always a girl in distress
with just a shabby doll
he's just a shabby doll
late friday night when the bars are all shuttered and dark
they'll never know the ways of the world
they flop on the beach
and leave me for days and days and days and days and days
nobody gets out of this alive
we've forgotten the things strangers do
must we be shamed into love
but i always return to your face
four walls and a roof
four walls and a roof
forget about the broken spectacles
soon we'll be shipbuilding
when we could be diving for pearls
this love of mine is packed with stepping stone
i thought i'd spend a pace and go the distance
cigarettes 'cause you watch him walk away from you
but when she's finished i know
now somebody has to pay for the one who got away
and he got hit by an emotional ricochet
i know the same thing has happened before
'cause when i'm drinkin i am nobody's friend
well it was a powerful day and there were black crows in the road
now she's pinned up upon the barracks wall in her home town
somehow through the day
through the sleepless nights
now everybody's breakin up somebody else's home
why dont we call it a day and we can both confess
and it's so like candy
here lies a picture of a girl
but that's so like candy
she couldnt say goodbye but i admire your taste
we've got them hangin on a string
so young so young
something about you is not the same
they took the girl of my dreams and left you here instead
put your fingertips up to the screen
that's when they'll fear my name
in a room called creation where you all obey my laws
between the pity and advice
i'd drop out of sight and disappear turn up in another town but somehow
mingling with the sweet smoldering scent of the martyr
sometimes you bring me down to play reluctant confidant
you've still got your dignity or the next best disguise
what can i say
and it's still too soon to know
how many crumbs in bed
how many chewings in gum
and how deep is his bite
strange i'm gonna leave you alone gonna leave you like this
clock all the faces that move in on your block
chorus
they're all covered up with white washed grease paint
with their continental fingers that have
chorus
but i'll be underground
have you got too much pride
and the corporation logo is flashing on and off in the sky
oh i know that i'm ungrateful
wait until they've got you running to the
it'll all start happening then
so when it's way past nine get ready for a swinging time
i dont wanna see you 'cause i dont miss you that much
he's got ev'rything you need
has mad a fool of him
there's gonna be no dancing on my own
he's getting down on his knees
so know you see
while i'm putting the world to right
when you've been on the murder mile
it's a professional career
opportunity opportunity
she said when they get to dover they'll be be taking over
please dont turn around
and you're fool enough to start
you make bad jokes you make bad time
so get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel
but he's so surprised he's alive
'til he's drinking hairspray she knows that he never would dare
those eyes i tried to capture
and so this had to be
and so this had to be
seen 'em leaving when the party's over
maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
i would give you anything
one of these days
i wouldnt say that i was raised on romance
and loud in your dress of blue
it feels so funny having all of this money
and the drunk down druged up crowd
but we all cheered wildly a photograph was taken
you're still a part of some conspiracy
international propaganda star wars
shorthand makes life easy
i believe i trust i promise i wish love's just a throwaway kiss
money talks diamonds and ermine
and the camera noses in to the tears on her face
give me the rope
they come from lovely people with a hard line in hypocrisy
just what it's like now you're a mess
turn you from a playboy into a man
would drag you down and now that the joke's on you
would you walk out the door
you took me away from the rest of the world
would you hurt all my pride
but money's rolling out of town
you've gotta use your imagination on some of that magazine romance
is all i can win
the piece of your heart
the poisoned rose
i threw myself upon the floor
to keep her out all night
those super 8 movies of daddy in your disco dresses
that lives on that lives on that lives on
so you're flogging a dead horse
he's screaming some words at the top of his lungs
i'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden
since he punched a hole in the fabric
the bluebird singin in the trees
that i sing since you've been gone
when you should have found someone to put the blame on
sometimes justice you will find
take the law into your hands
the wilted favour that he gave her still fastened to the frame
who composed this tune
and slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny
you had better not go too far
leave your mother and your father
and how it's always another day
i heard that you fell for the hell or to hammersmith blues
like going down three times to only come up twice
i wasted my time when i would try try try
you stay a little while and then you're gone again
did anybody notice over marmalade and eggs
chorus
the speak up quickly
i suppose we live and learn though it's hard to believe as we
stop press they've just decided to destroy it
i had to let her down easy as slow as i could
i'm thinking of the days
but it's alright
i bless the light that shines on you believe me
those endless days those sacred days you gave me
with all of my promise unfulfilled
i am not leaving you with all of your problems
a deep dark truthful mirror
but you're never in any doubt there's something happening somewhere
you'll stretch him out like a saint
chorus
'cause i know the things they're saying are right
'cause they seem to cover ev'ry move i make
and lions left to tame
that brags for rags and jewels
will leave you as you need it most
now i just dont know who to tell to go to hell
under the shadow of the distorted angel
when things go wrong i seem to be mad
that i never mean to take it out on you
dont you wish you knew what they were sayin
oh he's doctor luther's assistant
doctor luther's assistant
many blooms still linger there
havent said
it's been a good year for the roses
goon squad
for everything you see
with one eye on the clock
and she takes all the red yellow orange and green
she's picking out names
you tease and you flirt
you say you just wanna use me oh
dont you know i got the bully boys out
i wont ask you to forgive me
she's heard some of those small town playboys but this is something new
you're so hard to tell the truth to
but you dont know who you are
singing ave maria
of your checquered cab
in your fits and starts
sit down sit down sit down sit down
i got your memory or has it got me
the only thing different the only thing new
her voice is so soft
brings out all of your
when i hold you
did you really think i was a bad man
till you know my hidden shame you really dont know me
but the days and weeks get long
and all at once he lay there broken
even though you're feeling like another man
maybe i got above my station
here comes mr misery
oh and you cant sleep at night
you hang your head
or maybe it was yawning
this is where the home truth ends
this is where the home truth ends
is it my shirt or my toothpaste
i got news for ya baby you aint nothin but an alley cat
talkin 'bout the splendour of the hoover factory

love would tear you apart
the light just radiates
because i wasnt feeling well and i told them
but the exposure thing wasnt right
from down the hall near the stairs
gee that must be fun
which was so strange
and then i saw john cale
let's face it
and i dont understand about that velvet's first album
it would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
could have at least called
i was so scared today
'couse they ran out or veins
and nobody called
after you've had me you know that you've had the best
i'm just a gift to the women of this world
never really learned how to dance
guess it's true what all these people they say
you're a queen reborn
your voice perfectly turning
when what you really want's a muse
that could cause your cerebral cortex
differentiating scheming from my one true love
you redefine the locus of your time in space race
i anticipate some grieving
my adventuress
all through the night
and the novels written and the book is done
feel so sad i cried all through the night
give a little loving and some peace of mind
i want to have it all through the night
i would be a bat and come
if i could be any one of the things
and stones are all erupting out for you
now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose
miss riley had a dog

when i think of you baton rouge
well i once had a car lost it in a divorce
of malicious intent and you as poor poor me
that's what marriage came to mean
so helpless
so thanks for the card the announcement of child
so helpless
it's not good trying to immortalize yourself
as long as i dont have to try too much
i hope this baby thing dont go too far
and keep me company when i'm a wizened toothless clod
she says babe how you call your lover boy
se
you were five foot ten inches tall
oh you're right and i'm wrong
it was very nice
oh one sweet day
her mother was like steel
betrayed by her fragile vicious beauty
but she's looking right past me
big sky big sky holding up the moon
but it cant hold us down anymore
a big room it holds you and me
they cant hold us down anymore
big sky
and no one could figure out which one of us was the fool
when he came back he wasnt quite the same
and i pass the gravel on the foot of the hill
my doctor says she hopes i know
bottoming out
bottoming out
you cant depend on a beginning
you can depend on the worst always happening
busload of faith to get by baby
busload of faith to get by
you can depend on the worst always happening
or cruel or oh so it seems

you're going to reap just what you sow
i want to dance with you
when your people first moved to our block
i was visited by a majestic hymn
all of it
all of it
all trying to explain this
trying to stop the cancerous spread
as the radiation flowed through him
i was seized by divinity's hot breath
in the jungles of the amazon
cancer reduce him to dust
all of it not some of it
and gold being made from lead
all of it not just some of it
na na na na na na na na na na na na

she's out of her mind
she's out of her mind riptide
what you gonna do with your emotions
like a hurricane's rain
out with the tide
where they danced to the rock minuet
his leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
when they danced to the rock minuet
you could dance to the rock minuet
one fine mornin she puts on a new york station
jenny said when she was just five years old
it was all right
she started dancing to that fine fine music
baby baby ooohhh
inside his pants he hides a mop
he's thinking of his lonely room
brother give me another tote
i'll take manhattan in a garbage bag
and then it vanished and was gone
a few drops of rain
there's no one at home
i'm gonna stop wastin my time
sad song sad song
and eats natural food at my place
sally cant dance no more ooohhh
now she wears a sword like napoleon
and that's where she used to ball folk singers
she danced with picasso's illegitimate mistress
sally cant dance sally cant dance

your mind's a cage inside the cage a rat
when a night city's breeze blows across the room

stained signature of nightmares
and sometimes when a thousand voices

cushioned by the wasting

expensive spare parts

say yes to a real life ambition say yes to our hopes and our plans
16 million i cant hear you at all
moginiegarrett
you cant hide nowhere with the torchlight on

i've come to turn your world around
who strangled and wrestled the ground
i'm on the winter cycle shake my fist at the bite
i'm on the edge of danger and i'll run by night
so deaf to the call of the wild
the shepherd has been bound up by his hands and his feet
i could kill for this one time and not be caught
for cats to sleep
then i'll stop the games
dingos howl and white flags fly
sell my soul to him
america's great now
the harlot and the autocrat are they driving you further down
coastline hosed down washed away economics now there's nothing left
became the sunset of our lives
clever not very wise
conquistador of mexico the zulu and the navaho
they're only there to lend a hand short memory
on the fringes of torso and lips
it's a sometimes leading into future time
and i feel like we're coming around
checkpoint for the state of the nation
writing on walls
moginiehirstgarrett
cracking me up pressure brought to bear
strike a bell in hiroshima park
the human jungle and the global zoo
dont even know where it is
if you're out of transmission way out on the road
it's in the clear blue sky
out in the dead heart tourists and cameras
and we can hope
everything's neat avoiding the heat
the rising sun sent him floating to his rest
in the valley i walk who will take me there
in the valley i walk to meet my watershed
he wears a matching suit steel tipped shoes and the diamonds
you better look out beware
lost the thread of conversation
their days are darker than your nights
the days are wasted drinking
but still the crowd calls out for more
well you can say you're peter say you're paul
down the road at a familiar place across the wilderness
at the best hotel of all
a thousand dreams it's getting late
i'll be hitching pacific when the morning suns up
i hope it never ends
the settlements explode
now they want to be somewhere else
now the fires begin to rage

moginiegarrett
truth gets harder to define
set up those gunsights in hg wells backyard
mountains of burma the road to mandalay
soldiers of armies storm empty fields
and did i hear you say
my country oh so strong
and did i hear you say
i've seen the naked flame
i've seen the naked flame
more than we deserve
used to be simple but look what it's become
waste passion and wasted mind
and in my world
better to ignore the rabid dog baying at your door
and i thank god for that but there's needles in the sand
rises in rivers in power of the sun
suitcase full of good ideas history that's filled with tears
now every man must be what his life can be
who wants to sit around turn it up turn it down
he took advantage like the spider helpless
one too many times
i'm at the edge of myself i'm dying to talk
i say the silence of the ribbons of iron and steel
but you dont give in
getting fatter and fatter and splitting their jeans
goodbye to the let it happen stand
star of hope star of glory
star of hope star of glory

water shapes

to secede
you keep running from the wheel
women and men who have fallen silent
i'm gonna wait till we reach the sky
super computer the new contraband
farmers are hanging on by their fingertips
and i hope you're not beaten yet
there is room for make believe out in the ocean

waiting for the next big thing
superboy takes a plutonium wife
family and friends
i was fooled into thinking the paper in my pocket was real
this the crown land
dont drink by the water hole
this land dont change this land must lie
this land must change or land must burn
and it makes me shake makes me shake with rage
and they live so fast and they die so young
you got everything to live for
but they die so young
such a hopeless game
what goes on
but you die so young
they're taken for a ride
with the certain satisfaction
you gonna leave us lying here
when you feel it when you feel it
dripping
white skin black heart
yes i feel that i
when the first fleet chain sailed in
one by one now they block my sun
when there's a dollar to be made

and when the weather's warmer you can hear me shouting yeah
ignorance is bliss havent you heard
the headline still rules the editor's a fool
but we're ready from within and we're starting to go
if we surrender ourself to industrial rules
and send it coughing to eternity
blackened hands and heart of steel

for he still smiles and he's still strong
oh i'll be sleeping by myself tonight
oh i close my eyes and wait for a sign
i'll be sleeping by myself
even out it's a precious thing to bear
and i know she's reached my heart in thin air
once upon a time i could control myself
once upon a time i could lose myself
you cant know how it feels to be in here
i make the others run and hide
stare
you're always wishing and
cause when we're dead
all the feelings i'm needing
i'll travel there on my own
and though he's too big a man to say
my shadow left me long ago
to and fro the pendulum throws
looking up looking all around
running to
and initiatives are taken up
hold my hand
i just want to be
makes much more sense to live in the present tense
p r i v a c y is priceless to me
the oceans made me but who came up with love
push me pull me
the oceans made me but who came up with love
push me pull me
i've had enough said enough felt enough i'm fine now
they dont scurry when something bigger comes their way
dont shit where they're not supposed to
it's time i came to get mine
nowhere to run when my dog's on the prow
aint nothin but the hill
when i hang with stone and i kick that funky slang
i couldnt breathe holding me down
saw things x4 clearer x2
i was not allowed to leave the room
hovering just above your bed x2
windowsill
i'll hold the pain
release me
all the stars and everyone
and there is no god with a plan
it's sad he could only love you
it's not all been said been said and done
who made who made up made up the myth that we were born to be covered in bliss
never shook satans hand look see for yourself
gonna save you fuckernot gonna lose you
let's pick up your will it's grown fat and lazy
and fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
i've no fear but for falling down
understand i'm not falling down
once dissolved we are free to grow
to breathe and reach across the bed
with the ever after
oh its a fragile thing this life we lead
want you to know
i have not been home since you left long ago
i wish that i could hold you
no matter how cold the winter there's a springtime ahead
little secrets tremors turned to quake
puts his faith and love in tremor christ
it might be your needs it could be your eyes

it's a wave building before it breaks
on his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
near to death uh oh oh oh uh oh oh oh

an echo that rings a bullet unchained
and the roads exploding
with no one knowing

it's hardened up your heart
and the family puzzlin
puzzling sometimes evidence
got a reciever inside my head
we're gonna leave the land of noise
i hear ev'rything you're thinking
i was getting kinda tired of her endless chatter
i knew somewhere amid all this distraction
the look she shot me through the glass refraction
get on down to the main attraction
you were too good to be true
a little too tired of just hangin on
would take you back every time
im a little too gone
its a little too late
are traces of the man i used to be
what my heart needs is a womans touch
oh you're not so sure that you're in love anymore
aint it just like me to let you walk away
so i let you on in and i'm hopin
aint it just like you to make me feel this way
or give that child away
aint no right way
chorus
trying to pass a law
you can justify
i always thought she would
but it only made it hurt
'cause i know it aint no thang
but you cant buy the biggest wish of mine
and send them to santa claus
that's the best that you can do
a heart so sweet and true
everything to everyone
and sometimes all night long
beside my brothers and my sisters i will proudly take a stand
meet my twin sister betty lou
but there was a time back in my prime
got in a tight spot hustlin a game of pool
but there was a time back in my prime
but my pride says oh yes you can
but i'm as good once as i ever was
she was lookin at my feet
make a pretty woman look down each time
on god's green earth'
they're the baddest boots on the boulevard
they didnt get too far
when the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
christmas eve in birmingham
mary's hurtin joe prays to god for a helping hand
so away in the stables lay mary the baby and joe
'cause tonight i might need it
yeah dont laugh it's been two months i still got it
all the man that she'll ever need
hey daddy
sayin the girls start shaking everything they got
if your girl starts acting like she is one of a kind ya grab the next one standin at the head of line
let's roll
chrome steel bumpers and red step side
it was built to run she was built to show
yeah i'm in love with the girl in the four wheel drive
it's a big ol truck
i'm not sure what happened then
i woke up she was wrappin gifts beneath the tree
change my holiday like this
you'll hang a north up to santa fe
if you find that love is what you're needing
baby you're still everywhere
the people came here from parts unknown
pocket full of cash instead of chump change
the fools packed up and moved away
need a good home just give me a holler
i'd hook you up get you through it
i'm just the guy to do it
oh but if you need a hero for tonight i can be the one let me prove it
and im throwin
knock yourself out
i thought i had to play each part
i still make a mistake or two
it's clear to me now i was a fool
life was a play and the world a stage
i've got good taste for blended whiskey
you havent said it's over yet
every night i pray for peace on earth
but i bring my better angels to every fight
pre chorus
and lucky me i've got room to breathe
with her out of my way i'm not crowded anymore
lucky me i've got room to breathe
pickin me up and dustin me off
how much i still depend on you
mama come quick you know too well
i never thought that little street could ever look so good
i guess it's time i got up and took myself back home
to spend a little time with you on this special night
i want you to know why i do what i do
and i break the silence by kissin your cheek
me too me too
pick up a long lost friend of mine
it's time that i make time for that
show her what she means to me
he said where you headed to girl where are you coming from
when she dropped the kids off at the mother's day out
cause i'm here to take you home
new orleans that's another time
i recall on summer night at a party
we partied through college acquired some knowledge
he said i fallen in love with a waitress
yeah we were boys who made a lot of noise
better hide your horses bury your whiskey
cause there aint no right or wrong nothing's carved in stone
love's a deck of cards read them and weep
and i almost forgot
you're skating on thin ice
and she still does
she's already gone
it's just not my style
we started talkin 'bout gettin real close
i just dont like to pick 'em up and lay 'em down
i just dont like to pick 'em up and lay 'em down
i used to run with the big dogs 'til i stretched out on your front porch
i used to howl at the moon yeah i've been known to roam
and the sad man standin at the door says the place is full of broken hearts
if you're hear to see the lonely if you're hear to see the lonely
frost on the window snow on the ground
in ways we'd never thought of
while we were waiting up
oh what a night
every kiss bittersweet and tender
i'm gonna laugh until i dont cry honey 'cause
i dare you to call me
they call themselves the taliban
we should do just fine out around palestine or maybe turkmenistan
sons of bitches you better not be doin any business with the taliban
we should do real fine out around palestine or maybe turkmenistan
i've been doing without
i believe it's time for me to ride
my name is jackson i was named after my father
no rest for the weary ya just move on
she said i'm tired woke up tired
you cant where you been
a little too far this time
a little too far this time
i'd never leave you behind
and you're not quite sure
in a world where a heart could never shatter
we can always always say goodbye
we might go down cryin
it's gonna get bad before it gets better
you can cry and cry but he still wont call
she said goodbye at the cattle guard gate
she's getting out while the getting's good
life's too short to be hanging around
living upstairs downtown
and today might be the hardest day
was it just my wishful thinkin
but the fourteenth of february
but when her kids go to school and her husband's gone too
it's pta meetings warm social greetings
well she's got her children to raise that's why she cant let it show
and all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
and all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
and oh how those nights went flowing like wine
now we learned a hard lesson in a small texas town
we hopped on his old bus the honeysuckel rose
in the fetal position with drool on my chin
or did he know about the way he would die
did she know the world was filled with pain
dont you know the world is still in pain
it just feels like a memory
how are we gonna let go of something that's gone
who'll be the one
and who'll be the one to stay
an a sleepy voice whispered as he turned out the light
he'd run out money he'd run of luck
someone who loves you like i do
you know you're never gonna find
hey we're going out dancin she's ready tonight
just aint enough good burn in taquilla
just sittin there singin every song on the radio
puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole
they walk right in and sit right down
driving from work in our ordinary cars
but we just punched out and its paycheck friday
and when the going gets tough well the tough get going to the little bar down the road
my baby just left home i didnt treat her right
if it takes me all night long i'm gonna get my drink on
oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
baby if you're good to go we'll go down to mexico
baby if you're good to go we'll go down to mexico
with the gringos and the touristas
i took your leaving with a grain of salt
i need to catch a few zs
me and the boys went out and had a real good time
here you come a runnin
i know your head is turnin
come on baby let's get started
if you need someone to hold you
ooh the boy aint worth missin
i know your heart is burnin
just like me we keep her on her toes a lot
he'll grow to be six foot three
he knows that she's done her part
out under the stars and the moon
about six months ago
the fairytale ending i thought it might be
i know i should have gone home but i was doin that caribbean thing
well there was silence at the end of the line
hello if you give me just a minute
hello
but buddy what do you expect
she's my beauty queen
if your washer and dryer in need of repair
chorus 2
see my baby doll
you're lookin at me
hold you kiss you love you
just close your eyes
hold you kiss you love you
i'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
every corn dog fair and rodeo
as long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd
he was standin at the front door givin candy canes away
it's the fastest highest flyin winter wonderland machine
is that he might be here just long before the children get to sleep
i broke into the stadium
how do you like me now
then you married into money girl
how do you like me now
was a little wooden a frame with a yellow tin roof top
it was two bucks to experience the thrill
she said 'until i get my wedding ring boy we cant go that far'
and i cant believe how long its been
and my favorite secret underwear
only bad thing about it
i tried to have fun with all of my might
i wouldnt have to carry you around with me
you werent in
are you comin back again i swear
how was i suppose to know she was allergic to chocolate
i dont understand my girlfriend
then i found the perfect woman jack
you got the right
i did you wrong
i aint got you
that smile that laugh everyone is staring at
up until what use to be walked in
after all my heart's been through
this happens time and time again
seems like everywhere we go
you dont have to tell me she's beautiful
there's no need to apologize
and we got hustlers we got fighters
hmm hmm hmm i love this bar
i like to take her out to dinner
an old jukebox and a real bad band
i just love it
but every once in awhile
your high school team and your moisturizer creme
wanna talk about i
wanna talk about i
there might be someone else
i'm crazy still in love with you
i know my heart will break in two
if i was jesus i'd have some real long hair
i'd run around with the wrong crowd man i'd never be bored
i know your dark little secrets i'd look you right in the face
i'm just talkin bout two lonely people
you were looking right at me
i'm not talkin bout knocking out heaven
she said i'm a lady looking
with whether we're wrong or we're right
can you forgive me i hope that you'll be happy
i'm laughing through my tears
the park is full of sunday fathers and melted ice cream
i'm laughing through my tears
i cant put i love you in other words
a pair of i love you's gently ends this conversation
in other words
for one second of my life
i'm callin the shots
my pride's too hard to swallow
i aint saying that it's wrong for you
save this ol world tonight
it's ok
we live out here in the country
'cause by the time he turned seven he was a stealin watermelons
he'd say by god you better know it if you're runnin with me
they bought a new double wide and on their wedding night
'cause i'm skinny dippin finger flippin son of a gun
'cause i'm skinny dippin finger flippin son of a gun
it's really over rated to me
i aint got enough money for a big diamond ring
let's tie a brand new bow around the same old thing
i swore i'd love you 'til the end of forever
i swore i'd love you 'til the end of forever
late last christmas eve

and the statue of liberty
this big dog will fight
and the eagle will fly
i almost said i need you
if everything is still alright
he had a taste for the nightlife and he
when those sevens cleaned the table up
i drive a big rig from shore to shore
sometimes you dont
and the best that you can hope for is to die
that i left behind
i've got a memory somewhere
from the back of my mind to the bottom of my heart
i wanna hold you close to me feel just like it used to be
and baby if you feel like i do

that you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve
and then i'm gonna love you all over in and out of control
chorus

four hundred dollars two good spare tires
we'll wine and dine and do 'em fine
runnin block

you can have that perfume that you wanted
if you aint got it right come christmas night
hey it's time you loved your fellow man
'cause if you aint a good girl by christmas
he might throw that car up with it
she aint hooked on me no more
her love made me so high but i abused it
she's letting one go
we'd still be together but she left me
guitar and my guns
when i am all she needs
she'll never show it
she only gets that way with me
a big full grown one
she's got twenty two dollars
makin my camp at the end of the bar
she ran away with a rodeo clown
she's gotta have it she's gonna get it
she's gotta have it she's gonna get it
that's what she wants that's what i'm gonna do
said honey what's the matter with her
make mine black and hers sweet as sugar
by the teardrops in her eyes
they never tied the knot
oh i should've been a cowboy
i should've learned to rope and ride
just like gene and roy
i never knew a girl who could do what she's doing to me
lock and key
she's got some kinda good kinda hold on me
and all our friends still come here they ask about her all the time
at the end of the line now we're strangers again
she's sweet she's got 'em melting in her hand
i said 'would you like a drink
mmm boys she's babelicious
she's sweet
fill my pickup bed with roses and back it right up to your door
if you change your mind and love me like before but that's not how it is
someone finally complained enough
that's my kids and that's my wife
the more they never seem the same
that's my dog in my back yard
and you're lookin right lookin good lookin like a woman should
and who's the one guy that you come runnin to
so come and get it
than go on lovin without you
turns out i knew what i was thinkin
you'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
were just lessons from the past
you're not the woman behind the man
is something i cant do
leading the way through love and life
yeah my truck is packed and runnin i'm headed out west tonight
i made it out to tucson where i turned my truck around
wouldnt wanna be ya
and dont care about what you've been told
dont want to hear what the weatherman has to say
and yet this is farther than i've ever fell
i've never let another in so soon
funny it dont feel like we just met
now there goes my lay z boy and my flat top guitar
you aint leavin thank god are ya
barking like a dog howling at the moon
i could've died drinkin now i'm killing myself
it's honey do this honey do that
oh that you came here to get
just the softest place to fall
you've caught me at a bad time
how can all of our yesterdays mean nothing to you
why'd you lose your faith in me i never gave up on you
i gave you my heart to hold thinkin it would go unbroken
i'm as strong strong as i can be
and it always blows me away by the power that you hold
something shot right through me
we'll get lost on this dance floor
if you do maybe kiss me again
and i wont know where i'm at
i think you mean it like that
turn it upside down
turn it upside down
in 1985 i placed a bet and lied
we've realised there's no going back
only 16 years of age he said
cheeks sunken and despaired
i wanna be so skinny that i rot from view
but i can see my ribs and i feel fine
and not soil its purity
i long since moved to a higher plateau
i wish i had a bottle
i wish i had a bottle
we dont talk about love we only want to get drunk
but once within a long and broken night
but always the moment it just seems to stay
this is a song
pretend humility the ugly lie
it's the facts of life sunshine
to carry the sky away
always never
daylight bores the sunshine out of me
only exists in advert time
sunk deep in my tv
i wonder who you think you are
nail it to the house of lords
blanche and pickles amin milosovic
not punish less rise the pain
give them the respect they d e s e r v e
i want to fly and run till it hurts
sleep for a while and speak no words in australia
wear your love like it is made of hate
remember the best times are yet to come
clear your heads and get ready to run
remember the best times are yet to come
the bay of pigs
as if they never exist
the devils playground
you cover illness with flowers
to be morally good
it ruined me
know that i should never give advice
starbright keep me safe today and tonight
just leave me alone
bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah

my eyes are shut tight
this black dog is out of control
my eyes are shut tight
and it's twisting and changing this fragile body
no place around there where i fit in
i'm blurred to bits and wired
sleep so heavy that it's out of the question
nothing but pieces of dust
sleep so heavy that it's out of the question
is as good as it can get
i'm sick of being sick
and all my violence it does not exist
happy being sad
blackhorse apocalypse
blackhorse apocalypse
embarrassed possessed and so uncivilised
maybe richer maybe wiser
it was no surface but all feeling
just for one of your smiles
what's your poison and what is your honey

vicarious thrills re run their youth
slavery to the beat
my cheeks blood red as my favourite port

she sucks you deeper in
you exist within her shadow
access to a living you will not see
look around here you see nothing is very real
that's all you need

morning always seems too stale to justify
fragments crawling like cobwebs on stone
you have your very own number
harvest your ovaries dead mothers crawl
never gonna wake feeling free
in your love
eyes close down i dont wanna see
pay for it
you're so dead
solitude sometimes is
drop your bombs on all i see
everyone is staring with the glaze of obsession
power facts are brutally sold to worn darkened skin
obedience to the law is free desire
cigarettes a life line it's safety in death
jam your brain with broken heroes
dont wanna hear your words
dont wanna see your face

the love of richard nixon yeah they all betrayed you
the need it still grows stronger
yeah they all betrayed you
you thought you were our friends
messed up and dead on alcohol
i'm tired of giving a reason
in your eyes i see it mirrored
i've tried so hard to shake it
i thought about it a million times
just forget about the rest
depopulation
what have i said again
through early morning for i see

and i can take or leave them if i please
victims with the saddest hearts
passing by the grace of god

let's get this straight girl you love me
someone somewhere soon will take care of you
i close my eyes
leave this country

i cant breathe
way down of course i cry
i am an architect they call me a butcher
i am all the things that you regret
i am stronger than mensa miller and mailer
i exist in a place
but i found that soul
yeah i found that home
but i found that soul
this is the place where my mind resists
the fragments fail to hold me
worship obesity as our birthright
but freedom of speech wont feed my children
and see the love in richard gere's eyes
pretend there's something worth waiting for
pass each other as if they're drugged
from despair to where
further away
the more estranged i feel from my youth further away
find your faith in your cocaine
why dont you just fuck off
now you say you know how we feel
oh yeah
humiliations not easily understood
if we can still fall in love
against the soul
erodes the soul
the nothing in me
i cant see right from my wrong
all of the hope and the dreams
the apostle in me
skin so tense gives in
i live to fall asleep
everyone who loved you stayed waited till the end
needing to remember how and why to live
bullets for your brain today

images of perfection suntan and napalm
tipper gore was a friend of mine

isnt it lovely when the dawn brings the dew
yeah i'm really tired
shielding what we need to see
winter lovers winter trees
they hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
and you think you're so clever and classless and free
if you want to be a hero well just follow me
he's a boy you want a girl so tear off his cock
for 200 anyone can conceive a god on video
there is no part of my body that has not been used
dont hurt just obey lie down do as they say
our voices are for real
you love
you better wake up and smell the real flavour
oh you love us
oh you love us
i love you all the same
but it dont come easy
but you stole the sun from my heart
trade all your heroes in for ghosts in for ghosts in for ghosts
you stole the sun straight from my heart from my heart from heart
you're so fragile tonight
whether you live or die
you're tender and you're tired
whether you live or die
drift away and die
dreaming on a lie
sink into a slurred veneer
of yourself
everyone is perfect and you're so lame
yourself
never had a chance to wave goodbye
children wrapped in home made flags
fades away
i guess we'll have we'll have to test ourselves
indian summer still hurt and broken
we said the truth was fixed it's lost without a trace

the way your life just fades away
braindead motherfuckers
braindead motherfuckers
life sold cheaply forever ever ever
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
this happiness corrupt political shit
the past sideways scrawl
your memory is still mine
we sensed the breaking of our lives
misery and trauma making love
lips i kiss just another plague
skin never sweating dignity
lips i kiss just another plague

listen to luke sermon six
nail a crucifix onto your soul

gotta taste for danger
cos i'm a damned dog
find nothing that satisfies
dead martyrs always take it further
just dead stars for dead eyes

dna of restriction and law
see myself without ruining lines
i recognise dim traces of creation

the future is now
door to the river
but i guess that's just how you are
silence is not sacrifice
embrace to betrayal

excerpt taken from the song 'dixie' by daniel d emmett 1859
it's what you remember what you remember that makes you
but now have no direction
collapsing like the twin towers
where that is they only know
god knows what makes the comparison
no matter how miserable it is
please take me on home enolaalone
please sing to me a song enolaalone

happy black days here's the summer here's the summer

hangs in my wardrobe behind
on this summer evening
oh lookin fine that day

and i love them as if i love them
so we close our eyes
but while you're out there playing you see
i feel like i'm losing you to this town
all over the world in eighty days
driving from zurich to milan
what kind of a man could live this way
be myself with you
right now
you play the part so well
so no one lives inside
if you cant speak you cant lie
can you make it on your own
trigger happy
you were wronged
lie down in the flowers

things that might not help you
promises i never kept i will leave you
i will hate to leave you
a different point of view in every speech i make
a different point of view in every speech i make
im the man of a thousand ages
i stole a fire but it burned up much too soon
speak like a leader with the voice of power and command
voice of command
stones in the parthenon
face in the stars
leave me running in the wheel
i will leave you alone
all your byzantine excuses
afraid of sunlight
so how do we now come to be
so how do we now come to be
so how do we now come to be
scorch marks on the road ahead
there's a line on her jeans that a ballpoint made
so if you ever decide that you have to escape
see those people there
it used to bother them but now it's ok
see the little girl spirallin down
we could make a pillow of sand and sleep
for god's sake dont pretend to be concerned
i was taught from the much too young
i only wish you knew
cause happiness is not something
to never give myself away
i dont say all i can
no incantations of remorse my friend
listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision
a friend in need is a friend that bleeds
a non com observer
everybody knows that we live in a world where they give bad names to beautiful things
we should live in a beautiful world
have you the faith to be
and we fall green to red to brown
i dreamed i rolled on the ocean floor
that dragged me down to the ocean bed
rolled in the sway of an iron bell
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
sighs at the skylight gets lost in the haze
he's clutching a photograph of a berlin party girl
with a hole in our hearts
the quick an the dead
today i saw music in the sky
between you and me
ice and fire
with no god to complain
what goes on in between
and a fever that wont leave me alone
i will stare from the window
kick my legs and scream
took all you have and i still want more
i would take you and run
but the poor misguided directionless familiar of some obscure scottish poet
she was a wallflower at sixteen she'll be a wallflower at thirty four
to a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears
the weekend career girl never boarded the plane
on the verge of indecision
a lonely piece of action from another town
still trying to get over still trying to write love songs for passing strangers
some of us go down in a haze of publicity
inviting me to a casual obscenity
a childhood my childhood
she had medals pinned to a threadbare greatcoat
should we say goodbye
ecstasies undared tremble upon the edge of the tightly respectably unfulfilled
with the inevitable loss
placed herself in reach
and she's crying
you cant cheat your fate girl
though stinging kills the honey bee
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
i watched her as she walked across the coals
i'm your nightmare surfer babe
she was singing i was born in nineteen sixty weird
plastered in paris
home is where the heart lies
before the blond hairs turn to grey
charting charting charting charting the single
where is home
auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen
would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause
but for now it's just another chelsea monday
catalogue princess apprentice seductress
i turned to the mirror i saw you the child that once loved
and i'm still the child
now you realize that you've got to get out of here
i'm still the child
through the looking glass
out of luck out of charm out the game of rejections in a cigarette city
awaiting development with paranoid polaroid eyes
give me time wont you give me that time
did you ever fall in love
and so often
running scared
if my heart were a ball
did you ever dream of falling
never do that never do that
wild rose
a dummy in tussauds you'll see
i want to do adverts for american express cards talk shows on prime time tv
forwarned my audience leaves the stage floating ahead
nursing an erection a misplaced reaction with no flower to place before this gravestone
a misplaced reaction satisfaction
just like a greasepaint mask
you've played this scene before
a mother to the living
a mother to the dead
the violence of my heartbeat
and your cs lewis books
all the poisoned attitudes
of the chapters you'll be writing
paint a picture of it
microsoft and tears
when you've nothing left to sell
it's already broken
thank god for the internet
in so deep
holding the word scalpels on trembling lips
we are pilots of passion sweating the flight on course
empty chambers embracing the end
this is the ricochet
just for the record i'm gonna put it down down
but i've got no discipline got no self control
do you remember dawn escapes from moon washed college halls
kayleigh oh i never thought i'd miss you
so sorry i never meant to break your heart
how long can you stand
how long can you stand
and you're sick to your stomach
is suddenly gone
a dozen tequilas and you're feeling all right
the make up hides the bruises and the tears so they never show
i know you'll never act with me i know that you're in love with me
ebony flowers pinned to a velvet cushion in a red light
dreaming of a spark
you will be queen
iou for your love
when i met the magdalene
i can hear your heart i can hear your heart i can hear your heart
but i cant give up believing that i'm going to live forever
i gave up everything that feels allright
the colours stand still
the pain when you fall
the attitude of authority
alone in the city at seventeen
hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground
and the fear to try
i just wanted you to be the first one
i just wanted you to be the first one
i have seen this face a thousand times
is being made again by you
to a bright new world
pinned up on her wall
sleepwalking through the danger signs
she's got a map of the world
it's such a beautiful world

an row an row all for mhairi's wedding
i said i'll i'll i'll i'll take the low road
i said you take the high road
an i'll be in scotland before you
i found my thoughts shift slowly into phase
silent chimneys provide the silent steeples
are you following me
i plan the path of destiny from this maze
i'm the market square hero
i'm so alone
as the days become colder
the fruit of the wild rose
ever could fade
dreaming westbound waves
heading for the dignified walk away
you're holding on you're holding on
ii fallin from the moon
there's murder on the street
now that everybody talks to me
watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
but perhaps we'll save your skin
a pretty sight it seemed to be
and the square becomes a battlefield
the corridors of this white place

hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors
we're terminal cases that keep talking medicine
just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water
clutching at straws

she was in a backroom
she was enchanted
and he said 'oh by the way'
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
there is a man in my head
the end of the day
the end of the day
feeling so high you can feel so alone
a billion miles of darkness left your feeling low
and eats and sleeps and grows and dies
in the whole of the world
i'm the uninvited guest
cause i'm the one who knows what scares you
i'm the one thing you knew you shouldnt do
cause i'm the one who knows what scares you

meaningless words
i fabricate the weave with my excuses
security clutching me
i cannot let my life be ruled by threads
i've conquered my fears all my fears
contemplating
didnt know
these chains are all your own
this cage is safe and warm
that everything could be explained with mathematics
this is the 21st century
natural selection
this is the 21st century
and rest your heavy head my love
to have kids
lived in the shadow of the mountains with the smells of disinfectant dusty old leather and the polished wood of his bed
an upright piano and the boys in the choir
whispering youre the only one
and not get caught up in their rules
and he worked down on a coal mine for national service so that he could be around
a cloud of bees with no particular aim and no brain
blue pain from something with no brain
tomorrow on the horizon
this love
for one last time
this truth
strobing in the amber light
and we came to this place to make the chances real in the big city
this town hangs around in the doorway and tells me i'm late
you ask for my love on the strength of a kiss
i'll remember you
we almost remember
now they scream
the good times rolled beneath his feet
la la la la
three minute kid is here again
girlfriends gone off with the jag
read some kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now
dr finlay and my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle you wont reach 30
you and me against the world
we never checked each other's eyes
i think we came to know the meaning of the fall
tux on tux on tux on tux on tux on
the first time and the last time that you thought you had control
a brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue black vein
he's gonna get one with a tux on free admission with a tux on
we roll in the radiation
under the sun
i lie awake at night listening to you sleeping
in the spiritual third world
you said you didnt like yours
you came and brought the rain here
on promenades where drunks propose to lonely arcade mannequins
laughing at the world till the barman wipes away the warm wet circles
with quick bitten fingernails
and i'll always surrender to the warm wet circles
destined to be found in a cheap hotel
dont be surprised the heroes never show
dont be surprised the heroes never show
why do i seem so blind
sit back and watch
i saw a perfect mirror
tearing women and men
dont do that
and if to feel is no solution
found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown
we dont need no uniforms we have no disguise
tokio children
cairo children
you cant take a photograph of uzis on a street corner
i close my mind i shout it out but you know it's getting harder
we buy fresh bagels from the corner store
i know that i would rather be out of this conspiracy
dangerous lines
pain and heaven
she's like the girl with the smile in the dream in the dark
ferocious designs
the joy and the pain that we deserve
we get the toys that we deserve
the spores on the breeze that we deserve
in all the time that i've known you
you're an island
tell me the truth if you could do
but i cant leave you all out at sea
out of a the first light came
bound for the north of ireland
when you tear them apart
forget
my dreams and they're my dreams they're my dreams
rollin under like a surfboard in a wave
i feel
i'm a submarine in this ocean
offer your life blood away
with those who have loved us today
as this watery world spins around
stay and be happy

you search the darkness and you're scrambling for the light

it's a slaughter it's a slaughter
where why not and should they oughta
i'm wining
smiles polluted with false charm
oh please do come
does the ocean hear you cry
or were you only playing macho
you're trying to win back her affection
you think they will forgive a hero anything
it only takes a fraction of a second
thrown on the beach like a seal ready for slaughter
can you understand it's the way i choose to be
heading for the rave
the fire and ice of amazon and eskimo
they say it's a lie
use me instead
it's as simple as that
i'm sick for you
i'm ashes on the water now
heading for the great escape
standing in the swing
of every corridor i walk
heaven number seven
mountain echo curfews bell signal ending tasks
they cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in grendels name
along the forest path he roams to hrothgar's hall so clear
denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through
stellular heavens ignore even childrens cries

so you say you believe in all of mother nature's laws
instrumental
hard as love
it makes you tremble and it makes you fall
it makes you angry and it makes you blind
baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love
when he offered you the sacred bread
he's got experience he knows you know
blank eyes purple fever streaming through the frosted pane
he knows you know you know you know
for i was born with a habit
wide boys we were wide boys
lucky little ladies at the watering holes
returning to a nature child happy wild and free
holidays in eden
back in your own country
see no hear no speak no evil
a cog in the hurrying world
i know how hard it can be to wait
in deepest darkness
be who you were before
but i've got a feeling that the rumours are true
your fairweather friends call two by two
i feel so strange what's wrong with me
my hands steady as a hangmans hands
ive been feeling kind of down and loose
i found a power on a dusty shelf
madam im adam im a palindrome
hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors
frantic as a cardiograph scratching out the lines
this house aches
quiet at all volumes
let in the spring air today
but now it's crumbling tumbling down
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth
there's a million words that we could share tonight
how can it hurt how can it hurt
like the last time
in the chaos of colours
hold on to me
even if the good old days were good
savin up for mary savin up for jane
music marillion lyrics john helmer
but i must drink you all alone
my feelings and i
into the answering machine
on the floor by the bedroom door
best not pick up the phone
that beauty was skin deep
were really all the same
you're all i believe in
you sound truly heartbroken
learned the routines and the high scoring loops
dont you ever wonder
waiting for the world to change
waiting for the world to change
did we fall asleep babe
blue bird
only love will turn you around
to the gasp from the crowd
must a man take all the mail will bring
paper lies
when you get behind the news of the world do the things you find begin to bend your mind
in the starless shutters of my eyes
stripped the gloss from a beauty queen
oh judy
punch and judy
who forgot to flush the loo
punch and judy
punch and judy judy
it's a kind of lie
just exactly what it is i'm taking pleasure in
and with every little grin you dont want to be wonderin
if i could jump a ride between the skin and silicon then
you're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled
leakproof
and turn up half an hour late night after night
no tears
there's always another chance for you
no lies
there's always another chance for you
have the nights and the days that you've come through
was a runaway girl all they chose to see
you pretend to wait for washing in some laundromat
one more experience one more entry in a diary self penned
too much too soon too far to go too late to play
i'm losing on the roundabouts roundabouts the game is over
a scream that's born from sorrow
sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer why
can you still say that you love me
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
sledging on a hill
in england
say goodbye
so unpleasant inside and out
if you like i'll tell you about it
from the living stream
to be worth paying to see
enough of a freak
when she spoke her words ensnared me
i've seen a different doorway shut a million times before
betrayed on a lizard's bed on a lizards bed
go to hell
what anyone could tell her
what anyone could tell her
a carbon trail scores a moist stretched palm
to their hopes and betrayals and your only reply
take me away
we stand here waiting on the whistle to blow
and it twists in her body
and there's a screw that i tighten
'till the splinters you gather
with these fragments of love
for when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame
we're just sugar mice in the rain
i just couldnt stand the looks on their faces saying what a jerk
'cause there's not enough love to go 'round
'cause there's not enough love to go 'round
derek dick steve rothery mark kelly pete trewavas ian mosley
how do i fell inside
summon all your answers with an ice cube chime
so if you join me
could please pick up my tab
but you couldnt say it and i couldnt say it
outside i could hear a mockingbird
it was almost goodbye
and my future was suddenly so clear
so many nights i could only dream ya
but thats way before she told me we were through
repeat chorus
so little time when she is mine i know
love that town but i just couldnt stay
i am who i am
but one night while she lay sleepin i slipped away
and say the job is taking longer than i planned i dont have the heart to tell her
guess she finally had to tell me shes not waiting anymore
since she left me by myself
and spend my time with my new next of kin
just like somebody kicked him
told him dont play dumb with us son
reckless discharge of a gun
through the teardrops in his eyes
so i guess i'll be confessin my love confessin my love
there aint gonna be no restin at all 'cause i want you too much
my will and send her home tonight
but i know my day has not come to an end
but i dont have anyone to blame but me
i'll be down in tennessee
i ended up on my butt with a puzzled look
coming down droppin fast
the higher you take me the deeper i go
the last one to show the last one to know
hey im not big on social graces
that youre livin in
but i dont anymore
but it all seems so tiresome now
two paychecks are better than one
i cant believe what the judge had to tell us
the river of love a little too soon
and dont mean dallas
gotta find somethin to ease my mind
so startin now
i'm gonna get a life
i'm gonna get a life
mark chesnutt steve leslie roger springer
even cuss and swear
thank god those days are gone
they are one and the same
care of a lot of things
i know that time will take
the coldest winter we ever knew and our ole hound dixie passed away
so many just give up and walk away but in spite of it all youre strong enough to stay
my hearts too broke to pay attention
i aint ready for another love
a man will never see a more beautiful sight
i wont wander from from her lovin arms
yeah she's on a roll which way do i go
mark chesnutt roger springer slugger morrissette
b 11 takes me back to the first dance we shared
she may stay out late tonight
ice and drinks will be up soon
grown up sexy texas babies
but theyve all got new names
i thought everything was right but you went and left instead
repeat chorus
if it aint one thing it's another one on the way
i can never think of givin you up
she swears she loves those kids and she doesnt mind that load
ringing telephones and decisions to be made
wondering if they're still in style
hoping you might return
while i was hunting wild turkey and sippin on jim beam
i wouldnt bet a wooden nickel that he aint
when they start hating love and loving to hate
coast to coast its alive in most
last night i came home again
after all the hell ive put her through
i pray to god someday ill feel the same
last night i dreamed i went to sleep for good
waiting there to carry me away
well i dont know how to keep a woman around
takes more than luck to really mess up
that's the way you make an ex
how i missed your neon lights they sure are a welcome sight
repeat chorus
grow deeper with the miles
with compassion in her heart
why i thought that weathered face
is a moment i treasure
and i'm wondering what your dreaming
the sweetest dream will never do
for all the rest of time
right or wrong i had to hear your voice again
and girl it's solid gold well i'll let you go
mark chesnutt roger springer slugger morrissette
gonna walk outside one night and turn your memory loose
1997 emi music publishing
my heart and soul belong to you
all the love that you've got comin
i cant say that im all right but by tonight
if i cant say a word to her ill blame it on this lump thats in my throat
one look in her eyes and im gone for a ride
she says hello and i away i go
im not gettin any better at good byes
ill start dusting off all my best lines
it paid big money but he sure cant spend it now
and he traveled all over the country blasting holes in this great land
and they might just leave you in their will
i gotta myself through the week somehow
but it's all over now and it sure is monday
chorus
repeat chorus
the words are still so dear
i see you sitting there
against the window pane
you may be over me but cant you see its not over if im not over you
the kind of man she needed me to be
but its a little too late
done tuned my heart around
believe me i've seen the light jolie
wont you make me feel well again
oh please jolie
gotta ring for your pretty little hand
let it rain
let it rain
how its gonna be and how therell never
but when it comes to him ive heard enough
live a little now and then
this life aint coming 'round again
unwind take your time leave your cares all behind
we step out on the dance floor the band starts to play
you and the music
i lay me down
from the moment you walked away
so i might as well get out of this bed
it wont let me be eee eeee e
and i dont love you rollin off her tongue
i've heard that famous whippoorwill
i'm gonna put some daylight through that door
as this side of the door
before i leave you in the past where you belong
so ill hold on til a better memory comes along
and i'll be seventeen on my way to pick her up
to the good ol days gone
i'll just close my eyes
well it sure feels good to come in here
we proudly wore those uniforms
keeps smilin back at me
telling me is breakin your heart
you should try being me
i'll always be a part of you
you tell me this is hard for you
im just hangin round a better class of losers
is the same old lonely phony atmosphere
chorus
so i spent half my paycheck in one evening just to find
cowboy gotta ride gambler gotta chance
willie nelsonhank craig
and never wake again
a face among the crowd
it would make a man fool enough
what was you thinkin
but tell me what was you thinkin
tell me what was you thinkin
roger springer tony martin reese wilson
keep wishing upon that same ol star
about the girl i love so
cause after all is said and done
step by step you taught me easy lovin
bill kenner mark wright
its visible
chorus
we'd be lovers any way we could
this aint what she really wanted
but i'm almost halfway back to birmingham
she was new to me and fully of mystery but now i know
for love in the hot afternoon
heres a few things that ill leave with each and everyone
then mama looked at all of us and said id like to pray
girl lay your shame to rest
without a hope without a prayer
i get so tired
oh these old city lights
ba da da da da da
because of this
you give your body to me
because of this
to choke on dust and feather
in the wheels of a train that crawls
look for me baby
you ask me why am i flyin
look for me baby
anymore
boogie boogie boogie now
fuck yourselves i need some more room to breathe
and i'm sorry for what i said
sees and believes
one whiskey for every ghost
for girls are sad in their eyes
just turnin your back to the ghost
who'll follow me back to the freak show
i'm crawlin all over the carnival
through so many highways
through so many highways
and keep the tears from your eyes
so you need yourself a man
i dont want to be left on the outside
ride in on horses
shinin white light
i'm gonna try and shine
blue lonesome nights away
turquoise and twilight coat
show my lonely night is fallin
it wont get any easier in the dark
think my blood might boil
these darkened days
felt much older than i really was
felt much older than i really was
while the shame in your heart
i have loved your eyes
from the dive down to the wet
now it's just like you said
i remember your face
whoawhoawhoaand
you aint got nobody to touch
lanegan
better than i love myself
you carry yourself
i got to take care of you
one and one are two
and tie off my arm
and i'm a bastard's son
i sense a dying spark
watch the river rolling by
in their loose mother hubbards and their stocking feet
i murdered little sadie in a first degree
forty one years just to wear them stripes
another fire out in front of me
far removed
shining precious light
it's a solitary star
i know he'll take me shake me
to live on
i'm going home
jesus christ been here and gone
not feelin any pain
yet all my strange and simple games
between the earth and skies above
i need a little more time
and let me breathe that air
cry i'm gonna cry now
around my heart
from morning 'till night
while the cold winter winds do blow
a shanty mans life
they wont be back 'till spring
children all come out to play
when they arrive at home
well the water fell away
livins not hard it's just not easy
believin aint hard it's just not easy
sunrise
with my hand
i see they're comin
hate is gone drippin lies from the tongue
i dont walk that tall
what one eye sees
and there's nothin else i can do
laneganjohnson
all tied up in a winding sheet
night when the dogs from hell come out
please touch my hand
and nothing else matters
and nothing else matters
just prayers for drownin ships at sea
how can all this rain keep fallin
fear and paranoia run together in my dreams
and i'm as light as anything
in the winter time goin
mornin comes cold chills and shakes
lady
can never be no doubt
here i am still spinnin round
run around catchin 'em baby
tell me where did you sleep last night
in the pines in the pines
i have to watch you come back to earth
or written in stone
'cause my mind is an open door with nothing inside
or go where jesus fled
she could have had anything she wanted
inner tubes piled on the top
she says right beside me
anybody can see she loves me
love's a gamble every heart will take
because lovin you is paying off more than i knew
oh now i've got you my ace of hearts
almost doesnt count
one foot outside the door
you came real close
if you're looking for more
almost doesnt count
but standing here i just got to thinkin
back when all we had was love and dreams
roll up our sleeves and keep this love alive
anywhere but memphis
and if telling me sooner was just too hard
she could've told me in baton rouge or dallas
three girl it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
one you're like a dream come true
you came and breathed new life
one you're like a dream come true
hey now look at me i'm hanging with the stars
back on earth
and i thanked them all for being kind to me
back on earth
back on earth
when i can touch you
do it 'cause i do it 'cause i do it 'cause i
because i love you
yours heart and soulfully
and i know how it feels
dont get your pleasure from my pain
i lost my wife and little boy when
someday we'll all have perfect wings
ted hewittrodney atkinsmax t barnes
but whenever you reach out for me i'm gonna be there
emily sat right next to me
a farmer's son and a preacher's only daughter
i played it cool but i had it bad
it all seems just like yesterday
me and emily harper
so i'm gonna need something to go on
i want to be everything you ever want
so i'm gonna need something to go on
let me turn the light back oncause
and we'll dance inside the flame
but please close your eyes and trust your heart
i've been trying not to love you
if you care for me at all
but it dont know where to start
help me fall
feel like i'm still seventeen
now baby's got the kind of kiss you could start a fire with she dont need no gasoline
my baby's got me high low and in between
everything in this world all that i'll ever need
i've waited so long to say this to you
for the rest of my life
tuesday morning sports page i've got coffee in my cup
i hear the food is great i hear the summer sure is nice
sara used to talk about
man i hate chicago
i wonder if he knows
she cant trust a man who tells a lie
oh i wonder if he knows
i'll be around around like a second hand tickin
girl i wish you happiness
girl you know that i know you too well
girl i'll be around
more than anybody
i'm gonna love somebody
'til i'm so oversome that i cry
three am on the clock
i hold all my hopes and dreams
as i watch you take each breath
and i'll try to hide my tears
oh this promise i will keep
aint no such think as peer pressure
slide a fastball past hank aaron
i aint tellin him his buisness
in my heaven
'cause it's working
and sometimes when they put it back again
steady and strong and certain
steady and strong and certain
working like a dream
born with a silver spoon in her mouth
and gettin caught didnt seem to matter
late one night by the harvest moon
you cant really give it all away
it's almost like she's fadin out of sight
she hasnt started going
i can feel her leavin coming on
my heart slips away
i could feel my mind drift
off the edge of forever
pretty sure it's a sign we need to
do some catchin up
one touch i'm where i want to be
the world can wait
the world can wait
love is alive
constantly needing this feeling of ours
my heart was never really beating
now the majic of that moment
and i'm always falling more
and i'm loving every minute
and i'm loving every minute
and at night they'd meet at the cold spot
we all thought that she was just kidding'
but i'm not gonna be held down
things are gonna change
dont have to tell my body to breathe
and for me you are that one
tony martinreese wilsonaimee mayo
i may never see the wonders on this earth
d vincent williamsrory lee
but i've got more than enough
love my wife like my dad did
carson chamberlainbilly simonrandy boudreaux
right now right here

third of june she said goodbye
how her smile lights up the sky
told everyone i'm doing fine
she's in love
why cant it be me
she's in love
sam tateannie tatedave berg
somebody on the morning train
it's that blue eyed girl
there's somebody
somebody on the morning train
she plays down at jimbeaux's gumbo and washtub
you can play me fast or slow
let me be your squeeze box
harley allen
he might be around the corner
somebody's gonna take you
she's still waiting
all the little faces different races
there's about a hundred ways to leave
'cause i'm here to tell you
it's the sudden stop
i thought he was just being a kid
i can still see his excitement
he gave me his crayola pen
him pointing and smilin
and i remember i made her cry
i'd ever want
that i have of her
i'd ever want
i say girl you know sometimes my faith is weak
are the words i could not seem to find
the perfect conversation always ends
and i'm too secure to be afraid
picked me up just to let me down
like it's never gonna fade away
and i would divert a dallas parade
you'd have to admit it'd be worth a shot
a time machine
you were my tower of strength
the sky the sun the moon and stars all wrapped into one
you were my shelter that kept me warm
the sky the sun the moon and stars all wrapped into one
and love dont cheat
'cause love dont lie
and i will show what love is
you're the purest form of heaven on earth
what's not to love about perfection
yes i love you what's not to love
said he loved her and they told her
no survivors found she heard him say
they say hello i miss you so wish you were here
give a little then take it back
with a broken wing
she still sings
goin through the motions of my life
keep 'em guessin keep 'em laughin
though it aint my size
but when the sun goes down
or held me for so long
and you havent left a clue
somehow a woman knows
your mansion on a hill
it makes me proud
we've never been untrue
make a wish and baby
love can take you anywhere
wont you let me
i'll give you anything and everything
i'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
it's just another saturday night
anything's better than feelin the blues
chorus
an in a moment they can choose to walk away
i saw your face when
no feelings have lasted
so dont be thinking
he's nothing but ashes
oh yeah and by the way i still love you
sometimes what you dont say
make a scene
go on and be that way
she was only ten when her daddy got fired
she smiles 'cause she knows in the end
then she sees her little girl
and these tears are gone and i'm beyond the blue
sometimes i sit on my front porch swing
to be here with the ones that love me
i have been blessed
when i feel you holding me
i have been blessed
i was born to give my love to you
as sure as newborn babies cry
seems i always end up driving by
feel so at ease
baby you're the best i've ever met
her image all tear stained and worn
and each breath that he draws makes him think
and the sound of goodbye
chorus
we dug to solid ground
wearin the same dress she wore yesterday
and she flies to a place where she's loved
and she flies to a place where she's loved
and she flies to a place where she's loved
it's gonna be alright it's gonna be alright baby
when the rain when the rain comes crashin down
'cause there's no comfort here in your zip code
'cause there aint no telling what i'll find
and cry on the shoulder of the road
yeah if you really wanna give 'em something different
'cause they dont have a clue
yeah if you really wanna give 'em something different
you cant cry hard enough
always thinking it's gonna hurt forever
your heart oh yeah
there's a time to stand and the time is now or never
comes on his tv
and the time is what you make it
'til you figure out what your plan is
i'm keeping my distance
i'm keeping my distance
i can see that you need me
never let down my guard
and you came along
and i'm ready to heal
i know she's waiting for you she's just biding her time
living on life 9
living on life 9
living on borrowed time
never dreamed of turning back
strong enough to carry the weight
your burning light did shine
the kind of feelin words cant explain
i'm not aching like i should
that losing you feels good
'cause loving you has hurt so bad
love land
amazing all the progress we've made since the days of thomas edison
now we're watchin him blow three candles out
love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again
she said this world is movin so fast
and she's got her daddy's little grin
and we got children walking around with guns
somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playin out of tune
dont you know that
'cause boy i aint nobody's fool yeah
baby i'm trying to find a place inside your heart
oh but it's hard to start a fire without a spark
get it off my shoulder
and make the world make it go away
dont need to dress like no beauty queen
he's always sayin he's my biggest fan
he's always sayin he's my biggest fan
forget you for i thought then i never could
i'm beside you and above
you're a young one who is running
one day you will
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
but it doesnt really matter 'cause there's nothin to be said
he calls the hospital her sister's house and the place that does her hair
she's just got to be around
and when it starts to tumble
these things you'll come to know
tell him i'm the woman
living water
so tired of livin solitaire
safe in the arms of love
safe in the arms of love
i've found another man
still i want you to set me free
somewhere he needs to be
she found in the pocket of his coat
oh but she aint seen nothin yet
nothing's ever gonna bring her down
give her the strength to fly
give her the strenght to fly
there was a bunch of kids laughin and jumpin in
tell myself to live a little freer and love a little better
what they dont know what they cant see
some say i'm running
let's learn to give let's talk things out
and there wont come a day
stronger than the both of us
even when my arms are empty darlin
even when my arms are empty darlin
that your promises are lies
'til all the pieces are in place
the way that you keep comin back and forth
guitar
i'm not the one
that wasnt me
let your heart see
that's him that's him
that's love
that's me
but now the wind blew wrong
there is one who'll lead you home
in the distance shines a light
it took my heart this long to face the truth
my tears will run and they'll keep me afloat
like an angel standing guard
there you are in standing in a crowded room
you're watching over me
there you are
wondering where you life is gonna go
this is for all you girls about forty two
who dream with everything they have
who love without holding back
and the other's runnin scared
papa needs a new job
but the wolves just keep on gatherin 'round the door
to get you off my mind
i'll get by
til i can make it on my own
til i cn make it on my own
repeat chorus twice
i'm so blue lonely for you
just call me your true blue fool
when you're standing' on a bridge that's always burnin
say goodbye
baby it's just time to walk away
'cause i've been workin and i'm too tired anyway
but i've been sleepin in a warehouse in west la
and even if the sun refused to shine
but in my dreams i couldnt love you more
always took the rocky road
i wanna join our hearts
'cause your love led my heart back home again
your hand in mine
the shameless color of
she made her life a mess
he's all nerves when he sees her
she'll be wearing white
later we can work it out
you say yes you need me
whether i go whether i stay
and it all looked so promising
the day she quit the baptist choir
when god fearin women get the blues
call the ladies aid
what they're gonna do
we dont know who'll sang her part
when you are old and tired and gray
and i will be old too see
it's hard to be everything to everyone
baby in your arms i'm free
baby hold me close never let me go
there's not a stone to mark
feels like a mile wide ditch
that i cannot give a name
there's not a stone to mark
do you feel lonely
if you were single and free
tell me now
is it hard to be yourself
keeping love alive in these troubles times
well it must've been hard it must've been tough
baby what else could it be
from the day we met
i knew that it was safe with you
it happens to a lot of men
my poor heart would never mend
and i'm gonna stand right here
and i'm gonna stand right here
just trusting you was my great sin what can
i love you still you won again
you never push and you never pull
you lift me gently up
i hope the wind catches
from the ashes
so dont try to save me now
than i've flown before
as he struggled down the driveway it almost
i've wrestled wrong and right
since i dont know when
showed me the truth
to go to work get up and go to work
but now it's back to work
throw myself into my business and collect my pay
right now i'm goin to work
and i wonder where you are
all their beauty from within
lost my hope i was so far gone
is a happy girl
i'm a happy girl
i'm a happy girl
in the whole wide world
yeah you got heart trouble comin on
begging me to come back home
i never knew that i could hurt this way
a love that i cant win
shake it loose and let it fall
lord tonight i need a friend
and tomorrow's out of sight
here in my heart you just wont let me go
here in my heart you just wont let me go
here in my heart you just wont let me go
here in my heart here in my heart
but there's cracks in all the walls and all the windows
and i'll sew some yellow trim along the seams
and i sure hope that we can live forever
here i am begging you to try
there's a chance i could change my mind
keep on giving go on living with the way things are
that's how i feel when i'm with you
every day there's something new
when you're followin all the rules
i cant guarantee that your dreams
but straight to you
but lie awake alone and dream the whole night through
but lie awake alone and dream the whole night through
so i've made up my mind
they still make me blue
time has opened the door
and it's wonderful now
this old heart has just run out of time
and when your teardrops finally come
i dont want to feel you
can hardly breathe
can hardly wait till our next kiss
sure as the sky is blue
sure as the sky is blue
baby i love you
but what would it matter
and there wont always be someone there to pull you out
sweethearts walk by together
i wonder if she's sorry
but i wont close my eyes
i see black and white
if i was a raindrop i would be fallin
but you're sinkin like a stone
repeat chorus
there aint no breeze big enough to slow me
i'll be there ready and a waitin
and i hope you believe
and promised that we'd never forget
if you can count on one thing i'll be here
i'll still be me
i'm poor but i'm proud
in my daughter's eyes
oh it puts a smile in my heart
though she'll grow and someday leave
is a soundbite at the news break
and some are just too quick to give away
pull the blinds and lock the doors
for these times in which we live
they said he was a dangerous man
roll the stone away let the guilty pay it's independence day
let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning
a few short days and night together
two shadows blending
the world's greatest lovers
and dreams of flying i fit nearly
she comes
see me now with my nearest dearest
inertia creeps
i make no sound in my eidertown
she comes
say you string me along
to bring me love
you go out every night as a single
love sweet love
you're gonna lose love
you see someone you'd just like to mingle
though you may not drive a great big cadillac
you may not have a car at all
you can still stand tall
and though you've found
better things will surely come our way
magic without love
love you for the mother
love you for god
no sunshine in my life the way i deal is shady
yeah while i'm doing this i know

she hated me but then she loved me too
attack inna the area murderer

eternal love eternal love
buzz surrounds
and listening
as advertised
my ears know that my eyes are closed
put keys to locks
wasting time when i could do
seen through me little glazed lane
while southwards he roams to the home of the whale
on the waves that blow wild and free
the wheel keeps turning the sky's rearranging
one man struggle while another relaxes
on a simple line day by day
the big wheel keeps on turning
just like i want you
want you to want me baby
want you to want me baby
tricky
i need to live and i need to
tricky 3d
we overcome in sixty seconds
digging a hole in your neighborhood
tricky 3d
something's on your mind that you cant share
lately baby where did we go wrong
try to set the night on fire
try now we can only lose
come on baby light my fire
always a fuss and fight
he gets in so late at night
and how serene your friends and fiends
and windows hum
you'd agree it's a typical high
we can unwind
all these have flaws
you i love and not another
if the basket should fall all your eggs'll be broken
i believe in one love oh girl
tracy thorn
if you left her just the way
and i dont have no fear
sometimes you look so small look so small
you're a girl and i'm a boy x4
i'll put my arms around you
and i can pull you into me
there's nothing i can save for this
comes back to me
no use to me no use to see
you light my ways through the club maze
why you want to take me to this party and breathe
they're invisible when the trip it flips

all will feature on the freakshow
to see me lookin back at you

but if you hurt what's mine
voices that i've heard before
i feel like the world is my home at last
wondering
when you check it them a use spying glass
when you check it them a use spying glass
shakes me makes me lighter
fearless on my breath
stumbling a little
i looked up and i was in your arms and i knew that i was captured
what's this whole world comin to
it's just so hard to be a child
yes i'm missing all the things i knew
and now i've got to know much more
x5
i believe the world is burning to the ground
started crying and i couldnt stop myself
oh well i guess we're gonna pretend
now it's over for me and it's over for you
let's see how far we've come
and she screams and her voice is straining
and she only sleeps when it's raining
and sometimes you can still lose even if you really try
someone i can lean on
down on themselves and dont know why
and life aint no beauty show
right now
wake up
i dont need it
so torn up
woman
heavy on the memory you need most
represent the ashes
it gets inside and it tears you up
i'm not angry anymore
all these feelings cloud up my reasoning
it dont work out like you want to
but i dont go there cuz i dont want to
this dont mean that you own me
they do
to get it back to good
i'm marking it down to learning
no i would not sleep in this bed of lies
and i gave till it all went away
over me but dont go weak on me now
pick me up and dust me off
can you help me i'm bent
i started out clean but i'm jaded
it's never enough
you're breaking me in
everybody has those days
just nursing this ghost of chance
you wont go down like this
so one more day down
of black and white people
we are black and white people
you'll find something that's enough to keep you
chorus
for god sakes turn around
come on home
we're too cool to be alone
chorus
i need a new feel dirty
in my head i heard the sound
what it means to be
you're ready to fly
chorus
tell me why you gotta be so cold
tell me anything about you i dont know
how can i be the only one
with my head first and i shake i shake
just wont come out
and i was wondering
one step away from
'cause you know damn well that i'm a simple man
one step away from down down down
all i'm building up you're tearing down
i dont want to be the crutch
she's got all these reasons in her head
what's the matter girl dont you think i'm bright enough
mixed up fixed out
i bet she will
i have to let you go
i got a disease
you drove me to the fire
tell me what i am supposed to do about it
i'm free of my disease
i got a disease
wonder how you sleep
i've always been with you
i want you to trouble me
and i'll be your downfall
i've always been with you
well i'm coming home on my back
well it's a big big city let me show you around some time
howyouwannafeel
chorus
chorus
howyouwannafeel
well you got to think with a girl like that
is that what makes you feel damn worthless
says that she's sorry now but it's not enough
chorus 1
cause no one's tried to give you what you need
you start to wonder if you're ever gonna make it by
whenever it aint easy
from what i've seen
she grabs her magazines
if it's the same for you i'll just hang
well i always say it would be good to go away
pass it on and try something else
you know you know that means so much
and i'll tell you it's only you
the hard way about giving it up
you're part of my soul
i can see where we end
when i get close to something beautiful
change my ways
help me if i fall
help me if i fall
i think i could need this in my life
i bet the room just wont shine
if you're gone baby you need to come home
if you're gone baby you need to come home
when i promise to be better you say
forgive me i apologize
dont turn out wrong
whoa i'll believe you when
whoa and i'll believe you when
chorus
there's nothing to feel good about here
we cant take back
it wont be the last beautiful girl
and the promises i never should have believed in
everyone else's girl
it wont be the first heart that you break
how i turn my head and lose it all
straight out from underneath
i'm not saying there wasnt nothing wrong
the one you're leaving out
the one you're leaving now
that i cant bring myself to throw away
i'm here all the time
just keep you trembling
it's me yeah and i cant get myself to go away
i've been changin think it's funny how now one knows
i come undone in this mad season
bleeding and broken though i've never spoken
i need you now
there's been a mad season
you dont owe me we might change
and i dont know why you couldnt just stay with me
just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart things get so
i wonder where i'd go if i could fly around downtown
i wonder what i'd do if they all did just what i said
just three miles from the rest stop
i was listening to the radio
the light was shining from the radio
i had better end it quick
or i could lose my nerve
what we learned here is love tastes bitter when it's gone
second steps have been forgotten will you tell me how
and open up more
for you so
cause you've got soul
but you dont worry you dont worry
cause you dont worry you dont worry
but you gotta give it up
you gotta give it up
you gotta give it up
you'd better stop
i thought about
and i wonder how i never got the burn
how lonely people make a life
slow dancing on the boulevard
this could be
there was nothing that could make it easy on you
just came down
and what you want
and taking the strife from all our lives
when all we need is some relief
and we cant keep holding on
through these hard times
that i should get some sleep
i'm not crazy i'm just a little impaired
somehow i've lost my mind
i've been talking in my sleep
but soon enough you're gonna think of me
but you couldnt wait here
it's you and i and i yeah well it's a shame
honey i dont think so
you'd better stop well try
see what you get
no you wont be mine
but no oh no
no you wont be mine
hope i can sleep for one night
a black fly on your necktie
hell you're so real
a pretty girl with a wicked smile on
cause that's you baby
dont you know it's alright
think you're so smart that you're fooling us all
like the rest of us
you must of done something wrong
back to you
anywhere you look
'cause if this is a sign
for a long long time
was supposed to come back
i didnt mean to hurt you
i didnt mean to hurt you
starin into one another's green pools
before i knew it she picked my pocket
we're a couple o' blue fools
did you tell me how you feel about brotherhood
when i watch you go i hold my breath and dream
come in and i'll play any game you play
tell me how you feel about brotherhood
brotherhood
she'll be all by herself
she is all by herself
she is all by herself
you have broken the chains forever
catch your breath
forget what he told you
i have found you
nobody's going to rush you
forever i'll be yours and you be my girl
forever you be mine and i'll be your man
exploring all our senses as one
forever children of time we sing and we shout
come to california come to california
come to california come to california
you try to feel
time will fly
if time will fly
i could feel it
you should know that anyway
my life is simply very bright
when you know what happens each time
that you're tired of faking it
well it's hard to take it
cursed by the past held under glass
you're getting old ready to fold
and i'm coming back with my dinosaur act
dont know if i'll find a place
divine intervention
i'll do it again
that cant be real
and who would want a dream
'cause love that's bad
she's just your size
putting up a fight is it
well i can you up the
'cause when all the waters gone
there's nothing i can say
there is so much i have left to say
oh dont go
and even now it makes me laugh to think we wanted more
but all these notions disappeared as soon as she was gone
we were so easy
i think i love you
but i'll feel a whole lot better
just tell me how you want it
i want you
you put your little hands together and
how can we ever come together when
there's no difference
each single day
everything everything changes changes
so you look for the answer
like a bird you'd sooner fly away
and i look up at the blue
should i put my faith in you
should i put my faith in you
though i saw it wasnt clear
wishing to the shot in the dark
for the face that lost me found
love i trusted
you could change your mind forever
as the days begin to pass us
fade
that keeps us coming back for more
that keeps us coming back for more
lived half in one and half in the other
i'm in over my head
you'll never get the chance to recover
i want back
something they left here with me
something they left here with me
trying to grab your little piece of mind
no two days are quite the same
but i cant hold it
not when i need it
i waited for you here but you never showed
but i couldnt keep my grasp cause nothing lasts
you should never have to feel
'cause i'm exactly who i want to be
so i will quiet her
i will quiet her
and i wont be left at the battle front
you're reaching out
all my dreams are through
you're reaching out
i'd come undone
and i showed you what you had to do to make some sense
we cant solve problems
you dont know how you move me
it's hard to even want to try
something is beautiful and true
and i'm beginning to think baby you dont know
when it's high up in the sky it almost looks like
how does it feel when they have turned out the lights
when it's high up in the sky it almost looks like
'cause there's a hole in my heart getting bigger
and everything i'll ever be i've been
i've got a split personality
when it all goes wrong
i've got a split personality
it's time
super baby
lover you're the one
than my dream
i want you right where you are
my blood is still warm
my blood is still warm
before i take your blindfold off
i'm superdeformed now dig it
so wont you love me tender
that's right
we want you to act like nothing's wrong
yeah it kinda flies right into my face
ugly
this above all
some hide it
you can remember
but c'mon baby
this above all
and it took me years to figure out
then we were young and strong
then we were young and strong
didnt you need me
from the start there is a coldness in my eye
you just close the door
they make everything about rules
get older
you might be happy just to stay
if you dont know what you want
in the arms of a girlfriend
solo
you're only looking
giving it back to you
so i'm giving it back to you
half asleep
but every time we say we're sorry
i dont wanna sit in silence
think it only sane
these words of mine
looking in my eyes
are hardly worth it
we'll begin the race by living in ecstacy
break when i look at you
but the world keeps breaking through
the entrance to a place discussed but hardly there for you
an evil bigger than you could know
'cause i'm not in for killing another man
i dont know what's going on
but i do not want a war
though i didnt want a war
the way that you remember there was nothing to say
close enough to whisper as i soon hope to be
how cool in the evening when you sent me away
that i will never be free
is it gone forever
that i could be what i was not
the night is short the day is long
never have let you know
i do what i want to to
what i couldnt say love
but it took me a long time to see
i wanted to tell you
if time permits me
but it looks like i'm still trapped inside this space
yeah and do you want me
it's easy when the fear is real with the fear
ah it's too deep
everything fits but the size of my love
into your drug
i didnt think i'd find you
i didnt think i'd find you
i've been waiting waiting
and you
what we do or say
your desperate dreams
i dont like people knowing about me
or what i let escape from the place where you walked through
if you had to watch me scream and cry
watched you getting nearer like
i'm alive
i dont care where you've been
ultrasuede heaven made
ultrasuede
ultrasuede
seems useless for you to look for attack
all we want is on our minds
people in this world arent very kind
how long until you break
how long until you break
how long until you break
do let me grow cold
dont let me go on
cuts through my dreams
but i died an early death
does this mean i'll have to stop pretending that i'm not scared of heights now
each time i take a little bit take a little bit
fade
to absolute freedom
to absolute freedom
to absolute freedom
what will the past remember
you're gonna change
you're gonna change
when people look but can not see
i watch you walkin on the other side
i watch you walkin on the other side
we lose another day
while time is ticking away time ticks away
baby we're the same when we fail in each other's eyes
baby we're the same when we fail in each other's eyes
do you wnat to show me something
so go on shoot your mouth off
do you feel one little bit
do you feel one little bit
and no i dont want to kiss you
and we arent perfect nothing is
to leave your feelings in the past
to leave your feelings in the past
waiting for love to appear when i feel again
waiting for love to appear when i feel again
mine looking away
you're working for
stay and keep it coming
oh i used to sit around all day
wind and the sun got together
wind and the sun her there
wind and the sun got together
could you be my little movie star
i feel alone
you've got to let me know
worse to live
i do too
and you only want to take me where i've never been
if mine doesnt do it for you
once your heart would own me forever
if you find something
you cant see how i matter in this world
even though i loved you
speak to me with your sweet voice
if you hold me in your warm hand that way
speak to me with your sweet voice
whether you're cold hot bottled or not
you picture a time that's other than yours
no single world can deliver you love
no single world can deliver you love
speak to me once or a hundred times
and i only tell lies
the earth she treat me kind
dont say that i believe you
i promise you it doesnt exist
no one else is going to do
when i look up in the sky
pardon me pardon me
i'm gonna put something in you
and i knew i was close to you
and watches you
they say it's you
if you dont need me
and treat me right
holding on to me
i look for you
i hear you say
and arm together
nobody's eyes are bright and starry
right by your side
was it all in vain
dying in my hand
in his eye
i think it's sailing
beating for me
not like the kindness that you gave
an empty heart that sees me through
it's not the same
i cant believe what i cannot see
you live your life
a stranger's heart without a home
beneath the water of play
and came my five string serenade
beneath the water of play
and i got nothing more to say about it
i fell asleep in the silence
not afraid
that covers
maybe i wont
and i'll hold you forever
and ever and ever
cause you see
people give me warnings
so i ask if i can hold you
and close my eyes til i see your surprise
i guess that hasnt changed someone
i'm over you somehow
cold outside burns a great big hole in my heart
count my stars
like two strangers
and two strangers turning into dust
make me feel it even if it aint true
look on down from the bridge
how could i say goodbye
you pick my heart with a smile
you're looking at fear
oh sweet mary of silence
cannot hear what you're saying
now we just dont know
do you know
well i wont really do you any harm
just like you said that you would
but you're so heavy for the price
shiny orshining on never again
watch me come down
she's the winner of her game
looks at my baby
yesterday was another day
be the same
come so close that i might see the light inside me i might see
does the wind indeed like me
come so close that i might see the crash of light come down on me
you really had a million hearts to break
that's just the way you are
you never got there even though you say you will
red oh red
red oh red
she should have seen the thing in mother's belly
some kind of complete
in the sunlight
isnt this so
is that what you do
i felt a little unfortunate
i felt like i'd been wasted
all day long
i did no right you did no wrong
that this would be my last goodbye
dont make this hard on us
goodbye 1000 times goodbye
i want to be honest with you i met someone else
in my heart you know that
i still really want to be friends with you
was turned off
a man without any valor
if you follow your advice
if you follow your advice
the speed of light trapped under my hood
the speed of light trapped under my hood
i'll have one more yesterday

music hank shermann lyrics king diamond
i will gaze you will know what is to come
we will be back we will be back
dancing the witche's dance dancing the dance
before the goat of mendes we all must take our turn
i can feel them closing in
were going to talk at the moon
ill smash you youll look just like a stranger
were going to talk at the moon
pretend dead in their sleep
unless you're in for the kill
why do i keep on doing this it's not for me anymore
sooner than later i'll see you all again
up then down i'm spinning around
but the song goes on and on
the wall of black
solo shermann wead
i've got to reach that door the number 6
dead again i know cause i've been here before
a little longer this time
a basket full of poisoned fruit
and it's way past her deadtimethe night has just died
dark lady coming out at night
death kiss walking down the long road
now shes walking back to hell with just her hands
lovers and mourning wife
copulation in the night
they dont belong where the flowers lie
oh yeah i'm devil eyes oh yeah i love my eyes oh yeah those evil
in the dead of night flames are rising cant you see you're dying
music lyrics by king diamond
osirisanubisi put my soul
or will i be condemned
my body and my soul
o thou of countless names
i was made a mercenary
i'd love to hear you cry
the crature behind the mask i wear
for i know him not so well
i wonder will he always stay
i cannot let it show no one must ever know
and the rum went down their throatswith a twist of wine
going downgoing down

you are the ghost of change and now we meet again
you are the ghost of change and now we meet again
they say you know the secret secret of time
gypsy you're inside of me
they say it's full of demons that satan keeps them there
i dont want that holy water i guess i'll never learn
but keep in mind that if you do who is it you deceive
let's go to the house on the hill
let's go to where time stands still
i was one of the mentally illwho stayed in a cell of his own
my brain is burning upinsanity
i'm so tiredlet me sleep
undress until you're naked
into the coven
darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
you took a chance now you must pay say your last goodbye
it is time for you to pay what's due
ohmelissa you're in my dreams
the time we shared
i want her by my side
ohmelissa you're in my dreams
i am alone in the dark when i call the demons name
i send you my demon to blacken his brain
a little of your blood
let us ride to the crossroads
let us ride in the dead of night
someone better kill those evil eyes
kutulukutulukutulukutulu
can you hear the voices in my head
i must finish this book tonight
that night i sold my soul to youto the devil his due
oh your majestythis time i have to know
to the devil his due
no matter where your hand may lead me
use me
lalalalalalalalala
your the one that's keeping my heart beating
jesus sing over me
say say what you wanna say
say say what you wanna say
am always on your mind
you're always by my side
if you're a million miles away
if you're a million miles away
when the world is down who are we to stand and shout
your faithfulness continues through all the earth
i wont be moved
remember
remember back to chorus
and there you will find
and all the above rejoiced
you're a child of the king
chorus
all great things come from
i can count a million times
my only shelter from the storm
i am yours regardless of
i will worship the one who tells the sun to shine
i will worship you
chorus 2x
i've been embraced
when i'm standing within your presence
i believe your spirit is alive and on the move
everything revolves here
enter in and place your feet on holy ground
yeah
i've held my breath for all my life
lord here i am again
but to a god who's calling out to me
and as i live this daily life
to choose this world over eternity
isnt that crazy
you're everything i cannot see
like finding freedom by surrendering can it be true
you're the love i give away
but that's okay
you're the love i give away
swore i would ask words just wont come yet so amazed at what i've seen so much more than this
this is where i'll find the strength to stand
i have seen the way this story's going to end
bigger picture taking place oh to understand one day
wont you help me make it through today
and other days i stand here asking why
i will hold you cause you belong to me
this is all i've got
no more no less
i'm just a kid trying to make it home that's it
show me the things that are true
i'm a one trick pony if you will
oh i'm a one trick pony
no more trying to run away from
of this love i've found
no greater love has ever been known than he who came to find the lost no greater sacrifice has
wont you shine on
wont you shine on
wont you shine on
but i have met the one who really is worthy
so long self
there'll be better days there'll be better days
still there's something about you
i will live to praise your name
covered by your love divine
chorus
now i am spoken for
if i've been acting strange
the change inside of me
words just cant say enough
it goes beyond the highest star
to write the love of god above
let the redeemed celebrate
we fall on our knees
there's a reason to stand
of every moment seems to have its worth rest assured life's not in vain for all things work
but i am taken back
unaware of everything
unaware of my shame
but glorifying your name
the only thing that matters is
undone
holding high my chains undone
holding high my chains undone
and i'm undone
oh i swear the angels sang
when you spoke my name
when you spoke my name
well i have arrived
in hopes that one more day is justified
i'm stepping out so come what may
cause deep inside i know that i cannot rely
where you lead me i give my life away
the last thing i need is to be heard
in your holiness
the world was put in motion you were on your throne you were on your throne
and i embrace
i'm gonna keep on living
for your glory
what exactly do you see that makes you want to stay
straining from the weight my heart no longer can keep from singing
chorus
i'm inclined to say there must be something more
she stands on the ocean shore
never been told the name of jesus
whether foreign land or neighbors
proclaiming peace and your salvation
suddenly i'm lost within your beauty
suddenly i'm lost within your beauty
suddenly i'm lost within your beauty
help is on the way
or could this be our lot in life
unless someone comes to take our place
if home's where my heart is then i'm out of place
i've never been more homesick than now
wont you give me strength to make it through somehow
come and celebrate his majesty
chorus
forever you are robed with majesty
let it reign
when your face
when that day comes
i can only imagine
it wasnt that long ago when my own world fell apart it fell apart and everything here inside
i feel your touch and then i know
going deeper still
i just want to be where you are
and i pray that you will use my life
but i promise you i will give you all there is
long before i learned to breathe
and though i'm living a good life
that becomes my legacy
i'll embrace every moment i'm given
chorus
j marshall k vanderhoof
i've fallen down while playing ball
a human life's a gift from god
abuse is from the pit of hell
do people feel humanity is something of the past
a neighborhood or dmz but people call it home
amidst a subtle war that's right outside your door
more cover ups legal deceit there is no one in power who can destroy me
any price they'll pay to me pay to me
the forgotten man wanders misplaced in the world
everything you've worked for and everything you've done
the doorways that they dwell in are shelter in the night
all alone again
as the world awakens me so hard my values have been changed
as the world awakens me so hard my values have been changed
as the world awakens me so hard my values have been changed
we form tonight we kill tonight
what will we do with a steam something nation
struck out now the bodies just like remnants
hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to oblivion
i've always thought when you grow up somehow you get wise
what looks like it's harmless is rotten inside
we split the planet with atomic bursts
to withstand the dark attack
will we make it back beyond the black
i bet you fear the loss
all forgotten heroes lost and crippled dancers
i'm your conductor what's your destination
if you never quite belonged
it's hard enough to live my life why dont you live your own
i'll pay you soon as i get paid the check is in the mail
someday i'll get ahead of things and life will be so grand
i cant even afford to pay attention
and seen more than he wants to see
the things he's learned today
they need a place to get away
another shot another pill
just pay your bill on time
you sickly and decrepit ones
i'm a healer
i took the easy way out
flee from reality
delivering my resignation
no one to be his savior from the vises he made
you got me down on my knees
the devil is on the loose
you gave to us their fire but who was watching you
gods of wrath
inaudible hockey's fine by you
god come down gods are before you
they got their men promoted before it's time
you're at the cemetary feeling all alone
bloody mary the drink of choice for those who dabble
you are just the right type a little bit closer my dear
i'm trapped in the pressure cooker
too many potions in my cabinet
dont pull this shit with me
too many potions in my cabinet
the enemy you're looking for is laughing all the while
you know the last words that they spoke were who loves me
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
nothin left to hide
get up off the floor
your lies are open now
from a blue sky falling
my family they have seen the battles
to bring destruction
the sea of dead and dying increases by the day
a few more years a few more tears
are we the losers in the game
we'll not be losers in the game
congregation rises starts to chant a hymn
no use in speaking out against anything we do
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells m dodson
they've got you in their sights
suddenly you think you're so bold
i would bide my time
you were a patriot's son
to try to end your life
a friend of mine is the first one out to check
what makes you hate the difference
hide behind your bedclothes meet in some secret place
all men created equal all have human rights
touched in such a wicked way
that will destroy me
it is the eye
forced to live with my fear
how can he stand to bear the pounding of his heart
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
you know they're just a pack of lies
keep chasing all your dreams
keep chasing all your dreams
what is real
you dont care what they say or what they do
you cant seem to get it right
someday you will die
the best money can buy
disaster along starboard side
women and children first
the orchestra played to the last moment
i just love to see my parents flee
like a ship that's built for destruction
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
'cause i'm shakin and i'm thinkin
then something black and very fast
of something evil lurking
by morning i'll be dead
he wrote down it on parchment but alas no one believes
so many teachers preach a lie to the sheep who need a guide
you wandered throught the wilderness
one bowl for the wicked
remember what i've told you
here's your ticket
what gives you the famous final word
demonstations in the land
the human factor has diminished in oh so many ways
everybody wants to be a star in modern days
i wrote the book two easy steps how to succeed
when the human factor shows
demoralized servant to my every need
life as you've known it you'll be much too old
hatred grows among the ones destined to be slaves
blood begins to flow
i'll hit you like a ton of bricks
i will dare so i will win
taking chances
ton of bricks ton of bricks
it's far away at least for today
you wait for tomorrow to call
stare in the looking glass and wonder who i'll find
and oh lord i'm coming home
come whatever may
with open arms meet catastrophe
i know the when but not the why
the joy of violent movements pulls you under
i cant hear ya talk ta 2x4
into no one into no one
it aint my bitch
draggin me down why you around
aint mine your kind
hold it dear hold it suffocate
crush all within my hands
let you run then i pull your leash
crush all within my hands
control is love love is control
all blistered and burnt cant hide my disgrace
i'll split you to the bone help set you free
like a double dozen before ya smells so sweet
sent to avenge my mother sweep myself
power wolves beset your door
i cant believe the price you pay
so true
the ultimate in vanity
justice is done
their money tips her scales again
justice is lost
seeking no truth
like lesser birds on the four winds
behind the clock back there you know
the queenly flux eternal light
would find themselves at four winds bar
and dont forget my dog
just let me kill you for a smile
why cure the fever
yeah gone again

and satifaction this way comes
born into attitude

safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
i have fallen prey to failure
frayed ends of sanity
waves of fear they pull me under
hostage of this nameless feeling
frayed ends of sanity

nothing matters no one else
to the point of agony
blow the universe into nothingness

someone whose laughter i'll lean on
devotion forever
and stay with me until the end of time
help me grind this mill
they say that you're really not so prim and prude
after one or two lies
i've been a fool
i read the papers i read the news
maybe it's true
do it for the money
she's the boss she's the boss
she's the boss okay
okay i'll do what you say baby it's okay
yes she's the boss she's the boss
okay okay okay you're the boss
so keep on looking for me
find me in the palace
i turned around
now you're a notch on my gun
right in my favourite seat
you were so sensual and so inventive
i really love my sweet thing i cant give her up
i cant give it up
think about the hard times that you put me through
how much of the happiness can you really claim
that i'm the one who loves you
think about the good things that i done for you
that i'm the one who loves you
let it down now
lying on a ridge
is just building crumbled down
let it down let it down let it down
and all the love we saved
too far gone
she aint your mama she aint your sister
i found her crying and helpless we made a quick getaway
turn the girl loose
until you use me up
oh you get me in a crowd of high class people
and dont tell me how to
'cause i could get used to
so dont put your arms around me
just use your heart not your head
'cause i could get used to
i said oh am i running in a race
i kissed the mona lisa and i breakfasted with kings
i'm a wandering spirit there's no place that
i'm a wandering spirit no escape no parole
and keep our children safe and sure
we just wait for the shout
and the tanks all roll out
i'm gonna sharpen my nails and primp up real cute
we hit the high life
i'll be drowning my sorrows banging my box
how can i think when you puke up your guts i'll be juiced
it's so insane right before you crack
i can see your monster makes you shake and tweeze
next time around
have i not bowed
just take my frozen hand
your black uncaring eyes
divinity burns in thunder
open me
leave the village lights step into the night
lay me down
and so now your time's come for me girl
the fields of blood i'd left
made me fight for you made me die for you
she is a walking tall saint
she's coming
and i will love him to my wicked death
i'm coming through
down to the bone now
young women fall and die at your feet
where were you on our wedding day
whoa oh give me back my ring whoa oh
'til death overtake me in the chase
i will witness your leaving
through purity and through light
we are hers when we are bleeding
they hunger for the life of me
everywhere i am heard
you were only playing with my heart
in your eyes i thought i saw my heaven
you take it for granted
breathe dont hold your breath
you feel high you feel low
breathe dont hold your breath you might be next
so brace yourself
every step along the track
throws his burden down
there the grail remains
how many creatures live inside you
at the trumpets of jericho
am i just seeing what i want to see
i'm at the point of no return
repeat chorus
creepy crawl
we've got to get together
we've all got to die
throw it all away
never let nobody dare
of loving you
i never let somebody move me
and that's what hurts
and i dont know what's worse
cause i'm lost inside of you
aside nocturnal trapping
a vile red heap
smell her wounds
i have watched them all fall
because sometimes we never die
and there's no going back once i do
i refuse to refuse to
so here's the key
go back go back
i wanna hear it say that you mean it
i dont wanna get hurt again matter of fact matter of fact
simple as that
you've been wondering
you've said it all already now
weeping with you arms around them
people fill your eyes
fade and wither long lost the fight
i'm fine
emperors it's time for war
natural born killer
until the clouds had blown away
i cant believe a month ago
you've given me all you have and more
you've given me all you have and more
how did i miss you how did i miss you
but no one else could do
i went through the motion went through the motion
and no one else would do
oh you could search the world forever
arranged by mark knopfler
but it's as real as the feelings i feel
within her breast but only sleeping
and the kiss in the doorway as you cried
and you cried and promised me your life
why i ever left at all
cause you'll only get so far
well you're not far away
a single strobe ignites the night
bring on the night
leaves them in his wake
hot and feverish you face the fact
of youthful follies and changing teams
what she demands of you
it's bad enough she knows how you feel
or do you want revenge
let's go i know the son of x 51
proceed mission bride injection
prosecute and draw conclusion
revolution prostitution coming to ya
what's the deal are you really shy or do you think you really cool
cant you see what i'm 'bout
their lost eyes you lift me above myself
dementia of your deception
you product of your walking head
shut the fuck up

thanks to julia james for submitting
conceal the scab you dont want to show fate
bled for days
now this did happen once apon a time
his spells to weave and steal her heart
dont you know that storybook loves
dance the cobbles his abode named dis
please put off your veil
give back to nature what we first did take
harlots and sluts whores of our world
dragged out through war torn lifetimes
you laugh and drink wine of no great age
name before i die no person in everything can
great ones the mouths that dare not speak his
mark in my head my clean white bed it calls
for she will never rise
at her should have fled
touch you softly your warm skin
and cry out loud
be lost in me
the two of us
i'm lashed by grief
ten thousand suffering
this when i was young before i knew nothing
will open up
i wear a nice blue hat
my skin itching insane
sad tune on jade flute
falling drowning deeper and forever
throw me into the oceans mouth
my only sin
by myself and leave a gun
to wipe you from my eyes
to wipe me from your eyes
i'm wasted under you i meant nothing at all
come on come on take a shot
come on come on if you've got the guts
everywhere suckers stop and stare
under pressure to admit you're gay
say you will say you wont say you will
life for life is just the way its at
white bat is death feed it to pigs
but i will fight the distance between us
i dont need need you to love me too
i dont need need you to love me too
i'm on the run
blow yourself away
forever night
this endless night
can never disguise
despicably reveal
blood of nations blood of war
we're scared
blood stained lies
the lyrics
medecins du corps et de lame
read me kind words
ice as eyes lured my soul
steal the blue out of the sky
it seems like years
yea this is life once again
dont waste it it's time you faced it
this is life
my lust it burns deep inside of you
the devil talks to me when you're touching me
looking good stepping out looking for romance
only love for sale
to send it through the mail
i cant believe it's legal
so many have paid to see
watch out boy she'll chew you up
oh here she comes
and ordered orange juice for one
i'd say a lonely prayer again
no finer woman had lay before me
woman of mine you'll never close your eyes
be still my aching heart each beat you have stole
entwines and captivates me
you tried to turn and flee from my side
your eyes your smile
mother please please take me down
i claim your life on this night
sweet she sings sings her hymns
death all around him the flies the dogs the din
there he lay for his god a final time
urges whorish as ever
beware ravaged one
look for me among the flowers
lay my obscure hands upon you
down from your throne
let me out
to this once petrified earth
come to my bosom the help i bring
secrecy fosters passion
saviour lose myself in gods death no i cant
my pain sardonyx lays waste to your eyes
name with cruelty the mother of dying
and in silence would he pray
beauty is fragile and time eats at it
take me anywhere that you like
i need a soft flesh bed
deep inside your love

he said i know what's on your mind
they got a hundred acre dream
most of us have lost our dreams
but you cant have the waitress
there's a cowboy down in abilene
a man whose world's been torn in two
i'd lost hope
needs somebody
never gonna come back to me
never gonna come back to me
making me believe again
there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
the way you look the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
right now i think you see
are you all out of love
are you all out of love
that clock on the wall it rings it chimes
lord my get up has got up and gone
it's beer thirty a honky tonk time
momma used to send me over with things
chorus
later on that night i laid there thinkin back
the chapter or the verse
i'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
talkin to mom on the phone one night
i raise my hands bow my head
no this cant be
i believe
i'll be all right
so wait to see in your eyes
past the city limits sign
when it's quittin time
oh cadillac blackjack baby meet me out back
i see outloaws inlaws crooks and straights
makes some people go insane
we were born and raised in black and white
we were born and raised in black and white
he said its just what life had planned
chorus
oh how i used to roam
'em
we're right on track
something special like champagne
the day the woman walked out on me
and give it a womans name
how long can this keep goin on
i'm buildin bridges straight to your heart
wont keep us apart
i make a wrong turn down your road
i cant stop my heart
i tell it no then before i know it
my sweet caroline
sounds like thunder through my head
dont you think we've earned the right
pick you up at half past eight
she went right out and bought herself
i went back for a refill
well that copper clocked her doing ninety in a twenty zone
but she's a cool drink of water
every night your taking me back
the fire burns the site of her still remains
shake my head and i have to wonder
those bottles in the driveway and the bottles in the hall
your sweet lovin daddy or those lying eyes of yours
that cigarette voice asking for her big boy
when the weekend comes she's like a red tail light
that girl likes to get out of town
yeah yeah do tell
she's so tired of them puttin her down
ooh yeah now
she walked out on me and tore my world apart
turned my back on her love now she's long gone
oh she used to be mine
chorus
but it looks like that night fate proved 'em wrong
put her heart in my hand
oh she's about as lonely as i'm gonna let her get
while she's so sad while mr right did her wrong
she found out the hard way about him
she walks by and every head turns
but there's one kind of trouble that i dont mind
i could get jealous but it aint no use
she yells at everybody just come on along
and when he gets home he'll find
but once she made up her mind
and what once was sacred only yesterday
i drifted into town one day
somewhere north of heaven
i'm still running free
wish i could hold you one last time
but i'd wake up still in love with you
if i had the time i'd spend my
whole life dreaming
only a fool would wanna be that strong
oh another pretty woman just what i dont need
chorus
find a way to lay this hurt to rest
and maybe find my way back to her again
it was a foggy mornin south of san jose
still see her wavin through the radiator steam
livin for the moment forgettin all the rest
she used to call me texas and i called her norma jean
it's a fact that women like the one i left
but there's nobody sitting by the phone
it's a shame but i'm afraid the one i love
dont you think that i deserve to hear you say goodbye
dont you think that i deserve to hear you say goodbye
what she wants most are the little things
whatever turns her on
i might as well be playin with matches
aint nothin left but a few old bones
i think about ya and i start to speed
i know they say if you love somebody
climbin up a hill
sometimes i ask my heart did we really
on a wing and prayer
it's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
such a waste of two lives
you're trying to find
i'm gonna show you what love can be
i am that man
i got myself in this i'll get myself out
i stare at that door that you walked out
my mind wont believe you're gone
i know you said it's over
guess i'll go on back to my place
oh you gotta help me girl
i turn
i dream
it's out of my hands
you've stood too long with your tears in the doorway
just remember when you turn down the lights
he dont see what i see
not that long ago seems like yesterday
i close my eyes i feel your touch
i may never get over you
i sued to sing this song to you
i just couldnt play it
you say you love your freedom
if that's the way you want it
if that's the way you want it
tell him i wish him well
say that i think of her from time to time
nothing's changed
where's you old friend mr misery
oh close the door turn out the lights draw the curtain
stop me before i drown
and i'm headed straight for hell
well i'm never coming back
asking god to get you off my mind
it's getting better all the time
yeah i could have said a million things
i thought i had her wrapped around my finger
a little sundown buzz 'n more on the way
runnin wild gettin high
some cowboys lights go out
smokin tires through the lights
i wouldnt give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
a show stopper when she gets to goin out on the floor
i lost her trail on a friday night
askin bout a diamond ring
who's taking her for a ride
say they havent seen a thing
askin bout a diamond ring
they just look at you
must be in the cards
girl you've got oh you've got lonely written all over you
the wind is in your hair and we're nowhere to be found
i close my eyes and smell the warm salt air in memory town
take me down
we're two days south of the border
if we dont show for a while
the chips and the salsa are gone
and i'm still standing here and your miles away
i aint missing you
down this long distance line tonight
since you've been goneaway
built a pyramid up to the ceiling
jokin about my broken heart
i still need ya
more than a shooter
even when i'm feelin no pain
fast motor burnin comin over the hill
she's got it all and i got to have it
my baby's everything i love
you have captured my love completely
that led me away
while you ride out your latest storm
it's not a a temporary shelter it's a home for someone's love
top down burning up the night again
rocking to the radio underneath the stars
running through the shadows
you're my kind of crazy
my love will follow you
everywhere you go
my love will follow you
down every highway of your soul
my maria dont you know i've come a long long way
she is the sunlight when skies are grey
you're stepping out all over
you taught me how to hurt
be the death of me
what's left of me
on my side of town
i spend most every night
running wild and free
she'll come back someday
the jukebox plays on
there's always room here for
of a neon moon
i cant take but just one heartache at a time
somewhere down the line
the last thing you need is the thing that you keep comin back to
but one more roll of the dice an you're believin again
while you still got a little somethin left in your heart
maybe just one more shot in the dark
starin at the faces in her rearview mirror
we all get a chance
and talk about the stars they could have been
where we dream in red white and blue
our time is coming
steady through the highs and lows
i like kenny keith allan and patsy cline
crank up the band play the steel guitar
ha ooh hoo all out in the country
threw back a shot yelled i'm a george strait junkie
down that red dirt road
her daddy didnt like me much
and driving home tonight feels like i've found a long lost friend
call me the underdog of overtime
aw a cool one is a cure for the redneck rhythm blues
life aint all hard knocks a quarter in the jukebox
son i'm a sucker for the redneck rhythm blues
she got an a in math and never cracked a book
she says i got to learn to loosen up
but he cant tell you why
dont look back now
he's gonna see you cryin
the moanin of the rails
is gonna be a long way down
wondering what went wrong
ridin on a hurt train
i'm like money to burn and nothing to lose
i'll see her bet and i'll raise her one
mama dont get dressed up for nothing
a sea of coppertone's and hawaiian tropicana's
see jane dance
dance
but she's bound to fly away
you can try and make her stay
sometimes i think about how lucky i am
fight for the right to be free
i'm gonna walk on the road less traveled
out with the boys dont cut it no more
she said
somethin tells me i went too far this time
as it walks away
you'll never go unloved
now and then
so long to sad and lonely
'cause i way gone for my sweet baby
so strong and i dont mean maybe
rumor has it you've had trouble with your man
he had his chance with you now all i want is mine
it still aint history
you cant bury those memories
when love dies it dont rest in peace
he had to go and i looked at my watch it was 145
thought about all the winds and turns and mistakes that got me here
tommy got off at the texaco
to the levee where the party never stopped
he kissed her hand and took another drink
angel and i went to wave goodbye
no i'm not that type
goin wild an honky tonkin
she's just a line away from fallin
whiskey do my talkin
a shattered dream that brand new love cant fix
dont look back
finally got me thinking
i'm dead headin down from tulsa
i got the one i cant get over
reachin out with open arms
oh i'm comin home to ya
a love bandit of the road
oh i'm comin home to ya
i just want to hold you
what a foolish way to end it
chorus
repeat chorus
with a little faith mountains move
this old world it spins so fast
you'll always be loved by me
baby you're all i need and whole lot more
baby you're all i need and whole lot more
not much chance we're gonna make it
not i get this empty feeling
you're my angel you see me through
when i am weary and way behind
love is ever true
and never made a sound
with a love
feels good dont it
like lightning and thunder
and we can drive all night
got memories turning in my mind
let's go west
yeah let's go west
made my way down the hall
all alone it's just too much
when you look at me with those eyes
you say you need a fella who really can
hey i get up and i go to work and i got to work some more
if i got you well it's a good day
if i got you well it's a good day baby
bad girls go everywhere
chorus
from my four wheel drive to my cowboy boots
is to outrun the wind
well i'm a hard livin hard workin man
pardon me boys if i get a little out of line
pardon me boys if i get a little out of line
an man we had the time of our lives
but her west was wilder than mine
i knew i was losin my mind
as long as it's over the line
he'll hold you tonight but i wont
the one thing i thought i'd never lose
waitin on saturday night
hillbilly deluxe
big timin in a small town
country girl cuddled up
sayin the jews the gays the junkies
send gabriel and his legions
they say a holy war is comin
but in the end and in its own way
i aint thinking i aint drinking i aint crying
that's the honky tonk truth cross my broken heart
oh but baby i wouldnt mind knowin just
i aint been hearin your footsteps fallin
like the times that we spent
listen to the tears roll
listen to my heart break every time she runs away
listen to the music on the lake
i knew all the time that she'd go
van and willie went out one night
going out to the smoke and trees
where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
said what made you go and do that
going out for a look and see
she left with a driven look in her eyes
she was proud and so strong
well i know
she looks to the west with a look of longing
there's a long way to go
you've got your life and you watch it away
it's just another day in this old town
aint no big thing so let it ring
so get down aint no big thing so let it ring
everything would be alright
on the barren ground
then the captain said pour me another rye
what'll you do where will you go
hey now watch out run
go tell it on the mountainside
hey now come on around
they look away at the time of your greatest need
let me carry the load
let me carry the load
things were going so welljust rolling along
put on your strong face act like nothing's wrong
in a world where you never know
over where the paper mill runs
behind the curtain i see two shadows in front of me
i saw the country doctor to ask him what
someone soon must know the trouble i've seen
it's been a long time coming this feeling i've got
no regrets and it's on we roll
one slip one fall
many miles oh i may roam
wheels roll and the whistle will blow
there's a place
down the road over yonder
they said what they're doing
well what would i do without the nights
that's when i know i need you now
a little relief in sight
before i go to sleep
through the clouds it's hard to see
fortune smiles on me so
across the fields of gray
calm your fears if you're afraid
now they're passing out the torches
now he wonders
there's a fire on the cross
there will be no tricks tonight
i can see you shining with sweat
like to make you shake and shiver
did most anything we wanted to do
our faces as masks everyone glow in the dark
there's a shelter down at the veterans hall
what i come here for
sometimes you feel so small
sometimes you feel so small
i met a fan dancer down in southside birmingham
all i want from tomorrow is to get it better than today
if so i want to go
walking in the shadows
dont know just what's going down
long tall cool one
as he sees the color of the fields turning
just trying to stay afloat
close their eyes and let it all out into the bay
look out look out for the back room boys
somewhere between two worlds
all day long he drew careful on the paper
after school had just let out
b r hornsbyjohn hornsby
on the western skyline
on the western skyline
trying to cross her battle line
got the urge to jump on board
it's your life it's your world
looking out for something
walking through the park
your life and i'm just passing through
she found it in the discarded refuse pile
hey now where are you going
you reach out for me in the low light so clear
i believe they're out there somewhere
he'd pull up from around the back
jump to the top and pick off a dime
you'd just sit there silently
looks like a special night
ever compared to this
so nice to be here
get up
we better do something
or maybe a little flashy show
looks him up and down
that's what we're supposed to do
when he was the one
tomorrow was way in the distance
big man around town
i found her selling in a fashion booth
well she said she was
it's alright it's okay
hey dont you worry about a thing
got a belt and a mainline scene
says she's an actor but she's hooking
somebody's trying to blow you away
got a thing going on
everyon else has just come undone
they say cant we make you see
and me and my baby we're the talk of the town
predictors of doom think this is it
let's take it out hard till they show us the door
she sat there with that plaster smile
laying asphalt on the interstate
old friend dave with the silver spoon
in the twilight distance on the bay
there's a village on the lower eastern shore
it's a long race
dancing with miss virginia former
even interest me when they're just boring to him
keep those good songs coming
maybe it's over over tonight
where the talk is cheap
where some play from dreams
where the talk is cheap
i hope i'll be standing when the day is done
she loved the things that shine
havent felt a drop since you went away
and you're always drifting through my mind
the sky is light to the west of town
the river run high
and nobody waits for the tides to rise
but the hills out there so up and down
oh the coal dust sttles on the window display
another time and another place
oh i saw her she was sitting there
i see her in my mind and then
the show goes on and the sad eyed sisters go walking on
people watching as the curtain falls down
and you keep on walking
still without you the show goes on
hallelujah when you get to the end
all going down looking for the tango king
b r hornsbyjohn hornsby
we'll be out on the water
better times are coming up they say
when the seed is broken
we'll be out on the water
go deep in the woods down the low valley road
but everybody knew what they were talking about
when it all happens nobody wins
some things will never change
he said son
is the line on the color bar
el dorado riding on the fringe
leather skin
well i'm counting the miles
you might just not do
well i'm walking the line
now you'll do what you do
at the corner cafe
up down all around and all the rest
but oh my my when she walks on by
oh my my when she walks on by
my name is vernon james and i live to the south of town
i'm taking tickets and watching
i know that sometime soon
b r hornsbyjohn hornsby
what a time
what a time
b r hornsby
came a little early to go over their lines
it took a fair minded man not to wonder aloud
30 days 30 days out
30 days 30 days out
30 days 30 days out
sandy the aurora is risin behind us
and they kept me spinnin
and i saw her parked with loverboy out on the kokomo
and the wizards play down on pinball way on the boardwalk way past dark
chasin the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans
every summer when the weather gets hot they ride that road down from heaven on their harleys they come and they go
we settled in for the night my baby and me
we might'a got all nice and friendly
i can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone
once she was somebody's girl
she got time now for casanovas
and how expendable their dreams all were
a love so fine me and my baby
a love so fine
mama's chewing you me off about hanging out with alley trash
will sleep 'neath auburn skies
somewhere across the border
tonight we'll sing the songs
i know love and fortune will be mine
and all your dreams slip though your hand
tell me who is next to cross that borderline
todas las calles son hechas de oro
well dont move
at school
well hey man
in the summer that i was baptized my father held me to his side as they put me to the water he said how on that day i cried we were prisoners of love a love in chains
in the bible cain slew abel and east of eden he was cast
his ringing voice a soul that stirred
be free from pain and inner strife
a man content with home and health
still searching for his true reward
will come together when he cries
and all the little girls they wanna tear me apart
i got a fancy foreign car that rides like paradise
i'm telling you my darling
you're you're all i need
you're you're all i need
all i'm thinkin about is you baby
a sweet pair of legs got me feelin so blue
friday night and daddy's shirt is torn
whoaaa
all i'm thinkin about is you
i have stumbled on the plains
on the tops of the clouds
all just to get to you
not near enough
crossed the rio grande
raised in a good christian house
now i aint into fast livin
make it seem get out of this muddy race
making while we were blasting like a
i wanna do what aint ever been done
said you'd give me just a little kiss
i want it all or nothin at all
then shout out what you're thinkin of
well if you didnt look then boys then fellas dont go lookin now
now some may wanna die young man young and gloriously
it's getting late
oh i could walk you baby
'cause i can walk you all the way home
41 shots
it aint no secret
that you'll never ever run away
is it in your heart is it in your eyes
it aint no secret
and then the band played
and the sandman brings them dreams
and the little blue dot went away
so the kid goes back inside the station
angel eyes that devil sent
i wanna know who's her new number one
as the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
and hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress
but big bill and little angel they'd last on and on
just big bill and little angelyne
cat's getting fatter
pray they dont get worse
time to move on
another close loss
the bottom line is
you wake up
shrieks of sheiks as they run across the movie screen
with this great top 40 hook
'cos if what mama feels is too real papa says fetch me my flashlight
come the arabian night
check the band's arms for bullet holes
so get in and get tough or get up and get out
and with one quick jab he brings the devil down
now they blew up his house too
and meet me tonight in atlantic city
and maybe ev'rything dies baby that's a fact
they tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
and then they told you that you were conceived in hell
they had to see by touching hands
but i knew that they were wrong
only understand
buy me a drink and shake my hand
well night after lonely night
keep a searchin serachin serachin
i'm on the prowl
i keep searchin searchin searchin searchin searchin
but at night i get a burning burning burning burning burning burning
we've given each other some hard lessons lately
i'm the same old story same old act
there's a girl across the bar
propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks
now the boss dont dig me so he put me on the night shift
i remember wanda up on scrap metal hill
radio's jammed up with gospel stations
i work five days a week girl
i walk the way i wanna walk
and they watch us from the corner of their eyes
girl i'm down the street
baby out in the street i just feel all right
i'm unemployed i'm out of work
i'm out of work
to make a man lose his mind
i'm out of work
i' m on the outside looking in
yes i' m on the outside looking in
yes i' m on the outside looking in
oh then i kissed your lips but when i looked into your eyes
where the river runs black
the virginia hills have gone to brown
i search for you on the other side
i break above the waves
offers his lover's prayer but his soul lies
well the man on the street believes what the bible tells him so
those phantoms fly in strict formation
and he hears jessie calling to him in the hills
now the christian army awaits you
and he hears the prisoners working in the field
well i walked inside i ordered a beer and a double shot of whiskey and in three minutes i
i'm lost in the valley of the supervixens
beneath his breath he whispered a merry fuck you
motley crew you can guess the rest
i gave him my hankerchief pulled out onto the highway and as i sat at the light
nude nude nude
godiva and i sat and worshipped 'neath the angel above
i'm lost in the valley of the supervixens
i turned and i asked him how's the kids this year santa
motley crew you can guess the rest
i gave him my hankerchief pulled out onto the highway and as i sat at the
you may think i'm foolish
i love you for your pink cadillac
pink cadillac
but man i aint going for that
of your pink cadillac
honey we can park it out in back
right between the pretty lies that they tell
point blank like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
you just stood there and held me then you started dancing slow
point blank shot straight through the heart
giddy up giddy up giddy up whoa
down into the valley deep
well i'd sell my soul for just one touch
well now i dont care what the preacher say
he leads me to water but wont let me drink
well just as i got the preacher's daughter ready for a light
and it's haaaaayyyyoooo
and feed of the public hunger
and the black man releases his caddilac fangs
and the maid comes in with coffee and cake
and they ask you to bend over that they may anoint
and you reach for the sky and get stuck on a steeple
welcome home my prodigal son
all i do is think about you
baby from your love
i rush down the stairs
believing i cant live without
i see you waiting
tonight we'll drive that dusty road from monroe to angeline
everybody's got a hunger a hunger they cant resist
meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo
she's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
we take all the action we can meet
calling out around the world
but all her pretty dreams are torn
we're goin racin in the street
just searchin for a world with some soul
i want a million different voices speaking in tongues
this is radio nowhere is there anybody alive out there
if there's something you need
please let me try
everybody's got a hungry heart
everybody wants to have a home
she's a hot stepping hemi with a four on the floor
hey little dolly wont you say you will
life was young and things were easy
the lady was mean
a head full of clouds and eyes full of sight
for her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying
rambo he was blowin 'em down
late movie on channel five
oh feelin like a real man
hell any monkey can
my lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
if there's a light up ahead well brother i dont know
one sunny morning we'll rise i know
and bought a shrimp boat with his cousin
there he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds
someone said you want 'em out you got to burn 'em out
billy said my friend you're a dead man
kissed his sleeping wife
so he gave it a name
well the street lights shine
the girls in their summer clothes

ooh ooh growin up ooh ooh growin up
shouting victory for the righteous for you must hear the grace

in a world of doubt and fear
happy baby come the dark
tell her of my plea
she dont love me
but dont worry baby
so girl close your eyes and i'll be there
look out
now it's a sin and it oughta be a crime
and then they had the gall
and would be millionaires
let me take a look inside my magic book
in the alleyway you'll get ripped by strippers
it wont take much to kill a lovin smile
before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves
i want to look in their eyes and know they're gonna stand a chance
we made some small talk that's where it should have stopped
in a little desert motel the air was hot and clean
the road was filled with broken glass and gasoline
the next time you see me comin you better run
well mack the finger said to louie the king
he said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
and have it on highway 61
nothin feels better than blood on blood
nothin feels better than blood on blood
well i musta done one hundred and ten through michigan county that night
verse 1
and baby there's one thing that i have found
i've heard some hard lines i've seen some cryin times
so perfumed sweet and so obscene

my daddy said right before he died
in the early spring
on a summer night
and this darkness is all baby that my heart sees
got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot
i say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding
we swore we'd travel darlin side by side
if i should fall behind
wait for me
well now if jesus was the sheriff and i were the priest
he runs the burlesque show
well things aint been the same in heaven
well now if jesus was the sheriff and i were the priest
with his six guns drawn and ready to fan
i'll work for your love
well tears they fill the rosary at your feet my temple of bones
what others may want for free
it might as well bury
well my wife got another
he sits by the window
where the bluebirds fly

to do what they have done
i can feel it too
but although you wont ever let me in
and baby i've been working hard each day

through this city at night
i dont believe what i see in this street
hey hey city at night
tenth avenue freeze out tenth avenue freeze out
and kid you better get the picture
tenth avenue freeze out
when they built you brother they broke the mold
that attitude's a power stronger than death alive and burning her stone cold
off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a
like a young girl holds her first pimp he held his bible in
well his holster slung low like a hot kid sister
at night the moon stretched tight light 'cross the plains
tom joad come walkin down the road
they found that his family was gone
and he loaded up the car
they buried grampa joad by the side of the road
and the hungry little kids said
and then he got away
and tom and casy they did run
a deputy and preacher lying dead
that's where i'm gonna be ma
come the afternoon he'd take her wadin
waist deep in the big muddy
waist deep in the big muddy
i work so long that i'm a losin track
well it's a wham bam thank you ma'am god damn ring out sam
i got your neck in the noose and i dont give a damn jack
now those e street brats in twilight duel flashlight phantoms in full star stream
all them little girls' souls grow weak when the manchild gives them a double shot
and blow it into the sea
feel like i'm walking dazed
she has men who bring her anything she wants
when i lay down at night oh i cant get no sleep
nothing that a po' boy can do
well now you are my sun in the morning
long black line of cars snakin slow through town
tell me baby who do you trust
on the edge of your bed you slip off your blouse
hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
waitin on the ghost of tom joad
but nobody's kiddin nobody about where it goes
and the fight was my home and any blood was my trade
'til i felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone
well if you know anyone different then speak out his name
just let me lie for a while and i'll be on my way
where you gonna live are you gonna taker her away
we all sit down on the front stoop everybody happy at last
well it dont take no nerve when you got nothing to guard
better than the waiting
from morning till the day was through
could burn right through your skin
kissed his brothers lips and placed him in his grave
waitin on rain hangin on for love
one more drink oughta ease the pain
yeah yeah this is the long goodbye
california to the sea
shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind
kid sat at the table with his old man
with my machete by my side
and in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death
now you cant walk away from the price you pay
but just across the county line a stranger passing through put up a sign
and honey i just wanna be back in your arms
i lie in bed but baby i cant sleep no matter how hard i try
i look for connection in some new eyes
but for protection they're tranquilized
now i hear she's got a house up in fairview
till some day they just cut it loose
i'll be on that hill with everything i got
now mama dont you worry none
it's sad but it's true
well she shot him dead on a sunny florida road
i aint afraid of no grizzly bear
they say the tougher' get goin
do you love me baby
i'm a coward when it comes to love
there behind the morning clouds
this skin your fingers on my skin
i got a rabbit in the hat
this is what will be this is what will be
this is what will be
tonight down on union street
oh strong enough to save something
in cars rushin by
every face on that crowded floor
'till their strength gives out
no one baby but the brave
aint no flags unfurled
i'm lookin for it in your eyes
into this black river of doubt
and we're goin with the tumblin dice
sixteen hands from her withers to the ground
no corral will ever hold
summer drought come hard that year
'midst the harsh scrub pine that grows
i walked the avenue 'till my legs felt like stone
the night has fallen i'm lyin awake
some nights i go to the drive in or some nights i stay home
every day it just gets harder to live
like when the truth is spoken and it dont make no difference
i went out walking the other day
someday these childish dreams must end
that's if you think your heart is stone
circus towns on the shortwave
and the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along 95 96 97
and the strong man sampson lifts the midget
down in a mesquite canyon
we buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge
i stood down on the tarmac i was just a kid
'neath the trestless drinkin the beer and the wine
well me and my brother'd hitched a ride in joey's pickup to the edge of town
through the brothers under the bridges
long and dark shiny and black
tearing up the highway just a big old dinosaur
she came from germany to the usa
when i come knocking she smiles pretty she knows i wanna be candy's boy
when i hold candy close she makes these hidden worlds mine
i drop my kids at school in the morning
i do 'em all and i dont favor none
and then very carefully he'd proceed
now billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right
at their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white
stir them all together it's mama's soup surprise
well sometimes i dream of getting out of here
pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor
well in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched
there's a hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftin
spellbound and swallowed has the tollin ended
i take you out on a date
but i just do baby i just do
my little candy girl
with a note from the nurse
i love you like i do
circus towns on the shortwave
oh god save the human cannonball
and the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire

club soul club soul city yeah yeah yeah

your kiss was taken from me
when the tower bells peal
baby i'm countin on a miracle
everybody in town will be there
baby down at the county fair
we let the fortune wheel spin 'round
oh i wish i never had to let this moment go
i can hear the wild wind blowing

we set forth to confront the nation
and with hand held high to touch the sky

they say you got to stay hungry hey baby i'm just about starving tonight
got a little lost along the way
just around the corner to the light of day
just around the corner to the light of day
and calls out
when the midnight boys were stranded
chorus
that old lions mean and long in the tooth
after the music had stopped
the night seemed to say it was right
oh oh oh oh sha la la
on what tomorrow brings
kisses sweeter than wine
she said we could just sleep together
she unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes
his hair was the same muddy brown
dont worry darlin
beneath the dirty sun

the groundskeeper opened the gates
of somethin righteous goin under
none of this has happened yet
na na na na na na na na na
some jerk keeps breaking my connection girl
living on the edge of the world
because i'm living on the edge of the world
crying like he swllowed the fiery moon
i crawled deep intoo some kind of darkness
well now all that's sure on the boulevard
looking for a little bit of god's mercy
she said just a local hero
they make us boss the devil pays off
i woke to a gypsy girl sayin drink this

where the sword of orion sweeps
it's been a long time comin but now it's here

but now it's here
the sword of orion sweeps
and the moon comes skimmin away the stars
it's been a long time comin but now it's here
it'd be that your mistakes will be your own
well there's just a spark of a campfire left burnin
last night i stood at your doorstep
in town i pass sals grocery

sax break
and an eye on man
and an eye on the sea
and an eye on the war machine
'cause that's what i want to be
keep an eye on the lovers
he's just looking out for no 1

she said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast
we lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling
loose change in my pocket
well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end
chorus
that pure american brother dull eyed and empty faced
i wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
still breathing when i walked away and somebody said hey man did you see that
but you were the one who lied
oh you were the one who cheated
bye bye baby
and i know our love's on the line
love's on the line our love's on the line
going wrong somewhere
i went to see the gypsy the other night
roll them dice son ah snake eyes
he's a lucky man
down in lucky town
tonight i'm steppin lightly and feelin no pain
and a stranger in this land
with unsatisfied heart can you live
she sighed joe are you alright
chorus
as i draw near
and watches the salesman stare at my old mans hands
my dad he sweats the same job from mornin to morn
and it aint gonna stop till i'm alone again with you
is it the cry of the river
it wasnt the wind in the grey fields i felt rushing through my arms
a cop come along we give him a little race
well tell me why does a vigilante man
at night jackals crawl from the cracks in the walls
'but captain she commands the lightships that patrol the sea around the rainbow tips
he jumps a horse tries to get away but gets caught in his irons
and now night cradles low
it was torn and the yard was charged into a raging sea
and he thinks to himself
black jack poker and the roullette whell a fortune won or lost on ev'ry deal
viva las vegas viva las vegas
i walk in the apartment there's clothes thrown all over the place
baby all the sounds i heard even if they werent real
wages of sin well i keep paying
waitin on a sunny day
hard times baby well they come to us all
and the tears cried onmy shoulder i couldnt turn away
well tonight you step away from me and alone at the alter i stand
oh billy stares at cherry in the hall
walking in the street with nowhere to go
running past the graveyards in the snow
i feel once again
but none in my mind
when a bullet laid him low
she was not a shielded one
the war nurse left her soul
for it means destruction of innocent lives
war
what is it good for
war
war
you better watch what's goin on when the lights are out
but you kept slippin in late at night
yeah when the lights are out down in this dirty little town
just one taste wont do
my heart is breaking shaking what you got
oh yeah baby
if you miss me i'll be there
'cause without you my life just isnt the same
now that pretty form that you've got baby
and man i was gone gone gone
now it aint hard feelings or nothin sugar
somebody break my heart
i turn the corner and i drive down your street
i hear the guitars ringin out again
chorus
you dream and take the boy's home
but in the morning you always end up
dont make us some little girls dream
at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe
take his body to the graveyard and over him they pray
and blondes are fun
a red headed woman
a red headed woman
well if you hold me tight
i want a rendezvous
she said honey how's that feel
in the valle de dos rios
you're ready she said
in another world my little one
on late night movie screens
where whispering trees and dark rivers run
oh ricky wants a man of her
she slides way down in the front seat so the kids wont see her with him
oh but daddy ricky wants a man of her
went to his mom's mobile home where she took him in alright
chorus
pocketful of pills and his brain on overload
honey tonight i'm feeling so tired and unsure
sixes and nines
we'll be celebrating
in just another roll of the dice
little guns downtown in front of woolworth's tryin out his attitude on all the cats
closets are for hangers winners use the door so use it rosie that's what it's there for
and my tires were slashed and i almost crashed but the lord had mercy
we left the toys out in the yard
roulette i dont know what they're sayin
i'm the big expendable my life's just canceled null and void
but i've left behind the man i used to be
roulette with my kids and my wife
you say you're happy and you're doin fine well go ahead baby i got plenty of time

he who could romance the dumb into talking
and hey there serita

for the things that money cant buy
when the lights go down
a man who aint afraid sugar

bo diddley bo diddley's at the seaside bar
your girl leans over and says daddy can you turn that radio up any louder
she'll let you in her house
that'll bring you down
she'll let you come just far enough
so he put all his money in a hole in the ground
parked in the lumberyard freezin our asses off
and send you on your way back home
and a big plastic machine she was climbing on
dead
and a fellow comes on shouting free haircuts for life
i forget that guy's name but i know somebody said
you can buy it you can try it it'll help you in bed
third angel says do the right thing meat
walkin on wings all sexy and blue
the earth's so lonely sad and blue
but it's the last time that she's gonna be riding with me
now sherry my love for you is real
let the brokenhearted love again
she left me standin here just two foot tall
suddenly it's winter
when you came up to say goodbye
and what you showed me
hey baby

i'll get in my car and burn it up
her eyes are cold stone

oh mama mama mama come quick
oh mama mama mama come quick

we sit in the car outside your house
setting me up just to knock a knock a knock a me down
i got a bad desire
and a freight train running through the
i told my friends and neighbors to refer to me now as king
and we rumba'd in my sports car
i got drunk and puked up my guts in michigan
i met a woman
puerto rican jane oh wont you tell me what's your name
upstairs a band was playin and the singer was singin something about going home
jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see johnny up and putting his clothes on
we wouldnt change this thing even if we could somehow
just say goodbye it's independance day
now the rooms are all empty down at frankie's joint
papa now i know the things you wanted that you could not say
and you cant touch me now
there was just no way this house could hold the two of us
at night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone
the sky was falling and streaked with blood
may your strength give us strength
may your strength give us strength
may your hope give us hope
may your faith give us faith
may your love give us love
with my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
you get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
it's a hard world to get a break in
for just hanging around
'cause you can believe me honey that there's money out there
it's my life and i'll do what i want
it's a hard world to get a break in
remember remember

it aint no use in trying to hold me down
girl i will i will god i know it i will

into a house where the blinds are closed
every day ends in wasted motion
and it dont matter just what you say

his mama stood up and shouted judge dont take my boy this way
and let `em shave off my hair and put me on that killin line
up over the ridge came a white cadillac
and the magic rat drove his sleek machine over the jersey state line
they'll meet `neath that giant exxon sign that brings this fair city light
inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the dj plays
between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
and them tin cans are explodin out of the ninety degree heat
here she comes here she comes here she comes here she comes
the doctor gives the strange love but the lady she dont knock it
sometime
the lady feels the doctor's made of stone
big wheels rolling through fields
and all this darkness past
this train
this train
this train
who'll be the last to die for a mistake
whose blood will spill whose heart will break
a martyr's silent eyes
and you're the last to die for a mistake
as leah

one soft infested summer me and terry became friendstrying in vain to breathe the fire we was born incatching rides to the outskirts tying faith between our teethsleeping in that old abandoned beach house getting wasted in the heat
endless juke joints and valentino drag where dancers scraped the tears
remember all the movies terry we'd go see
for just the in betweens honey i want the heart i want the soul
and these badlands start treating us good
i believe in the hope and i pray that some day

sleeping in a shelter

because the night belongs to lovers
they cant hurt you now
baby down on main street
glistening down on the vine
out where the river winds
for a woman i can call my friend
your heart like a diamond shone
and cant stand the company
these are better days it's true
mama knows 'rithmatic knows how to take a fall
over hill over hill daddy dont you spill now
well mountain man if you can cut me down a fir tree
where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths
the seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the great plains
whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard
brushed her hair and kissed her eyes
with this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground
yeah he was blinded by the light cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
he said take a right at the light keep going straight until right and then boy you're on your own
oh but mama that's where the fun is
we lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
and the miles we have come
the world come chargin up the hill and we were women and men
with no one runnin by your side my blood brother
well i came by your house the other day your mother said you went away
just to say goodbye bobby jean
i'm standing in the backyard
from your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen
the dance floor is alive with beauty
i need you right now
i like the way you walk
boom boom boom boom
a light is a funny thing
the echo of his foot steps is all a friend would know
used only to divine
chorus
come back home to the refinery
down in the shadow of the penitentiary
you end up like a dog that's been beat too much
to go and kill the yellow man
he had a little girl in saigon
in the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway american dream
just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
and the boys try to look so hard
where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
i saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
but just dont look too close into the palm of my hand
me and wayne on the fourth of july
sha la la la la la la
for a kiss and a smile i'll give mine all to you
walk with me and you can have your way
and i'm gonna ride it
it's just a dead man talkin
beneath the summer sky
everybody laughed when they told him why
well they said that wasnt any miracle jack
if you didnt see it man you must have been late
dedication girl every way
they took all the money he made in his life
they chase us like rustlers like outlaws like thieves
a fireball of lightning that shook all our hills
and all they will call you will be deportee
and i'm just trying to survive
the smell began to rise
it'll turn your heart black you can trust
i've got my finger on the trigger
it'll take your god filled soul
the beat in your heart the devils arcade
instrumental
the beat of your heart the beat of your heart
rex said that lady left him limp love's like that sure it is
but girls grow up and throw their toys away
we're living in a dollhouse
but your little dreamhouse is runnin wild
a crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall
oh we're living in a dollhouse
we're making night tracks through the blazing rain
well angel wont you believe in love for me
i had a job i had a girl
she bought a ticket on the central line
there in the clearing beyond the highway
day after day i'm more confused
and drift away
i wanna get lost in your rock n roll

'till the last rains fall
and now i'm left with the wind and the rain
oh the year's have made me far too tough
the wind and rains forever mine
the wind and the rain is all i love
and the ladies at the office all silk stockins and rustlin skirts
i got my hot rod down on bond street
last night we sat around laughin at all those things that guitar
and i hear the word on your soldiers
noiseless and shoeless
you wore your heart like a challenge
and you heard about the highway crew
i know what he feels like
in a very small backyard
baby there will never be any other for me but you
i've been that down i've been that crazy
donald and ivana once swore their love forever and a day
now me and my sister from germantown
and the only sound at night's the wind
it's me and you frank we're lookin for lost cattle
and we'll ride until we fall
i saw above me the endless sky
from california
chorus
this little girl is mine this little girl this little girl is mine
that
but if you mess with her i'm gonna mess with you
this little girl is mine oh oh
so you're scared and you're thinking
all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
riding out tonight to case the promised land
but tonight we'll be free all the promises'll be broken
it's a town full of losers and i'm pulling out of here to win
out on the floor there just is no one cleaner
she aint no little girl she aint got no curls
you can watch my partner reelin
just as long as it shows my love any verse will do
said he wasnt any different than a thousand other joe blows
oh save my soul sweet rock and roll 'cuz i'm sinking fast
oh word is out word is out she's fast
and we all sighed
and he's outside pumping gas
whoa whoa whoa wo
whoa whoa whoa wo
that truck rolled away in a cloud of dust
tom joad walked down to the neighbors farm
they fed him short ribs and coffee and soothing syrup
the joads rolled away to jungle camp there they cooked a stew
and he met tom joad on the old river bridge
but the vigilante they hit casey with a club
then he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved
wherever men are fightin for their rights
so if you're rough enough for love honey i'm tougher than the rest
here i am baby right where you found me
and i'm trapped again
cant let the hand of fate
i'm trapped again
i'm trapped again
and it seems like i'll be wearin the same ol chains
trappedoh yeah yeah
and it seems the game i played has made you strong
you do the drying i'll do the dishes
you did the dusting i did the sweeping
but in a play where the hero has no vice
now we share the laughing we share the joking
that all i seen was smiling faces staring back at me
cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove
it's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love
or great american novel you see
they're gonna give my life a whole new ending
somehow somebody made a deal
and how i made her cry
at night i get down on my knees and pray
i got one kiss for you honey so come on let's go
i'll stand beside you we're two for the road
and she sings her love songs through a funnel
she swings on a vine across the state line
as the siren wails she silently sails
he wants her more than he's got the guts to say
two hearts locked in true waltz time
show a little faith well woman there's magic in the night
it's like the rushing touch the dirty wings them highway angels wear
there's something waiting for us down that dirty road
we'll dance all the way
make up your mind girl i gotta get her back out on the street
with their corsets and their old betsy ruffle
you lay watchin them off eat a hole in his cloth
knockin on each and every door
when i was a kid my only wish ws to get my line in him
i courted her and i made her mine
but on the far bnks there's always another forest
monday i go to work
without you without you
without you without you
i'm helpless darlin
talking about the weekend scrubbing off the dirt
working on the highway working on the highway
we lit out down to florida we got along all right
but when i look into your eyes we stand worlds apart
we'll let blood build a bridge over mountains draped in stars
now there was blood and glass all over
sometimes i sit up in the darkness
you can look but you better not touch boy
you can look but you better not no you better not no you better not touch
looking for something pretty i could hang on my wall
well i watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen
and now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
they bought a souped up jitney 'twas a cherry red '53
your head's spinnin in diamonds and clouds
you'll be fine long as your pretty face holds out
sax solo
you'll be comin down
that helped the union win the war
fed my children and made my pay
he said them big boys did what hitler couldnt do
to the mesabi iron range
here darlin in youngstown
that
well
like an empty shadow in the morning light
left clumsily at the scene
but everything is upside down
the times they got too clear
your own worst enemy has come to town
everything is everything
children are asking if it's alright
down at the first street station
but terry says no pop they're just plain heroes
like tomorrow the earth was gonna catch on fire
and the gang fought all through the night
just walkin hiking the streets of the sky
they worked side by side in the orchards
but if you slipped the hydriodic acid
there in the dirt he dug up ten thousand dollars all that they'd saved
so young and in love
so young and in love
so fine sent from above
seems right
something in the night
and burned our cars in one last fight
i want to get caught but i never do
but i drive by night
it was there in the shade i laid my body down
i can remember how good i felt inside
nobody ever sees me when i ride by
oh cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps
the axis needs a stronger arm
now the sons they search for fathers
believe me my good linda
they wait for that old tramp dog man moses
so break us now big mama
the axis needs a stronger arm
i'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider
love just falls part
now raphael rodriguez was just seven years old
i want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down
and though the northern winters fills my heart with joy
we crossed the land in the caravan we traveled with the best
and hey you're the one
time enough to cry
couldnt be all alone
talk to me my sweet
i got a picture in a locket that says baby i love you
we'll fill this house with all the love all that heaven will allow
they're built like light
and she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
so we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row felt just right
mary beth started to drift she hit the shift but she just couldnt get a hand on it
well if you've lost control of the situation at hand
bobby was leadin the pack he settled back and he got ready for the long haul
mister state trooper please dont stop me
mister state trooper please dont stop me
i wanna get caught but i never do
when our love was young and we were bold
mayby she's there mayby she's looking for me
i keep tellin myself everything's gonna be alright
in the end it was something more i guess
and i'm driving a stolen car
sometimes i can feel the itch
sooner or later it just becomes your life
lay my head down on the pillow
i'm dying but girl i cant go back
i hung a horseshoe on the wall
i'll make another wish upon a star
in the way i want you to
tommy still drives that ol pickup truck
chorus
at the texaco on the highway
gonna die young
i picked a bad day to let you go
waitin on lady luck to call
i picked a bad day to let you go
chorus
i just pray the road will be long
i made a promise to myself
i cant help it if my heart has started
and you still
it always looks the same
i spell out your name
for all the wrongs i repeated though i was to blame
all wrapped up in that hurt
but i must have been wrong
it might have been the magic written in the stars
going going gone
my only dream
so glad i'd finally found you
i've been way out here for a month or more
this helpless heart will always belong to you to you
still you have never wanted to change me
waiting for the rain to pass over
bright colored balloons in the wind
we agreed that it was over
out on the town
now i'm writing you this letter
broken heart
you know when you knock on my door
i'd love to be the way your heartache ends
take what you need i'll understand
didnt take long to find out
i know i must have took you for granted
it's always the same i keep hoping that you might
then darlin i just know we'd fall that fast so dont you ever think it cant love happens just like that
hey hey hey hey
at the break of day
what's with the attitude
if you want to drive me wild
and i've been wishin i could find me a wishin well
i wanna see the stars in your eyes tonight
me and the moon have never been so blue
and me and the moon have never been so blue
no gain in drowning in my sorrow
and get on with my life
and it's hard when you're feelin like there's nothin left to lose
is nothin less than love
when all she wants
keep on showin her how my world
teardrops could fall
and i could lose it all
chorus so please dont you have a miracle just
with so much more in life than i deserve
a quiet girl with green eyes full of fire
high school days me and becky learnin
mama flashed the porch light for me gotta go
i think i hear your mama callin gotta go
cause you know you can it comes so natural to you
i'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
my heart's sittin on go
but you'll come around
i was out of my mind
i was out of my league
what you meant to me
the stars are shining bright
their wishes all come true

chorus
the last time that she ever called
the truth is that he never tried
i can feel sorry for my friends they must be tired
that feeling just cant be wrong
dont know how i lived without it
but that's another song
oh the way i used to hold her
the truth in front of you so hard
this could be love
so lighten up and play along
just let it flow
when the times get tough what you gonna do
this town doesnt understand
there's more than dairy queen and friday nights
baby i just know it
it's easy to get bored
what do we care what they think now
the summer she turned sweet sixteen
the tenth time he carved their names
true love left it's mark
where they swore they'd never be apart
for just the right him
at the end of the light
i guess i'm the sentimental kind
and i dont think we ever said good bye
we could have been
only god's hand could have made you
that you'll always touch the heart and
you brought this dream
then you know how i feel
and you know that it never will
i never want to let you go
we'll see it through to the end
i'll be the one to hold you close
put your head on the pillow
lay back baby and close your eyes
and it still feels good

and his thoughts were purely physical
and her love was so dependable
wind underneath her pretty wings

load up on sex were movin on inside
he sucked the life outside of me
stop feeding me interpretation
there is nothing left
where the people had nothing but faith in the lord's hand
poor people like you got no money to pay
the whole towns hunger started closin in
when he held it to the light the great pearl did shine
with his knife strapped to his back down the rocks he crept
with zandro by her side not beleiving such a thing could be
when you and sleep escape me
ooh i just know that something good is going to happen
in the garden
but just saying it could even make it happen

she said
tripping on the water like a laughing girl
and you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
some wonder if life's
the way
i long to be with them
happy
dont you know they're seen
from all these mirror windows
on a diamond flight
and i'd like to be back on the ground
over the moon over the moon

i'm hanging on the old goose moon
alive and well
i lost myself
this is the land of the living

until one day a trigger come cocking

since we can rise
my future lies
in space travel
the future lies space travel
the things we do to the people that we love
how's it feel when she's out of your reach
all the fallen down angels

hair left morning wet
that we could have it all some satellites
we could have it all some satellites

om mani padme hum
severed hold
to make you bolder

dropping beads

it can really hurt
every old sock meets an old shoe
hey there bill
sucking your tantric suck
sucker monkey on a drip
she thinks that i was with my friends yesterday
mother stands for comfort
your silver grin
all your mental armor drags me down
all your mental armor drags me down
made me give
all your mental armor
how i'm moved
it always takes you over
battle sense to keep you apprehensive
heat broke no smoke without a fire
kilburn and california
you are cobalt elemental
you are cobalt elemental
this is what i need
that clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me
will never be mine
nothin in your eyes seems to hold me
someone has to answer
and i wont let you do
you're miles away
before you know
for all of the guilty to set them free
and no names mentioned
and i'm home before the morning
and no names mentioned
posing as the night
there's no risk
the soldiers soften the war is over
oh england my lionheart
oh england my lionheart
i find it hard to place my face
oh to be in love
and never get out again
and never get out again
i found out for myself
i found out for myself
out of this world
are you drowning or waving
out of our minds
and drinking kitchen paint to dye the winter
it's all so temporary
the harp that once to oombayga and family
the harp of tara swells
well that's the waste of you
a free man on scavenger
better get your feet back on the ground
it doesnt make sense sense sense
and my silver bullet
ooh i pull out pull out the pin
i love life
i'm pulling on the pin
with my silver buddha
i love life
and i love life
reaching out for that hand to hold
reaching out for the hand that smacked
is the earth beneath my feet
bring me close to you
seems real
watch the water bleed the soil
home is where you are
that's why i'm hangin round
it was such a drag to hear him
with my carbine on
is full of famous stars
yeah yeah
but it seemed to me the saddest thing i'd ever seen
and dressed as a rocket on waterloo bridge
on fire
but you neednt get heavy with them
there's room for a life in your womb woman
no we never die for long
oh mama woman two in a one aha
i feel they've got a lot more sense than me
a rubberband girl me
i'd be back on my feet
snap like a rubberband
two rubberbands wont keep you up
i'd make a deal with god
is there so much hate for the ones we love
say if i only could oh
and i'd get him to swap our places
and if i only could
if i only could i'd be running up that hill
there's nothing that can move me
i just begin

they think he's lost on some horizon
and he's so aware of all my situations
the man with the child in his eyes
like a stone
i'll tell my father

how's it feel she's coming up sweet
what happened to you
the way we break if there's something we cant take
the things we do to the people that we love
she said just take off my red shoes
but it's gonna be really happening to ya
oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be
feel your arms are opening out
they're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off
so hard anymore sometimes it can be done
there's something very real in how i feel honey
you'll never know that you had all of me
but i look for the light through the pouring rain
and drift away
i want you to know i believe in your song
then i'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth
do i look for those millionaires
and at first with the charm around him mmh yes
of the solitary heart
comfort me with apples

ooh i'll come in a hurricane for you
c

you've made a wake of our honeymoon
now as i'm coming for you
bang bang out like an old cherootie

an eye for an eye
they arrived at an inconvenient time
them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
we humans got it all we perform the miracles
half an hour

i hope you remember
what about edward g

in the breeze

all the things we should've done
i know you have a little life in you yet
all the things that you needed from me

take me up to the top of the city
i dont know if you love me or not
take me up to the top of the city
when there is hockey on the set
a little more fat and slower

there's something moving
over the quavers drunk in the bars

where
red red roses
poor little thing
deus et dei dominoinaudible
there's a stone around my leg

you cant hear me backwards
the red of the sacred heart

bad dreams in the night

wuthering heights

people you hate will get their hooks into you
but you still dont like to leave before the end of the movie
and we all fall
she goes
shut the fuck up
will eat your children and steal your thunder
do more to turn my joy to sadness
and if she's not gone she lives there still
we know of an ancient radiation
in a room all filled with chinese lamps
the flies and spiders get along together
there lives my stuff
i'll be remembered
i call my co star's brother
my talent feeds my darker side
i am an opera singer
when the house was standing
when the house was standing
dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite
well i have passed the test just like all the rest
you only tell me
so if you really love me
say yes
a million times i ask you
but if you dont dear confess
and please dont tell me
she'll be strong till the end
grab on please stay strong
do you wanna see the stars wanna see them at noon

you'd fload down to the sea
your demons would all be around
you would bury them deep in the earth
the land where you cant change lanes
the land of race car ya yas

is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket
how much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar
your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments
you'll never really kill it
is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket
how much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar
your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments

or maybe it's five
i'm finally cutting through this haze of love

still in love with you
who tried to break me with desire
i will survive
i just walked in to find you here
werent you the one
i will survive
and you'll see me with somebody new
you're not welcome anymore
i've got all my love to give
and wishing you were gone
is this love
is this love
she doesnt care
just as long as she still has her friends
it's such a simple machine
she puts the rest on a tray
she's got a silk dress
it's coming down
it's coming down
it's coming down
but lots of things dont matter
jane brings me lots of things
jane makes three
i hope i've got a little more time
if jesus saw me dying
still i build my towers high
still i burn this earthen fire
that sickly scent is always always there
that sickly scent is always always there
cancun
oooo ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

i've wondered if i could hang on
let me go she said
you dont wonder where we're going
we've got to keep this fire burning
long line of cars
i want to love you madly
i dont want to think about it
i dont want to hold back
i want to love you madly way
lovely lovely lovely lovely girls
la la la la cucaracha girl
took a shot saw them bleed
look at me i'm the lucky one

took a shot saw them bleed
the scattering flock
all full of desire
searching through your closets
meanwhile rick james takes her new
but she had a lighter
to let you go
for mexico
but she was the sky
i've lost my heart again
there's a building on fire
get your car out of the driveway
where are you mr fireman
we're comin in stand back
then they flap their wings at the last second
i dont see their last second curves
unless i see their ascent
then they flap their wings at the last second
it becomes important for me
mr mastodon farm
i love you
i'm gonna paint her stop light green
you dont own me
i'll make love to you right now that's all i want to do
though i just cant live without you
i dont know just how to say all the things i feel
though i just cant live without you
'cause quittin just aint my shit
baby you're never there
you're never there
your love was just a game
this roller coaster
ever ever there
no phone no phone i just want to be alone today
waking me when i'm asleep
no phone no phone i just want to be alone today
heads of state who ride and wrangle
learn to buck up
shut the f up
now clever feet that flicker like fire
i dont wanna
can cut you from their bloated budgets
who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels
now simple feet that flicker like fire
when we're driving in the car
i need you here with me
when we're driving in the car
left out last night got scared 'cause the thunder
left out last night got scared 'cause the thunder
watch out dont fall
shot in a little rain
avocados omlette pans
brand names fake rocks rabbit feet
canaries corn secret morse decoders
make great gifts for the ones you love
get away
get away
my baby my baby
hospitalize the crazies
it was a hell of a time it was a hell of a time
it's undeniably lazy
trying to make you smile
you're driving recklessly
take it all away
je serai blonde pour toi et trs jolie
il y aura beaucoup de soleil
il va me donner une trs belle maison
la joie
their prowess is potent and secretly stearn
he's going for speed
in his mind he's still driving still making the grade
she's all alone
who plays so loud
and night after night who treats you right
and you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take 'em home
got to play
i'm mad
they hate me
the more the thing will bite and scratch
some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
i wanna be your nasty bride
that what it was was really pure
and you can soak your bread in gravy
you can soak your bread in wine
i say always be waiting
the room where you still sleep
i wont
the place where we would kiss
of bein the beauty queen
i wanna ride
wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
alright
spinning round
why you say you music stops are not in love with me
when you sleep
or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife
when you sleep where do your fingers go
rivers are raging in your blood
hear you whisper
there's only room for you
there's only room for you
the same ones that i'm drowning in
but when it's me you lock the door
you tear down the bridge
then go home to kiss your wife
it's what you choose to do
they're pouring it slowly and steady
you think that i
that i heard
friend is a four letter word
she's writing she's weaving
but now you've gotta write them all again
you want it confront it
you think she's an open book
i need you here with me
i need you to be here with me
i need you here with me
the blood now critically proof neural cells fatally quenched
bleeding urine as the inflamed bladder rips
black star burning bright
shine on
glittering dark a sun in mourning
shine on
brittle tests eroded in hot corrosive succus
of rancid meat and writhing life
morticians implements to tap and bleed
a carnal cacophony perversely penned
disinterred and detuned
your usefulness isnt through
your remains dampened and fingered
pass on to ethereality
in a playground of grey your fate is sealed
now redevelopment lies in ruins
play hard like child's play
for a chondrin puzzle so quaint
so mystifying
with each cumulative piecing of commensated meat
an incessant game methodically made
munch the mouldy scabs lick the septic gash
the thorax infected with furuncles and boils
acholial fluids coagulating and thickening
if beauty is only skin deep
cross my heart and hope to die
cross my heart come let's cross the line
misinformation distortion make belief
lies lies half truths misinformation and
lies you believe them all
palpitations spew a foetus
ladling out aborted debris
the stiffening dead babe's crib
eat the cervical slop
stagnation in shrink wrap
grotesquely dismembered
finished with the fragments a mass of stinking waste
the miserable festering stiff
the evaporating reek of putrefaction gets right up my nose
rupturing your gallbladder
your nates purple and raw brillo pads scour and cleanse
disemboweling in my rage
liver bleached and soaked
brutally impaling your rectum this process i adore
grimly i dig up the turfs
to satisfy my gratuitous pica
caskets i grate
ulcerated flesh i munch
to consume
my larder's a grave
lyrics walker
a painstaking callous arduous task
hate is the law love under will
with no meaning no depth
the instinctual herd as fashion dictates
another generation under sedation
no individuality misinformed
lead
music walker
wont you be told
so let's turn up the heat let eternity begin
let's burn in the flames yeah
go straight to hell
a truculent shambles so severe
the exsanguine esprit snorted as snuff
skeletal groats triturated desinently
mucilage vapours toxic fumes to savour
lead viscous residue snorting by m amott
in the hallowed turf you lie just for the taking
extinguishing all hope of beatrific dispatch
seedling my rich harvest bring out your deadfor the soils to devour
harvesting the defouled to fertilise my soil
music walker
economic salvation in sweatshops returned from the east
leads
keep on rotting keep on hoping keep on dreaming
peculated in an ebriatng narcocis
music steer
the newly fully developed boiled as sprouted fodder
to fill the lower species' plate
they will bleed
lyrics walker
dont want your respect
your beliefs polarized
dont want your faith
polarized tell me what colours do you wear
you're infernally rotten to the gore
stinks like hot putrid vomit
and maturing damp fumes
a rotten gaseous expiration
deteriorated bloated corpse decomposure burning hot
as the cadaver is slowly wasting
get high on the rot
the same old lies
if you just do as you're told
no hope no choice
doing fine
believe the lie
lyrics walker
the doom watch ticks
in my own private year zero
in my room one zero one
the future is ours
miasmic fungus infests the small intestine
globular tissue decomposed hydrogen sulphide is evolved
visceral organs infested py rampant hungry larvae
with infestation of grubs
lumpen meat is hacked
dismember carve and hack
chunks amongst your thighs and rump crawling with tape worm
cranial fluids sucked
chapped commodones perspiring zits
hackne vulgaris spluttering pus
bubbling seething disgusting mess
in which all life is now appraised
draws out a morbid nous to bleed
on a coffin which is joined
always spelt out well
the roulade now pandemonium
epigraphic text a literary vex
whilst fresh still are the wreaths
exculpitation perverse artworks so unique
your ideology self delusion
you're waiting for tomorrow well tomorrow never comes
skillfully lathed for us to maim
chisels rods sharps and catheters
that love still exists
the loneliness of each day
that runs around us
saber quin tendr la culpa
ms all de la locura
entonces no me quedan dudas
para amarte a cada momento
when you fall asleep next to me
guide her with your grace
give her faith so she'll be safe
through the darkness and good times
let it fill my soul and drown my fears
i cant believe
ohhh a light
i was waiting for so long
oh it's almost blinding me
pre chorus
it's waiting pleasantly four steps away from here
in a corner of carolina
four steps away from here
in a corner of carolina
captain kidd who's smiling
est sur son ile au tresor
tu seras un chef indien
run under the sun my child
then i hope you'll understand
my heart with a melody
and all of the songs left unsung
and makes me believe
to all that you are
come and behold him
glory in the highest
o come let us adore him
when i dial the telephone
all by myself
making love was just for fun
by myself by myself
it's no good unless he loves you all the way
and for all the in between years come what way
oh i hope that it wont end though
you dont know how long i have waited
how do i get you alone
contigo me escape del mundo a otra dimension
and in my heart the love for you awaken
i'm joining you to discover what it is
amantes que el destino sedujo sin control
cent lheure
ce jour l
rushing like an arrow
amoureuse sur un ruban d'argent
and the radio and the radio
woman in love woman in love
who was calling me
amoureuse amoureuse
things we said right from the start
without announcing how much you love me
there's still no one saying goodbye
apprends moi
et dans mes reves
que rien d'autre ne compte
qu'on est plus vivant
apprends moi tes phobies
approche un peu plus pres que je m'apprenne dans toi jusqu'au dernier
ohh yeah yeah
you smile you smile
oh and then the spell was cast
in the papers
et souvent j'ai trs peur
dites moi au moins qu'un jour
plus de frontires plus de mfiance
il me faut beaucoup d'amour
people will make peace with each other and for ever
un nouveau monde o je me noies
la vie m'a tout appris
ce silence qu'on entendait deux
les paradis ne sont pas sur terre
restent les phrases ecorchees
lasts will be firsts
ce que les autres ont laisse de cote
dans lautre realite
his sole family was his mother
and the beloved child on sundays
j'achterai au marchand
for you beautiful mommy
on last spring brutal destiny
et j'allais voir maman
she love them so much
pour offrir les fleurs sa mre
but seeing him a nurse
tu les emporteras
on vit les uns avec les autres
but at the end of it
we dance ones against the others
on se comprend on se console
we're always alone in the world
but there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same
lets talk about love
venise 12 mai 1834
mais garde moi dans un petit coin secret de ton coeur
je crois qu'il ny a gure de milieu
peut tre m'as tu aim avec haine
afin qu'un jour tu puisse regarder en arrire et dire comme moi
a ding dang
got a trick
on on
flish flash fly
a little bit of love
and when the morning comes you'll be good as new
can go a long way sometimes
'cause true love is on our side
a little bit of love sometimes
this is not a night to die
asking nothing in return
as no one has loved
for the one i love
moi je te dis
je pourrais te rendre fou rendre fou
jamais trop jeune pour aimer
but you dont know the fire which lies dormant
si ce nest pas toi ce s'ra ta faute
will you again make me wait for days months
what does that mean
je m'en fous je m'en fous
jusqu'au bout
jamais trop jeune pour se donner
inside of me
si je regrette toute ma vie
if it's not you it will be another guy
lolita answers i dont give a damn give a damn
always get where we're goin
what it is 'cause
what is it
well it's new romantic
i guess i live with the fear
nothing our love couldnt raise above
and feel feel it in your soul
we can do anything make it
love will find a way
it doesnt have to make much sense
dont you know that
we can try
it can come all at once
no one even asked is something wrong
dont you find that ironical
it's not my problem so it's not my call
dont you find that ironical
why dont people seem to care at all
my heart has got to learn to forget
time is turning the pages
i can feel it right here in my heart
love is on the way
with sweet i love you's and some pretty lines
baby hold me in your arms
i tell you now
i need lovin proof
pardonnes moi si je t'appelle ainsi
all the children from my song
however i see you smiling
j'aimerais croire que ce prince joli
all those sleeping beauties
you are not alone if i sing for you
and that's you who learn us love
open open your heart ooh
come on and give a little bit
only a feeling can save us now
je partirais loin dans la vie
suspendus lchelle de linfini
je le peindrais ma faon
quelqu'un comme les autres
and i imagine him living in my decor
but even if i give it all all is not enough
quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versees
quelles armes repondent aux pays de nos peurs
if we would change things a bit only by loving giving away
if loving each other was enough if loving was enough
how can i make him read my thoughts
si lon changeait les choses un peu rien qu'en aimant donner
les portes laissent entrer les cris meme en fermant
my peaceful life where i can ear every heart beating
i would do a dream of this world an eternity
if loving was enough
i dont know if tomorrow has a day
but they cant point me to the light
it's just a little dream
and now my sleepy head your carriage weighs
yeah sleep tight
and sleep tight
i wanted to fly
to make my dream come true
quiero saber
sola otra vez
alone once again
i played to love without showing myself
sola otra vez
sin amor
eric carmen sergei rachmaninoff
salgo a buscar
sola otra vez
i want to know
alone once again
quis volar
sola otra vez
sin amor
once more without love
that i will always be
'cause with you i've lived
and now i will promise to you
cause with you i've lived

and i know i can make you believe again
so when you're feeling like you cant go on

it's a good situation
you and me we got a super love
gimme gimme gimme some of that super love
you and me we got a super love
you and me we got a super love
sur les passerelles lembarquement
we fill in the hold with steel with swear words
sur le mme bateau
des salles de moteurs des salons joyaux
all the souls are worried
everyone the same distress
ne manque plus qu'un signe du capitaine un mot
un doigt de champagne un toast au depart
to shadows to sorrow a bad alcohol
sur le meme bateau
plus de rang plus de classe plus de bagne ou de beau
on the same on the same boat
now look who's sorry god i'm so sorry
and every spot's hiding my scars
just when you think you know me well
i let myself go will you still want me
just when you think you've got me figured out
and maybe it's not meant to last
somewhere underneath your skin
when you're laying down on the floor there
what do you say
maybe he's in love
tell him
your love cant be denied
love is light that surely glows
tu as guid mes jeux
mon premier souvenir
et quand plus rien ne va
you the wisdom well
however you know it
so much love i have for you
time can pour on your silver hair
ten days and i'm all alone
and what i've got i keep inside
that's right
ten days i've seen the rain
but all i've got to do is
que font les amants qui se retrouvent
if you knew how much i missed you
j'ai ce que je veux
terre
promised land birds remember
j'ai laisse les etoiles guider mes bras vers ton cou
car ce soir j'ai touche
danse du ciel
dance from the sky
terre sauvage terre promise
tonight i touched earth
feliz navidad
from the bottom of our heart
we wanna wish you a merry christmas
feliz navidad
from the bottom of my heart
qui je souris sans la voir
femme comme chacune
lindolente et voluptueuse
femme comme chacune
revenir dans mes bras la nuit
lindolente et voluptueuse
that's quite a story
et de nos battements de coeur
the softest cloud the whitest dove
cross over to the other shore
the moon will rise the sun will set
nol blanc

the kind of love you really need
i'm not the one you're needing
i know i'd only hurt you
i love you goodbye
if only you were mine
so today i finally find the courage deep inside
till the end of time
these three words
till the end of time
there were days in the sun
i remember goodbye
that love still exists
the loneliness of each day
that runs around us
saber quin tendr la culpa
ms all de la locura
entonces no me quedan dudas
para amarte a cada momento
when you fall asleep next to me
tu ny comprends rien de tout
it is somewhere in between us
c'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se mlangent tout le temps
je suis quelqu'un de nouveau
c'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se mlangent tout le temps
it's for you also that i love children
des millions de secondes instantanes de bonheur
je voudrais tout ramasser dans des grands sacs poubelle
sinceres demasques fragiles et vrais de candeur
and i hear a voice say what's his is hers
and it feels so good falling into you
falling like a leaf falling like a star
and forsake this solid ground
i'd make you give them all to me
and no they cant take that away from me
i surrender
we'll make it through
i give my life to live again
i will sing i will sing i will sing i will always sing
ou qu'on est ivre
when i will know all about your gifts when i will know their weaknesses
i will always sing
gravee bien mieux que par une lame
heavy the sadness in our hearts
lourde la peine en nos coeurs
lead our children for the end of the times
and on my balcony
they are the birds of happiness
ou se promenent des fous
nauront jamais peur de la peur
un jour s'ils netaient plus jamais la
all the lovers gave themselves rendezvous
but in these days of conscious living
gonna make you happy
and if two people both agree
there'll be days when things go wrong
make you happy gonna make you happy
i'll give you love without the pain
i aint the kind to be untrue
comme il traite les autres
i know he's treating me
yes but
my live is rather beautiful
ou un film ancien
if it's true he forgets me
mais restez l
vous voyez sr'ment mieux que moi
de votre sympathie
but stay there
sa carriere c'etait sa vie
and even her hymne a lamour
she would live today
she would live at maximum
you who are chasing her shout
elle serait elle aussi
live my life like a runaway
yeah yeah
my way
i love you in the shadow of love
shadow of love
that's just the woman in me baby
mysterious femme fatal kind of stuff yeah
that's just the woman walking on you
you call a tragedy
you break me and as i bleed
to reveal what i've become
you call this love
this nightmare is not fair
aujourd'hui je prends lautoroute
direction aucune importance
i feel free
libre
if i ran out of gas
come all boys and girls
me i have my visa for the crazy things
vous qui cherchez letoile
you give me a chance
vous les nouveaux poetes
you give me a chance
the blue of infinite the joy of being free
you who are flying towards the year 2 000
i know it will yeah
we will carry on
a new day will come
everyone told me to be strong
i've been touched by an angel with love
i see a light in the sky
let it shatter the walls for a new new sun
hush now
'coz i gotta see my baby
loneliness i'm gonna leave you far behind
gotta be with him
'coz i gotta see my baby
if you ever leave me
just no living without loving you
there would still be air to breath
but you know i would have nothing
tout est prt pour mes amis
j'aime revoir mes joies d'enfant
et je songe d'autres nols blancs
the time when the good old man comes down
you might think that my world's been torn apart
we'll they dont mean a thing
nothing's broken nothing broken but my heart
it is the night of our dear savior's birth
o night o night divine
noel noel
we dont change
les instants d'innocence
que lon fait des choix
we get faces and poses of combat
which insists and repeats itself
j'ai copie des images
a prince a valet
walks in charlemagne worried
une petite fille
le temps de me regarder faire
a little girl
on s'est aim cause cause cause cause
on s'est aim cause cause cause cause
malgr beaucoup de choses
tout pour un regard ou deux
all that for a look or two
sans hsiter sans savoir
champagne en trop
nothing is too beautiful
on se dit que cette fois ci
a life without a story
it's the love it's an accident
we pass through a mirror
we pass through a mirror
one dream keeps you wondering
love will find a place yeah
one dream keeps u wondering
i'm looking back through the years
livin without you i only fall behind
'cause i need you right here
but i'm gonna run back i'm gonna run back
and we know we'll see each other again
the stage is a world of lights
du rose pour les tendres
arc en ciel comme la pluie
rainbow for kids
qui me font chanter le coeur
somewhere over the rainbow way up high
if happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow why oh why cant i
around seven and a half o'clock
ma malette
reproduce my silhouette
give me
a kid playing
another large black coffee
i lay down
donnez moi de loxygne
avec une pile la place du coeur
all the week
du building
i turn on my air conditioner
as every morning
je me maquille
compulsory accessories
the elevator
un enfant qui joue
while falling on the ground smothered by the air
i only eat
et j'expire
give me some oxygen
we bring to the emergency
me panique
always has the same smell
give me
to days shorter
quand mes yeux s'eclairent
when my eyes light up
prisonner of the wires of your secrets
de vous si doux
how much i love you
pour s'ouvrir
aux ailes de verre
for just a little light
ne s'efface jamais
dans le soleil
everywhere i see you
que je vis et que j'existe
that i'm not afraid
in the sunshine
que tu te perdes loin de moi
for some unknown person
je te vois
je ne vis pas
i see you everywhere
de paradis
from paradise
from that forgotten book
devant la vie
facing the life
virginie jolie
c'est la belle nuit de nol
before closing their eyelids
c'est un peu cause de moi
all the toys that i see in dreams
et tu vas pouvoir commencer
petit papa nol quand tu descendras du ciel
et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
i didnt well behaved all days
c'est pour vivre
that people create
musicians and king's jokers
it's for living
all those men that look for the shore
it's for living
it's for living among the stars
it's for living
that men once lift off
sing it
put your voice
mais la nouvelle
nothing's new
chante la
mets ta voix
sing the magic note
en arrtant le temps qui court
the other comes back
search again
you chosed upside down against sadness
et si jamais tu te perds
i'll be there i'll be there
back of your memory's bars
et si jamais tu te perds
i'll be there i'll be there
and in my heart there is no doubt
it's christmas eve and they can see we're in love
to hear my christmas wish
with the lights reflecting in your eyes
ooh you make the season bright
all my dreams are comin true tonight
baby come to me
but dont you know the stars you wish upon they fall its true
and the seven sea's you sail
no matter where on earth you are
like in the novels
et parle moi comme dans ce temps l
bien mieux chaque jour
like we used to say
les musiciens s'arrtent
i am scarlett
that caressed
la la lala
it was yesterday
matin solitaire
le tlphone
time which dangles
love falls short of love
useless stroll
mme un jour une heure ou une nuit
require us to begin everything over again
love falls short of love
you the traveller
my heart is cold
the taste and the colour of things
dis moi plutt comment t'aimer
i hear your voice speaking of everything
sand between my hands
tears if i was living without you
je veux savoir comment t'aimer
qu'il peut rester d'un amour si grand
que chaque jour sans toi
que malgre la pluie lhiver et les vents
que chaque jour sans toi
me fait plus mal
c'est contre nature
dont find a reason to say
tell me that you played it safe
coulda woulda shoulda
it's meant to be
oh but i didnt do that
just throw in everything you've got
i'm the reflection of your heart
alone in my dreams
dlivre moi d'un amour
and in front of everyone
if you want me free chain me
sors de ton silence et parle mon coeur
bis
but when you speak
what i hear is for life
first of all what's love
fais semblant d'y croire
tu crois que c'est
au milieu de moi
lamour c'est
du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets
i dont know what they want nor the sentences he says
even if he doesnt want my life
rien qu' sourire lattendre vouloir le gagner
mme s'il ne veut pas de ma vie
he seems to hesitate between a love story or a friendship story
about the progress he made and of all his projects
lui seul peut decider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amitie
on dirait que mon coeur est trop grand
only to smile waiting for him wanting to have him
even if he doesnt want my life
d'un magicien
of a magician
carabosse
some chariots
qui vous croquent et vous craquent
some things
des carosses
so many wonders
et tring et trang
carabosse
tout laisser quitter tout rejoindre un destin
goodbye tender years hi battle zones
the world is at your door and is making fun of the locks
j'aimais manger sa peau j'aimais boire a ses mots
et descendre et descendre au fond sur le carreau
i could wait for him here nothing is forgotten everything is gray
rendez vous when i will have eaten all my appetites
and laughing enough to die but laughing today
and laughing enough to die but laughing today
when you smile at me i see
hey of love
tonight to you baby i make my declaration of love
declaration of love oh
i feel magic every time that we touch
je suis comme une ombre
of my days and of my hours
alone waiting for you
que j'aime au grand jour
qu'enchainee a toi
open the door take me away
il ny a que dans lombre que j'aie peur
tire tire laiguille ma fille
ta robe doit tre finie
spangles letters diamonds ones
lailailailailailaila
and rocks your asleep father
tire tire laiguille ma fille
tes yeux se couvrent d'un rideau de dentelles
semer votre route de bonheur
lailailailailailaila
there was no one that you wanted more
everything you need
you will see i can give you
let me be the one to love you more
lika a country that i'm discovering
de libres
on dirait qu'il neige
tu sauras toujours que je suis l
you you on your mountain
me i'm the next door
toi laisse moi me battre
i need to hope
i'll go on the mountain with you
i woke up this morning baby
j'imaginais de mon cocon
his baby's far away
all the blues are written for you
words are burning your one by one like if
nobody knows nobody sees
i woke up this morning baby
j'imaginais de mon cocon
his baby's far away
all the blues are written for you
words are burning your one by one like if
nobody knows nobody sees
tout lor des hommes
tout lor des hommes
tout lor des hommes
tout lamour du monde tout lamour du monde
lady treat her like a lady
right in her face with another woman
dont sit and think you'll hurt her feelings
je vais
tu veux m'emmener loin d'ici
for tomorrow in the afternoon
je viendrai c'est sr
i will come
twenty past three i've well understood
je vais
toi surtout que je voyais
what already nothing else to say to each other
trop tendre aussi
i played to no longer be a child
trop jeune
et ne plus penser toi
trop tendre aussi
tonight
voilil y a deux jours peine
and you're looking at me
and i'm afraid of loving you
tout commence aujourd'hui
depuis que tu es l
love is in front of us
you are there
a labri dans ton silence
mais la bas
j'ai peur qu'un jour tu nreviennes pas
au loin tu nages
un amour pour moi
like a sun after the rain
un amour pour moi
like a sun after the rain
un amour pour moi
like a sun after the rain
a child
et a pleure
and it laughs
qui dpose ses perles
et a s'endort
of a world that persists
mais un enfant
a child
meme si je sais
la premiere fois que je lai vu
il etait quatre heures du matin
and we told each other lives
he sells discs in a boutique
where he has lots of friends
ziggy his name is ziggy
mais moi je laime c'est pas d'ma faute
je suis folle de lui
that i wanted him
he told me come take a coffee
in his head there's only music
in very very cheerful places
qu'il ne m'aimera jamais
de paix d'amour partager
la paix lamour la vrit
elle cherche le soleil
it hopes to arrive
a dove went for a trip
c'est pour la libert
de paix d'amour partager
two hearts ignite we're one of a kind
just when the world can tear us apart
here we are undivided by anything
la route est longue le monde est grand pourtant
times goes out of our hands
you're letting this die
and why that isnt what
drifting in one time
then tell me what does
the hope has vanished from your eyes
il ny a qu'un chemin pour le rve
there's only one word to say it
va sans larmes
ne crois pas tous les mots qu'on invente
va o' s'en va lamour
go without tears
go where love goes
que les dieux vous gardent
et le manque de nous
de paradis
from paradise
from that forgotten book
devant la vie
facing the life
virginie jolie
je cherche lombre pour danser avec toi mon amour
sur cette vie trop courte qui file entre nos doigts
je crains la nuit quand tu nes pas la
je prie qu'on ne me remarque pas
the rain the lightenings and the black cats
i'm wary of myself so often
je crains les saints le mal et le bien
i'm hearing your voice

chacun a ses habitudes
when i dont feel like doing anything
je de de de danse dans ma tete
every day the same words
je de de de danse dans ma tete
from everywhere they stallite us
j'prefere regarder la lune
les sirenes de police
je de de de danse dans ma tete
que nous lattendions passionnement
le bien le mal et meme le bonheur
et que la vie lappelle que le monde lattend
je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
je ne suis pas celle que les lumires clairent
je ne suis pas celle que tu vois
un peu d'amour sur la terre oisive
douceur d'un ciel d'amrique
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
promises in the wind
all that happiness that i could grab
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
you spoke too much
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
you spoke too much
je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi
i dont want
j'sais prendre un coup le rendre aussi
i know the winters i know the cold
je sais me dfendre j'ai bien appris
fight after fight worst after worst
je sais pas
try to grow some flowers the same i tried before
but when i dance
but you you cannot hear me
and ceilings scratch the sky
o' des bras me serrent
whatever the spot
sun fire on my face
ok for your lagoons all blue
tes mots tes tabernacles et ta langue d'ici
et les toits grattent le ciel
and the snows are perpetual
i love your desires i love your light
et les toits grattent le ciel
and the snows are perpetual
ok for your torrents your everlasting snows
et des palmiers sous le vent
i want camels mirages
where someone's waiting for me
montre moi tes edens montre moi tes enfers
et les neiges sont eternelles
and all children understand them
when you light them
leve leve
brise comme du verre
and the earth is shattered to pieces
jours de fievre
in our frenzied dreams dreams
je marche et je me perds
i dont see very far lit dont see beyond 4 steps any more
jours de fievre
in our frenzied dreams dreams
this girl who is flinging herself
days of fever
days of fever
stand stand
devant moi devant moi
and i'm burning and you will burn
c'est la sve le temps du tourment
consuming as in a consuming fever
devant moi devant moi
and i'm burning and you will burn
c'est la sve le temps du tourment
consuming as in a consuming fever
i'm the one who has lost her head
on our lips up to our eyes
consuming as in a consuming fever
you made it all right oh yeah
i'm standing in the light of day
and just a little bit love's gonna turn it
and it can free your soul
and just a little bit of love's gonna turn it
i've got to take the blame
and let my life be as it was before
just walk away
just how i let you go
au ciel des enfants
tu le trouveras
c'est comme les bateaux
are afraid of water
efface la pluie
to the heavens of children
all the mysteries
are like the boats
le monde est grand
nont pas pu secourir
nont pas pu secourir
surgit dans le dsert lombre de la callas
is not an easy task
que je range
il est juste il est faux
mineur et puis majeur
je joue pianissimo
one more step
but so long as exist
dont know where it's going
d'avoir fait sur son nom
cette drle de chanson
grave bien mieux que par une lame
heavy the sadness in our hearts
lourde la peine en nos coeurs
lead our children for the end of the times
things have changed that flowers get fade
even if in your dances others dance your hours
they say that today they say others do so
even if in your dances others dance your hours
i'll say them without remorse for you to still love me
your games will be ours if that's your wish
qui chantent dans ma tte
i want to sing them for you
i will go look closer
caressing the waves
ce que je chante est pour vous
can we unite a sacred lesson
let them dance let them soar
through wonderland and looking glasses
as the river runs through fields
you can trust with your heart but for time
hands pressed to each other that's easy
je prie la terre de toute ma voix
je prie les roses je pris les bois
et j'suis sincre j'prie pour tout
et tout ce que je crois
je prie les hommes je prie les rois
what the skies never see
je prie la paix linespre
et toi le ciel entends nos voix
hands pressed to each other that's easy
je prie la terre de toute ma voix
je prie les roses je pris les bois
et j'suis sincere j'prie pour tout ca
et tout ce que je crois
je prie les hommes je prie les rois
what the skies never see
je prie la paix linesperee
et toi le ciel entends nos voix
when we only have love
to burst in joy
quand on na que lamour
pour unique chanson
when we only have love
for the sickness of the world
quand on na que lamour
et rien qu'une chanson
then without having a thing
ce nest pas un
cours au soleil mon petit
ce nest pas un
cours au soleil mon petit
c'est ton voyage ton univers
in a gold and red sky
run under the sun my child
your friend superman will lead you by the hand
if alone
someone to give to
to whom i could at least give a call
to share
someone to give to
to whom i could at least give a call
je ne suis plus
the book of my fairytale
with whom all share
somewhere a perfect man
after lightning the thunder cracks
that happened to someone else not me
sooner or later it had to come true
when will you see what i want
what i want is you
you dont have to give me rings on my fingers
i need real emotion
show me what's it gonna be now baby
not a cheap imitation of love
maybe i was just an innocent
chorus
the orchestra was playing
it's like a machine at full power
je veux qu'on m'explique je veux quelqu'un
tu vois pas que j'crve 1 que j'suis vide
let me get off far away far away of all this
pour accepter nos nants
temples hitting it takes me again
oh retiens moi
tout pres contre ton corps
de dire je t'aime sans toujours
la chaleur de ta chance et loubli
aux jours de grand soleil
le marin qui se perd
tant que leau s'endort aux yeux des reines
rien nest vraiment fini
rien nest vraiment fini
right in front of me
to reach a new beginning
somewhere we couldnt see
in front of me
i had to fall to finally see
i had to fall to finally see
but it's myself i need to blame
but it's myself i need to blame
when i was a little girl
if i lost you would i cry
and do i love you my oh my
do i love you my oh my oh baby
oh night of peace holy night
clbrons ses louanges
dans les champs tout repose en paix
everything you are
if you cant be with me
every little thing of beauty
every tear that you cry
knows the wind
seul un oiseau blanc
ce que je pense de plus fou
he'll keep the name of my secret for himself
knows my heart
sans un regard sur le pass pass
oh mamy oh mamy mamy blue
and they come to tell me goodbye goodbye
you dont have to try so hard
riding on horses
oh baby
then follow the map to my heart
it was only a dream
du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets
only him can decide if we talk about love or about friendship
it seems my heart is too big
ca devait arriver a moi aussi
a cueillir d'autres fleurs
et je voudrais que le calme
my boyfriend left me
love still exists
the solitude i fear
everywhere around the world
c'est un garcon pas comme les autres
ziggy il s'appelle ziggy
i simply told him
to talk to someone
he's my only friend
every night he take me dancing
meme si je sais
on vit sans domicile
we come from nowhere
quand viendra lan 2000
when the year 2000 will arrive
nous
be happy before being old
mais au bout du compte
on danse les uns contre les autres
we destroy each other we want each other
we're always alone in the world
le monde est stone
qui m'fais du cinma
the world is stone
and let me die
ce soir on danse
it's the return to catacombs
and the day looks like night
storms are outside
children are like boats in the sea
all come clearer
the world is cold
all come clearer
i could never worship pagan gods around me
but the greatest gift i give you would be to stand by your side
you're my life's one miracle
with all the future has so much for you in store
i live for your desires
tought that i knew you well
chorus
but when i've been dissed
you been seriously misled
je ne sais o'
and other rendezvous dates
je vous le dit
soleil fragile
dans mon coeur quelquechose a boug
he left me
i stopped dreaming at least for today
je ne sais ou
and other rendezvous dates
je vous le dit
soleil fragile
dans mon coeur quelquechose a bouge
he left me
i stopped dreaming at least for today
ou comme un phare banal oublie
qui pardonne celui qu'on choisit
le vent la mer et les orages
rencontrer la chose magique
et je vois briller le monde
today more than ever
some shadows afraid me
et ma vie change avec toi
au got des plus mauvais jours
and i see shinning the world
on a beach all in clouds
against the waves against my tears
aujourd'hui plus que jamais
and my life changes with you
but you come to save me
from my worst days
et je vois briller le monde
today more than ever
i believe that the heart does go on
near far wherever you are
and my heart will go on and on
and you're here in my heart
once more you open the door
the endless confessionthe rise and fall
somehow i forgot how to ease my pain
would you do the same for me
did you know that i would play the part
your safe as you will ever be so hush my dear and sleep
my soul is yours to steal
'cause i'm trembling shaking
take me wherever you want to baby
my heart's almost breaking
and while we spoke of many things
tu es comme tu es ca me plait
ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
ecoute c'est important
ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
like the air you breathe
i just want it all
i want to be the face you see when you close your eyes
i would teach you all the things i've never learned
but i know that i can never cry your tears
and there isnt very much that i can do
i didnt change your world
and if you care about her
take this to heart
but she'd rather go than fade away
i'd hold affection
you bought me flowers and you sold me a line
there's no point to this affection
you talk in circles when i need a straight line
make me believe
there's no love
that i hold inside
of foolish pride
if only you could see me now
the freedom that i walked away to gain
you see above
i know love will bring you back
ev'ry second i live that's the promise i make
ev'ry beat of my heart ev'ry day without end
i will hold on all night and never let go
turning it over in my mind
there's no way out of this
dont you think i want to stay
dont you think i want to stay
that only we know
heyever felt like this before
when we're lying where we fell
when i hear no violins
ooooh baby
i understand that some things are better left unsaid
but faced with the past now i realize
used to be that i believed in love
i just might give my heart
i said i needed needed to be free
silent stars
but the nights alone can be
your heart would come undone
when you warned me not to throw your love away
if only you could see me now
if you could feel me now
i get wings to fly
filled me with love
i feel that i'm alive
when you call on me
all my worries die
i'm loving every moment with you
to hear you whisper
lovin everything we do
no rivers too wide for you to make it across
and when all hope is gone i'm here
and all of your days will be bright as the sun
i am your angel
i'll be your shoulder when you cry
i'll hear your voices when you call me
les ocans et ses naufrages
comme des toiles sur ta peau
j'ai vu lazur et les glaciers
j'ai vu des hommes tomber
comme des toiles sur ma peau
the spark that makes the power grow
i make my journey through eternity
every ounce of me must see it though
with all my love for you
dont give me that same old look
in his touch
how it hurts to need someone that much
there's a leaf on that tree
that unlocks your desitiny
there's a sky vast and blue
maybe meet in the middle every night everyday
incognito
incognito
far from here another life
loin de nous
far from everything
incognito
qui diront ce qu'ils voudront
si jamais tu me revois
loin de tout
incognito
incognito
incognito
incognito
sans frontieres
that my body froze in bed
but when you touch me like this
and there were flashes of light
if you want me like this
and whenever you tried to hurt me
and if you kiss me like that
there were things we'd never do again
and when i see you like that
and it's all coming back to me
it's all coming back to me now
i need a man
i dont need a husband nor a brother
i dont need a devil nor a god
j'ai pas besoin d'mon pere ni d'ma mere
i need a man
pour moi tous les chemins menent a lhomme
i dont need my dad nor my mom
j'ai besoin
lenfance est un immense ocan
and i dreamed long years long indolence
le pourquoi de ces au revoir
i was waiting i was waiting
doubts games and bad flowings
there's a lot of lives feeded from studies or science
i was waiting i was waiting
i was waiting to finally live
a peut t'apporter
to live and to give
go to the life
un peu de ton temps
without wealth and without glory
there are too many clever or hidden people
rejoins le ciel et lther
quitte ton corps et nous laisse
go join the other bank
deviens souffle sois colombe
vole vole petite flamme
oh to get to you
do i gotta get water from the moon
but even that's not enough
how do i make you see that i'm going out of my mind
in a world made of steel
and make it happen
and make it happen
call call call call what a feeling
i want you to know that we loved performing for you
i see friends shaking handssayin how do you do
like this is
when i need you
but you know i wont be traveling for ever
oh i need you
how they feel or what they say
that being with you wont break my heart
that's why i'll never say goodbye
i feel in your eyes
where does my heart beat now
i'm reaching for the arms that let me know
then one touch overcomes the silence
i've got someone to give my heart to
if ever the river could whisper your name
if ever a boy stood on the moon
a boy stood on the moon
i tried to swallow my pride
why did you have to lie
but i felt my heart start to tremble inside
cause i felt the trust start to die
why when i looked in your eyes
with this tear
sometimes i catch myself
i held u
i long 4 u 2 talk 2 me like u did
that night in the restaurant u spoke of love so openly

hey man come over here
that it's me that you've been seein
i'll give you something to hold on to
but sometimes life can come
like a fire burning bright
whenever your hope is gone
in the darkness of the night
desobeit desobeit
a stain an error and suddenly you understand
zora smiles at the sidewalks at the cars at the people passing by
zora sourit insolemment
zora sourit zora sourit zora sourit
cause d'une ambiance d'un lieu et d'un moment
malgr les stratgmes de nos corps sans dsirs
on s'est aim cause cause
in this thing called love
so dont surrender 'cause you can win
'cause love's gonna conquer it all all
and that's the way it is
everybody knows
how to fly
merry christmas to you
then all doubt i shall erase
show how i feel
swearing that we'll never part
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
i thought our joy would fill the earth
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
i thought our joy would fill the earth
i've done my best i've served my call
you made me who i am
so suddenly it's clear to me
let me be the first to say

deck the halls with boughs of holly
the good and the bad

so fill your heart with love and joy

oh and god bless us everyone
not just twelve days in december

first chorus

the sound of your heart beating
and since the dawn of man
as the world gives us its best
teaching lessons we must learn
teaching lessons we must learn
it is the power of the dream that brings us here
lead us to the place guide us with your grace
i pray we'll find your light
how much faith there's
we dream a world without violence
intorno e dentro se
let this be our prayer

oo cant you hear me calling
it's all because of you
you came out of my dream and made it real
i want to touch you
day by day
sun to sun
i'll find love again
these are the special times
as you and i travel through time together
the special times are the times i share with you
and through it all one thing will always be true
chorus
but baby this is serious
dont do what you're about to do
she remembers italy
to crazy love to infinite
is still giving herself to him
elle revoit des chambres d'hotel
there's the sun of life
des sanglots longs de jalousie
elle a des frissons de desir
la peur du mal lenfeminine
des nuits d'amour en nostalgie
tears full of jealousy
that talent for the music
when we sing well
que tant de gens perdus
quand on rend les gens heureux
quand on a chante bien
with a smile or two
out there the tempos appear
out there the infinite dances
the islands initiate into love here
le rire aux femmes aux filles aux eclats
le plaisir en ces brulants combats
in the dances and the childrens play
les feux d'en bas ce lascif etat
les iles initient a lamour ici
the fires from below this lascive state
i go where you go and even beyond
le soleil avait prepare ca
when i fall asleep against your body
qui me guette au bout de ma route
to love you at any price
love still exists
the world is leaded by insanes
everywhere around the world
love still exists
alors je nai plus de doute
and who'll live will see
love will take its time
i have so many things to see
courir aprs lt
love will come later
i have so many things to see
courir aprs lt
in the middle on a colourless hour
attention the ballet is about to begin
qu'importe les mots nont plus d'importance
you you make yourself velvet and your jewelry is shining on you
a look when she bends over and let show a breast
a little more alcohol and cuirasses to fall
j'ai du succes dans mes amours
from where i control my universe
i have my second home
au fond je nai qu'un seul regret
pour pouvoir crier qui je suis
to be able to create my life
pour pouvoir etre un anachiste
to be able to tell why i exist
toutes les bandes dessinees
pour son anniversaire
au cinquantieme etage du waldorf
they spent it looking
they have walked on broadway
pour pouvoir mieux rever
comme un oiseau qui plane
and when he saw
that we buried
and let myself die
qui tourne a lenvers
the world is stone
who build empires
in the middle of the night
j'voudrais seulement dormir
et que les rennes traversent la lande
rouge comme un lumignon
everyone was laughing a lot about it
come to the paradise tonight
suivre trs digne les routes clestes
rouge comme un lumignon
his sledge across the skies
as soon as will ring midnight
announcing santa claus
le temps qui compte est toujours compt
annes de trop qui m'ont vol
il nous martelle et presse le tempo
mme avec toi mme avec passion
i go around the world
i do a complete tour around
i go around the world
envolons nous sur une chanson
go around around the world
tous les avions nous appellent
on fait le tour des fleurs
all airplanes are calling us
la raison est un fil de soie
juste en fermant les yeux
on frolait locean
et j'ai suivi le vol d'un ange
who i saw laughing and crying at the same time
et moi j'ai compris la chance
my steps will take me back
there that i have been loved
en se levant chaque jour
a world where caresses smell good
bis
on entend on entend
the shepherds the shepherds
voyant la fin du jour
qui charment leurs amies
tra la la tra la la la la la
around the old fireplace
tra la la la la la la la la la la
quand marcher sans autre but
de ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer
in the other reality
plus assez neuf plus assez
nous serons princes d'ternit
et leurs yeux sont remplis de brouillard
les enfants oublis nont pour seuls parents
only the sounds of the main boulevards
ils ont froid ils ont faim ils sont presque nus
i'm living in a very small village
i'm turning around like a bee
ds le matin mon rveil
moi je vais tous les jours aux manges
from the morning at my wake up
we slumbers safely tear the mother
the murky caverns air so heavy
get down of your wire you the happy artist you the gentle pierrot
je veux embrasser tes ciels de lit
tu rves debout et tu restes pur au milieu des loups
avec toi
i want to devour the most beautiful fruits
que si toi tu veux rester sage je serai sage moi aussi
so baby close your eyes
maybe somewhere in the silence
you this lullaby
be the heart i know will be
the one that beats for me be the man
be the heart i know will be
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful boy
to see you come of age
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful boy boooooooy
unexpectedly
as the sun will arise
beauty and the beast
you're the one who saw me through through it all
you touched my hand i could touch the sky
you were my voice when i couldnt speak
you've been my inspiration
because you loved me
because you loved me
qui cherche encore
a child

to those who will suffer
beautiful days makers
that my name coils around your name
i'll have a blue christmas without you
i'll have a blue christmas that's certain
in the sky stars are bright
may these hours
quand le jour reviendra
'round your head
who deals in love beyond repair
the tears i cry
he's needed here
call the man
some place better than where you've been
i am calling you
dont even touch the ground
a million miles away
it makes me feel so alive
just dance dance mmm

it's him that just refused us
lamour est enfant de bohme
it never knew laws
tu ne lattends plus il est l
it comes goes away and it comes back
mais si je t'aime si je t'aime
watch out
the wind was making sing the summer
pastel colors butterflies
it was only a dream
semblaient vouloir toucher le ciel
comme un jour qui se lve
a smile on my lips
at least answer the telephone
in all promotion shows

making you a double expresso oh

je vais mon chemin
je prends je donne avais je le choix
i take sadness in airports
at my heart beats high rythms
did you give enough love did you show that you cared
did you give enough time when i was alone
it never happened to me
that's only waiting for you
je t'emporterais avec moi
i would bring you along
dis moi si je t'aime
tell me if you love me
i stay locked
how many people are asking for love
how could you wait another minute
find a way
their whole life long
love
it's just a game of love love love
so i get in the car
i can never give you up
to carry on and
baby baby baby baby
par un matin de mai
a morning in may
si bien que je ne sais
so fast that i dont know
i often say to myself
de ce matin de mai
of this morning of may
la ligne
avait les accents
avait tout lclat
of that century
et chopin la trouvait
and chopin was considering her
que souvent
est mon idal
the biggest star
la magie
they were doing for her
and i fly i fly i fly and i am
en amour
like in france as a bohemian or in china
and unknown stars that all have the name
comme en france en bohme ou en chine
like we go from country to country
comme on dit du ct de chez nous
i long to leave with him anywhere
en attendant ses pas ce matin la
a spring he will chose
pour qu'il ne voit pas
je ne sais s'il est grand ou pas
while waiting the nice weather of his arms
un printemps qu'il choisira
he will like that
calmer les forts
but we no longer see shadows
open with words we say
le temps na pas de fin
we no longer knew
pour jouer son bonheur
sur un vieux canap
de confier en t
je serais celle l
o les uns et les unes
et s'il nen restait qu'une
and i dont need any other proof
nobody wants to see it
tell me i should find another
no they dont know what he's all about
but i know how he makes me feel
he's not like the others
my sisters and my brothers
chorus
you hear what you wanna hear
that you're the one
no matter what you think i need
no matter what you think of me
let him know it's real
no matter what you once believed
you better keep your eyes on me
i'll learn to forget
just fade away
there's no right or wrong
i know that one day i'll find that feeling again
you're not the same
tout sera vieux
that it rotates with us
do the warmth and the cold
et mon seul ami
j'ai mon amour qui fait soleil
ma dernire carte pour te garder
mon amour changera mes nuits en soleil
building castles in the sand
i didnt know just where to go
just take me as i am so please have faith have faith
just take me as i am so please have faith
he'll be back here in my arms
chorus
and settle in for a good laugh
oh you never can tell
there's a
a tender soul who's out of control
an old flame still burnin
faithful and available
from my 19th year
exploding with passion
i thought he was dead i picked the lock
i found the lady with the alligator purse
so said the lady with the alligator purse
i just carry this bag because it matches my shoes
in the back of the bottom drawer
he broke up with me and he told me i'm not always right
he signed it i love you so i gave in
and i bite my tongue fight the urge to say it's my way
so while the words are still unspoken
and it gets easier every time
take your time
this can go go either way
everything changes
that i dont like you too
all the dreams you had
with everything you say
but if it really was all that bad
i've got a bright red sticker on the back of my car
and my grandpa earned his purple heart
that's why i've got a sticker for the us marines
so i hope that lady in her mini van
did truly love the mademoiselle
the little money comin worked out well
it goes to show you never can tell
wendell mobleymarv green
day one
yeah i'll get over you if i can only make it through
let the river rage on by and the wind blow
i realize how good i've always felt
so dont be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
destination nashville september '64
she only needed three chords to play those good ole country songs
and this 1950 gibson was emma jeans guitar
what do i wish i could undo
what do i want to say to you
what did i change by letting go
i really had a ball last night
i held all the pretty boys tight
that hadnt already been said
i really had a ball last night
so i just laughed it off
of all that we've been through
when you love someone for the long run
it's the easiest thing i could have done
go on and go
go on and go
after a long hard day
we gotta get good at givin again
it hasnt always been this way
hey we gotta get good at givin again
dont do nothin for him
and he watches tv
no he dont do bars anymore
dont you know baby love makes the world go 'round
dont you know baby love makes the world go 'round
i've got it memorized dont even have to look
just three hearts all waiting to see
there's a little house i can see it in my mind
good at lying good at loving
he's a good ole boy and i'm a good ole girl
the rest is in a garbage can
would give you a call so well hi
i've got to see what's up with scorpio
you dont have to try so hard
when i will love you
who didnt have a clue
you want to see the light
i showed him what a woman needs
he might even cry too
but you moved into our house of love
he's come a long long way
and i love you enough to let you go
if you come back someday
and i love you enough to let you go
that kind of life
she'd smile and she would wave
'cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us
i'd of told marylin you can keep that man
cant put my finger on
and if it's love boy i wont mind
oh we took our chance
and if it's love boy i wont mind
it was calmit was savage
i used to have so many doubts
it did all things love does
it was warm to the touch
it was
to turn this thing around
is getting old
it's not too late for you to change my mind
i forget where i am
and on mother's day i was nowhere near the phone
the reason why i'm standing here
i forget where i am
it's the song
just another heartache
another bad lie another goodbye
another bad lie another goodbye lookin for another
fight a little bit but we get through it
baby that's just the way we do it
we can take our time
i see your strength and how you shine
i dont know who taught you not to trust
he digs big band music and the rolling stones
sittin right beside him
'cause it makes him crazy
he was a rebel she was born across the tracks
oh but they had something on their side
it only hears what it wants to hear
it only hears what it wants to hear
are we over now
when you needed help like i did
baby i could never show you
climb up to the sky and pull down all the stars above
make the passion last every night
fill up all your days with sunlight
who'd lie awake all night cry til you were out of sight
i let it fool me once again
broke every vow you made me broke every rule
i look at them then look at us and see
but he loves me more than i could ever love him back
spent a day of our vacation in chicago o'hare
and look at this year it's been our hardest one yet
you and your stubborn pride
baby one night in las vegas
paintin them's such a mess
but i cant take the give and take the price is just too high
i guess i'll never know
there's no fireworks and no big bouquets
'cause we're right in the middle of it
last night i went out with some old friends
everywhere i turn something reminds me of the way things were
it never really is your car
everywhere i turn something reminds me of the way things were
and i cant swear to god i'm gonna change
and i cant swear to god i'm gonna change
and i cant swear to god i'm gonna change
i'm dancin in a sea of cowboy hats
i'm dancin in a sea of cowboy hats
did i think i could go through this world
i should have been living it up
there's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
track 2 time 413
across the railroad tracks
half time is over
as fast as she can go
she went out for cigarettes
your heart has a way of making you stay
i'm the voice you never listen to
in a sad country song
dont look in the mirror
but it's just like a red red wine
and i've been passin up every what if
ooo you're underneath my skin
you say you'd feel a whole lot better
but you'll know it when you get here
i'm on the southside of lonesome

but it's fire that keeps you warm
maybe i'm rough around the edges
he's dating a doctor with a gentle nature
when he's out with her he's never in a hurry
cause he knows how much i've suffered
once again like it did back then
when he said mommy you use daddy's glove
and that kind of love is hard to find
it's got to be here somewhere
we didnt give it away
it used to be here somewhere
we didnt give it away
and hid her earrings in his pocket
from the guilty lonely life she's bound to lead
they tried to keep it undercover
there aint a whole lot you can do
of the ones that came before
in the clothes that she'd been wearin
i'd gone to school with christine thuro
i heard that they did all they could
i swear i'll never go down there again
i said i know just how things are
and for years she's paid the price
till all her tears are dry
this heart of mine finally understands
now in your arms it's plain as day
i'm not sure about hell but i know there's a heaven
that i sing when i drive
repeat chorus
love that's gone by and the things i didnt do
that's what i learned from loving you
that's what i learned from loving you
'cause what if we fly
they dont come easy
what if we fly
it's clear to us it's serious
why do i do what i do
baby we better hit the brakes and take it slow
get these wheels back on the road
and our one dance turned into two
you ask me what's the hurry you say let's take our time
i can hear mama now say it wont let you down
but tonight i've wrestled with the devil
for some kind of peace
and i shall not want
but it dont help to ease an aching heart
i just want a little love
i cant help but look up there and wonder
wouldnt it be cool if all the supermodels tried to look like me
if one day you beg and plead for me to take you back
and one button doesnt match
i put it on and you just surround me
it keeps me company
it's so soft on my skin
lyin on my back in a cornfield back in kansas
your woman misses her man
your woman misses her man
your woman misses her man
and she shines
and i'm alive
always misunderstood
that make my heart feel surprised

out of control

rollin down the nape of my neck
it's gettin harder and harder to breathe
rollin down the nape of my neck
they always have
i wont be here very long
i wonderin if you'd do me
and just dance the night away
but i didnt mind 'cause you made my life worthwhile
but i'd never be the one to say goodbye

you cant do a thing for a love gone bad
you cant do a thing for a love gone bad
as far as i can see everything is still the same
it reminds me of the first night we make love
my heart will never know
as the night turned into dawn
and we let this ship set sail
girl you're all that i can think of
what if i dont say what's on my mind
we could be blessed without even knowing
that you're meant to love
what if we dont say what's on our minds
and i am the one

a day of this for all the treasure on the ocean floor

and as i waited for my change you know it hit me then and there
a million little miracles far beneath the stars above
is a life as ordinary as can be

or maybe this unexplainable smile
holdin it inside
you're looking for
and say no more
when i toss and turn
but you spelled it out enough
but in my heart there's never been a doubt
never been the quittin kind
she's right behind me when i doubt myself
but her heart belongs to me
sometimes she leans on me
any other way
you're exactly what i needed
your every move carries me away
when it's so much more than that

when the new wears off and the old shines through

i love you so much in so many ways
he probably told you everything
before you gave up on me
now it's much too late to say
but this time love

i'm sure your heart is telling you true
i know what love is
i wondered why you never called
and things are well here in room 28
on an old forgotten wall
now just when i started feeling
you were feeing lost last thing i knew
it's not that far away
so long see you around
sure makes it hard to walk away
paul nelsonlarry boonetracy lawrence
but i love what she does to me
it's a mystery that i cant explain
and right as rain
and when the road is winding
for sometimes asking why
when there's a distance
you deliver me
you act as if your leavin was natural as the air you breathe
i wish i knew
you stirred up a breeze that felt like heaven
i'll say it again
of sayin i love you
i'll say it and then
and how i want the card to read
got your picture up
you're beginning to get to me
the way you hold this heart of mine
cold bitter tears as a suitcase is packed
a few angry words you just cant take back
two hours late
of being nonchalant
she's got her two tattoos
but if there's one thing
'cause i love it
she taught me more about love in a day or two than i'll ever know
i couldnt get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
the frost on the ground in this tiny texas town
the morning air is cold sending shivers to my soul
i'd say that's right
will i love you for the rest of my life i'd say that's right
will i love you for the rest of my life i'd say that's right
some folks think that i'm lost in space
my train of thought never leaves you
i'd be a millionaire in a week or two
if i could make a livin out of lovin you
i'd be a millionaire in a week or two
from my hands
the door's wide open
girl i'll show you
last thing i wanna do

we even saw a couple on the movie screen
we still hold hands like we used to do

if we had an hour glass to watch each one go by
i'm sure it's something i cant do if i cant leave you with a smile
i dont know where we'll go from here there may be no way to fly
next thing you know we take the fall
but i'd never be the one to set you free
'til it's time for a windfall and not a single moment too soon
but it's the only game i know to play it doesnt matter anyway
son you finally got it made
looking at the back side of me
woopwoop woop
for gettin this far and it's the part of you
when you really just need to bend
another lover's moon will rise
that's just the way i am
is sure gonna put him through the trials one day
'til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
it's many the chimney that he'll shimmy down
how many children are watching the sky
we'd trim the treetops knockin a boot off
little bit of snow would fall
well maybe in whoville not me and you ville
oh you're a hard one
oh you aint gettin no younger
why dont you come to your senses
but it's right behind her eyes and no matter what she buys
you can hear it in the carols that we sing
when you're feeling inside out and insecure
miles an hourit's orbiting at 19 miles a second so it's reckoned
we're 30000 light years from galactic central point
and pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
when the rivers all run dry she finds the water
never was a man that ever felt this way
getting one leg up when it's said and done
one mans ceiling is another mans floor
most things i dont have a clue
to know i wanna hold you and to know that i love you
exit
you dont have to be standing on the moon
out on the highway flyin by me
burnin up the back streets tearin up town
the killer curves are gonna drive me to far
it was back when i'd still get things from santa claus
santa gives away to all the girls and boys
perfect little boy inside a man
when i get lost in the liquor
i dont know nothin 'bout tomorrow
we're not gonna lose ones
all ages hear the call
repeat chorus
and when i hear it i just cant believe i never liked the rain
just like the rain i have fallen for you
like the rain i have fallen for you and i know just why you
verse one
the town of old christmas
imparted right from the start
we are sharing his wisdom creating a kingdom
i'm looking for christmas in time for this
creating a kingdom for all
arent we all wise magi sharing his wisdom
see a little bit of tension
but i'll be swingin when i loosen up my
he gives her attention he's constantly carefully planting the seeds
if she gave in and worked this one out
she wants the kind of love she cant live without
i'm a horse without a rider
i know i've been through it all
and i've been loving blind
but it's not really me
but i've been numb since our last goodbye
and i knew things had gone awry
showin me nothin but the taillights
'til i find that pick up truck
stuck here with my thumb out in the wind
she hit me with a left and right
braggin on how it used to be
and how the world ever got used to me
one emotion wrapped around me
it's just as real as the wild horses
seems like it's never goin down
aint that the way the heart goes
i've got one more payment and it's mine
we're still the same
you'd have some sympathy
now i'm head over heels in the lost and found
i'd walk right back to me
most of them make sense
i hear that old cliche
has so quickly come and gone
it's holding tight lettin go
the way we work together is what sets our love apart
we help to make each other all that we can be
love isnt just those words we said
aint it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
it can make a right from a wrong it can make you fall in love
but it's not me
if that's what we have to do
there are no walls that we cant climb
but here in my heart
you're the only lock that's made to fit my key
nothin less than exactly
waitin on a shove
you're the only lock that's made to fit my key
get that old work monkey down off my back
repeat chorus
there's always something in between
so many people out running around
the shoes you're wearing
now i'm only five years old
but how in the world does he get in
i've got to check now i dont recall
could there be something i might have missed
clint blackhayden nichols
and i've had it to the gills of knowin what the nitty gritty's all about
the dark
there's room to grow under the mistletoe
dont want out if we're in the throes
say it aint say it aint just the mistletoe
but if anyone should ask from time to time
so even if i wanted to i couldnt stay
was just before i saw the light
i oughta know the look in another's eyes
somehow we sell ourselves on love
and they're always gonna be they rise and they fall
that's what i had in mind when i said i do
when i said i do i meant that i will 'til the end of all time
it wont be long before my ship comes in
not losing sight of why i'm up here alone
i thought my feet were planted
a fire in my mind
but there's no way of knowin where i'm bound
time after time
trying to change your life you change your point of view
feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
the memories and emotions that i've been through
giving everything i use to be to belong to someone
but i'm through holding back the flames
you're way over me
and wherever you've gone to
someday i'll need you the way you dont need me now
who's my character to be
all of your friends i hope are listening
all of your friends i hope are listening
guess i'll learn to accommodate
i have not the words to write
and they do
well it's 10 years later and still i havent a clue
maybe something means nothing here
watch my world spin round
my kingdom is all yours to receive
break the news out i've got to get out
the world's done shaking
so while you're tasting sin
when love is your constant
question your answers
it seems i'm bearing
memory
yeah you need to need to
can you swim now on your own
our love dissolve
i long to be yeah yeah yeah yeah
this time i give all to you
this time i give all to you
a collection of peace where we could live
can you see this disguise
a momentary refrain
counting the days yeah
dig it get it dig it what your looking for
all of your madness is crowded in my head
you see i'm living with a crowded head
to all of my questioning
now that i stand here alone
i'm sorry for the folly was all mine
loved in their own way
for what's in a day of a dandy life
dont think aloud
ambiance and vanity
i'd love to stay and evaluate
but my mind's become vile
it seems i'm losing ground
am i picture perfect subject tonight
am i a picture perfect reason for you
still turns to signals of distress all the while
in the next homecoming yeah
in the next homecoming yeah
for this night
no constraint
a melody you never sang
got a photograph of a smile
where should i go
well i would walk a million miles
she has yet to crave
she'll just have another perfect day
hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town
cant break now i've been living for this
should i thirst for knowledge
should i beg for mercy
take me out of these walls
i now claim as mine
are these times contagious
i weaken with each voice that sings
cause i will be your force
river will flow from scenes unknown
and i dont want to have your views on everything
well i dont want to be statistic industry
see i'm the one obsessed with truth and honesty
so she gathers rain
no longer will she hide
to wash and cleanse and make
to her days of youth
she said
because love she's never known
tell me what will i find
teach me how to speak
ease your troubled mind
it's simple
let salvation reign on you
you wont always get thunder
jesus dont speak english
morning like this
slow down to control
of what i've been missing
a little purer now
you smashing young man
i dont recall wanting to
and i dont know why
to see my world below
i'm going' for the norm
i'm diggin for the norm
to a world where madness craves
we leave an open invitation
out of sight beyond confusion
if ever you think careless is the night
see i dont believe in
no more sentence
shut your mouth
one more time
sitting while you world just floats around
wasting time
now she's questioning her mother
she has centered on the topic
find yourself another soul to hold
gods of the season
so tell me why it dont feel the same
no one understands me
what i'm trying to say
stands at distance still
guide me save me teach me
everything is suitable
as my seasons change i've now grown to know
to define my premonitions
round and round and round
color me any color
glitter to so mundane
how we came together
let it run now let it run out to me
yeah i'm coming round this world loves me now
generate
giving me thoughts that i may keep
i want more i want more
i want more i want more
who's going to soothe my heart when it's burning
i'm gonna let you sleep
'cause happiness is more than a kiss you know
'cause i got my piece of mind
it falls on me
you know you live by the words you choose
government is loneliness on this we agree
pick up your faith yeah everybody come with me
we could wake up and be laughing
until we find love
caution never heeds
hope we've yet to see
with my anger well defused
i was caught by your lies spinning
and the answers you seek
aimlessly around your consciousness
reviving just to crash and burn
once i was down and couldnt see
dont push me dont shove me
took a rented room on broadway
but you know we're never farther
one will get you where you're going
that we were through
just keeps on going strong
it's plain to see your hold on me
it's kind of like you never left at all
could you please take them under wing
use me to guide them day to day
keep us so close we wont forget
i swung that bat with all my might
as long as i live and breathe
dont you want to be rich one day
and there aint nobody gonna take that from me
you know i love you dad
all i can be is a sweet memory
while lying here with you
a ring for your finger so fine
all i can be is a sweet memory
could be the right someone for you
detours dead ends endless explorations
on that road that takes a man
cant you see that i've surrendered
heaven knows you cant be from
frank j meyersbernie nelson
any old stretch of blacktop will do
any old stretch of blacktop will do
this world has gone half crazy
too much grindstone too little time with you
you've passed up so many chances to walk right out the door
there's nothing more to say
the smoky mountains wear
hoping next time april may
i'm just an april fool
then you took me to st louis later on down the river
you know there's not much there to make you stay very long
blackbird singing in the dead of night
into the light of a dark black night
i hear your favorite music on the jukebox
you put a spell on me i guess i'll always be hypnotized
'cause that old blue magic still works like a charm
for me who'd love me like nobody else
girl i'll give you my heart
with all of my soul
darlin completely
whoa the cool cat knows how to run fast and play hard
you feel goodso good
the corner of the heart
you better hold on i am
well now baby this world spins too quick
turning the corner of the heart
i still miss your love
what matters most to me
what was i thinking
girl i shoulda known it
i said a lot of things
me in my rented tuxedo you in your big sister's dress
ohhhh there's nothing to say
oh i could die in your arms dancing with no music playing
of where i thought i was going
when i didnt know how to face tomorrow
for once i'm gonna rest in the arms of the unknown
i see how precious you are dear life
but i wont let it change me not if i can
billy mann
one last breath and a kiss
without you girl
it's cruel to take a fragile heart
eliminate the words i love you
i cant walk on
we need to sit and talk
dont worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay
you never change
you start the fire
you're a faithful old flame
many a time we will gladly take the long way there
all the places our love has been
and when i asked you to go for a ride
yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
i guess while i was thinking you were reading my mind
my kind my kind of girl
he said look behind your own soul
she had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic
maybe both lead her back to his door
i cant win for losing try as i might
i should've stayed in bed
the way it curled around when she was spinning
i got no chance if i'm not in love i'm on the verge
when she said there's someone you should meet
this was the day they'd waited for all their lives
repeat chorus
i found the sweet surrender
and forever's not enough no
that was missing in my life
softly you whisper you're so sincere
this empty house is so cold
open arms
alone and living sadly ever after loving you
you grew up in the city
she takes my breath away everytime i see her
saturday night she's like a time bomb tickin
whoa every day's an education
she's all that she's all mine
now she cant remember my name
first she'll have to let go
she saw through a white lie
when her time here is through
she's gonna fly
and i see it's still spinning round
well i do 'cause you put the stars in my eyes
i aint gonna lie to you
i know we said we were through
like a friend like a fool
i know we said that we were through
the way the world's changing i just cant accept it
where it's accepted and even rewarded
oh we've got nothing to keep us from start over georgia
though your pillows soft and deep
we're survivors we made through the storm
we're survivors we made through the storm
survivors in love enough to fight
are you miss behavin
honey now it aint right
sweet miss behavin
here comes that doubt again
this much emotion
one ship in the night
lee roy parnelltony haselden
well i got that deer in the headlights look
you know time comes when a wise man knows the best thing
that's my story that's my story
she just looked at me as she finished her tale
'cause there are people that you pass by every day
you know the picture was clear
but i didnt see any and i could see just fine
oh but dont you sit and judge me
i was sure that by now you'd have let yourself go
why you're drowning inside from the tears you dont cry
'cause you got a heart full of rain
and doing things
and eat your candy
almost at the same time
somehow i just needed time
i can let go now
every now and then
and lately i've been too confused to think
in everything i do
i'd made up my mind
i'm finding out how much i love being wrong
i'd a whole lot rather be herein your arms than be right
it doesnt matter who she is
chorus
i think about you
life's left you standing there
someone to dry your tears
and the wind is at your face
i pray this love song never ends
for the rest of our lives
i want to be your birthday kiss
i want to be there
for the rest of our lives
i want to be there
but if i said i didnt want ya
and those big blue eyes are too hard to resist
it's amazing how a little girl
and put 'em in a jar
i almost fall apart
but i wish i could
i know i cant i know i cant
who knows we may never know
who knows baby who knows
love's not worth goin through
without your love i would be lost
in this life i was loved by you
and i knew it was over
it could be that easy
to give up everything i own
it could be that easy
baby it could be that easy
across a bloody battlefield
maybe there's a chance this time it might last
to celebrate his birth and peace on this earth
oh it's not that it was so bad
girl it's not that it was so bad
you aint gonna have to worry bout nothin
im gonna love you forever im gonna love you
when i rock you in my arms itll be alright
ill be there to take good care of you
with your hearts desire
when we fall
are you scared to death
one more kiss one more touch
to a spirit that wont let him rest
in the darkness his big pony idles
and so i beg you
so never leave me lonely
and that you'll always
her sister works there and she'd know where to find her
she said i might see you in this old bucket of rust
i'm committed i'm in love and i'm desperate
she drove off with my heart i got to let her know
along the way i lost me and you
wait and see
jesus would forgive but a daddy dont forget
we had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
i read those words just hours before my grandma passed away
between now and then till i see you again
tears and sweat they build a home
on this earth without you
i'm tired of being the teardrops on your face
this aint the way it should feel
you'll come flying back some day
i can see it in your eyes
with all your boxes and your broom
you stole my pride and dignity
without a family oh they're just things
take one last look around
he takes it in he hangs his chin he ducks another blow
what ought have been written
honor thy children
all i need is you more everyday
but baby in my eyes you'll still be beautiful
you gave your love away
was his last chance to see what he'd lost
as he sits on the time machine
find yesterday
as he sits on the time machine
i just turned into an open book
got my reasons like most
like old jericho
with a wrecking ball sound
collin raye
till he'd have to face the fire
he never looked back guess it really didnt matter
to a slow and steady pace
so girl with that in mind
you see i've never been one for reinin back
too la loo ra loo ral
just a simple little ditty
too la loo ra loo ral
now i'm looking back on
when he drank too much
now that it's much too late to change
brent maherthom schuyler
i gave everything
and i hope that you can see
the way my life should go
i prayed for courage
these days i'm getting better
i dont always get what i want
i dont always get what i want
the city folks said hey that's not his
it wasnt like she got to choose
oh what if jesus comes back like that
where will he find out hearts are at
and talked til dawn
what the heart wants
when stronger powers pull two bodies near
broomstick fishing pole hanging in a puddle
if no one can convince them
on what they dont know
as sure as gods in heaven
as long as it comes from your heart
just know somebodys listening
fate is kind
a million miles away
i'm under your thumb
just in time
right before the beginning of the end
girl you're under my skin
oh
you always get to me
i wont leave the light on anymore
when i gave you my heart i gave it forever
you took me to heaven
and you'll be the last one
our first night together
like moon light on the sea
i want to hold you
i dont how you found
and take care of you
across the deep blue sky
he turns to her says baby tonight let's take it all
these may be the best days of our lives
tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
there he was just the way she's seen him
comin around again
so alive
comin around again
we can ride on the wind
my pledge is my bond
i made you a vow
no one
without
jason blumekaren taylor good
if you have a dream your dream can come true
if you have a dream your dream can come true
sheep are running scared tonight
just what are they looking up here to me for
unless you tell them what to think
they're looking for christ
they're praying for christ
by george harrison
watch out nowtake care and beware of softshoe
and all the poetry
of all countless questions
and all the minutes
it was the heat of the night
i got the ways and means
o you were a vampire and now i am
o you were a vampire
oh and if you took your love away
you're the only one who takes me wrong and makes me right
i knew that it would
she said she saw you in the store today
i wonder why i wonder
its seven o nine california time
today i went bought myself a bottle
make it seven o nine california time
if you think about me
but tomorrow i'm on my way
everywhere
i'm close to home close to home
i'm getting closer and closer to home
you were right about them all
getting dark and i'm alone
i hold you to my heart
we always seem so careful
and will we know it when we find it
dancing in the morning
are you there are you there
that you said goes ricochet
and still the whining of the wheels
i'm not the first i'm not the last
reached the point of no return
after a fair beginning
if you ever miss me
it was the wrong place wrong time wrong end of a gun
i'll get a badge and a gun and i'll join the pd
it's well after midnight
neon in the window
fly me
something to share so i've been told
feeling my feelings so out of control
or maybe i'm finally insane
wont give in
help me help me help me find my way
couldnt let you keep the wrong lyrics to the best concrete blonde song on
help me
carry me away
a price i swore id never pay
and you do not see the reason
are telling you so much
it's the border of
i call it love
come from above
but we burn like a house on fire
i dont wanna be your mother
will never be for sale
put your money in the bank
if he had another life
trying to make ends meet
oh jenny my dear
but the american dream was nothing to write home about
and all the angry young boys and all the angry young girls
and she smiles
and all they have
i killed you in my mind today
oh jesus please forgive me
oh jesus please forgive me
i know you've heard it all before
all is forgiven listen listen
the little conversation
you know i never could say anything
like a story incomplete
and let the others speak for me
all the times you couldnt tell her how you miss her
like a blanket on your shoulder
when your breathing is the wind
sing you a lullabye a lullabye
miles have gone away
i can see a million years
i look up at the sky
thinking of you underneath the mexican moonlight
so i can watch all the evil in the room
i'm waiting for the time to fall behind me
wine dine do a line
it's a matter of time until they find me
wherever you go
you cant get away from the face in the mirror
everything we did
deathly cold
sip your tequila give me some time
by a world filled with
the moon is full the stars are bright
thought i heard your car
i wonder where you are
and things i tried to say
but you're always polite
hands are shaking lips are cracked
run run run
my eyes are jaded and complicated
i wont give her up
i never knew that the price would go up as such
they finally called you away
she said hold on hold out
i wonder why
keep on keep on keep on
and glitter on her eyes
he doesnt give a fuck he's living under a truck
show me a ray
show me a ray
as love looking down on them
love is the killer you thought
paws you and claws you you try not to fall
love is the teacher who lives in the dark
they say goodbye tomorrow wendy's
any second coming
i'll get a pick up truck and i'll drive away
i am who i am and it's all i can do
cause if i cant walk proud i'd rather walk away
when you smile i dont know what to do
when you smile i dont know what to do
and all the while behind the dancing eyes the boy crying
you cant keep your promises you just keep naming names
it's just dope for you
cause i was born a liar albatross
from your god above
i've been told things get better
my life is hazy hazy hazy
i've been told things get better
and when the process comes undone
heal these wounds
when you kill the mother there is no other
the struggle in side of your mind is a waste of time purest thoughts evaporate
break for the sun your the one the chosen one your time is up your time is due
and dont they wish they were blessed like you
your will is broken
you'll be a good citizen
just move move ahead
you were lying to yourself 'cos you were afraid of what you'd find
you can say it with a vengeance you'll be back from the grave
in the land of a 1000 nos
fucking mess
he said it happens every time
wont live up to your image
have fun
the beast you've been fighting
potential vaporization
in my mind haunting haunting my life
you reckon with forsaken dead
heard too much know too much dont know if i can take it
constant pain the endless rain becomes too much to bear
you're dead
the dance of the dead
dark thoughts there are no words
hum increases in my brain
sad domination by those who say more than you'll ever know
pick your own deliverance
we amputate the shown
there's a man who watches over me
like me you're drowning in a daydream
listen to the battle cries of a race that knows it's dying
but dont erase the pain
all they hear are the echoes in the well
dress codes rules and age limits
i'd rather have hole in my eyes
2 might make you crawl
how did i come to become
someone to hide behind
look in the future
with me i've gone out and
only alive to do what's
hey fool havent you heard heavens not over flowing
you know the rules only apply on the witness stand
no more
in their minds they've found it
powerfully screaming what is life's meaning
technological march of death
stealing filth from those forgotten
what if i was high like an aeroplane would you look at me the same
would you be my queen of this desperate land do you think i give a damn
rabid pack with sirens howling
i'm at a loss for words
i'm tired of going through the
our eyes
death without a loss
mad world we're living in a mad world
until they sound like the truth
no care no less
no care no less
no care no less
minds are controlled
except for the few who got rich off of you
the whole goddamn world is riding on words for thousands of years
i got to be there
crippled will with tomorrows pill
man they cave in
mygrain
always wanted to make a difference
so go ahead and call me dumb
painted smiling face
and i hear you
poisoned planet nuclear war
left to rule
where are you putting your energy
as pressure turns to rage
god's word enforced and controlled
rabid dogs rabid dogs
lonely boy says come what may
and kills the dream so we sing this simple song
sleeping on the wing
toobad the good ones always have to take the blame
sweatin on the line doin 40 wasting time
mister clean
chances shine seven days our fears become entwined
beginning of this world selled with mankind
and put us in their hell and set our souls on fire
technocracy probable cause
technocracy bending laws
growth on this planet but
tell me what is gained
by staying aboard this runaway wreck
while you're losing is on the curve
nihilist to be turns the scrape into a gash
so the snake keeps on recruiting we one more royal shooting
but the snake is just a pawn and remains when we are gone
vote
i'm talking about a revolution
chorus
and the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight
cant even think
but i never condemn a man
time the names will change
your voice is screaming clear
when the bays opened nothing was said
guaranteed
i listen to few and i'm fueled by fire
i guess i bought a gun
then they take me on their knees again
in 1494 he did it with the girl next door
people
stalk on a circle
i'm filled with the white noise
i was born on a warm night
she's got a red balloon she's gonna be the sky
i wanna be a plane i am a red balloon i'll never be the same
headed for berlin
and didnt drink
the only thing i thought to say
this time is better than last time
but i think i'd really like to die
she says oh no this is the last time
a little discipline can mess you up inside
oh this time i think you shed a little light
but i feel better today
i'm dreaming underground
i cant remember the last thing that you said as you were leaven
and it's one more night in hollywood
and it's one more day up in the canyon
what's wrong with him anyway
how'd he miss me anyway 7 days and i cant feel anything
he doesnt have to know
it's been years since we were born
five for silver
you can see the flames
think about it every time
come on come on
well i didnt mean to do it
settle down inside my love
accidentally
just get yourself inside her
lovers leave me alone to try to have a little fun one way or another i just wish i
got a message in my head
of all the stupid things i do
if i could give all my love to you
and the people that you knew
of a clock that tells the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
she comes out on fridays every time
holding a candle up to my hand
making me feel so incredible
she never came around
making me feel so incredible
and that's all that really matters to me
and some of us sink like a stone
just to get a change of pace
it just takes so long
for someone to take us back home
people dying from lonely days
bright lights shine in midnight
to leave me where i stand
all my innocence is wasted on
why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for
and read me like an open book
all my innocence is wasted
but i'm just not coming through
you were sleeping next to me
take some time before you go
i'm an anchor on the line
but i'm not sleeping anymore
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 am
down into this valley
jaded i hate it
every waking' hour
i dont wanna be your slave
we break down in smaller combinations
jumpin jesus my oh my
he's got a great big bottle of sunshine
to get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside get
nothing but being alone
hey what you got that makes you want to be lonely
make it better than it was
what i know is that you're not really very old
and kid things
make it better than it was
its crazy but somehow clear somehow clear
shock
we race in small circles home
thin lines of light these days were lit by light
maybe i just want to breathe
in the morning rain
how your garden grows
we see things they'll never see
i cant remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin
and it's one more night in hollywood
and it's one more day up in the canyon
separate love from addiction its not the same i know
wasted my time this picture you see is nothing like the one
put on your bad self get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try
the morning sun when it's in your eyes really shows your age
all you did was wreck my bed
oh maggie i wished i'd never seen your face
water beading up her chest
were infants pushing slowly through
haunting only to myself
render blind the ones who see
it's got far too many doors to block the wind
in the absence of a place to be
a nd stay beside me where i lie
it looks like darkness to me
well maybe i dont need no angel at all
the summer's gone
they come out of the blue sky
hey romeo
for sean me
hey romeo
dont come around here
for sean me
we'll i'm all messed up
and close your pretty blue eyes
i was down at the new amsterdam staring at this yellow haired girl
believe in me
paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
standing in the spotlight
she's perfect for you man there's got to be somebody for me
yellow haired girl
believe in me
paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
standing in the spotlight
yeah we stare at the beautiful women
right back at me
well i am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame
and there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring
and the lovesick rejections that accompany the company i keep
hey mrs potter wont you talk to me
but you cant get very far
i cant remember my name hey mrs potter dont cry hey mrs potter i know why but hey
company i keep all the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep hey i can
stand up at the palace like it's the last of the great pioneertown bars we shout out
we can take it nice and slow
i've been wondering where we've gone
there's a bird that nests inside you
i walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine
sprays me with water
and then she comes up again
waits at the end of the road
maybe when things are different for me
something about the buildings in chelsea just kills me
the light in her eyes goes out
leave my sister alone
waiting for the sun
and get myself home
it's melting my bones
to spend your days in the sunshine
it's a crazy situation
you gotta you gotta you gotta make it
throw off this disquise
dont you wish we were younger
ready i am fine i am covered in skin no one gets to come in pull me out from inside
stuttered shook and uptight
and unfolding
i am fine
take me out
do you wish it was me
with a smile on your face
like a rusty shot in a hollow sky
she's crossing muddy waters
that big oak tree is groaning
i got my flower i got my power
suppin boze is precedent
you are my flower you are my power
daylight fading come and waste another year
daylight fading come and waste another year
waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside
we leave just before it's gone
come and waste another year
now i can walk away mad
my turn this time they scream
and everyone stares at the ground
dont add up to anything at all
his intentions are clear he wanna be well liked
einsteins down on the beach staring into the sand
who'll never be together again
who'll never be together again
for an eggman on and off the wall
all his wings are slowly sinking
one more sun comes sliding down the sky
one more sun comes sliding down the sky
the worst things come from inside here
what you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway
there's a house burning down on the radio but
all the smiling hands delivering all the
lonely lonely lonely
every night i'm floating over you my love
and it's plain
to say i dont care
all over me
can relieve
are only lies
with her pride
make a mark upon the wall
all i want is something fine
i got four more reasons why i
damn these nights are dreaming
i got four good reasons why i cant go back there again
mary comes and goes
i'm much much too concerned about mary jane
mary jane pulls her hair back and wonders what she'll do with all her free time
i'm sorry she said
she doesnt exist any more
i wouldnt be me if she wasnt her
she cant keep away from them
pretty soon they've got her heading for the door
she dont want anybody to see
oh so saddle up and go
she said it's raining' in my head
six different ways go deep inside
not one of you is the same
she's watched all tidal waves away from your disaster
and bind you to your mother
inside your plastic head
taking some time i'm thinking about leaving soon i got some things i cant tell
staring out of his window as the world rushes by
out there in the shadow of the modern machine
i have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives
me and the girl who could make it all clean
replies i dream of ballerinas and i dont know why but i see cadillac's sailing i
and drives down the length of the evening to the carnival side in a house where
but i see cadillac's sailing
with the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins
we are spinning and spinning and spinning and now
good morning baby guess you wanna touch me now
or where they are
to be everything i could be anything
dont you fucking touch me
i cant feel a thing
take the way home that leads back to sullivan st
she's nearly crawling on her knees
give me your autograph
nobody can see him
she's sniffin in her tissue
no body can ever hear him call
sweet home alabama lord i'm coming home to you
they pick me up when i'm feelin blue
but guns they wait to be stuck by at my side is god
years ago my heart was set to live oh
inside you the time moves and she dont fade
inside you the time moves and she dont fade away
the ghost in you she dont fade
make an exception i am not worried
but i'm sure there's something in a shade of grey
she cant stop shaking
but it's not all that easy so maybe i should
it's keeping me awake and anna begins to toss and turn
somebody tell me if i am sleeping
and no one to say when we're done
i rode a ladder that climbed across the nation
i took the cannonball down to the ocean
make a movie from the things that they find crawling round my brain i wish i was a
elizabeth you know i'm doing alright these days in one of these dreams you
well night time let her through
without a single place to go of interest
so buy a pretty dress
yeah now cant you hear me call
then i will go away
the color of her head changing every day
a little puff of wind and she's always near me
a little breath of wind and i just get crazy
i wanna go on down to new york town
i gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn
and girl i just dont know
but i wish that you would hurry
the best things are sevens and sex is just ok so please stay
all the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time
thin air
un
you watch him as he stutters over what to say
well darling if it's shit came out
and i dont want to fall apart this time
i wish you were inside of me
can find a little flame me i say my prayers
when i'm slipping in between
and it dont look like sleep's coming soon
and it's a dangerous time for a heart on a wire
and what brings me down now is love
i been hangin around this town on the corner
i been hangin around this town on the corner
after the love has faded
dont get up 'till the afternoon
i gotta get out but i'm stuck so tight weighed by the chains that keep me
when the weather bothers me
she wears a silly yellow hat
and when you wake the morning covers you with light
all the regrets you cant forget
you're remembering again
like sometimes
i remember me
here comes that feeling again
i gotta find a place without so many
and when we're older
and are you sorry for what hasnt happened yet
this island life never ends
i'm a comet common uncommon honestly
straight to tears
the disappearing nature of the people we have been
just the way you do
but oh this desert life
how i line my sky with all the silver i can use
one plus you equals one plus you equals you equals
we got big black cars
we may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight
they left the television screaming that the
city's a drag
you can still come and cook me chicken fried steak
you know i dont mind
but i'm not sleeping anymore
1 2 3 4 5 6 7am
down into this valley
and put me in a plane
just put me in a wheelchair
time ticks by her one race at a time
she's trying to be a good girl
boys who cant tell one girl from another
margery's dreaming of the middle of the day
lookin at a green sky
but margery's dreaming of horses
one last time tonight for
and give 'em what they want
now there's trouble busin
and meet me tonight in atlantic city
where the sand's turnin to gold
well i'm tired of comin out on the losin end
cause everybody else has got
i'm getting older and older and older
in the shadow of
i can see
into a slow heaven
touching the souls of all the lonely
after the slow lonely waiting
sick of waiting
after you're gone
it's running in my veins
spinning round
checking it up
until they leave you
lay me down in the circle
all this pleasure gets them high
thought you'd realize that i would know i would show
the special love you have for me my dixie dear
and i guess got regrets
52 weeks later your still the same
maybe you could leave a light on
you just keep what you need
theres no one to receive me
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday
and put up a parking lot
hey farmer farmer
late last night
you look a lot like you'd shatter
cut yourself until you bleed
cause you've been waiting a long time
in the twilight glow i see her
in a land that knows no parting
to decide
shut your eyes
hey louise whats the barrier
one less bell to warn ya one more song to play
well ya got one less bell to warn ya
you're better than the world
they took a lot of time
like butterflies with wings
getting it right on this girl i said
and the caravan has all my friends
because i long just to hold you tight
and i'm there with you in ensenada
back to chorus
staring at the ceiling
is my confidence eroding
another pair of lips and eyes
all of the people are vanishing here
and galen she says
but i'm at the end of the new frontier
but for everyone you do
because everybody gets to be perfect when they're gone
maybe i will lose tomorrow
everybody glows and then they're numb
i went down to houston
oh my sweet carolina
oh my sweet disposition
may you one day carry me home
it's the heart that matters more
omaha somewhere in middle america
hey m ister if you're going to walk on water
they'll trap you then they use you before you even know
the dressing rooms are grey
you'll have to learn just like me
i've been driving all night
there's a bottle of relief upon the table
exit a
he's unimaginative at his best but you know that's all right
and you think that that's so cool
he's hearing voices he cant attribute to the ordinary noise
he's never that bad he's never that good
he's always just a little bit ah ah ah ah
chorus
i know you think you'll get me
you werent your mama's only boy
no one heard his dyin words
the day they laid poor pancho low
the desert's quiet and cleveland's cold
a few old gray federales still say
where i got friends who'll care for me
in beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle
there's a dead man trying to get out
in the belly of a black winged bird
i'm alive but i'm sinking in
hey i only want the same as anyone
i've been here before and i deserve a little more
i need a raincoat
i need a raincoat
i need a phone call
gonna get back to basics
recovering the satellites
where we make a lifetime commitment
and then you're everybody's satellite
come out on your porch or i'll step into your parlor
and i saw my devil
and the man on the radio wont leave me alone
and lighted out for some desert town
i might be dreaming'
i can see that you dont believe me
oh shannon
i might be dreaming'
come again some other day
the contrast of white on white
chorus
she knows she's just a little misunderstood
mama's little baby better get herself in
she must be tired of something
so bring me a second or bring me an hour
got on the wagon the tenth of december
and i want to be a raider i want anything
good riddance good luck and good bye
and i wanna be a man
i was born on the shores of the chesapeake bay
from where you think you will end up to the state that you're in
there's a hole in the ceiling down through which i fell
st robinson in his dream
in the world
the kind i dream of
from the african mines
get tickets for the dance
if it's no well i can go
it's okay i know nothing's wrong nothing
i come home she lifted up her wings
i'm just an animal looking for a home
like a vision she dances across the porch
show a little faith there's magic in the night
i wanted so badly somebody other than me
i cant please myself
beneath this graveyard western sky
everything i've ever wanted
everything you dream of
i'm so unsatisfied
i might sleep all day
just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me
wear a dress so i can get it off real easy
i've been up all night
is everybody clear
and if you're coming back
i might sleep all day
i understand that everyone goes disappearing
i'm the king of the world
i'll be your useless stuff
i'll be your useless stuff
i'm gonna stay
she says adam what do you see
and if you dont amuse me
and if we talk about this town
i will live on
and the world seems like my enemy
werent you just waiting by the phone
aint necessarily a bad thing to believe the
it's leaving me here all alone
anyone you think about is better love than me
and the days of my youth have all long gone by now
wiseblood hears grace whisper right behind
i guess i'll realize in a day or more
i guess i'll realize when her baby starts to cry
one or two people sliding gracefully together and apart
and didnt anyone wonder where their bright eyed babyboy has gone

baby lets use it up
and that is how i got these lonesome johnny blues
and the price you pay is to remain alive
and he wound up taking much more than i own
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep
millions regardless
and their tears taste like wine
tempering weapons of criminal lust
tiny red miracles falling likerain
devour the sun
a jewel more radiant than the moon
she lulled me away from the rich masquerade
on the sea misted lawn where stone figures forlorn
i danced like a blind acolyte
i now know what thou art
but poised nectar within my stirs
secrets dead wouldst thou inflict
need fires have lured abominations here
blind reason against thee enchantress
enrobed in death's shadow like a swifter
that our fantasies spent
the damned
i remember the night as if it were engraved
come my friend to fate let's raise
the damned
in the shadow of miss anne thropy
my heart torn apart left a rifled grave
and death was swift to swallow on the hells of life
she stole the soul hate had sold away
eternity
all heil love fails all hope lies in eclipse
but then all to soon
my limbs ignite
under quicksilver clouds
argentinum spurred
instead of harking prophecies
come skyclad to my arms
i buck under flames
i love the night
dressed for the sepulchre
amor e morte
bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
from heavens farthest shore
thrown east before the midnight masses
and for this grave mistake
never fucking more
that ran like blood through scarred ravines
like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
221
with the coming of days
and through rich whores and corridors
and as he wrote i smote
that the stars overall
to catch sight of the seams
i knew not her name
her spinal chill rakes the earth
as bane and tyranny her dobermans sleep
for beauty is always cruel
the wench her tower tombed
as to eclipse
men entranced divined from her gait
of suspicions abroad
chandeliers a tiara
but caprice honours leashed
winds lashed their limbs together
were flung to a wayward god
pounding upon the pauper ridge
for elizabeth's grace could raise
littered with aphrodisiacs
her embers tempered roared
each tendon muscle rippling
she drives me fucking wild i want her on her knees
she let her wet tongue roll i gasp and cant control
burning like penal fires roused to strain
horror stalked the bilious fogs
moved to mirrors cracked with heavy lines
splashed on occult tongues
died at last
he took to things
skies litten with five pointed stars
the circus lurches in a ring of promised delight
war torn forlorn and malarial
she was the light of the world going down
and should she awake through embrace or mistake
dani filth scripture and howls
additional guitar by martin foul
performed by the budapest film orchestra and budapest film choir conducted by lazslo zadori
livebait booking agent
but now i cease to play
heading to the bedding
now the tidal are turning
with polished scythes that reap worldwide
now the tidal are turning
drove the ghosts of my forbears
to this mouth of mine
i must protect her
across the shifting abyss
like potions made me
she spasms with orgasmic flare
pity
horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
forever sworn to keep it
their unforgotten violence remember those who died
burning a funeral pyre
burning a funeral pyre
who stand accused and have refused the church's clemency
your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms
like shifting parent flesh
are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring
we should have cut our looses as at calvary
heiling new flesh
i smell their cumming
and nightmares crawl
prowls the cloud dead eyed
a fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
this is the end of everything
all sinners lose their lot on judgement day
on our knees or another fker's shore
now they're clawing back
when empires fall
whilst the bitter winter moon
as through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
of this world long a paradise lost
for those damned in flames repay
peace a fragile lover left us fantasising war
next to eve
shall see gehennah paved
of thick forest dusk has filled
whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed
on her zenith to come
her lustre eviscerates me
and commit this world to thy ancient
grant me thy dark command
toll o'er the sobbing throng
i shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
masterbating in their graves
yet far fiercer still
usher the spite seething draconist
seduce me with silky timbred limbs
bewinged infested belfries
this wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
in necromantic tongue
celestial knifes ebonied
love sank wounded when i betrayed
candelabra snuffed prey silhouette wedded
is my love in vein
the crowned and conquering darkness
to claim her for their very own
whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
the path towards the castle weary innocence takes
and laid to rest i now am blessed
hilt your dripping fangs that range
foul snake despair
just a palace of dreams
once crucified
gabrielle
for long lost gabrielle
gilded cunt
black and grey like panzers
dirty little gold digger
that halo paid for by a consummated ring of ice
the stars are fixed
dirty little soul frigger
motherfuckers
but words escape me when i try to speak
mark my words believe my soul lives on
hallowed be thy name
serrated mountains of mad shadows
victory spent
fulfilling destiny the promised fever
the secret amour of her archangelic rape
lords of the star veiled red sepulchres
now freed to plunder
our legions killing all in sight
hell awaits
satan sees the answer lies not far
warriors from hells domain
their souls are damned to rot in hell
before my coronation and vocal aspirations
desire the fire
that screamed of me supreme again
aeons reversed the two
a first degree murder of ravens
the abyss edge
down dark steps of history
the limpid rags of resurrection
whose kiss glittered with sleep
is a thief come after dark
the night awaits with baited thighs
the cream of mortal kind
their crystal skirts
i'll make you pray
that bleeds their borders
even a man who is pure in the heart
on the black side of the glass
sharp eyed impassive whore
like thistled ruin garbed around thy heart
impaler lord
foam flecked nightmares drag a moon
unto us that wait with patience in
in nakedness their ochre flesh
the trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
in raven feathered dress
satanic tyranny
yet all tongues are not true
mathistrises that dont give a damn
a kindred spirit in a graveyard
gothic towers tottered on her heels
to take the reins of pleasure
is a vengefull call on grace
iplintered her coffin and lay on the floor
of concern save for the aeons left
for her corset laced with arsenic
of heaven where thou didst reign and in the deeps
lips distend ending time to falter
strung where crippled vultures dare
cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
sowers of discord growing wars to reap
sunset expect
lightening freezes seven
once the forests spired
we come like drumming thunder
disintered in the writhe of the lone survivor
martin suicide notesbroken heart strings
thanks to perversebeauty6aolcom filth7986hotmailcom for correcting track 9 lyrics
and ran with morning fauna his mastiffs and gazelle
she deftly spun
serpent tongue
a simple dish born with a silver spoon
palled in mysteries
and mankind basked in vast eclipse
originally performed by anathemaand i often sigh
in my broken sleep
call me within your holy house to dwell
carnal desire runs through my veins
break their crust
strive ever to be more joyous to the death
spare me from the wolves
has never burnt so sickly sweet
soft white throat
of a bestial past
that start to gnaw my fingers
in her spilled over
save that my soul in hell is kept
with these words scrawled in a severed hand
my life to have her with me
the day that laughter died
and i much as i have tried
midst the mist and sleepy hollows of fever
now drowning resounding
my life to have her with me
forever flung to celestial dreams
grinning winds of hate unfurled
they pray to the full moon rising
war
stain the milky sunset red
for his dark eye
on the grave of my clarissa
the devils pride
and the smoke has choked these vistas
lipped with blood and last goodbyes
but her face soon dispels
naked she sways
as with our ghosts in the fog
all i desire
it's just the high cost of loving
every second counts i cant break away
step by step
and you can take it or leave it
temptation
temptation
thou art pale hecate
nothing will keep us apart
leave them lifeless and broken
come to me black goddess arise
hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
and in this state of bliss
mad caliban with manner
they call me bad
that mouldered where older
and theres nothing like a mouthful of venetian tar
a passing fad
on my grave
i wont have peace of mind
i'm the hangman today
i saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
a white assassin painted black
in this garden of gethsemane
i sip the blood red wine
as restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
as the wild hunt careers through the boughs
i stand enthralled
she comes again
torn bloody weeping skies
for her that exists beyond all knowledge
and yield the swords that sever and stain
spat snarling into form
for him whose place was set
him spur the hymns to heaven sent
lustrous scourge of fallen spirits
these waters held secrets
espied gasping breath under dark sheeted moons
of truth and her deleted scenes
in equal measures sewn
i sense the beauty that waits for me there
than a breeze next to this night
but now i fear i will never peer
bent on knees and harrowing
drink the pouring of my fury
unhilt the black grimoire of death
as another soul passed to the grasping styx
limbs purring from the kill
from the lilt of choirs choking
that peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe
the countess fell
that the growls of mating houls inclined
if blood is what thou carves foul fiend
the countess with the promise
to the ravenous wolves that the elements led
none more cold in repose
and possessed of such delights
though inwards she abhored
tombed her soul with such stone
pouncing to haunt
in faustian verse
stigmata still wept between her legs
past the howl of buggered nymphs
like a flame unto a deathshead
the biblical prattled their mantras
through the maw of the woods a black carriage was drawn
round hearts a glance would betroth
of erotica
but the stare of their lord
when she knelt down to atone
forgiveness would come
no horrors were worse
she sought the soceress
to the forest's vulva
secrets brooded as she rode
but elizabeth laughed thirteen autumns had passed
forever in your throne
in her dark secret eden
and her cunt she feeds to fulfill her desire
reveal to me your mysteries witch
seeking cause to subjugate
suffer not the infidel suffer not the infidel
zealous and maniacal
the unfettered few who choose to roam
unbridled at dusk
with a turn of the screw
her cut diamond rings
enclaves were upgraded to goshen
fertile female mind control
yield to my sweet embrace
let all acknowledge that we are here
the work of crafts surpassing sin
for seven days and seven festival nights
she was found
war torn forlorn and malarial
she would take jesus
v empire
ebony dressed for sunset
as we shall see
of my pondlife as pearl
they crept through woods mesmerized
dawn discovered her there
come back to me
and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs
my porcelain yin
mesmerized
her ghost in the fog
though incisions once made her so vivid
to break to make my fluttered heart amiss
once dancing in a spotlit waltz
and in those frozen moments won
and midst the writhe of parapets
i thank god for the suffering
swathed in the haze
where virtue bathed their ravings made
smothering another lover
though fated now than later
like the night 'twixt vice and virtue
midst drowning crowds that howled in rage
though with spit for all things divine
return their fallen leader
that weaves inside my should
just a white flag blackened by
i am the thorn
stays the sleeping beauty
i am the spear of longinus
a lightning strikes their blinded mains
wooed by dresden serenades
of greed and deepest dark deception
to her surgeon full of general curses
libertina grimm
they haunt her heart those precious few
so alone
lump in the throat on my come choke
i live the slow serrated rape
dub me lord abortion the living dead
a perverts gasp inside the mask
who lets me prey a gilles de rais
my appetite whetted storm crows wheeled
i know i'm sick as dahmer did but this is what i do
lest curses spat from primal lairs
into the scented scheme of night
thoughts possess me
erupt from the grave aflame
like a woman scorned by life
verona marishka aleera
for all eternity
on life's brittle glass
before the veil could part our embrace
my soul to the dead to achieve
how they plead to the skies
so came the night
but for dreaming of thee i regain
from temptations peak we will see
and lives that hide in scriptured lies
than death could alone
awaiting the sun to set crimsoning seas
dripping sweat
how it was that we first met
as they have forever more
be my mannequin
that god alone would know
i tongued the nuns at louviers
in the samhain mist
wreathed in dreams
sprits rising to discredit rebirth
through the forest of our hearts
under pagan veneer snakes a fear
tread the salt the dead exult
no mercy or brakes applied
sleek and polished black
millennial the whore
smothering the congregation
instrumental in stripping gods
hear the foregone cries of the last surviving
comets tear the skies
thereafter
spilling the wine of her fornication
death slathers near her heel
her laughter
mr crowley what went wrong in your head
conceived in the eye of a secret
i want to know what you meant
tragedy blooms from one act
i am nemesis
no longer am i paralysed
nemesis
poured in my arms
whose flag unfurled
black is my heart
black is my heart
just like you
it's just like adam says
and the voices pass with time
a feeling
no no no no time to cry
everything will be alright
chorus
the dead would sing for me
have delivered me gifts from the grave
the wolves among the sheep
as phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day
deceivers dragged before their cross
rather dead forever than to lose her
cold was my soul
and would you ever soon
nymphetamine
wracked with your charm
as we did in those golden days
from the bind of your holiness
to her alone in full submission
my nymphetamine girl
untold was the pain
come above unto me
sick and weak from my condition
i am circled like prey
as we did in those golden days
from the binds of your holiness
to her alone in full submission
my nymphetamine girl
she was all three wishes
two tracks
she haunted at the corners of my mind
on with hope to the grave
that never enchained
the right slot for your sacred key
nymphetamine
more white lady laid
bared on your tomb
discolours all with tunnel vision
none better
with every rome inside me
screaming in the keys of faith and fear
from pleasure or pain
every dirty word
baring lunar curvature
her roseate sliver
like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief
of a slaughtered lamb throw
with thick unguent rum
succour me
whiplashed from the gates
satan seated there
half naked and insane
at the throat of the human race
spat from the massive throng
afaisnt the flora of nightfall
unveil the greed our needs are bitter spent
mona lisas where the paint has run
draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat
will she show rewrites of dark delight
over teeth that have tasted shame
my dreams unroll
ghosts of pearly gate remissions
the time is past
but now the winds are strong
were quaffing morning glories
the time has come
300
her spirit freed eclipsed the moon
thrown upon damp cellar walls
the narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
where erotic stains had cleaved
met with torments giving vent to her swoon
by the father of lies
of virgins forced naked
douse their luminosity
and only when they're running
within this kissed disembowel arena
shatter the glass house
as they have for countless lustrum
red
winter ice terminal frost
the fall of man is now at hand
future is coming
rip your back out
death comes ripping
skinless the dark shall scream
an emanation of phantom madness
how weep the pure
her clock of hacked out cunts
as pregnant skies outside bore thunder
that she carved her seal
she's just a devil woman
i can see me a tall dark stranger
she's just a devil woman
showing the future the past
she's gonna get you
our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
with judas in my stride
conquests deep methodical screwing
this winter chill grist for his mill
killing al resolve
have locked to hasten blood
in the pits of self rebirth
and hell for those that dwelt
from the palace orchard i espied
i listened with a heavy heart
were all but reared
since the crimes divine i left behind
michael was weaponed
far worse had worked
in adoration of the moon and thee
appease the beast on spattered sheets
surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
and snow white balletic grace
bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair

they couldnt pull apart
just waitin for you roamin love
and in my dreams you always come true

for you to hold me in your arms
though time and time i've told her so
that's when she thinks she looks her worst
though time and time i've told her
shootin the bull in an old cowtown
lookin like a permanant fixture
watching grass grow as the sun goes down
we placed our bets
and never complained
reek of nostalgia
but i'm going
this town aint my home
and this old guitar of mine
unable to cope again
blowinmy show again
well i really look a mess
it's a good thing you're not around to see
pickin up the pieces of my shattered broken heart
i'm really not that strong
except out of my mind
they say time can heal every broken heart
these flowers aint for you
so i'm doing all i can to do things right
i'd do anything to get to you
a girl of my sweet dreams
and talk was small when they talked at all
if you want me to
and made his request
but only a time or two
it only adds to my confusion
and though my heart tells my head to stay
but i'm too far gone to leave
'cause i'm too far gone to leave
girl wont you tell me why
girl wont you tell me why
girl wont you tell me why

there's a look in her eyes that's sayin goodbye
slitherin around in the dark
a little bitty crack in her heart
i thought i could hold her me oh my oh
little jolena never showed
hi it's me again this wont take much of your time
look what i did to me
and if that wasnt enough
i broke their little hearts
pretty as she can be
well well well

drivin me out of my mind
hotter than a fireball
and every time i hold her man i start to smolder
hold me holding you
we're one now we're not two
and baby baby baby
i knew you are the love of my life
i see it in your eyes
is i need you
but today when i came home my key was hollow in the door

i see the flicker in your eyes

chorus
maybe i should just give in
didnt know i'd lose this much sleep
i cant explain but sure can touch
figurin out what love really means
lovin just who you are
going somewhere where she'd be wanted
staring at the rest of her life
she cried and laughed while the red lights flashed
on the backseat of a greyhound bus
the moons full but it sure aint round
forty pilss two kids to keep
how his mother came undone
hallelujah
give me give me
i've been tellin my dreams to the scarecrow
and how do you keep your feet on the ground
and i will grow up where i'll wander wild and free
when you know that you were born
how do you like that paper plate and those pork n beans you're eatin
you've done your sowing now you can do your reaping
shotgun houses shanty shacks
aint gonna have nothing but the supper on
all mine head to toe
3rd chorus
aint gonna have nothing but the supper on
aint gonna play the crying game no more
to stand by me like i stand by you
do me right dont do me wrong
burned by love
one more hole in my poor heart is just what i dont need
and heartache at its worse
well i wish i'd listened closer when you said that i'd be blue
and i'd give anything to have you back
oh what would i do
when the sun sinks low all around
a thousand miles away
what's this your kiss
i feel it comin on
and you'll wake up cryin
wash over me
you know i use to think love was blind
well fool i'm a woman and bound to change my
that's you and in a hurry
hey i'm letting go
hey i'm letting go
listening to the rain
i know heaven must exist
is right where i'm meant to be
every dream i've had's come true
there's a cold wind howlin at the trailer door
will you make it go away
no i dont want to see the light
i dont want to see the light of day
all right i give in
and if i pray for you
repeat chorus
then i see my friends
i keep looking
well i guess that i'm as human as the next one
hey good is good but could be better
driving 'round in your daddy's old chevy
i can stay up and wait or just go on to bed like i do
i learned that from you
and i made wishes at wishing wells
it happens people change
i've got a letter no address that i can send it to
bring me coffee in the early morning
and i'm likin your strategy
you gotta show me every day
bring me coffee in the early morning
imagine me still loving you
'cause you know you've always had my foolish heart
i've got a tiger by the tail
looks like i've got a tiger by the tail
and it looks like i've got a tiger by the tail
cause this old world gets tough
wanna feel your touch
romance till the night is through
you'll be holding me now
but it feels like years
dont worry bout the danger
and i'll try a little bit
but i lied lied lied
somewhere between the hubbub and the drama
where they show me back in missouri
bridge
at the smile on my face
me and the girls in the coupe deville
repeat chorus
chorus
right here with you is where i belong
love you for all of my life
plant our hearts on solid ground
i bet they'll have a town parade
plant our hearts on solid ground
and wake up in a new hometown
but not for long
if i had to run if i had to crawl
air is heavy and the moon is bright
i guess it didnt take you very long to decide
i cant stand up for fallin down
if you dont take me to paris
baby every little piece
my daddy looks annoyed
yeah good enough for me perfect
i have no boundaries
i guess god just made some of us
what do you do where do you go
and it was something magic out of something frightening
a thorn in the flesh
take the nightmare from my dreams
all the glitter out in hollywood
he's just wating for the obvious
repeat chorus
but through all the tears that we cried
your broken heart your broken wings
when in each other's arms
saints and angels
i dont mean to be cruel
back when i played the fool
you've gotta take my hand
and lead me to where you are
to show me the way to your heart
that was all she wrote her mama's heart was broke
now dont you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about sunday morn
now she's gone in the blink of an eye
she left the suds in the bucket
'cause i know it's supernatural
i'll flood the faith back into your eyes
supernatural
chorus
everlasting never changing
so listen with all your heart
hold it inside forever
you may find all your dreams have already come true
well i've never rocked the rockies
it doesnt matter where we end up
come on and show me the other side of the great unknown
she's says a silent prayer
her heart is running scared
looking at me now
no body knows
i love the way you touch me
no body knows
but the devil seemed to own the night
and the more they prayed the more it fell
to the ears of tender age
to bring a brighter day
there's only one
i'll surely know
there's only one
the hands on the clock just take their time
when you loved me
i was skipping school with a lunchbox
im not rich but i've made a million memories so far
there were three little lives that would need me
i ran my fingers through my tangled hair
but somehow i knew each word by heart
i think i found what i was missin
it's plain to see
i've got a tiger by the tail
i've got a tiger by the tail
there are questions that go on and go
no time wont tell me how it might have been
for me and you to be happy
everyone everywhere would be happy
if i had a weakness
right into your hands
i might be just a sinner
although i know again tonight
so darling lie to me
buried back in an old dresser drawer
you could have taken
is there somebody's heart out there
you built me up so high my heart cant stand to fall
and from that day down to this
so walk out backwards
i never told you that i love you
oh and why would i feel that way
so why should i care
when you look at me that way
to be the one who loves the most
how you steal a piece of my soul
no you dont know how it feels
in the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest days
then crossed the line
just remember that you will always be my baby yeah yeah
noo your never too far gone
i search myself and everyone
adia i thought we could make it
it's easy we all falter does it matter
and it's hard at the end of the day
and the endlessness that you fear
that you make up for all that you lack
of your silent reverie
i will be your solid ground
you'll still be burning so bright
it will all be worth it
into the valleys
you and me
the shadow of death
chorus
as edens sixth day now all you've been allowed
on the hills of fire the darkest hour
fear not for you're just dreaming
and all i feel is black and white
everybody loves you when you're easy
and all i feel is black and white
as the walls are closing in
'cause i want what is pleasin
the frightened and the weak
underneath the skin
but i'm gonna take a look around it though
you strut your rasta wear
and a smile that wont wash away
holding on and holding it in
just when we need one
fun for all that children call
christmas time is here
oh that we could always see
every little part of me
they're wanton for discovery
when it will only end in misery
dear god
did you make mankind after we made you
i cant believe in
that father son and holy ghost
dont tell me it's too late
where every tongue is wagging
you know i would not hesitate
conjured this temptuous rage
with apparitions of your soul
i dont know how
i do what i have to do
chorus
and we were drawn to the rhythm
yes we are drawn to the rhythm
chorus
of the spotlight that follows wherever you go
i love the time and in between
and i'll defend it as long as i can be
i believe
might not be right for you but it's right for me
would you understand it
my heart is saying one thing but my body wont let go
respecting what is left
mercy pure and simple
with kind words you'd come to soothe me
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
o morning stars together
where meek souls will receive him still
my time went so quickly
and i lead the parade
freeway cars and trucks
dont need to teach a seed to grow
ordinairy miracle today
ordinairy miracle
it's just another
they must be just around the bend they always come
held back in my pitied world where everything's undone
the life's slipping out of me
chorus
chorus
the riot in my heart decides to keep me open and alive
they told me plenty
no matter what they'd say i would have thought i'd be with you
there was a freedom
voices trapped in yearning
and after i'd wipe away the tears
and i would be the one
oh into the sea of waking dreams
lord make me an instrument of your peace
to be loved as to love
you stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together
there are times i cant decide when i cant tell up from down
oh please dont hesitate
put a little love in your heart
it's coming on christmas
i wish i had a river
made me weak in the knees
i would teach my feet to fly
lay me down beside you oh as long as it lasts
all the feelings they remain like a still life
but there is no place to hide
for so many innocent lives
oh i've seen a part of people that i never knew was there
and i wanted to believe
'til she cries no more
i am sinking
i am free
heavenly hosts sing alleluia
i could see the city light
son he said grab your things i've come to take you home
i walked right out of the machinery
i will show another me
to breathe a sigh or two
upon this winter night with you
morning smiles
there's there's nothing i'd like better than to fall
tangled up in our embrace
i feel just like i'm sinking
i said
come and lift me from this place
i wont fear love
i wont fear love
i wont fear love
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday
hey your glass is empty
dont tell me i havent been good to you
who's there that makes you so afraid
so just let me try
and so this is xmas
for rich and the poor ones war is over
and so this is xmas war is over
let's hope it's a good one
make the yule tide gay
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
my love
that you'll be strong tomorrow and we'll
so now you're sleeping peaceful
and looks out as far as she can see
so much anger so deeply ingrained
i have a smile
my sea to your shore
and cold here
and the night's
no light ever shone in the doorway
i remember when you left in the morning at daybreak
will you remember me
weep not for the memories
clinging to a past that doesnt let me choose
weep not for the memories
your love is better than chocolate
the cold is lost forgotten
the only comfort is the moving of the river
the only comfort is the moving of the river
christmas eve will find me
in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
what can i give him poor as i am
i yearn for comfort
i yearn for comfort
i will walk into the fire 'til its heat doesnt burn me
i'm reunited
we walk without a sound across a barren landscape
you feel only what you want to
it's a very strange world that leaves me
into old familiar shoes
but you come around in your time
but deep in my senses i know
and led me from my home
i only hope
sweet surrender
is a cold room
and so it continued both day and night
o'er bethlehem it took its rest
born is the king of israel
you cannot tell me you're so strong
through the years i've grown to love you
the path is overgrown and strewn with thorns
and both shall row my love and i
and neither i have wings to fly
but you send your thieves to me
you have me to hold me
if i agree well it's just to appease you
if i agree well it's just to appease you
born of a world oh that gets me so high
born of the one love that gets me so high
cause i'm a train wreck
somewhere deep inside me
i can show you places where our time has had no ware
and someday we'll be free
he said i can take you there
'cause i wouldnt lie to you
my wake is getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray
under a blackened sky
the new born hope unjaded by their years
to have and to hold that precious little thing
the new born hope unjaded by their years
allah kiss me once more
allah kiss me once more
cannot believe what i see
what child is this who laid to rest
the king of kings salvation brings
and i see you again and i know its true
my thoughts lead me on i only see one way
when she loved me
but she began to drift away
like she loved me
are everywhere i go
love an happiness surround you
and this is how i see you
with good intention
as we carried the weight
everyone is waiting
try and bring my share
hearts break hearts mend
chorus x2
i have sunk so low
time always reveals
and tell me i told you so
though i've tried i've fallen
they dont know how to feel they dont know what is lost
sympathy's wasted on my hollow shell
you never wanted time to end
life's never what it seems
spinning 'round in circles dreaming
we twist and turn and we avoid
words to deceive me more and more
so take all this noise into your brain
i'll say a thousand words or more
i believe i'm loved when i'm completely by myself alone
i believe the only ones who disagree are millionaires
i believe you cant appreciate real love until you've been burned
find me baby
all around me i want you
like cold chardonnay chilled for a day
all around me i want you
pick up your things you're a star
never known
when the madness stops then you
do you say
you've never known
will be alone
and the groove tonight
you're never safe 'till you see the dawn
move closer passion stronger
carry on keep romancing
it's bringing me to my knees
it's bringing me to my knees
yeah i think about it all the time
i feel the magic building around you
i know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
when you feel all alone
i can mend a broken heart
let me be the one you call
you're the fire inside the man
the fever that burns in my heart
the fever that burns in my heart
i just return to my heart 'cause i know that i'll find you
you're the fire inside the man
and feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in
cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
but heartache and misery
if we cant find a way out of these problems
more than angry words i hate this silence
but lately i've been down upon my knees
now we dont live we exist
i might need you to hold me tonight
mozambique or was it veronique
imagination racing
well i dont care no i dont care
oh no cause i dont care
get away and out of this city
we dont talk much anymore
are you still the same
i know i never really treated you right
i dont recognize this place
i see my future in an instant
there's just no rhyme or reason
i am complete now that i found you
i just hold on tight
chorus
is what i live for
who is swimming with a raincoat
magenta feelings take up shelter
chorus
well i bet he'd be cool
well i bet he liked gaultier
'cos i wonder how we'd deal if he just passed you by
i bet my speeder bike he'd turn his back on all of that
get me through the heart of the freeway
where you can fear no evil acceptance is a natural part of life
can make the darkest moments feel like heavens come alive
that love can move you
you get your kicks from the ghost of a memory
it picks you up and it turns you inside out now baby
cause they're designed that way
in the cover of darkness i can make believe it's you
stand still and you've departed
take away the pride all the dignity that's burning inside
listen to the hunter becoming
and i want to take it all
so let your body move a little
the wait
so dont you dont go make it harder
a fool a fool a lonely sorry fool
beauty so unavoidable everywhere
difference
i never felt so lonely
difference
and we stare each other down
make you cry
and love has left you bare
we twist and turn where angels burn
so take my hand now
which one is more human
and i feel it
would you like to take my hand yeah
shut down turn around feel the ground beneath me
never want to leave
i only pray it doesnt kill me
never want to fly
you've moved on
to your love
but nothing seems to make sense anymore
and time goes by so slowly
the only difference is
chorus
chorus
chorus
and now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
she's saying love is like a barren place
got a ticket for a world where we belong
if you'll be my baby
be everything that you need
a mountain
that we're surrounded by the
all that you need with surely come
i want to bathe with you in the sea
another alibi to write
but the mind is an amazing thing
wonder how i ever made it through
and the years go by so fast
chorus
if we could
chorus
you will only end up lost in loneliness
a resolution hard to see
wont be needed
to the disco inside your head violet
and that's no lie
and that's no lie
to the disco inside your head violet
cool breeze and autumn leaves
if time will set you free
you see the light
and going higher than the mountain tops
i think i'm going insane oh yeah
got to escape
i'm movin fast
forget the past
and all the things we'd said we'd be
got to get back
the mornings arent quite as brightgot to get back
got to get back
all the things that really matter
and the letter flies away
yeah i'll fly away
aint a lot of time left to be a star
never feeling bitter
why
every drink your downing
and if there's not to be another way
silhouetted against the sky
in his mind he was already there
a youth he thought asleep
marked blackjack guillotine
dont want to look across the waves
anymore
as the tears that passed between them
and as they crashed i thought i heard them say
of cold reality
but to you i will relate
lost here in glaze
i'll tell you to die
there's nothing you can do
never ending suicide
razor sharp
leaves a stain
back
goes for yards
in the mind awaiting its cue
back
and the ocean said the first time was with a friend
he never thought it dangerous
the reason that i still say it
do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
my power so divine
i watch as you
to an echo in the night
and pull you back somehow
contemplating years
with the shadows seething
screams without a sound
when the souls for selling
when said please listen all
close your eyes and close the door
carries on
that waiting in the dark like destiny
is it dark when the moon is down
burn the night away
one kindness
should you chance to die
played as he stood in his trance
and have all your spirits meet
that it's your time to learnoh city beneath the surface above
total illusions of tales
i will be your mentor
we supply amusements
can tell you where we are
the right and the wrong of it
till you turn on a light
and walked back along the beach
i can no longer resist
though he tried to wipe his eyes
when the young child he looked back
as they walked out of sight
i keep them on a shelf
they're good for conversation
i'm crying crying for your love
i'm crying crying for your love
damien
no one sees them fall
and do you say your prayers any more
is there time or is it too late
looking out of my lonely room
looking out of my lonely room
and so i sit here in the dark
the moment dies
the labyrinth's there
the curtain fell
what makes it bad is they're living next door
nodoesnt matter anyway
cause that's what they're for
nodoesnt matter anyway
it's all for sale what's your side you couldnt say
balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
but i dont think about you anymore
fight for the rock
fight for the rock
fight for the rock 'n roll
if my dream would soar
living in a world where he's safe from reality
when he's in his mind
the kind we say that could never be me
what might happen to your soul
in the search for the gold
it is part of the power
it's gonna put your
some would wait for the morning light
but i believe light is the source of all of our pain
in the light of morning
through a world that's in decay
pray the ocean will understand
and the ocean she understands
revealing each star while the moon plays the fool
when your time is uo it 146 s true
that in a world of opportunities
that she comes from the grave
necrophilia
no
yeah
had it all once
still you know i'm never gonna leave
better watch the time
and if you're running blind
fade it to black
cover you tracks
strung so tight
nagi skins anarchists
with no source of defense
islam lebanon what the hell is going on
light through the trees the hunter flees again
but you're not here today
and with the dawn comes another day
into i dont know you anymore
never quite sure what you meant
time
and in truth a fatal deal
no one leaves
though he never thought he'd pay
goparagons of innocence
no one leaves
and written on that wreath
that it's unwise in god eyes
of men who lived in mansions
so the wind has blown this wreath to me
the legions growing stronger
heads upon the platform
raise the fist of the metal childout there coming closer quicker
power of the night
i've been pushed out but i'm back up on my feet
i know love it is all a gamerage rage rage rage
and your bills past due
while you've hidden in these bars
gone a bit off track
and without hesitating
and the silence hung like death
sammy saw it in his eyes
now there's a gargoyle on that belfry and he's been up there for years
scream murder what can you do
scream murder the last words you say
gazing with an appetite
oh yeah she's in loveshe just loves to please
oh yeah she's in love
she's only rock 'n roll yeah
oh she's only rock 'n roll
no she's only rock 'n roll
you're approaching the island of the
who are those women
remains till the sailor are gone
till it took him down
hanging round
there are certain things we cant explain
taste me i'll taste you
tied up she gets wild
skull session
it seems i just dont see
never even tried
instead of to statues
for surely you must care
and so i pled my case
he never closed his eyes
watching waiting
old man tell me what have we become
old man tell me what have we become
it's a gutter ballet
soon he's just a fantasyit's a gutter ballet
another chapter in the play
we fear
his deep
in the hall of the mountain king
to where i hid him we must run
it shelters like an ark
wash your women
had and lost
in the distance there's a thunder
twisting in my
the night is growing dark
and are you looking for somebody new
i am hard for your love tonight
part of the things you do
out of control
i am hard for your love tonight
hard for love
no fallen angels prophecy
yeah i carved that stone right through
final loss
we are coming upon the day
holocaust
the cry of the hounds live forevermore
nature's beasts derranged
through the bitter rain and cold
sampled by mistake
lurking in the darkness
standing in the shadows
there's no land that is so small that it cannot divide
and so his eyes are drifting to the house next door
middle 8
i see a little man sitting and he's wondering
you you you you you
and if i go away
searching for a chord i cant hear
and i'm always there
with no one by my side
in the dream
hung out on the boulevard
jesus started changin
her him cut through the night
promising salvation to strays
never ever got her name
i was captured from the start
i still could feel her crystal eyes haunting me
she's got my heart and my soul
our paths i'm sure will cross
instrumental
our legions needs
can they hear your battle cry
we come from the darker light
banging hard across the ground
good god
lights out
yeah she's got you like a big fool
head trapped between the wall
criminal days
without a flame
with the friends he made
he beats the wife
cause that's his style
am i losing my way
this strange insanity
look to the future
she is a native of the stormy skies yeah
oh i i followed her
she flies strange wings
somewhere
and this is where it has led
somewhere out there
glitter in the dark
your eyes are opened wide
red eyes sunken and stark
stuck on you
you cant spend this night alone
oh you're satisfied
hey you
when your always out there feeding your head
hey you
welcome to the prison
no time
i cant escape
the dungeons are calling
they think i'm crazy
cant bite the hand that feeds ya
yes you know it's true
believe it's right
the ending is
moved the ocean
to me
on the ocean look for land
in the grip of the storm
only this and nothing more
and would never learn
thinking god would understand
he pushes it off while he stays on the land
now our story's nearly over
when the captain had him thrown to the sea
that going to the authorities
he leaned against the tiller
and the ocean watched him leaving
on that next beat
and until that time
gotta get the message through
gotta get the message through
you'll be forever the same i dont think you'll change
i know you're all alone tonight
is your soul on the line my dear
that's the price you paythere's no need to worry
that's the price you pay
only silent company
i have never been a man of passions
there are wounds that bleed in silence
i believe what the prophets said
dont see or heed the warning
but in this world of heartless men
lord tell me what is to be
not knowing the price he would pay
they safely reached the port
to let the case slip through the cracks
when your soul will wash up on heavens shore
dares the stars to grant a wish
the whip is gonna get you
yea i'm gonna stay up late
drop you to your knees
the time has arrived and this is the one place to be
lead break
but that was long before the nights began to burn
for is this the answer to our prayers is this was god has sent
is this the answer to our prayers is this was god has sent
time and time and time again
used my friends to let them down
looks in the mirror
followed it to the letter
but when you need them
still she was afraid
she's traded every tomorrow
this i have always known
so he now turned to the ocean
i have read the words of shakespeare
now all i've loved have gone before me
that youth so freely gave
and have devised a plan
will be my final wake
some points the ocean did concede
now perfumed with romance
is born you see
or youthful king
what you romanticize
was running through his hands
rollerskate baby
little sister ride
i tried suicide
go down down down
away from light in darkest night
for he was a deckhand
that the captain had thrown in the sea
before that final sleep
and say this cannot be done
and undone cannot be
so unusual
so unusuali know some things cant be right
there's a light at the end of the hall
when the hour strikes 13
a lake of fire
look out beware
as the edge of midnight falls
and they cant get away
warriors of the worldon the streets they are roaming the night
kill or be killed
warriors warriors
when will this night come to end
when will this night come to end
washed out
watching you
watching you fallbetter not think about it
so close my eyes and pretend i am sleeping
i say it's time we play
the minstrel and the sorcerer
saints and hopeless sinners
while still safely out of reach
he was the last man of his kind
for eighty years plus seven
when she'd left here many years before
to others she was gray and old
that he could say to make her stay
when the skin is thin the heart shows through
but i'm still alive and my fingers feel
now that the lights are gone
so i play and i plan
and the ghosts
she leads you to your grave
white witch white witch
wicked white demon
taking your souls
taking control
white witch white witch
you've always been a good friend of mine
the only time you're satisfied
oh no no no oooh
as he stood on the stage
but somewhere in time we all pay
had some parents once
got to belongghost in the ruins
sellin her soul away so put in your order
ghost in the ruins
i know
and answer his need
trespassing force
midas knight
dropped on the world below wait for the afterglow
we never contemplate we only offer fate
chorus
my baby's right beside me
and the world by the tail
we really got it made
pulled up in the yard
of rebar and concrete
till my best pal ran off with my best girl
cause i never had a more solid friend
man i could use a new guitar
chorus
you set your sights like a loaded gun
to play a different tune
so young so green so blue so bold
would not be home till after five
she said your not the man you used to be
and still confused
i thought i could handle anything
these days i wanna kick 'em around
fame and fortune i can take or leave
i cant get over how i'm all wound up
which inspire your heavenly song
gloria sweetly singing o'er the plains
chorus
but what gave them the right
in four years the smoke had cleared
now some of them boys were friends of mine
and she keeps on goin even when the heartache's growin strong
they tried to lose us in the hype of fortune and fame
leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
just leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
just leave me my guitar i'll have an ax to grind
there aint no moonlight drive in here
it hasnt been easy letting you go
he set his mind talkin about elvis lookin like james dean
playin blue blue denim soul
blue blue denim soul
i look in your eyes and all i see
love's an addiction love survives
put it back together friday night
my baby drives a buick
aint the way i go around gettin my trills 'cause
and he's fifty years old
but it's a thankful man that gets it
and they sit here drinking coffee all alone
chorus
what i'm getting closer to the closer we get
can you hear me now
can you hear me now
it's a circle that just keeps goin around
and by the size of the crowds in and out of church
if people smile even when it's against their nature
i wish it was christmas all year long
there'll be one in the hugs around my legs
any to and from you go
for you for me for family and friends
for you for me for family and friends
chorus
way way too long i'll be here yeah ready and a waiting
you can call me any ole time
run back baby
i had some words with her old man
we finally said enough is enough
chorus
now it's been twenty years or so
chorus
because an easy street might lead you astray
you gotta watch your back and look both ways
it was a lo loco motive
if it wasnt wasnt for that train
she hit the track and she wont be back to stand on common ground
well i aint a jealous man but i got a doubt
i dont mean to accuse
makin the way for that big one out tonight
these old trade winds are blowin warm and slow
chorus
it's night and day
i used to wonder if that made a difference either way
and oh us shepherds we all came
and oh us shepherds we all came
and oh
that get to feelin good right when a hole wears through
just another old pair of shoes
take me mind off all the troubles
like all my love for you still feels the same
'cause there'll be one less pony in this one horse town
i've been lassoed by loneliness branded by the blues
and like the rest she quit comin around
chorus
because the prettiest girl that he's ever seen
she's tryin to hide
boy you got no clue
rosie knows but she wont say
there was a chick and an old scarecrow
they look like they could take a man
well the sky got black
there's a speed zone ahead but all right i dont see a cop in sight
six days on the road and i'm gonna make it home tonight
six days on the road and
cant wait to tell somebody it's getting better every time
in small talk dont you know what i heard about so and so
chorus
chorus
when you rolled your eyes and twirled my pink fur dice
chorus
better leave the porch light burning just in case your wrong
but there's someone whose never wanted anybody else
you see in me something i never found
and you'll find me when you need
you pull over and i jump in
clean out of sight
this aint the time to talk about that
there at the end of september
now and then as we walked down the hall
chorus
there's a rock or two on the road
we aint getting lost where ever we go
some days she cant outrun you or me
but we're livin on love way above our means
then you'd see i'm down so low
oh but yesterday's too clear
but when the landlord says it's over
these days a man and his dreams can get a little burned
all the love you gave me
i would gladly be the fieldhand if you were the field
i been saving up my lovin saving it for you
well i keep asking 'bout your love dear
we still think the whole world of you
glory to you the king
we sing to you
wonderin if your timin was right
and went down burnin
make a wish wish i may i wish i might
making sure that you dont hear
and half a mind to go
i'm half a heart half a mind
to save a lonely world god sent his only son
hallelujah hallelujah he is here
chorus
you love your woman and do her right and try to get a little sleep at night
come friday you get your pay get in your car and drive away
getting tougher by the minute
yeah
but some prayers are hard to pray
this child was the king of kings
so every heart could understand
the proof lay in those nail scarred hands
chorus
chorus repeats twice
hold on hold on
hold on hold on
the trees roll by and the white lines hold me back
so until we find a place to make a new start
so begins this beautiful journey
a seven day saint or a seven day sinner
what was once a weight on my shoulders
a seven day saint or a seven day sinner
what was missin
i think they call it intuition
who walks and talks like you know who
i need a girlfriend to hold me
first they gotta squeeze us
it's just a cheap thrill when
look into your heart for the one solution
just one life given willingly
and i remember
your heart's on fire but it wont burn
chorus repeats twice
so to honor him pa rum pa pum pum
to lay before the king pa rum pa pum pum
beside the still water
i can feel you hand gently lead me home
chorus
her heart cant help but break
i know exactly how lucky i am
thank god for you
the devil for the trouble that i get into
chorus
but we sure do remember them well
and if i ever get the chance
here in the middle of the middle west
i'll never go down easy
i feel tears wellin up cold deep inside
and here comes pride in the backstreatch
and how i lived in fear of waking up each morning
my tears are holdin back
looked out at the school bus and his little man and said
down our long dusty driveway
and his mind was wandering
was it the lightning on the water
i could've walked away
she thinks if only he could see her now
where hearts dont touch and ends dont meet
the girls from work are going out tonight
expectation was a none too great
and they dance and they dance
cowboys and cowgirls just for show
there's trouble on the line
i wont have a choice
lordy i've been denied
dancin with a new shoe
cause it aint love 'til twist comes to shout
when you run from love
when you run from love
some things just come when it's christmas time
no bedtime stories just questions instead
that it's right where you are
chorus
where was i when you stopped lovin me
when did i become history
everything that i have or can do
duet with dana mcvicker
we'll leave a trail smokin when we drive away
above thy deep and dreamless sleep a thousand stars go by
oh little town of bethlehem
you hold your head up high
hollywood if new york could
we got a 747 coming down in the night there's a 747 goin into the night
strangers in the night lost on separate flights
we cant see a thing here in the night strangers in the night
we were strangers in the night
life for you has just began that's what he said
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good
money rules the game
at the altar of the gods
reflected in the city
are there clouds up in the sky
we sat in the sun woah oh oh
and the bands played on
nothin can stop us breakin through
we're back we're back on our feet again
we're reaching for the skywe're back on the streets again
we're back we're back on the streets again
they like to rock 'n roll
just give me more cant get enough cant get enough
twenty thousand voices screaming
take the eagle from the sky
can you hear the thunder rolling
welcome to the nightmare
can you see the people
the seeds of war are sown
to meet the fearless clansmen
let me hear
let me hear
im on my way im coming home
keeping it together blasting my way home
'cause on this night the blood will flow
you know that your time has come
keep out of sightyou never see him out in the sunlight
bloodletter bloodletter
bloodletter
where are they now
the broken heroes
seven lonely graves on goose green
repeat to end
bring the glory down on you
feel the heat start the burn
you're turning all the young boys on
calling you tonight
run with the pack
you know you're dressed to kill
it's the call of the wild
that took him down
searching for the harvest from the deep
my father was a working man
we're living in the calm before the storm
to take you up towards the astro plane
follow me this could be the end of your life
follow me walking to the circle of light
they're calling they're calling i have to be there
for christendom's sake we'll take our revenge
with all your might
believe what is right
fight the good fight
the lies and deceit
the lies and deceit
cut out the disease
digging up rocks in this god forsaken valley
guitar solo
grab a bottle or a crate
party till u puke
party till u puke
there's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you down
there's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you down
they'll never stop the music they're living in the past
i've got no emotions i'm living with thunder and steel
to the power and the glory
i'm fighting for freedom i'm safe i've got god on my side
to the power and the glory
ninety tons of thunder
iron striking metal
i take a ride across the sky
i saw the writing on the wall
falling down like rain on the ground
going down
spreading like a plague across the land
going down
going down
just me and my machine i'll take you tonight
hey mamma can you hear the monster scream
somewhere in the night a candle burns for you
but still they play your music all around the world

to make it to the border of mexico

one night in louisiana down by highway eighty four
solid ball of rock crashing out of the sky
solid ball of rock
it's shaking all over but he dont know why
there's no more denying
in a midnight blue lagoon
10 light years away to change it all
close your eyes and it will crush you

weepin gently in my soul
are you ready to rock
cause the world's gonna stop
we're fallin down from the top
are you ready to rock
i wish this night could last forever
a moment in a million years
i leave you all behind
a moment that i wont forget
behind my driving wheel world seems fine
god that's me and my life
because the limit is the sky
is not the way that i can take
break the ice but never break
the night's exploding everywhere
your future wont see the light of the day
death is just a moment away
and whatever you do there's no way out
they pray for eternal damnation
all night long

make love to me right now
lyricsherman rarebell
i want hot love you know and i need it now
loved it more than any drug i couldnt stand it
i dream with open eyes
that we can burn the sky
suddenly out of nowhere
are you the one
just out of sight
and that's alright
she got me high and loose loose loose
if you feel that life's passing by passing by
ends up in new frustrations
es el morro de los negros la mansion
aunque no tenga capilla reza la gente sencilla
jealous hearts are deep oh so deep
jealous hearts are red so dark red
who's sitting on a cloud
wherever i go wherever i go
just keep me in your dreams
my little backstage queen
dirty rats are on their way
if you dont play along with their games
bad boys running wild
how does it fell babe
babe i miss you so much more than words can say
i need your love babe dont treat me this way
but it's more like spinning wheels of fortune
big city big city nights
you keep me burning
i look around and see this face
blackout
would like to know before i stop
blackout
before i give you everything i've got
stand up and rock with me
if your blood is so hot
crossing those ice cold waters
crossing those ice cold waters
and i'm always on my way
bringing this baby home
your time will come i'll make you feel it
you were born just to lose or to win
you've got your songs
sailing home where freedom rings
we shall be found with keys of light
we shall be one as morning light
and after alls been said and done
in the valley of the fools in the valley of the fools
standing up against the tide
i wont let you down
something has come over me
come inside now you are cold
can you feel it love is waiting there
is right now all need
down down
is that the night of your eyes
is that the wind in your eyes
i was out
she likes my sugar she likes my bread
she lives in my kitchen
tonight i'm going to kill ya
you're gonna be now
priscilla oh priscilla
riding lady luck
wanna move your hips
my mama said i had a devil to scratch my soul
in a roaring sixties summer night
let the film just roll
remember the bad times
in the summer of love
bad times good times
time's gonna fly
a wild horse to ride
another place to bare my heart and soul
here i go
is what i've got for you
got the groove that hits the bone
and let your feeling grow
is the game i'm looking for
and i say oooh oooh
where we live what we do with our magic from my generation
i lost my life

the bitch is hungry
my body is burning
the wolf is hungry
you let me in but wont let me out
the temperature's rising put the helmet on
rock zone
like no other
be a lover
new lovers come
you can do it
with a rubber fucker
be a lover
hear this voice from deep inside
seek the roses along the way
hear this voice from deep inside
here i am
for me someday
come on and set me free
walk away
for me someday
i'ii be waiting always
she's giving me a private dance
she's like a shot of adrenaline
and throw it right outside
she's knocking at my door
another mindless crime
keeps on following the sirens call
i see the fear explode just like
i see the fear explode just like
it wont take long 'till we collide
to bring a man down on his knees
to make a man just sell his soul
to bring a man down on his knees
that i'm under the spell of your love
a child of love angel like
the world is so bad you drive 'em all mad
and now i wonder what life will bring
sly come home alive
i'm pushed to the limit
my bones are broken into pieces
no turning back no more yesterdays
i'm gonna win some way
relax it
relax it
beggar or a king
the world out there is downn dirty honey
the world out there is downn dirty honey
the world out there is downn dirty honey
you know that guy with piccadilly eyes
lyrics diane warren
that's where you'll be
you might think our time is through
my love is waiting
here in my heart
the days of your life
the days of your life
i cant forget that afternoon
it turned around right then
we're goin home it's nice and warm to say
hey you i'm in love with your smile
i really die
you're driving me wild
came by today
i wish him luck and then he said goodbye
what else was there for me to do but cry
if someone wants to cut you down to size
you play with fire get your fingers burned
if someone wants to cut you down to size
i'm ready for that hit between the eyes
exchange your troubles for some love
lyricsklaus meine herman rarebell
no one can make me change my mind
to be your ever faithful strong lovin man
alright dont want me to stay
you'd like a holiday
you'd like a holiday
longing for the sun you will come
it was just a lie
there's no use crying
for our downfall
you better shut your mouth
when i'm telling you to stay down
dont make a sound
an angel cries
you're a needle in the hay
the world you made
humanity
you're a drop in the rain
humanity
my cat is purring
i've got to leave
just have to make it
here i am rock you like a hurricane
i'm feeling good enough baby
but i cant explain cant explain
when i feel blue
i'm trying to say to you
i cant explain baby
but when you turn upside down
she jets across the ocean
ohh so i keep waiting i keep waiting
i wanted to cry
the smile and installations are my pain
the smile and installations are my pain
yes i'm leaving you i've got to go
keep me in your mind till i
come back to love ya
faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world
i wake up in the morning
hey hey
when i'm in a trance
i'm in a trance
she'll catch me 'cos i've been longing
leave everything behind me
bloody money when it's lent
asking him for give up his demand
they want money oh
is there anybody there with that inclination
is there anybody there with that inclination
lovely sarah
no taste in your line
so leave my life alone
and you're not my wife
so leave my life alone
hey hey hey i've gotta be free
i think you know the answers but maybe you cant tell
kami o shin jiru
the innocent wont feel the judgement day
to give it all away
it feels so good to start another endless night
ooh yeah shake it for me baby
she gets her kicks after six
more than anything i want to be
the ice will melt away
'cause it's just a kiss of borrowed time
arranged byscorpions
souls flight into the cold blight
you'd better start crying
i remember when my teacher said
they tried to break me with their rules
there's no other way of life
is walk around to catch the thrill
enjoy the zoo
and hungry eyes are passing by
what they are doing what they need
i feel fine though i realize
they see nobody they see themselves
this is my song
i wanna know what you've got to say
when you're mine
dont wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
i keep running from my shadow
if you could see it through my eyes
there'll be a lucky star
to stand up every time i fall
leaves the hole inside my heart
they're days you wanna cry
sometimes your world goes down in flames
goodbye yesterday
you gotta draw the line
tomorrow's all that counts
i just wanna come
he's a superstar wunderbar out of touch too much
it is time to give my dog a bone
to be number one
isnt it fun fun fun fun to be number one
to be number one
but my desire for you is much too strong
but it's all in vain
girl i'm on fire
to be with in heaven
in heaven
each generation makes us stars
honest love's so hard to find
cant you see the end
twentieth century man
she was praying for her son
we watch the lamb lay down to the sacrifice
sometimes i think i'm going mad
'cause we all live under the same sky
it came up screaming from the ashes of the grave
troubled times dont turn your back to the lions
cry like you feel
death on the screen
garbage in the streams
lyricsklaus meine
cause you you're walking on the edge
for you life is just like chess
our journey called discovery
to love just means we really care
we dont own the world oh no
we come to you through a wall of thunder
energized by the feedback of the crowd
with all those scarves in your hands
so i can see you are there
we're ready to rock we're ready to roll
on a plain lit cold december see it evermore
sun in the sky made the world fly into time
well i lived in magic solitude
darkness everywhere and nothing more
walking through a winter night
memories of you are passing by
and passing time
lady starlight help me tonight
you look up to the sky
but the world would be cold
in a world full of pain
cruisin and boozin
please me
i never wasted any time
tease me
i'm getting loose just like the night before
i need a girl like you
and you're the one i really need tonight
the only king of rock has gone
the riot of your time
the hits from 1994 electric fire
when your electric plays
cause it's all about the love anyhow
take another breath
you keep my faith alive
you keep my faith alive
you keep my faith alive
well you know
well you know
around around around around
keep it in there as long as you can
it doesnt go right
lyrics klaus meine rudolf schenker
'cause life is too short
where angels come from
i'd turn back time
'cause life is too short
too short
and the beauty of the past is rejoicing your mind
like a river is getting wide
life's like a sea without end
and in my heart
but i couldnt find it
living and dying
to get it done
i'm living for today
a human face a human face
to make this world a better place a better place
to make this world a better place
wishing you were here
i gotta fight for you yes i do
all those lonely nights
now i've had enough
lyricspenniman
ye e e eh baby
gonna have some fun tonight
gonna have some fun tonight
time's passing by and i
there was a place where we used to seek shelter
you were my lorelei
my ship has passed you by
shot through the heart but now i know better
no change in the season
love 'em or leave 'em
i've seen it all and so much more
love 'em or leave 'em
she treated me
i wanna feel you
but you never life
but i cant leave
love is blind

too hard to reach
life goes by
passion turns to hate and you make
and i gave you everything
on the day you crossed the line
found out love is war
because you dont know
because you dont know
dont take it away from me
right from your lips
and inside out
always loaded like a gun
love will keep us alive
there's an empty feeling in my mind
love will keep us alive
you know i'd never want to control you
even the darkest night
a girl to drive a car to love
the city lights of london town
it's a lovedrive on wheels of fire
it's a lovedrive
you were on my mind love everyday
loving you sunday morning
takin a chance it's now or never
if this will be a night to treasure
is it love
is it lust is it love
throw your dice take your chance
to open up your life for you
dont you know it could come true
fantasy
and you'd like to be another
keep it cool it's not too late
never will return
till they stop their senseless wars
how long will it take
dont make the world a flaming star
boy you'r home you're dreaming dont you know
it's great to be here to see you all
the higher we'll go
had enough of the truth
i'm more dead than alive
i wish it would be worlds away
so what else can i say
it seems to me a nightmare becomes reality
which is as long as exciting hundred years
force yourself to use your brain
some people say everything's good
there is no one
sweet little child
then it's over for a while
sweet little child
then it's over for a while
she is daddy's girl
dark lady
sighing crying
deep down in my heart
it's deep and dark
i think you know the answers but maybe you cant tell
you'll find the secrets of this life deep inside of you
mon destin inscrit en toi
but it makes no sense at all
so many things that i recall
does anyone know
does anyone know
how to make me feel
and then one night we took a ride
she'll make your heart break
you're back where you begin
the girls insane
dont believe her dont believe her
says you're the only one but dont believe her
i saw this girl walking down the street
next day can you believe she was at the show
oh no dont make no promises
to the best time of your life
to the best time of your life
nobody's in the valley
and laugh about him all the time
some days are tides of life
hell or heaven night or day
who's gonna drive you home tonight
who's gonna drive you home tonight
ich atme durch voller gier i breath through complete lust
du bringst mich noch einmal um den verstand you tell me yet again about the
du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn you are so nasty and yet so fine
oh du meine phantasie oh you're my fantasy
i close my eyes
dust in the wind
dust in the wind
give ya all my size
take you down to hell
let's get it really tight
dynamite
lyricsklaus meine
keep on dancing tonight
has turned into a dead end street
keep on dancing tonight
into the setting sun
today all life is gone
just the present was alive
without you
i'd left reality behind
lyrics klaus meine
i'll see you again see you again
so many years before my time
it's now that i'd just wish so much to see you
ooh oooh
ooh oooh
so many things are wrong
far away far away
lyricsklaus meine
and i see the smile on your face
the man with a gun
fly to the rainbow
satellites transmit the latest thrill
over and over and over
hear me calling
hear me calling
you gotta spread the seed
the way you feel for me
hear me calling
dont use your fist use your brain
dont use your fist use your brain
we're living in a violent world
mind power every hour any minute every day
if you want it to
mind power every hour any minute every day
a moment of glory called evolution
moment of glory
moment of glory
who's to blame my love
who's to blame my love
it has been way too long
are you excited too
i dont know how you feel
you get my feet back on the ground
i want you to feel the taste of life
this moment in time
but she remains quite
mysterious
certainly not for you and me
through the window of our time
here comes the young the new generation
you are the only ones
some time at the famous grill
underneath you spell
i'm getting spanked with cold champagne
oh oh i'm back at midnight alright
drive me down nightmare avenue
come away come away come away
we gotta make it there's no limit
lyricsklaus meine
i just wanna be loved by you
you'd take all my sorrow away
lyricsklaus meine mark hudson
no pain no gain yeah
no pain no gain yeah yeah
lyricsklaus meine herman rarebell
teach me to fly
there's nothing that can bring me down
it's gonna be wild
but i'll be there
my world went upside down insane
it can not get any better
in my life
i've been running away most of my life
it's no one else it's only you
sometimes life just takes the long way home
with no one else just with you
all these girls are so smart
i can feel all you love and your pain
well i try to refuse
do the best that i can as you know
i want you to stay only with me
do the best that i can as you know
down in the city
some real satisfaction
and dont you ever stop messing around
i want you to show me baby
and dont you ever stop messing around
you're running me down
we overcome stormy waters
on the crimson sky
searching for light in the dark
once you're in
we're on some kind of a mission
on the crimson sky
gambling rules my life
when passion rules the game
dont you need some love tonight
crow black the nights caging my mind
crow black the nights caging my mind
i know i should leave
and out of the flames
and out of the flames
angels on fire
i'm in love with the fallin rain
and my love had a home
i feel blue since you're gone
it's more than you ever had
when it's time time time
a couple of songs to play for you an me
i cant go on without it anymore
i just never want it back
i just never want it back
finally i know and that's for sure
it's cutting through so deep
well life goes 'round
we run away
when love kills love
when the smoke is going down
when the smoke is going down
i've been waiting for
ooh ahh
and the world stopped turnin round
and the world stopped turnin round
for your love
there's plenty of room for dreaming
you find me
to that old river
by the river under suburban skies
you find me
you find me where the river flows
and while the sun goes down
to leave it all behind
that hope will not die
have to pay the price pay another price
fly with the wind
where the children cry
i know the fever's coming
and the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
she's on fire
she's a wild child
escuchando vientos nuevos
llevame a la magia del momento
llevame a la magia del momento
ya no hay tiempo que perder
donde los sueos de los nios cambiarn
did you ever think
distant memories
on a glory night
on a glory night
i'm chained to the fears
i see shadows
they wont leave me alone
i gotta break the spell
do you remember all the pain
they ask her 'bout life on earth
he's been sitting on the bay
lyricsulrich roth
take me away from here
take me away from here
to find our love a place where we can hide away
you and i just have a dream
you and i just have a dream
i lose control when you look at me like this
it's written down inside your heart
it's all written down in your lifelines
till the day i die
it makes me sad all the time
let's try again
you give me all i need
i'll throw the pages on the floor
beautiful as the first day i met you
cause when you know the love is gone
cause i cant exist
when there is no love for you
lose your mind
i'm a pawn
but my tongue is tied
do you ever let emotions
you played me like a toy
everybody knows
lyrics klaus meine
for the soul behind the face
would you love me for what i am
now hear what he says
and friends in the royal albert hall
you like david bowie
you live in his heart
i'm back with you
just lay your hands on me
scare you dare you anyway i want you
master blaster buy a jabocaster
as hard as you have been
scare you dare you anyway i want you
get out to see them write
steamrock fever in la
steamrock fever in la
to win back your love again
that i cant get through
if we'd go again
i would try to change
time it needs time
can break down the wall someday
i'm loving you
the things that killed our love
what you've been through
i'm driving out of town just follow my heart
rocking night after night day after day
lyrics klaus meine
ooh you better find a way around
ooh you better find a way around
yeah
ooh lord i need a break
look at the sun inside
how can you waste your time
ah i cant be cool
oh yeah it's like a drug
show me the white rolls royce in the rain
what can i do so my life
but instead i'm a poor son of a bitch
cant you see that it aint funny
many crazy nights
tease me
sometimes they make it hard to choose
before i have to go
you taught me everything i know
keeping me forever young
through the wind and rain
and the best is yet to come
soldiers never die
and you've always been the one
take my hand the best is yet to come
to play your wicked games
they say the devil doesnt rest
the cross i'm bearing
you made me kneel
i'll nail you to the cross
and you're just a touch away
dont let me fall you've gotta
and the future never dies
and the future never dies
to make you see the light
from the moment that you hit the ground
the strong survive
it's time to play
another breath begins
pumping blood to your head
and life will be alright
bring the boys back home again
the good die young
stay out of trouble son
alice said have you forgotten what will be
until the twilight fades
get away
said you better stay
'fore i lose my mind
try to put it back together
i watch the shadows fall across the floor
through cruel hallways
lights in the barriers
feel it slipping every day
where do you stand when it's all over
i guess that you dont care about it nowwhere do you stand when it's all over
truth less little town
unconquered and unreal
fill your head with everything you find
count the miles before they pass you by
can we go back to the moments that we held before
there's things you wont believe
should i stay or should i hide
changing memories they fade away
of empty promises in a lonesome town
heard it on the wings that you're going to die
i'd never seen your face i'm here
when you walked into the room
one touch leaves a mark upon the hand
dont you hide in the ashes
'cause i know what's coming then
i see it coming my way run
and let us know
until your destinies dissolve
certain keys were held until they must have let you go
and i know they're just repeating
and now i cant come back
but i know they're just repeating
i walk in cold rain
with some experience we'll go
days within a glass cube
anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
i've seen what you've never seen
i've left what you'd never leave
but now i can repeat 2x's
watching many moons go by around your head
in the direction of the sun
your eyes have turned to atone
torn like an old dollar bill
trying to make it better
been gone a while
trying to make it better
control just seems to twist around
til both become the ceiling
dont look down
lord hear me pray
all these dying days repeat waiting for the sunshine x2
timeless echoes of green
catch baby dinosaurs and see how well they ride
orange circles of a southern sunrise
there'll be screams like you cant imagine
all the sights and the sounds
i stand at the window the dim light is fading
you know that i'm never going to go back home againwell alright now
and the waves meet the ship
i've led an angel to the edge of the night
you wanna give me something that you can choose
when you put your head into the flower web
we're not alone when it's the two of us
when you put your head into the flower web
loud voices fill the sky
a different way to bring you down
dont turn away you havent yet awakened
if there isnt time then you should let it go
why dont you stay remember what you said
baby tell me what have i done wrong
no one knows just where we go
there's a change this too will pass
lies still unspoken
listening the wind is turning sweet to sour
take me to a new day
little orange airplane
she turns her head and never tells you who
other different days on different planets yeah
leaving all these things behind
suddenly it never ends
tried but i couldnt make it
come down with me
residing in a land that's either
heavy as the smoke still lingers
waiting for you to come along
say i should change before it's too late
you should know i've got nothing to say
without a reason without a reason
the hour is drawing ever closer
to find a reason to carry on
before the dust will trip you up again
when you appeared i just happened to be
it's coming over me again yeah
wasted like a sad devotion
she knows she knowsdont hesitate it's my fate
she knows the time is this
now i dont remember why i ever stayed
smoke rings drift over me
gone so long and feeling so let down
waves have washed home their disease
alone i see myself and stare
the face that looks on in my mirror
well all the nights last a thousand years
just standing on the edge of the wall
in a storm was she dead
there's a ghost in my head
some things never change
i get burned away
i dreamed you were there
and the carcasses of a million dead sheep
now i'm counting my chances gone 1 2 3
it hovers slow till you finally know
pushin me so very nearnow the walls are closing in right on you
what are you gonna do now
wont be the one
it's another tear
what could've been
all that's gone before
but the street light you're the only witness
where to fall and i could be calling
we're baptized still getting blinded in the darkness
then you cry please dont
do you feel
not at all said i'd never go
come on
his first contact is his only sight
pathway
alone and unreliable
secret kind
sign on the wall that i dont understand
everything inside is burning
close my eyes to the dawn
just as far as you know it's alright
you watch them burn
in a lonely way
she wont tell you why
your patterns locked in all these drawers
to find that i didnt know you
i was traveling too far away
ah ah ah
but only you would remember when
if you decide which one you want
ah ah ah
in these prisons i cant abide
i cant unbind
it's just another question of faith
will turn your head away
will turn your head away
booked and i got to hurry
till it's laid to waste
you take away and no one knows
been waiting such a long time
you never know where the twain shall meet
so very long and it doesnt matter where this has gone
which one stays
your pale skin cant turn any whiter
over again you could find a way
and a precious vice
now raindrops fall away like souls
it's kind of hard now to see it all
the gaze of eyes will feel so cold
and find the time to fear is past
that's what i said
hung me on the line
shine
a room that's washed in burnin tears
yard trip number sevens
they all tell you to try
whoa
and nobody wants to hear
in your ears it rings
i run out the door and into the hall
you tell me all these things while the darkness hides the light
you'll find me never more
i wont remember all that's said
drink your wine away instead
come on now i'm waiting
there's only you forever
run out into my side forever
come on come on go back to find
keep your hand on the gospel plow
coming down the sky burns into my soul
not at all
road keeps twisting slow so i know
it wont change
she wears a halo of ashes
glorified in the dying of the sun
specter on the wind
the books they all want to tempt me
ten years after i have read
remember everything you said
now i'm on the other side
sentimental memories call you back to your life
i've got a pain inside my heart now cant you see babe
out here they're gonna all ignore us
not a lot of miles to take me
shall i not ponder everything inside
just a flash of confusion when we meet
that i got illumination on the street
water drips inside my head
you're climbing down fast
and when it melts in my mouth
ivy on the wall
a dog hides from the heat
i'm thinking paradise
you dont ever know where to fall
that's how your father died
how it was and always is
and it wont take very long too long
like the chill wind
i know i would i've seen it's real
lines are forming circling round my eyes
lonely girl
not in my world
she's walking by
really need to take it now
and you're on my mind
you make my mind 2x's
you're on my mind
feels like there's nothing to explain
nothing left to hear
we're going to the poison planet
looking to you with gratitude that seems unreal somehowtime to know just what i'm buying
time to know just what i'm buying
and it's taken us somewhere
did you hear the distant lie
i nearly lost you there
found a foggy street
here she's coming and she's drunk again
and i dont deserve her
i couldnt hurt her like everyone
now i limit myself to a six gun quota
and i bottled them up 'til the well ran over x2
chafing straitjacket i wont die in there
save me smiling jesus get off that cross
i dont care if you are
do you believe in love
and all for naught
words are spaces between us
but what a waste of my time when the world we have is yours
you can break me down if it takes all your might
you've gone away you dont feel me here anymore
'cause i'm broken when i'm lonesome
i cant believe in yesterday
i keep faking faking fake
you are the reason we will never be set free
i will never belong to you again
come sit close to me
if i decide that i am alive
come sit close to me
when stink fades into smell
you cant break
cant deny the enemy's taken over
when i'm lying next to you
when i tell you i love you
we have to succumb to the feelings we can never face
then she told me she had a gun
i'm weak
if you succumb to the lies of the rebel
if you succumb to the lies of the rebel
today's the day we'll find our way grown
but i'm coming back
today's the day we'll find our way grown
good god you're dragging it out
you gave up on your dreams along the way
the one you sold to fool the world
or making senses that were lost in time
i believe in the fallen
hey man i see them comin
i believe i believe
try to stay sober feels like i'm dying here
you say it's over i can sigh again yeah
you're never gonna get away
seems everything's gonna be fine for me
remnant of a vacant life
god only knows
fuck me like you hate me
you come around when you finally face this
fuck me like you hate me
'cause i cant face myself in a mirror
i guess i like it when we fight
fuck it i'll heal you in me
fuck it i feel you in me
wanna get some on my love
that she wastes her life on
when i saw that beauty queen
she's got no one to hate
dress up in your best
make you regret and make you afraid of me
cause i've wasted all i've known
i dont belong here
never run away son
in time the pain will melt
empty and feeling numb
i gave my life away
wish i could fake
premeditation will kill the trust
the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
she's coming over wearing genocide
and the scratches she'd hide
i never found out how she could lie with a smile on her face and the darkness inside
my memories are all stained again
i remember all you said to me now
me
but i am afraid of trying
that i am ashamed of lying
and i am afraid
you're so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
you're no jesus christ
i keep rollin over
nobody's gonna stand in my way
you cant hold me down
pig
take it away 'cause i dont like this anymore
i am a plastic man wish i can be the one you could be proud of
another tradegy but you're too cold to feel
steal my pride
leave me blind blind blind now
well now kill me kill me kill me kill me
if you want me hold me back
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
call your name every day when i feel so helpless
i'll mend myself before it gets me
watch it blow my mind
it feels like i'm losing again
but give me your open hand
i dont wanna be alone again
until the day you killed me again
i dont wanna be alone again
i dont wanna be alone again
and i'm sympathetic
and i'm sympathetic
i cant make it go away i cant make it go away
as beautiful as fire against the evening sky
cleansed and pure and weak i suffer when i dream
i want you to stay i need you here to keep me sane
right on the wrong side of it all
i dont belong here and i'm not well
i am so ashamed of this
can anybody save me
goodbye cruel world
and now i'm deprived of my conscience and something's got to give
convincd on the inside you're so much more than me yeah
so turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
and you're fading with every day
but i am no fun
you could've been the next one should've been enough for me x4
behind me this wasted life
i feel decayed
so find me a way to leave this wasted life
and i dont need friends when i have foes like you
pain and pleasure inviting
i'm just like you just not a fool
i'm sick of wasting time on what can never be
i hate what you are
into wanting me now
hold on baby
and i supposed to be thankful
i'm a liar
i'm a liar
arrive in a life unknown unknown unwise and unaided
act naturally
i dont know what i should but i
till we get it figured out
and your heart is afraid
and it's strange but you're feeling fine
and i'll find someone else to bed
well the time has come for me to find
find someone else to bed
out on your only
and there's nobody to slow you down oh yeah
you dont see me cryin
i tried to get inside i bought a
a visitor a stranger thought i
with twelve little pieces of me
and i was amazed by the things i learned
so for awhile we conducted experiments
windows of airplanes and hotel rooms
i'll memorize everything you do to me so i can teach it when it comes my turn
turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl
time for you to go out to the places you will be from
sleep drifting above you sweetly released
dazed and confused
sleep drifting above you sweetly at peace
you're delicious
you're delicious
you're delicious
here behind your door
i want it to get me back in the crowd
it's not the pain that i'm used to it
so you never even get to go down
the plan was to burn up when the air was clear
you never even get to go down
yes it's time
stay awhile stay awhile
with blue clouds court and spark
you delight me
want a temporary savior
high above the midway lights
then you say that i could never make you mine
and that somebody wants you
that you're priceless
even when you are not new
help me forget tomorrow
to show me you were on my side
all of the rest will follow
and we both want it to happen
for the love of the game
sometimes you've gotta cry a little
playing alone with your lonely toys
you'll eventually get there
and it feels nice 4x
looking for a little bit of something sweet
looking for a little bit of something sweet
it's getting old now
why do i get the feeling you're a lot like me
now the rain turns into snowfall as the
now he looks around his place and anyways
i wish i could be anyone but the one that i am now
you wont even say if you really want me
i cant believe in me for you
swim the high seas for you
the day goes by and darkness grows
keep thinking it'll be alright if i just get on the road
call me
call me
call me
of another life
in another time
you always believed we'd mend it later
running in the current side by side
and your prescription has been signed
baby it's amazing all the things a self contains
he says bye bye baby bye bye
yes he's going away for good
he says bye bye baby bye bye
bye bye baby bye bye
beautiful one sleep in the sun
i hope you last a long long time
making a plan
making a plan
i only have time for today
shaking my mind like an etch a sketch erasin
and it's no longer clear in my mind
some days it takes all my energy just to forget about
i'm destroyed and recreated
like you you love
can make me cry
dont know me
look around myself at the shining toys that
so i'd love to believe
all alone with one true love
and the happily ever after
with a peacefully ever after
so i searched with my greed in the sunshine for all to see there
and i'm afraid i'm never gonna find my way back to where i've been
but a fear has caught my words inside
rising rising
from the bottom of a lake
and we still wanna stay
with a stainless steel balloons
remove this whirling sadness
i'm grieving i'm barely believing now now
if i run i can free my worried mind
but i wouldnt want to leave you behind
she's got a picture in her mind
she can see right through all my little games
and every mistake that i ever made
waiting waiting for the girl to call
where nobody ever goes
i've been living in your cassette
got your tape and it changed my mind
say the promise you long to keep
did you ever look so nice
i wanted to be home again
i want to stay forever in her light
and darkness blows my mind
i'll be a satellite satellite
for somebody like
and give yourself to
now my eyes are open wide
on your body and in your mind
i'm gonna surprise them all
i'm gonna surprise them all
cuz something in my life was run away
ah ah ah
maybe hang on to her phone number too
you gave what you wanted then you went away
what you gave as a gift a gift
cant you see i'm weary
cant you see i'm blurry
cant you see i'm blurry
counting down from ten it's time
when the man at the stop light catches you
getting anywhere
we're speaking in tongues
we're wasting our time
down a wishing well
not even angels saw me
and who who have i become
now the damage is done
all the toil and all exhaustion
the shattered dreams all down
just bitterness remains
a stern cold man is what i am hard relentless
i'll be the last to close the last to close my eyes
equipped a hundred swordmen
awaiting the winter frost
and a thousand men with crossbows
the sign of the dark and the cold
behind the seven seas
confusion will rule till i die
i wander between these worlds
nofaded in dream
sandman stab me in the back
bleed in my arms wounds within
fall from grace as i offer you sin
no looking back to the life i once had
life kicks us in the teeth
yet go onwe go on
yet something makes us crawl back for more
yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
hear these words i say
each funeral just makes us realize
on this momentary trail
and now i can no longer see the shine
it could seem that i'm doing fine
has only led me back to hell
flame thou of wisdom the greatest
set the world on fire
piss upon the graves where thy enemies are laid
raise the gun take aim and blow me away
put a bullet through my head
love your death
will you wait
may death again us unite
this snow in may reminds me
white as the ghostly veil on the ground
now the night descends
nothing more to be lived for me
grave sweet grave welcoming me home
i can see the torment the damage it has done
fears preserved
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
for as long as i remember life has been hard
and i feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
only bastards i havent met
in the dark in death
because here i must dwell eternally
hunt or be hunted
keep my grave open i'm longing to die
and freezing our feelings to ice
the burning light between us is already starting to fade
drowning us in a sea of flames
killing all we have
now everything
it's time tonight's the night
from this trip i'm taking now
i am in shape for the game but for life no more
he'll make it through it all
loving death
his remains upon the hearse ahead
lower the flags
the weight of the world is off your chest
rain drums the lifeless ground
the strongest link of our chain
lead is flying all the signs are there
the strongest link of our chain
my sky is darker than yours my star is brighter than yours
i am before all gods
it was written in the stars that i am the wrathchild
i gave and gave gave all i had
now it's all over and i am done
music tenkula sentenced words jarwa
nepenthe
and drown all your sorrow
reach for the skies for the distant sun
you and i will make it fast
for it's the only way
leave no room for happy endings
far too long the truth's been inverted by false tongues
as the world goes down the drain
far too long they had to wait him to arrive
as the world goes down the drain
i guess my hate grew much stronger than my love for her ever did
and with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
love laved with stillness like the grave in my heart
the dark the silent and the cold
again i reach out in the dark in despair
now there's only the ruthless wind
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
so you thought you'd just put your head
without hope without fear
at the dawn
into the icy abyss of colours
northern lights
obsession obsession obsession
inside my burning mind obsession
at the shattered remains of the world
i hope my life leaves me be dead
and dont be scared take death with open arms
and everything in it
but it seems that you're not receiving
one more day
it makes him wish to be gone
life's been too dire so the fullest desire has died
the moment of departure follows time
leads the fiend out of our minds
arising evil is all i see
hells gates were open for me
can give warmth to my life
and i'll cast mine all over thee
make the glow go away
the candles have been blown out by the wind
she gave me everything i had craved
on day zero my mother was expecting the worst
just let my corpse decay unburied
i do not deserve the luxury of
now every single cloud becomes a raging storm
no longer feeling the pain
the rain comes falling down
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
what can i do now except continue
i only know that at some point
music tenkula sentenced words the serial self killer
i'm the suicider dying every night and day
it's the last one you will get
you'll fire your musket but i'll run you through
the screams of pain as my comrades fallwe hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
and as i lay forgotten and alone
mullan rakoseen vaivun
this tension this pressure
disillusion
the dove of peace falls torn apart
if you could take a look into this fighter's mind
turn away
and in the end we're but two strangers
first came the wind dark clouds and the storm
that spread over our homes
beaten numb i didnt see you sneaking round the corner how could i
i'm right on your track you bastards
i rise from the ashes from these ruins of mine from the rage
vengeance is mine
i'm the warrior of life i know the reaper by name
the shadows are growing long
like beams of the light we are
to the prior deceased
hey little sister who's your superman
i let you go for so longit's a nice day to start again come on
come on
on the margin of emptiness
eager to see
life has given me much maybe taken more
i will leave with bitterness and joy
i will leave with bitterness and joy
you are the one
you are the one
to put all forms of life to an end
hovering in the air with the rain
'hovering in the air'
ceasing my bleeding heart and now
i'm coming closer to my end with every breath
and she takes away my sight with her shine
music tenkula ranta sentenced lyrics tenkula
so quickly everything swirled descent of the world
frail as we are
from the bleeding prison
is turned to hellliving in emptiness
verse iii
i dont need to care if you want me
i dont need a reason to brake you
and i keep dreamming
and you keep dreaming
hands of the night
now twilight hides the clear and haunts the day away
and hold you in embrace
the haze lies still and bleeding on our sea
here we are now lay the burden down
just waiting for the final release

pagan roots
on this trail i meet my ancestors
people can go only by being themselves
whining i'd committed sins
flames rose high
chorus
not having a reasons no excuse
see you in hell
this is where it ends
no i'm not the kind of man who'd play for keeps'
yet raging it's final blow
raise the power of knowlegde and give me the spirit to kill
reborn to a new reality
reveal the powers of wrath tomorrow i am god
first sunbeams of this day of glory
the love of the man lives here'
on grain and the earth rain and the chilling air
i wake up in the trench
we'll gather our hearts in the kingdom of gods
the night is still breathing
when it's time to fly and when it's time to die
oh no cant you feel the end is on its way
it's all over said and done havent you heard
music lopakka tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
shadowed the shine of our sun
burned alive in the flames of love
yet one precious treasure is lost forever more
well kill your god and your mothafuckin horse
holding a silver sword upon his mighty head swearing revenge to
it says son time is all the luck
from a sea of discontent he says
that i felt
that i felt
she stands at the edge
you dont make me say it
words dont believe
am i
from underneath
distance between
all the stones that are thrown are building up a wall
too black or too white
regardless of the balance
no yeah no no no
hey devil boy
we're gonna blow you're house in
hey devil boy
if you would come back to me if you would come back to me
because he's laid one out on mei think if everybody streamed
you need a string of good intentions
she says there's motivation
need to have a little conversation
you've got to wonder is moving on the best that you can do
translucent delicate
i think your loneliness is code
it's not the clothes that she borrows
because i feel him sometimes
a subtle constant shiver from the bottom to the top
busy talking to himself livingdying just the same
i can be a wall around you under any covering i'll find you
she dont break she dont sink dont think dont think a thing of me
what you told me
headstrong
tell me the new apron strings
bye bye bye bye bye baby good byetell me you in your mother's new shoes
you recognize me because
what's your daddy say
today we're giving it away
you get a brand new chance
i've made the most of love
i could be wrong
you could be strong
i could be wrong
if it was me then it was you
back it up with what you do
she thinks of him
maybe it's the prison
and deals with it herself
like maybe a killing went down in your town
she's got backup
marry me she said i dont reply
daddy said you better or you'll die
away from mobility
to beat the sun from her glory
cuts what she cant untie
what's she trying to do to me
it spins
she didnt want to play the role of the fool again
i know i'm all right because
because the needle cant burn
colossal fact daddy's ex dont let you read
this kansas wheat wont break me
if the oven wont burn
like air leaks from a tire
you cant look straight ahead
you know my will just fades
in the urban shopping mall
and maybe i worry
do things in a hurry
i sit useless
she dont need it
since i cant remember when
tell me what i've seen
you would never believe
things i've done to me
reality steps in
keeps looking over his shoulder
how to live with mistakes
a pretty shame you cant defile
spread out for every queen to see
and i know when i'm old the only runningonna come
as they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
funny how these things come about
'cause i'd seen her a minute before
this aint no fucking game
dont go down to the water's edge she said to me
i know how the good wind blows
i know how the hatred goes so i buried mine
now want to be your lovers
save you from the things that cause us pain
they believe you now
i gotta earn every breath you take
with you i feel safe
it's an animal city
my love
que pase junto a ti
aprendi a querer los gatos
mentiras piadosas
y fue por ti que descrubi
shakira tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about
oh it's not worth our time
beyonce the innocence is gone
when it's me who's ashamed
oh it's not worth our time
shakira tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about
oh it's not worth our time

desesperada a la operadora
yo me siento acabada de nacer
eres tu y contigo
por que este amor ya no entiende
para esta intil
enterrarte en mi memoria
y esconderme para no sentirme
ojerosa flaca fea desgreada
torpe traste testaruda
a mi tu anatomia
bruta ciega sordomuda
y aunque diga ya no mas
nuevamente
torpe tonta lenta necia desquiciada
es todo lo que he sido
pero me vas a vencer asi nomas
ten un poco de compasin por mi
pero ese sentimiento es mas fuerte
before i didnt give a damn 'bout what they say
dont be so hard on this
'cause i'm not here to let you down
dont be so hard
cuentas conmigo
porque no tenemos barreras
cuentas conmigo amor
que cuento contigo
dando vueltas en pars
y qu pasa si son ellos
los han visto en los cocteles todos
la que canta esta cancin
que te hicieron por ah
ya vas a ver como va
ya vas a ver como van sanando
la lgria sec
ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
y hoy vuelvo a ver
ayer te busqu
y quiero pensar
saliste de aqu
ayer te busqu
en las revistas
dando vueltas en paris
y que pasa si son ellos
hasta ofreciendo conciertos
o la que canta esta cancion
ven regresa por mi
donde estas corazon
porque en el planeta
en las revistas
tan largos tan grises
tan faltos de aire
tan faltos de aire
que aun me encuentro con vida
rompes la herida en tu pobre alma
como perdida en el desierto estoy
yo necesito de ti de ti
tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
yo necesito de ti de ti
nada lo consigo si no estas tu junto a mi
tu necesitas de mi de mi
no creo que el mar algun dia
que nadie mas te amara asi
ay yo quiero ser tu firmamento
por eso sigo aqui y camino
si hablo demasiado
voy a pedirte que no vuelvas ms
no se puede dedicar el alma
siento que me duelas todava aqu
a acumular intentos
to get a bit of your attention
next to her cheap silicone i look minimal
place to be
or train like a horse
y lo peor es que aun me quedan tantas ganas de
o que me mandes flores
para obtener un si
solo en las calles transitar
pero digo la verdad
es ms difcil ser rey sin corona
pero digo la verdad
desde ese entonces hay quienes lo han visto
pero digo la verdad
es mas dificil ser rey sin corona
pero digo la verdad
puedo vivir sin ellos yo
fi ainaiha aralhayati
abandonado en el desierto
viaj de bahrein hasta beirut
y no encontr ojos as
puedo vivir sin ellos yo
fi ainaiha aralhayati
abandonado en el desierto
viaje de bahrein hasta beirut
y no encontre ojos asi
delatando al corazon
no se como se puede ser tan bello
por favor ya basta
despedazo mi corazon
y retumba en mis oidos
y te enfrentaste a dinosaurios
piensa que el hierro
y ahora estas aqu
saludar al vecino
que dira la familia
y en la fiesta de quince
permaneciste desnudo
y de suenos blancos
los nombres y las medidas
para vivir en la vida
no hagas ruido en la mesa
y bailar bien el vals
no puedo
mejor le digo adis
que he comenzado a estorbar
a tu boca de anis
you start out playing with yourself
i'd rather eat my soup with a fork
cuz there's a foot for every shoe
pero que me quedes t me quede tu abrazo
que se consuman las palabras en los labios
pero que me quedes t me quede tu abrazo
que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
porque yoooo yoo si si
o que renuncien los filantropos y sabios
y si me quedas tu
ahora que no estas
ahora que no estas
unas cuantas libras menos
ya ves que hasta mis manos
que me gaste yo la vida
que te seques con mi llanto
corochorus
es abrir la puerta de mis aos
mi vida es transparente todava
busco eternas primaveras
sin saber por que
la flor que se abre a plena luz del dia
que renazcan a la vida
esta vida nunca pasa en vano
mi primer amor
huracan de emociones
i used to sing the saddest songs
i'm ready for the goodtimes
i dont wanna look at fashion magazines
swear to me you wont be gone
siempre viste de gris pues no tiene remedio
por la ley del magneto
cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
dana es nina de bien eso dicen sus padres
corochorus
cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
cuando muera tu
se lava bien los dientes
nada ahora puede importar
ya no tienes
siempre barre bien
lejos de esta enorme ciudad
duelen tanto las sonrisas
pensando en ti
me sigue rodeando
hoy estoy
es que no tenerte aqu ya me hace mal
que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
y siguen rodando por ah
pensando en ti
if this was meant to be
and there's something
plus you're the best kisser that i've ever known
they say to me that god's do exist
quand je regarde dans tes yeux
you make me believe
castillos princesas que ironia al fin al cabo fantasias
ya lo se no eres perfecto y es verdad
le ro lo le lo le
quiero vivir contigo
le ro lo le lo le
contigo mi vida
siempre soe con ser sirena hablar con algas y ballenas
yo tenia un mundo de ilusiones en el que te guarde un lugar
siempre soe con ser sirena hablar con algas y ballenas
yo tenia un mundo de ilusiones en el que te guarde un lugar
cuando se entierra en el medio de un no y un si
me voy
a prueba de patadas
satrico
te aviso que estoy de t vacunada
del mundo el dolor
muy muy lejos
si ya es hora de limpiar
pronto estare de ti
a tu boca de anis
si fuera un viernes
dentro de este hueco
de una hora y media
es caminar sin mirar
que ha aumentado su nivel
y por mas que yo lo intente
te necesito te necesito mi amor
yo no se si he vivido
like some kind of amnesty
this is the day and the time
are moving right to left
the heartbeat of the sun is racing mine
ahhh
to plant more trees
in the world full of strangers
chorus 2x
timor timor
it's alright it's alright
isnt it isnt it
if we forget about 'em
it's alright it's alright
if they forget about us
let's keep telling the world it's sunny
then hurry
y siempre tu fuerza que me gua
y a mi lado siempre estzs
buscare donde te encuentres tu
mis zapatos destenidos
el adios que no sabre decir
porque eres tu mi sol
y cuando me miras se encoje mi cuerpo y me hago chiquita
ayudame a hacer ilusion en mi mente
que me paso
no importaba
ultimo momento
no me inquieta porque esta cancin es solo una alarma
y eso paso
de vez en cuando lejos
corochorus
que se hace lava que hace
the jumpit out and jumpit in
is where i find them
i'm running out of reasons to cry
i love you more than all that's on the planet
there's an endless story
toda en ruinas como el partenon
pleno imperio romano
corochorus
corochorus
we could both make fun of distance
whenever wherever
lucky that my breasts are small and humble
we're meant to be together
le do le le le le
there's nothing left to fear
that i'll never wear
i'm only half a body
that i'll never wear
i'm only half a body
once upon a time you and i
wishing that time hadnt passed
when we could spend our evening
wishing that time hadnt passed
have i lived too much too fast
when we really cared
pero el prncipe azul
cuando miro en tus pupilas se que dios no dejo de existir
entre lo mundano y lo sagrado
muy original
que eres mi prisin
que es lo que te hace ser
que busca intimidarme
ser tan especial
y tu buena suerte
solo porque tengo una mente traviesa
es mi forma de jugar el escondite ingls
y me enredo con las horas ya no se si llegaras
el estar contigo me hace libre
este es el ritmo el que me hace vibrar
esta noche voy contigo a bailar
que recien ya te conozco
desato el corazon
si me dices te amo me siento muy bien
trapecista sin red
y ahora estoy aqui
estoy aqui quierendote
las cartas que escribi
sabes que sigo esperandote
que por ti esta latiendo
quisiera verte en cada atardecer
yo quiero saber
ya he
came from bahrein got to beruit
in rags and begging for pleasure
my one desire all i aspire
tearing down windows and doors
tell me lies
well let me say
you start changig
i'm embarrassed but

fool
of your shoes

so tell me now tell me now
always supportive always patient
you dont even know the meaning of the words i'm sorry
open heart
aunque te de lo mismo
y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
empezar por uno mismo
y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
y el deseo gira en espiral
y mas abajo estara yo
no me faltes nunca
no pido que todos los dias sean de sol
no solo de pan vive el hombre
y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
y hoy se que es tuyo corazon
yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
fue una tortura prederte
una victima casi perfecta
despacio despacio comienzas a caer
un volcan hoy
luego a bailar bajo la luna
por estar tan lejos
hoy me veo tan perdida
lejos de tu amor y sin salida vuelve
la resignacin es un deseo sin piel y
una mquina
lo fatal lo imprescindible
y aunque me haga la invencible
she's been to private school

there's all kinds of people in this world
some will die for you some would lie to you
one look behind and it's never the same
some will die for you some would lie to you
soft the drowsy hours
while the weary world
though i roam
near the presence
from off thee shaken
when you knew that i was always on your side
no it isnt how it's really meant to be
no is it how it's really meant to be
i spill milk on your table
i say all the right things
i am fashionably crude
i am frying my mind
when the money starts to running out
will seem one hundred light years away
and it's hard at the end of the day
and the endlessness that you fear
it dont make no difference
you're in the arms of the angel
you dont bring me anything but down
everything is crashing to the ground
you dont bring me anything but down

through the pouring rain
from the old familiar faces and
i'd be someone you could still care about
and i'm a bad bad girl
that you're stubborn
for letting you down
without you around
there's beauty in release

i feel happy
maybe i will get up and feel good today
cause it wouldnt matter where you're going
and every thing i thought worth learning
along the way it can get too complicated to say
blowin round the wind
that i only come home
open the door
that not everything is gonna be the way
uh huh
show you that i love you
ooh ooh baby
i leave tear stains on the ground
but now since i see you
all i need
let me live again
back in your heart

i will walk with you
being just a brick in an ivory tower
set each other both on fire
but they cant take this babe
yeah burn this bed
he just cant seem to say
and it makes me kinda sad oh
the president spoke words of comfort
and drank til i was thirsty again

every little thing that i felt that day
and you let me fall in love
that summer day that i recall
i knew we could make it
my baby i just want to be with you
you got cheap shoes a malibu and big public fights
i'll be satin and speed
my little superstar oh honey you know you are
i'd probably break down and cry
and the rain
she has a cheap apartment
sweet rosalyn
has been wearing a little thin
why dont you tell me babe what is going on
they're tearing us apart
i read your book
where do we go
to write down everything that went on
everybody knows a turkey and some
and so i'm offering this
and through the old screen door
tell it to me slow
but never noticed what was mine
then i'd no longer be in your mind
but babe i've changed
but when it comes to bein lucky he's cursed
the first cut is the deepest
baby i know
some people call me the space cowboy
i play my music in the sun
i'm a joker i'm a smoker
and now love is just a stranger in her bed

if you just be nice
when love is over

here's one more glance before i turn away
these must be days we've seen through tear filled eyes

does it feel like some never ending test
sometimes it's hard to stay the same
no matter what you do i love you anyway
even in the worst of times i give my best to you
stay together too long
but the fact is
it's never ending
i cant cry anymore
my karma was living inside a failure
we were apes before we spoke of sin
you lay down with angels
break my heart again
why dont i know
too bad the rest of me
i waved goodbye to all my friends
if i'm in the mood to crash and burn
and let a mack truck leave her there for dead
crash and burn
in the crystalline knowledge of you
you remain ageless
to the sea
now what do i do
but i've made it my course to avoid you
now what do i do
i cant stop looking back for the answers
diamond ring

diamond ring
crashing on a brand new day
it's gonna take a little time
pull yourself out of the tide

for having learned how not to cryy
i can hear the people crying
'cause i dont understand

my suicidal dream
suicidal suicidal suicidal dream
try to be different
you're the analyst
they're turning their head whilst they wait
if you dont regret them
now that you know why you feel like you do
the greatest view from here
to be reborn not born again

and doing that fun retro look
i stay awake for days

floating on the ground
i feel so low i feel so high
i've made up my mind
head to toe so low
but sanity dont come cheap
you're tied to alcohol
need help to
i saw a crack in the plan but i got lazy ways
when we're alone and out drivin ourselves around all the bends
i got a cold change of heart
mind reader baby come on
and i miss you love
like the one that just past
part of the teenage angst brigade and
remember two days
of the night straight from the vines refusal to shine
leave me alone i want to live
do you
his father beats him
cried for help before and
love me for my mind coz i'm a dangerous heart
could've had to lock the door
makes me drown
when no one else will
over me and i've got
i'm watching you watch
i'm watching you watch
or do you need a little more
waving my luck under your nose
it's not enough to say that this is my love
the way i'm thinking in different shades of grey
there's nothing left to say it's changing every day
this swan plagued pond
no more goodbyes
i know you hate me but i'll ask anyway
you think you can keep on going living like a king
you see it's good for nothing good for nothing
broken strings and stolen youth
go
hey hey hey hey
dont lose your heart you'll need it
we're closer now than we ever should we be
and
whether to stay together
i'll be straight
and all i can think of are ways to die alone
dreams are bad when all they do is leave the truth behind
faded signs for you
faded signs for you
i'll be waiting all day
without the truth falling out
false light and ashes
wont save you
like a thing that's big big
does it make you cry
when i make you feel so far away
the interviews over
we'll find a way
with a mean left
cultures cringing at accents
welcome to the closing
sleep till late to waste half the day
joining every bridge in the wind
some time
unhappy the land that has no heroes
and nothing to present
great times
no unhappy the land that needs heroes
promised lands
i believed in all you'd say
still the clouds roll by africa
what you gonna do when the love burns down
oh you lead me on till the feelings come
who is gonna come and turn the tide

little darling close your eyes there'll be no compromising
if freedom comes and goes you know i'll still be waiting
i'd be with you i'd stay with you tonight
little darling close your eyes there'll be no compromising
you've got to get it right
still the band played on
and the questions there were many
and the king of light
at the end of every party
hold me now spectre of love
but i'll be alright
i'm home all alone again
still banging on the door again
some day soon they're gonna pull the old town down
when the belfast child sings again
that's flesh and blood man that's flesh and blood
so where did you go
communication lost in the thundering rain style
we were on the top and the world was spinning
if only you could see me
in police room 619
oh biko biko because biko
the man is dead the man is dead
never turn away
i open up to take a look into the bright and shiny book
i open up to take a look into the bright and shiny book
all around the world

shelter in their suitcase
the suit he wears
we can live
run run run
to a distant land

street parade
well changeling for you
expose
lost
club
you had gone and changed your name
the chelsea girl
when morning comes
you got me caught up in a whirl
you're cutting up our friends
but radio's a god
i hate the sound of bells
we got to wear a badge
our food is getting cold
drum
they're shining out so bright
there is no cure
come on
you're so blind cant you see
there is no cure
colours fly and catherine wheels
when the pulses rise
catch a boy fell falling
catch a boy fell falling
swing low could be the last call for two of us
come a long long
then this thing just dont have no heartbeat
come a long long
come a long long way
i feel so insecure
so dont come too close
it's all so mutual but you know
lyrics j kerr music burchillkerr c emi publishing ltd reproduced without permission
like the pillars of destiny
i'm just keeping my soul alive
i go running in a circle
you can come inside
through the needle's eye
and you're down below me
come into the naked eye
up on the wall
cherries
and the world goes hot
sun is set in front of me worldwide on the widest screen
and when we dream dream in the dream with me
when i hear the lone night music
woh oh night music
it's a warning signal there's a bridge to cross
way beyond control
all my nightmares crumble
you
so keep your evil from me
i know it feels so bad
there is no cure
somebody's knocking out
the young man the brothers the killers explain
oh jungleland
oh jungleland
when my love sings it's an angel song she sings it
and hope long live hope could spin the whole world 'round
that's time
you life me up when i know you're around
meanwhile susan goes out all alone
tell me what you see
shine on the underground
nothing moving happening
raining
artifact
protection protection
there's a hole in my head
premonition
love sails to a new life
everything is possible
promised you a miracle
chance lost pearls of great price
he controls on love
counterfeit ticket in to jfk in the land of his dreams
outside the sister cried she said the whole world's so mean
every little thing that i possess
quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
the stars the sun the energy
real to real cacophony
do you receive me
carry on little saviour to the end of the line
i get high for ever
silent man
wear the mask
from this room
lyrics j kerr music simple minds c emi publishing ltd reproduced without permission
i gotta wake you from this daze
ooh another sad affair
ooh another sad affair
can you feel the ground move 'round your feet
sanctify yourself set yourself free
be apart of me sanctify
control yourself open up your heart
sun in my eyes
fate at the wheel
i can feel the thunder storms inside
if you can see the lights shout out where you'll be
written by kerrburchill reproduced without permission
that stand alone and crying young
in colourful breathless emotional sea
and stick your finger in
this thing's got the whole world beat
you got dreams that linger running through your brain
screams everything
this is the eye that's crying first
love brings the fall
follows in love
in seventy cities
i just found my new direction
she gives me travelling shoes
got a myriad of poses
meet me on the staircase
you fill me full of danger
with me in the rain walking in the soft rain
someone somewhere in summertime
someone somewhere in summertime
she says
you're running home before the morning light
she says
and we all want to know where the weather goes
and all that heavenly light
all that time in the basement
the more i see the more i learn
cruising land to land
thank you for the voice
falling here from grace
listen to the rhythm
something's going on
it's just the people crying out
some sweet day
what goes on through the night
and i can hear you crying out
i come walking to you
i'm gonna walk away
some sweet day
run till we come until we be
just my imagination just my imagination
speed your love to me
higher and higher higher and higher
i'm your long lost brother little sister what's your name
the city looks pretty tonight
stand by love stand by me
lonely love
this world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction
i can turn my back upon this wilderness
i'm gonna add some bottom so that the dancers will twist all night
the poor come crawling out
can you hear me
the hand thate reaches out
i think you'd rather be alone
i'll be alone dancing you know it baby
will you stand above me
dont you try and pretend
dont you forget about me
i say
all across the land it's east at easter
they're gonna lighten up the sky
when they lighten up the sky it will be east at easter
i'm gonna set myself up
factory
to the glittering prize
he had a plan to escape
a certain raion we know
factory
'cause in the alleyways and bars downtown
you talk about south africa
come say what you see in me
the car pulled up the girl she jumped in
shadows in your room
when all is said and done
yeah the ghost rider
e s p
oh no you cant
remember halcyon days
one step two step three step four
glitterball radiate round the hall
one final day
in the light of reflection
i saw up on a clear day
shine on shine the light on me
we were spending time we were staring out
with your love
there's a poverty of expectation
but a phantom with his heartbeat deep inside
i've been waiting all my lifetime for this moment
all i got to do was move ahead
you'll see me as i'm cocooned up in badlands
see me as i'm cocooned up in badlands
passion parade
i can feel the whole world spinning around
reminds me of some bright and sunshine day
i've been hypnotised
final hour judgement day
evacuees and refugees
marching on and marching on
i travel
but things still look the same
we love you still from here
i hear footsteps seems like i've been through this before
ooh are we near you
there's something about this sweet refrain
it reminds me of all that you bring
long time saviour
there's something about this sweet refrain
for just one moment in time
for just one moment in time
just what is going on
no calm to my hand
dream a dream a
trans american
stays up all night and puts a curse on me
kick it in kick it in
and that's the way it's gonna be
you keep me wondering wondering wondering
tell me about this love you've been
and take off with me
i'm moving on i'm moving on
ever think that how you feel
they say the rain in europe
there'd be no dictators anywhere
they're dressing andy warhol up
killing andy warhol
killing andy warhol
the life and times the art and talk
love lies under western eyes powerful yet transient
relief
sweet tears roll like a river from your eyes
make me want to live you make me want to die
lost broken and scarred
one more kick and the door cracks open
power to the powerless strength unto the weak
let the children let the children speak
let the children let the children
secrets of lovers
let there be love
so let it be love
and i'm praying
let there be love
life in a day
they'll soon be looking for you
life in a day
i want to go where you are
i want to touch let me play
lightning speed
i want to know how certain this is

building mansions on the hillside next to you
ah well it's not the sound of ghosts i hear
build me a great wall of love
they've got silver and diamonds
and may your sweet lips sing to me
i can hear them reaching out
hold the moment close to me
so will the force let go
war babies
think of the minds we sold
we'd better speak now
kill now
i'm goin to move on up to the waterfront

for a photograph feigned happiness
his face worn and harrowed
what else could i write

all in all is all we all are
all babies are born out of great pain
god gives them the stars to use as ladders

young mother down at smithfield
and i love my boy and that's why i'm leaving
in this weekday room
now a man is born to go a lovin
black coffee
and i knew i wanted to be a big star
make you feel good make you feel all right
got my hair shaved off and my black thigh boots
i got the most angelic son
i wanna go dancing darling
long time i've been dreaming of you
on this journey may the good lord guide us
it wont be easy
at sixes and sevens with you
but nothing impressed me at all
i never invited them in
i can think of to say to you
you can never feel
you got a nice big car
and you dig your own grave yeah
it wont happen to us
anybody wanna drink before the war
give birth to you
i didnt mean to
everytime i see you
i see another side side side side
you got to know you reap what you sown
vampire you suck the life of goodness
you see what goes up must come down
you've got to know yourself
why is it that you must know
specifically i want to talk about the famine
and so we lost our history
becomes actual killing
it's not permanent but they didnt know that
excuse me
but we've lost contact with our history
our history books the parent figures lied to us
where do they all come from
i was not thinking anymore
help me to help you to behold you
and i have always loved you
i feel so different
fire
fire on
oh yes a change has come
fire haha
spring is like
in other words please be true
i love you
never awaken you
my heart and i have
soul i'll be blessing you
how much i wanted you
he went away from me
he came in so sweetly
in dublins fair city where the girls are so pretty
a live a live o a live a live o
my darling child
my darling child
me little wolf
my pride and joy
to dine on my fine
tho' i know you perfectly swell
to dine on my fine
tho' i know you perfectly swell
nor life i owe nor liberty
young woman with a drink in her hand
it's the only thing
i dont wanna be no mans woman
and i'm not scared of it
and i forgive him a million times
no mans woman
but nothing
i went to the doctor nguess what he told me
i know that living with u baby was sometimes hard
feels like only yesterday
one truth two hearts you took my life and made it beautiful
well i sold me ass and cow my little pigs and sow
when we got to yankee land they put guns into our hands
here's you boys now take my advice
there is nothing here but war where the murderin cannons roar
i am so deep in love that i cant deny it
and the pretty little birds do change their voices
the love you kept inside will come
tout c'est okay
kissing your plight
i'm not no red football
when a window which people would look through
my body's not a football for you
it was our ruin that you were in bondage
ta grainne mhaol ag teacht thar saile
may it please the god of miracles that we may see
and for me some scarlet ribbons
lovely ribbons scarlet ribbons
can we understand just how he feels
scorn not his simplicity
the day the doctor told her it's a boy
he wont ask for your pity or your sympathy
all too soon
in love with you
from the highest hill
no secret anymore
since fame and fortune
like you used to do
success has made a failure of our home
alone thy will be done
lead me into rest again
fall tonight into my arms again
fall the night into the light of day
do you want to be
everyone's burned
i must have seemed
and i'm alone with
what was i to say
over
i am in your dreams
i am stretched on your grave
from night until morning
thanks be to jesus
and with you in your cold grave
i'm walking through the desert
no longer will i be hungry
so i'm walking through the desert
i wanna be loved by you
to anything higher
i want your hands on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
put your hands on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
put'em on put'em on put'em on me
hands gimme love
when i start remembering
u got into your car and drove as far
darling i'd treat u right
chorus
rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
let them all come as they will
for only to adore you
my love
my love
searching the shores for my jackie oh
laughing at you
and i'll walk the seas forever more
you dont know how hard it was to be alone without you
you dont know how hard it is to be a woman in love with you
but i dont deserve to be lonely
it got torn down
it's my turn
it sure takes time
you'd make it better
will you wait for me
when you could have died
pick up those dancing shoes
and if you look now then you'll see why
the phone calls
sick one or clean one
but not in my head
like the times we did it so hard
i've seen you the first time in trogny's bar
oh just call me joe
you've seen my face but you've never heard my name
leslie winer lyrics
multiple electrical systems you fly through
such as human rights violations
and people dancing in rings
not enough minds open
will you be my mama
nothing would
just like u said it would b
christ have mercy
where all poor sailors do sometimes go
for my lord franklin i'd sail the main
i memorize every line
that you sign
and lot of loved
soul surrendering your soul
it seems like years since you held the baby
to offer advice and say how i should be
but i wont go anywhere nice for a while
and i said so
you asked for the truth and i told you
i get the answers if i listen
if you dont know me
you're my daughter
maimed us at the start
words cant express how sorry i am
who can show me how i can
out of history we have come
i'll talk but you wont listen to me
and since then you have taken me for granted
i know your answer already
last night i went to see my love
or perhaps he is gone with some other lover
near there i spent my youthful days
rosy cheeks and ruby lips i own she has my heart in thrall then
but there's none of them can sing so sweet
i'm circling around the sun
oooooh it's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin
i'm not ready yet
and i ask you are you sorry yet
the state i'm in
how come you've never said you love me
oh let glorious love be done
through when your dreams are only blue
i will take from you when i come
to comfort you and get you through
and of course
the smell of you
have brought you closer to me
will always be with me
you'll feel much better when u open
but u put your head on my shoulder
u put your head on my shoulder
if you've never seen a good time
i'd a terrible broken heart
keeping warm
you will rise
i swear i didnt mean
do you want me
but i will rise
you should've left the light on
you wouldnt have begged me to hold you
you're still a liar
take back the pain you gave me
and only loyal love will be me happiness
take back the pain you gave me
and then where do you run
like some other men do
get me some money too
and see what you can find
so you're a fool to attack me
as you did when you were alive
no harder in this world
to the thief of your heart
though your lips never part
as i went out walking one morning in june
to the green woods i will wander to shun all mens view
but when he was dying i heard his last cry
see how the black moon fades
dragging it back to the start
i cant see the flame
soon i can give you my heart
thank you for loving me
and for not leaving me
you are gentle with me
thank you for saying baby
bolan snake510
remember yesterday
remember yesterday
washed away a dream of you
walking hand in hand
he walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
he married trouble and had a courtship with a gun
pour me a chemical to take away the edge
look at the suit in suspended animation
beat yourself blind
the killing joke had 'em laughin all the way
venus dee in the critical file
stiletto heels and a candy cane
big guns
big guns
play solitaire with my hands in the air
bang bang shooting like a firing squad
bolan snake
the savior has arrived
i wont leave if you stay i dont buy what you say
if you just let me in
that there would be things in life that couldnt be
cant stand the heartache
cant stand the heartache
cant stand the heartache
cant stand the heartache
i caught it right between the thighs
oh no i caught my woman on the creepshow
her six foot deep temptation
but psychos dykes and transvestites
baby baby dont you hesitate
the lights are out and i can feel you baby
no hesitatin bodies aching
pulse rave air waves
if you're lookinfor it mellow
givinmore than you're ever gonna take
within her sight
its really a street light
lay your body by the water
past wreckage on the way
faith sees the way
walk all over what i believe
all my thoughts go up in flames
as i stare into the weather
all the colors treat me kind
no no no what can i do
on 2nd avenue
close your eyes and i'll be superman
beyond the reach of god's faith
please let there be light
tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
should they both let go then let me lay
should this scar then it was meant to be
oh when i'm sad
seems that there's a little trouble down in mexico
feels like i'm livin on a chain gang
feels like i'm livin on a chain gang
i'm riding on a breakdown a suicidal shakedown
eat your heart out i'll send it cod
he shook his head and said all i need is that fiddle of mine
billy keeps a rockin like this

runnin from the girl in pigskin
cookin up a new addiction

do we live in fear or faith
when we get where we dont know
i gotta laugh when i hear them say
she's on the corner talkin trash with the punks

captain fantastic the nineteen seventiesdive head on into me
kick a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride
you say it's raining but you're pissin down my back
so stop readin me the riot acti never wanted to be president
stop readin me the riot act
the noose gets tighter around my throat
but my day in the sun aint even close
they tore my intentions apart brick by brick
jesus knows my story he kows the position that im in
taking liberties burned by your dictation
smiling like an alligator
the back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze
she'll love ya black and blue sweet little sister
she's my sweet little sweet little sister
wont beg wont bleed
it's gonna take more than a break in the law

well you think that you're right
why'd you have to make us so uptight
my nasty reputation takes me everywhere

we spend our lives on trial

he'll satisfy your every need
answer his every command

transforming of five toes to two
endlessly searching for salvation
you run
to benefit the aryan race
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
crowded tombs
his face of death staring down
angel of death
taste the sins of hell
death plagues the streets in which they dwell
raise the stake in malice
admonish of the cruciform
emerging from their hellish tomb
not enough to satisfy
the crooked cross
time melts away in this living inferno

not the last third war
peace breaks out then
that can be reached for peace
global tension starts aggression
stricken by the force of evil light

come and take on what you fear
victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
bringer of torture
god you really think you have balls
god how i wish that you were dead
i know my angel will make it
an unconscious universe alone
hey somebody hey somebody
by iggy the stooges
now i'm ready to close my eyes
i want you dear
heat me with your love oh your lips were meant
promise me you wont ever leave or i would die
you opened up my heart i just cant live
invite you
for my lies lies
ingest you
through these eyes no love is alive
total pollution the earth cant stand much longer
broken down by toxic trace
condemn the human race
social injustice will be no more without exception devastate all
lyrics king music hanneman king
you think you'll see the pearly gates
lead king
lurking in the dismal fog
just kill and kill again
hatred growing stronger
unrelenting need to kill
instinct spares no one
to the depth of human nature
on the edge of a
decisions to lose control
buffy
a gift
dont give me songs
i should be dancing for
depends
i live in hell
you'll get along
severe anguish as my body evolves
forms of hanging flesh shredded carcass
an echo bouncing inside my brain
that burns in your head
lead king
a personal hell is where i reside
losing all grasp an evil so old
force fed lies in this chapel of lust
realistic screams
but you wont kill me
count the bullet holes in your head
lead hanneman
a vile smell like tasting death
trident missiles in the air
pray for shelter
if you could see in the future
weakening reasoning
hollow carcass of a man is all i leave
will you see when the rest are blind
see the blood drop in your eye
the oceans have been ripped away
there's blood on your pollow
to thrash the tomb she lies
i feel the urge the growing need
he rules forbidden evil
lucifer takes my dark soul
severing flesh
tearing limb from limb
holy man open up your eyes
i wont be force fed prophecies
welcome to the horror of the revelation
witness the shame
silence the fear
yeah new faith yeah new faith
then masturbate
a wicked plan born of contempt
find death alone
skull and bones through the mind
reaping terror through words while
from everywhere
when you draw first blood you cant stop this fight
your life must suck when nothing's going your way
beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
before i get the chance to kill you myself
watch me fucking regress
cause i'm the one insane
visualize
seep from my eyes
your senses under siege
perversions of pain
alone they all will die
a vast sadistic feast
death is all i see
one more life that soon wont be
dismembered destiny
lead king
point is where all die
right the fuck where i belong
minister of death unreleased
your final pulse has just been spent
basking in your dying breath
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
fatality reality you await the final call
non rising body from the grave showing new reality
minor threat can not decline
begin to crank feel the rush
burning destroying and killing
cardiac cease to exist
return to power draws near
creating my structure
they cry their last wish of need
save me
that by giving you can save your soul
you should read between the lies
convicted witch my life will end
my deals will made eternally
proclaim my death to end my wrath
defy your morbid declaration
am i superstition
casey royerfred traccone suberbia production admin by bug music
he thought he find a better way
it happened just the other day
burning acid bath
oh how the years seem to fly by
and tearing attacking and manning
minutes seem like days
the end that came so fast
burning winds release they fury
shades of death are all i see
skeletons of society
throwned inside a death mask
faceless prey has been erased
hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts your neck
a demonstration
ripping flesh spitting teeth
all pain and fury
outlines the dead
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
a decorated splatter brightens the room
as you go insane go insane
blood washes my hand cant understand
staring blindly at some place
they dont stop they wont go away
but i live for the things that keep me hollow
launching me face first
staring back i look less familiar
the smile
an object of animation
bleeding
raping again and again
lyrics king music king
stalking the night cant you feel i'm near
evil stalks the night with us
thy soul begins to bleed
by gbh
people in white coats
there's assholes everywhere
a soul that will never rest
bearer of no name
sanctify lives of scorn
nightmare the persecution
judgment day the second coming arrives
bastard sons bagat your cunting daughters
the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
lyrics hanneman music hanneman
now smell the stench of immortality
hannemanking
coils of the serpent unwind
beyond the gates i'll take you
who found that hell awaits
involve yourself within my dream
it's time to be born again
into the vacuum culture
it may burn but i wont be dead
time to regenerate
wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell
it is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
it's not too late 2x
killing whore
hunting
symbol of oppression
the end justifies the means
protectorate of the dead
retribution selective terror
praise the land where sins are sold
wash the virtue from your eyes
deep inside of me
wash the virtue from your eyes
in fire i baptized
but you just cant hide
i wish i could say
'cause you know i'm here
but now that time has passed
provocative images delicate features so smooth
of placid faces and lifeless pageants
of placid faces and lifeless pageants
i'll shoot the violence
god makes no sense
you're facing your grave
rotting my lust away
visions of erotic bliss
a fever i can not resist
i embrace the darkness within
seek salvation from an mia god
soaked in blood the mask you wear
your veins have dried
the helpless minds of you all
smiles as some do his bidding
on the cryptic life that died
compelled to live your sheltered lives
strive for peace with acts of war
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
i hate everyone equally
by verbal abuse
and when i see you standing there
i want free money 4x
grand canyons of space and time universal
stab bawl punch crawl
the scales of justice begin to tip
here in 1994
with a passive government
social slaves caught in my rage
in a web like hell
what is being done to me
shattered shrine of flesh and bone
threshhold of pain unfolds
in my mind is only pain
and it's giving me the strength to carry on
wallow pearls before swine
the world that you despise
breeding fast in poverty
pulmonary overthrow
incapacitate fall into your fate
then we return from the dead
evil
chorus
just so i'll be rid of you
your opinion is always senseless fuck this
out
i cant tolerate the sight of you the thought of you or
slayer 1990 seasons in the abyss
rivalry and retribution
having control and sings or principle obsession
a misty night a perfect night
you've cowered down you've broken the chain
i'll trap you in the pentagram
a drone in the world of anarchy
cant see your side conflicts with mine
everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse
metal and men clash once more to the end
death will arrive
gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
something inside your head made a violent change
you're full of shit
you never knew
i dont want to hear it
i dont want to hear it
first you're telling stories
i am no one
your death is my salvation
numbling of your moral sense
walking slow breathing heavy
fallen mercenary dormancy is done
memories cant ignore
all life i drain
pray for sin a shattered faith
this is what lives inside me
down on your knees
this is what lives inside me
death's design blood splattered wall
i've been making shows of trading blows
she aint got that swing
sleepwalk through my life's endeavour
ian mackayejeff nelsonlyne preslarbrian baker
repeat intro
swerving through the street
run her down
run her down
imagine the innards of your soul
losting your control of physical
randomly kills its victims
screaming revolution
mmm mmm
more than i can say
so let me rest in peace
but i follow you like a man possessed
i can lay my body down
and you aint no friend of mine
cryin all the time
well that was just a lie
you aint no friend of mine
sell your soul for all it buys
from now things are done my way
have you ever wondered why
cant see living this lie no
watching disciples
torment
lyrics hanneman music hanneman king
it's what i was meant to be
the birth of satans son
all love is lost
he makes his move to conquer the land
blitzkrieg tactics of the german command
born with the power of god in his hand
lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time
every fucking endless day
with shit i cant identify you know it makes me
no one stands a chance when i'm lashing out
losing all perspective
i see the fright in your eyes
in the coldness all alone
tormentor
by verbal abuse
i get into trouble
they'll come around again and again
you wont feel a thing
smash their head
kill you before you kill each other
so many years ago
but i dont recognize all these things
alone alone alone alone
a type that wont subside
hannemanaraya
encircle the front lines
when victory's a massacre
soldiers of attriction
propaganda war ensemble
the sport is war total war
this aint about me
madness is coming your way
you dont concern me
warzone this is where it's going down
apocalypse
all what cant we face
where do we go from here

charles singletonrose marie mccoy

well if i had to do it over
it was he who brought me through
the castle kingdom all were lost
a new woman
there's nothing left
dont you wanna feel it inside
you'll see that it feels so nice
a real man
she swallowed the spider to catch to catch that fly
she wants to be to be anonymous
eat all the numbers up we're 00 gone
for so many dreams cannot be contained
i know what is going on here
i always make you so stronger
be yr mama
is it safe now is it safe to breathe
breakin outta this place throwin open the door
always thought that hell was the only place
if i buy her candy
like water like spring
steal a kid break a heart steal the show
in a formula or break me
call the doctor
call the doctor
well you know there aint no doubt
try not to let the words come out
dig me in
ya got me for now
dig me out
dig me out
dont act like
there's a part of me
i know what you are
angels in the skies
mess around up there
let it all go at once
they're calling on me
they're calling on me
and when you were near no sky was ever quite so clear
god is a number
couldnt say it couldnt make it go away
it's an old mistake but we always make it why do we
getting better worse i can not tell
it's always somewheresomeone new each day
because you want every you want it
hit and run
it's cherry cherry red and it beats on time
i am filled with all those sick things
well they say a body remembers it

how am i to know what you want me to feel
i knew all along you werent everything
you dont need to tell me
but thats the way it goes
how to be still
you say go deeper
i wont suck your big ego
write in passing when there's time
your suit and tie your shiny smile
you take what i want
i wanna be your joey ramone
push to the front so i can see
throw away those old records we go downtown
yeah yeah yeah yeah
honeybabysweetnessdarlingi'myourlittlegirl
to be a woman
hear this song
let's go hit the floor
you're other half
to everything
are you hungry did you eat before the show
you know me well oh dont you
damaged goods
i'm your little i'm your little i'm your little mouth
oh you wanna try her
i know i shouldnt ask why i wake up feeling dead
we can just pretend today isnt goodbye
let's go back to what what we came here for
without a path that i should take
but some things are passed down anyway
it's just my stuff it's just my
oh tell me baby what's wrong
it's not what you want it's everything got my foot on the floor
the dress you wore
for you things were
and you know why
because the doors were locked for you
when you get lost becoming a man
it wasnt so nice
i'm feeling so down
'cause it doesnt work that way
i want money
i know what you want from me
if you want everything's changing
here we are
i cant find you
and i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream
stay where you are
set it on fire
stuffed in the corner little girl lost
to make sure i'm still here

a cheap little house
i'm throwing it out
i cant be alone tonight
could be i'm not gonna find you
nothing the same after tonight
nothing is gonna make it right
and i saw you sit there smiling
when i look and i cant find you
for you to want me here to stay
tongue is tired
now there's no time left
on the brain
i'd rather fly dont want to get caught in this endless race
never let them see your heart is pounding full of hope
there's no bigger spotlight than show
you said this would be
this song your song
what you think what you do
can you hear me telling on you
our love is the size of these tumors inside us
in a hospital room
you got your words
it could fill the sky
i'll sotp the clock
cant stand the thought
do i sound crazy
i got it words guitar
i play it words guitar
oh let me have that sound tonight
i've got a message for you
we'll get to heaven on time
could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you
could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you
so
that she'll come around turn up frowned outside down
she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
chorus
the waters getting warm so you might as well swim
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
i know she wants green tea ice cream
cool boys playing pool stop and stare at the way she moves
your asteroids bounce off her like a trampoline
but the joke is getting tired and old and dangerous
come on baby and speed your lust to me
you spend your nights at home crying
fat ones whacked ones give me some
momma tole me boy you best behave
you merry gentle men always bet on red
so he took me for a ride in 'is big ol sleigh
remember tonight
but i'll have a blue blue christmas
we cant see what you say
you can come down to me 2x
so why should it be that
make no mistake
it feels so nice i want your arms to wrap around me twice
i cant get enough of you baby
cant get enough of you baby
just trying to relax i find myself on the couch with big plans but there's always tomorrow
i took a trip to the bar does my money go far can you show me just how to spend it
dont wanna be down
dear inez
you gotta believe
dont do nothing
you dont want none
and you've got it good as bad as it gets
and while the other try to take your spot
you jive you shuck you jab you stick
still i cant put out the flame
i'm so diggin your scene
can anybody tell me why we're springer bound
today you sat up half asleep and stared
every day i see you sinking low
disconnect the dots and be on your way
its time to go to town
and it works the street tonight
well i'm just another creep
days they go too slow i'm blinded
for the man who stole your water
you go back jack do it again
now you swear and kick and beg us
i cant help it i will always love you
any time was right for secret meetings
it used to be no words could come between us
who said anything about a good life
who said anything about a charmed life
should have would have could have never crossed her mind
we need a new planet
it's like a total eclipse of the sun
we added too much baggage when our ship came in
the ticker tape wants us to fail
out of sight
pacific coast party
get your ticket pack your bags
word i never heard a word i turn the other way
chorus
you'll receive a kiss on each cheek
i dont see it as a gang but a club
the underworld is like an undertow if you dont respect it
there's blood on the streets it's up to my knee
she came
blood in the streets in the town of new haven
blood on the rise it's following me
your honey sweet darling baby everything
i used to rock your world now i'm standing on a fault line
failing fast lying ass worthless punk
it's gone
x
but i dont let it show
i spin my wheels and try to figure it out
there's nothing left for me to do
well sooner than later
well we aint bending over anymore
program and progress
who would have ever thought
we'd spoil the sport and be on top
it's a cattle call
when i was blind i fell behind
and every little satellite
i woke up on the right side i woke up on the right side
on the right side of the wrong bed
breaking land speed records in the van
meanwhile the band is waiting for the road man
to the vibe i'm generating or maybe not 'yet
that's how i know that's how i know
with my two left feet
the girls are so pretty in their shopping mall fashions
there's too many fools and too many rules
waiting in the wings just doing her thing
now that's she's gone
may got play in a lei at the luau
goodnight irene jean and lucinda
now that she's gone she turns me on on on on on
so everyone cares 'cause the hat that he wears is on the wrong way
waitin for nothin to change
chorus
use your super powers and rescue me
use your super powers and rescue me
are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
sister psychic wont you tell me does it ever get better
there is a race to be run and a song to be sung
get up get out get on that train
loud and clear
you better make room we're comin through
we got the plan to make it go down
i'm so pissed off at myself
i dont like what i see i change but it's a work
i cant deal with all your hate 2x
which way that i should go i should go
i've got to hand it to you man
i bet you dont do it at all
cookie cutter man you all you look a like
there you go
so leave me alone
could you say the same
repeat chorus
why oh why
that you would have the decency to
it aint right i cant even look at you
so flo if you had half a heart
that you would have the common courtesy
she's been a wreck since you've been away
today's escape will consist of a mask
there's the riff here's the hook
bet you never felt quite like that
the escapade still exists of the task
say hello to my force field
turn up the sound
boyfriend tell her she's beautiful
go on baby girl you know what i like
aint nothing like it
go on baby girl you know what i want
'cause i'm gettin nuttin for christmas
bought some gum with a penny slug
somebody snitched on me
steve and rosie talking again
you standing in a queue
hanging 'round for a girl like you
waiting for a girl
waiting for a girl
but while you're around you might as well
they just wanna know that everything will be ok
so she got bent and raised the rent
maybe some day when i'm old and fat and bored
i think were gonna get the old heave ho
said it would only take one more
i've got a whiny neighbor x2
the lawn is dead
i've got a whiny neighbor x2
there's a money tree
dont miss this show you will be amazed
in babylon
where you from
but before you get too far out baby
but before you get to far out baby
let me hold you high
every day is a getaway when all of it goes unsaid
i got a holiday a paid holiday
i'm just lookin for paradise in my living room
and oh what an odor is rising
through the peep hole as they all go away
when the boat rocks and the crew gets old
and neutral means nothing to me
and i'm flirting with disaster i'm the master of g's
until 3 in the morning
your dad's coming after me
but i know one thing is true
saying i hate you i'm gonna kill you
i just wanna see
and if you listen really well
i just wanna see
and stroll right into town
now dont try to kid me mancub
i wanna walk like you
i wanna be like you
someone like me
if you dont come if you dont go
take what you want from me
if you dont come if you dont go
now i'm a believer
then i saw her face
try to play the role and yo the whole crew will act up
i'll serve your ass like jon macenroe
got the skill come get your fill
put out your head and you wake up in the dawn of the dead
scratchin fleas is the least in the real world
i've seen ridiculous sunsets in a sickening sky
i know i know i know
about who they
lately i've been thinking about my vices
and we'd know
the oldest story in the world
you think it's fun you think it's fun and games
so you dont wanna fix it
no one can see
chorus
you're laughing as i'm sinking down
dont know much but i have a clue
i slipped the man a twenty the keys to a hunsay
i gonna keep the chrome out of the ride
the cops the kids their checkin out the ride
i hit a as it's goin off
and i been thinkin 'bout what we've become
times havent changed i'm still swimmin
to tell the kid exactly where not to go
i can taste the blood
that everyone wanted to hear
i know its over
we are the in set
where have you been
on the swing set
never ever ever
it's no secret
take a bow
just in time
duck everybody
just in time
tomorrow's gonna hurt
and every single day is just a fling
there's nothing left for me to choose
wear my underwear steal my shirts
get outta my hair get outta my head
what's a man suppose to do
she was high she was really bye bye
she packs the pipe as much as she can fill
all that she could up with is this
even make a jamaican man sing a happy song
and teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
but if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin on the sun
repeat chorus
i'm lookin at my watch
i'm moppin up the floor
when i was carrying you
could you be lovelier
could i be luckier
and i just wanna make it crystal clear
eyes shielded with a shaky hand
with obvious and used excuses
and the children gather and wonder
i seen ya i seen ya i seen ya standing in it everytime
they wouldnt have you in the mafia
i want you to know
and i'd rather be hung from a tree or shot by a gun
and and and on top of this list of things before i leave this place
you said it wasnt all right but it would be all right
and even when i get home somehow you're still alone
chorus
you know that i am
but you're not
trying to save the world but never really sure
nothing more than that that's all i really am
i'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
nothing more than that that's all i really am
you better love your mother
you better shake that funky attitude
i had a good plan but it didnt go right
it doesnt matter what i try it all ends the same
there's always something that ends up happening
seems to be the story of my life
das verspreche ich euch
scary vulgarism
gasp your vomit out

balanced on the edge
only you prevent the forest
cancer creeps into their innocent souls

they're trying to break my spine
a loving husband devoted father
where is justice where is punishment

there is a bullet in your head

burst command til war
dont look back
snipe down the enemies
a game like russian roulette
get on with your fight
talk about friends
capture the flag
turning death into universal heir
luminaries become dall structures

in peace you live in peace you will go
hallowed be thy name

um gnade liessest du mich winseln
und niemals werd' ich frieden finden

all the dreg of humanity
misantrophists
in a dreadful fight
and you read the epitaph of your grave
mysterious groans torment your mind
your dignity with angels words
it's just the road that never endsrefracting the light of my dreams
secret wishes satisfaction
an approaching enemy
inside your body to do the job
who gave you the criminal passions
you wish to get the final shot
decimate the dregs of society
pray to god that he will take you in his hands
hopeless deliverance
armed and seasoned
hopeless deliverance
hopeless deliverance
mentally deranged
but slow and sure
liquidation and supreme sacrifice
the first time i've tasted blood
no tenderness within my heart
when i look into your face
sodomised
sodomised
waste away under the lashes of my whip
expurse of innocence and helplessness
mighty prophet's stature shall surpass the stars

my time is passing my chance is getting low
deprivation of my courage to face life
i'm coming from behind
say goodbye because i'm your saviour
you'll not escape

treacherous and blind
a soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger
a man without mercy
the enemy to neutralise
my eyes are blind uncertain way to go
just want to see everyone in hell to roastinfected victims lumbering you way
you go right off the track nobody escape
the meaning of my life
nymphomania dressed in leather
realise your exceptional dreams
when i look inside the broken glass
you take your virtues in a tow
like a locust plague
as on a proving ground
dying nations
wars were raging
into perdition
devils grip the iron fist
beast of evil devils hound
jabba the hut

your mind's fucked up by serving
the lies they tell you wont come true
feeding your mind with fear

verily you shall not die but live on console
exhausted is help and hope of wisdom
driven to their tomb

take revenge
the one that got me out of the grave
the shock of recognition now
pumping through my veins
pursuit of innocent flesh
seek them in their dread abode
stiff walking to the stake
you are gonna loose your faith
passionate secret and profound
i know that i am guilty but devoutness diarized
i consider to reap now the fruits of death
covered with rich headdress
an unsullied maid baffles his seductions and his ire
let your rites be rightly performed
i'll put you in a wheelchair

once you cross the line
crying out in vain

trace him to the place of fright
executed children
the saw is the law
the saw is the law
disordered life
no therapy will never last
terrified
dreadful pain
their despair
stunted growth of emotions
unsuspecting bags never pray
a sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood
my hopes are buried by my broken dignity
hear the last bell toll
falling down to see the sky
overseer turns on the switch
two faced killers on the battle line
following the promised land
will find a wicked end
ok corral
until his work is done
cant stop to see you suffering
they stick at nothing
and exalt them of low degree
and exalt them of low degree
unwanted youth
to save your right that you demand
starting to blast you believe in your way
unwanted youth
rebellion to society
unwanted youth
verrecke
mit luxulimousinen durchs revier
aus herrenmenschen werden sklaven
vom goldrausch gelenkt
mind decapitation
tv strangulation
to seal your morbid fate
in buring regions
feel her damp walls
from birth til eternity
es klingelt an der tr
fr all die gotteskinder
jehova wird dir verzeihn
armageddon
ihr zieht euch aus
you hear the screams of a million souls
the fate i feel is drawing near
your wish is my command
in duration of my sense
but his face was turned away
my comrades diving hand in hand
from those who never understand
the laughter of the useless man
no chance for your rebirth
i'm gonna go with pride
that's what hell can create
vampires
witchhammer greedy looked eyes
blind superstition
hear me people of sighing
they are fool adore in all clergy
intensive incense is befooled
persecution of christians in blasphemy
immaculate conception
whatever she wants
taking the chance and feeling so nice
fellows in misery
the way you told me beside stories
incubation of a mental disease
one mans meat is another ones poison
no dream and no reality
to a crawling wimp
privacy lost in cries
i felt a chill on my backbone
i feel i'm going to win
running down the back of my neck
an almost dark vault
conjuration
and the pain pulls you down
and the pain pulls you down
furious as tiger
compassion is the vice of kings
conqueror conqueror conqueror
cowardice a freezing touch
cowardice a freezing touch
a horrible man
dastardly cowardice
freeze your mind and blood
waiting for the message
come on man
worship blood and fire
pity not the fallen
they are the stupid brood
reborn are all the saints
und nur ganz allein fr mich
jeden tag denk ich an sie
doch ihr schweigen
wie all die schnen frauen
ich nenn sie ursel
gepeinigt und enttuscht
she growls and roars like thunder
so i cant hear her say
so i cant hear her say
you sweat blood
do the cannibal for me
bloodthirstiness dismemberment
greed of flesh naked skin
with corporal beings
pathological satisfaction
unrecognised by human eyes
cured the grieving pains
pray for disease
living many secret lives
supreme for creating words
equinox
man being veiled in woman form
flesh to thy bone flow to thy rod
man sollte euch wirklich mal ein

drove by rejoicing mass
on and on ride to the fall
their eyes are filled with hate hate hate
men make pleasure in hanging gore
squat behind the gates of proscription
deprived by crown
once by god created and destroyed
the revence came from exception strong power
never disown you never treat you unkind
ninety nine percent of the time x3let's move in together
hey nobody's keeping you from stopping
nobody's keeping you from stopping
the papers read that the king is dead
and the problems should be too few to mention
the truth is almost always confidential
there was a time and there was a place
doin hopscotch with my legs tied
holdin on to what's left of real life
it's a second hand story no one wants to hear
he liked amputation and the lord above
she read a story in the paper how she was victimized
chance to feel normal but now you're in too deep
if you're coming with me i might be on your way
beggars and choosers
you'll sell it to your children you'll sell it to your wife
at the end of the track is a two bit shack
meet me on the
it's a bitter pill to swallow
one less thing to call my own
that's a bitter pill to swallow
better get yourself a little street smart
there's a darkness looming but the sun is shining bright
beating me up until i'm bleeding
street cowboy with a badge that says can do what you please
bow down to the badge and colors black and blue
wont you fill up the tank let's go for a ride
but this place just makes me feel sad insidemother do you know where your kids are tonight
wont you fill up the tank let's go for a ride
who'll forgive me who's to say if it's right or wrong
staying out all the time
when everything you wanted somehow leaves
and they tell you which way not to go and
shoes
and each one's one in a million
i see something new in each and every moon
laughing at the other end
just how long is all of this really gonna last
why dont you go home and crawl into your hole
to the other corner i knew i'd be there soon
you just cant go back
yesterday's worries are today's
each one is gonna make his day
tucked away where no one own it
and there's a place for us
but it aint that bad
my day will come i know someday i'll be the only one
be the only one
my time has neither come nor gone
i dont need air anymore
i know there's so much more
yes i did my best
i did my best for you
i did my best for you
will come looking for you will come looking for you
i will still be laughing
she spins and pulls her pants down
and like everyone be just like anyone
on the street where the church bells ring to a different beat
and suicide queens
is it good is it bad
if i can keep it up
tryin to keep it up
still the caged bird's got to sing
the lines that seperate
i know how to find out about
how to go out without
it's only
i'm truly certain
by a shiny new machine
dont you know
you're right on top
if it were up to me i'd tear down this whole city what's all this sht here for
guess i'll be leaving in the morning
a guitar's a mans best friend
i hear you're good i hear you're made out of wood
they pull the strings and then they string you along
so why do you think she's so scared of you
they say misery loves company
we'll create the cure we made the disease
was it only envy so empty
money screams out i need a slave
i'll pay you when i get paid i'll pay you when i get paid
rich bored blind and lone better buy me a wife
and where will you be in 1993
i've tried not to forget about what hasnt happened yet
love's just not for lovers
never too late
never too soon
but you can be the on someone's
you can teach me how to lie
the sky breathes it in
i got a lot i gotta do
and you miss the things you never thought you'd see
and you never know what's going on inside
hopped in a big black studebaker they were acting pretty scary
your community thanks you business is good and nice guys dont get paid
for a case of cheap red wine to a traveling salesman
nice guys dont get paid
and i'm waiting for the garbage man to take you away
to take you away
where the kings of nothing rule my friend
the circus came i had my fun
and nothing that you can keep
but you dont understand how i'm feeling
it's too much to make you say
wash all over me
cant find the time
still i have the same old doubts
nothing i have figured out
i've nothing to write home about
there's no more ranges for me to ride
sometimes i feel so
nowhere to hide
and every day was a bad day
you know he never made it into town
poor little old me
and it makes me wonder who i'm working for
'cause i think you know just what i'm looking for
'cause you might be keepin secrets
its hard to get hard these days
'cause ill be ok
and there aint much to say
give me just a little taste
all these words that i hear spoken just promises broken now
all these words that i hear spoken just promises broken now
it's all right
because the meat from the pork is so sweet
she yelled out once more
i'm in too deep there's no way out
i can go where no one else can go
bought a ticket for a runaway train
runaway train burning in my veins
promise that you wont tell
you hide and
sweet manipulator
now you're anticipating
cause i've got all night
shipwreck sailors searching for some fools gold
be no concentrating contemplating
stuck up on a ladder scared of coming down
tried to get ahead but only got decapitated
shut down
sick of that song about all those women you fck
hello speak up is there somebody there
all the difference in the world is just a call away
i want somebody to shove me
suffering an under dose of love
oh my desperate disposition keeps me bitching keeps me wishing
doing the best we can
with every grain of sand
and saddle up your salamander
i'll make my intrusion anytime anyplace anywhere the hour
things arent quite the way they should be
wondering if it's safe to go outside
though it may be safe to say that i am annoyed
and you just act shattered
it brings a tear to your eye to get out into the open
sometimes i feel like a stranger i feel like a stranger
i want to buy some flowers for my mother if i only had another chance
she darts from the eyes of the panic struck driver
fend for yourself
who died in the bathroom hit his head on a urinal
and he brought it home and washed it in the sink
hey what're you saying calling out my name
take it to the root two times
left the keys in the door
and told them the way
makes me feel pretty good i guess
play with me dont play with me
dont play
play with me dont play with me
she takes care of all the light
with the sun maid
look at you now all those strories and there's no one to tell
look at you now
do you think you can find a place for my dreams
said she talks too muchplease dont leave me to my own devices
he shows no pity for anyone
do re mi fe fi fo fum
sometimes i wanna be friends with everyone
if we win or if we lose it's a pleasure to play
we are not responsible for these sad circumstances
so the darkness fades
and you hide no more
how can you be so possessed by the profit that's been made
the spell is cast in broken glass your time is running out
the traffic inside your head is tearing you apart
i was tapping my foot on a friday night
the lasting relationship sinks right off the pier
and i wish you the best i sometimes feel the need
i want blood
so seriously i took her
with honest pay
new orleans style
the mirror on the wall it tells no lies
got you in his chains
is he worth the price you pay
day in day out it's the same old story
here it comes my peace of mind
you're close so close so close
is there somebody that you want to talk to
i wonder if she'll ever come back
to regret all the things you've done who're you trying to hustle
closer to the stars
in walked the sheriff from jericho hill
so they stuck my dried up carcas in the county jail
holding the verdict in his right hand
hearing things loud and clear come outside have no fear
please dont ask me how i am a little tired a little scared
take them away
so get me out of here
good to see you see you later maybe one more beer
i never ever said i'd never make it home
i'm gonna crawl home crawl home alone
look out here comes one more morning
it's just one more morning
sometimes you get close to those who wait
when you look down on me
it sometimes just comes down to lust
am i still here
the pride it takes
can you feel me please say yes
and there you were put on the spot at the end of the other line
lived each day like there is no tomorrow
remember the first time you saw the rising sun you may be done
badly to be someone you can call a friend till we meet again
he picked up the paper from the bitter cold morning
and she does lots of crystal and she owns her own pistol
that's why they killed him
whatever presidents do
something better to do
it begins to change
they act just like me and u
and im workin so hard
keep em gotten
i cant change your mind
out on the freeway
on my way
would you look into my eyes if i were to go blind
do we need bad disaster to make it plain to see
gotta get on out
and the word gets 'round
it's front page news
dont want no more
goin down
i only want to go back home
if i could find my way to shore
i never really liked that town
goin down
and by the way that it sounded
now it seems that you are grounded
i'm growing into you
you never grow out of fear
you're running away but you wont get very far
played it at night in his dreams
but lighting the day alone seems so untrue
when the circus that you left goes on parade
you'd better look around
did it almost make you feel that somethings gotta happen soon
i'm away from the boss at least for awhile
and i'm almost there i'm almost there
but can you love her
naked in the cold sun
and leads the scorched ones here
now i'm in control
and i thought it was the 4th of july
santa you're my king
cool
loosely buying your cheating your lying
we couldnt look a saint in the eyes
no one can save
grow and decay
mother who's your man
deep into the ground ground
'neath the black the sky looks dead
steal the warm wind tired friend
i know youre half awake yeah i know hate
so tear it out and open it
and altogether gone
no matter how hard i fall nothing can break me at all
dont let the world get you down
follow me into the desert
i shot my love today would you cry for me
and if you live you can fall to pieces
the day will finally come in
not necessarily dumb but just uh beautiful beautiful
sitting here like uninvited company
sitting here like wet ashes with x's in
sitting here like wet ashes with x's in my eyes
it's backing down and under
everything's real to me
i can count it on my fingers
now i'm into plastics
unknown line
burn the candles deep inside
make no mistakes i'm what you make me
give up to greed you dont have to feed me
and my last ditch
i wield a ton of rage
tears of the feeble
the shelf of the sky
harvest the gold
under the red
while the rest of you
i'm the break and the fall
i'm the wreck of you
though stick and fire and may break your bones
written by chris cornell
if youve got some time to kill
i'm the dirt beneath your feet
for all that reminds me
of love
walking in two ton shoes
i built an elevator from his bones
i wanted to be free
if you could say it
if it gets you up
if it helps you see
save it just keep it
if it makes you brave
i'm gonna make it right
pile of bones for my bed
turn the head 360 degrees
i'm gonna feed
i'm just a baby who looks like a boy
i'm just a baby who looks like a boy
come down
get off
get on with your life
dont waste my time it's not going to change
so say what you want suck all my
no hesitation victim dead
just from the start it's the end
youve got nothing to say nothing to say
i've kept the movie rolling
it gives me the butterflies
i cant get any lower
been stuck inside andup all night at dave's
nothing gonna pinch this nerve of mine
over the pretence over the spire why
in control of everything
to answer to me
a cleaner love

i dont want anything
only empty in your armsi play i'm sick and tame
only healing when you ache
all these years cannot be mine
written by chris cornell
i'll take the river down to still water
and rusty chains i'm gonna break my
i'm gonna break
is it to the sky
is it to the sky
music shepherd cornell lyrics cornell
there's no more rides for free
now i know why you've been taken
wheels go driving slow
music lyrics shepherd
from the likes of her
in laughs of love
speak the rhythm on your own
steal the rhythm while you can spoonman
you dont have to hide
it doesnt mean you're high
get yourself control
and i just smile cause i could tell
cause i fell for her looks
now i wouldnt mind
here at sundown nothing is when
gather 'round and fall right down
i tried and i cried
except a voice was in my head
one more time around might do it
all the other pigs
blowing smoke and talking wind
sleep tight for me i'm gonewarm and sweet
cause i feel i'm going
another motherfucker goes down the drain
just add it on the hot rod death toll
i painted my eyes
and even if it isnt mine to say
how quickly you are uncovered
hey mr shame
and really no reason why
knowing everything's been discovered

try to decide what not to do
all these fuckin thoughts inside my head
everyday for me
limp bizkit in the house
five o said freeze and i got numb
check it out yeah y'all here we go again
now across the country has us up for the war
so what the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide
records from fred d still we can rock bells
limp bizkit
respect should be abound
never again trusted in you
pride for in my life so why is it that
done me wrong i need to justify the reasons
and my soul is bleeding i cant take away
force yourself on me
i'd kill myself for you
cant take one more day
could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree
i just cant get them through my head
not the only
here i am now
and i crawl
twisting turning crashing burning
x1
patiently waiting for you to disappear
that she believes
he looks with tired eyes
that i appreciate the way you always tolerate
your words to me just a whisper
or this i want to come apart
but i know i'll do the right thing
the devil in you i suppose
to make sure that it's real
if we could
from you
to you
i'll carry you with me
i just needed someone to talk to
when all this i was going through
to express how i felt
you were just to busy with yourself
it's obvious you've changed
but you had to fall because that's how this life is
your karma has caught up with you
and please i'm still wearing this miserable skin
was it something that i couldnt see
tell me please
so please if i cut off this nose from my face
i might breakdown in front of you
i might breakdown in front of you
as i wait for this valium to slowly kick in
can you see
and all you step on with no shame
the more you blame
the price you pay to play the game
the price you pay to play the game
what you pay to play the game
i cant take any more
and makes you hate the beauty
it's bringing you down
and you only wonder how
come on get it right
it's raining
for a while see if you can take it
see cant you see that were all afraid
cause it feels like a rainy day parade
raw
i feel so cold
you've drifted off somewhere alone
whoever they happen to be
the things that you do
i have seen to many sad eyes look at me
and your eyes
and for the times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait
i hope you're not intending
i needed fulfillment
searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
although i know you dont approve
love's not in my memories
run away why should you care
through your eyes
work things out cause
the drugs i take
but then i find you here
i'm in the thick of it
from all of it
from all that i am
is you
you save me
in the mirror staring back at you
so cold were the days when i listened to you
maybe i could use a little help
ashamed like me
i wouldnt be standing here preaching my hate
betrayed nothing left but pain
the walls that you build up will crumble around you
fuck
broken and depredated
and these are my dreams
one life contained
somebody shake me 'cause i
i feel i give everything to you
i dont look like you do the things you do
i dont like today take it all away
i blame you 2x
suffer
the life here that i've made
the life here that i've made
just kicked me in my face
all alone
take away my sorrow my tomorrow
i'm suffocating
i know that i am really not here
'cause i once felt that way
watch me stumble and come undone
so you choose to break my heart
so before i freeze to death there's something i should say
you're my world
here i am
you're the only thing
and goes like this forever
this place i see just doesnt look familiar
faces change
shine down through the rain
i'm not very good at just paying attention
i'm not really sure of the illusions we read on the wall
i'm not very good at pursuing redemption
the way i am just let me be
and it feels like this is good enough for me
and it fits
and it feels like this is good enough for me
take your wordly advice
take my bed of dirt
try to see the way around you
take me 4x
that's forced upon my plate
me sleep
with what i say
and i'm home
please dont cry
you mother came up to me
the life you waste
the life you waste
for not having
with my own hands
it's okay i've forgiven you
locked deep inside my place to hide
chorus
to notice when i'm not around
when i walked out this morning
chorus
and all these things you give away
chorus x2
i need someone here to help me
you made me so do something
the thoughts from my mind
please take it all away
chorus
i know that it never goes away
while the tv defecates
i've given all i can and are you pacified
i cant accept this all because of you
and i try so hard to be everything
i'll live through this
would you take the wheel and steer
not everything in life is handed on a plate
judging only by its worth
for putting up with me
fuck you and the judgements you make
and it's been awhile
and it's been awhile
why must i feel this way
but i can still remember just the way you taste
it's been awhile
it's been awhile
i've gone and fucked things up again
just the way you taste
it's so distorted
i feel so dirty
i'll take you down
just
you've lied so much you think it's true
i trusted you i trusted in you
do you know what the truth is
a song they gave give me back life
chorus
your name was layne
to time we borrowed
to really wollow
it's in the air
and whisperings
we found along the way
i cant believe i'm just an addict
i'm begging you to please come save me from myself save me from myself
i wish i knew just what that means
driving me insane
cause you can feel my anger
all these promises
make me whole again
the walls around me caving in
to live in
distorted
i hate the way you fuck with me
i didnt scratch the surface
too much time
addicted to the feelings
from
around you
talk to me
distant echo of peoples feet
overpopulation there's no room in jail
soaking up the cold rain
in vain
'cause inside your ugly
all the times
'cause inside you're ugly
stuffed it down
i can see through you
hold no prisioners except myself
i see no outlet
dont believe what they tell you all the lies that they are teaching when the make the corporations all
so lighting up a cigarette i followed in pursuit
so i turned around and forty thousand headmen hit the dirt
painter paint the scene
play this song
but when the hope and the love has gone
get back up and try againthough your future's not plain
what you've got he'll take
money's spent all the words are said
this time to the sky i'll sing if clouds dont hear me
'cause my rock 'n roll is putting on weight and the beat it goes on
yeah you're back into my life again
i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited
the party's over better walk away
just save the party for another day
well i'm near the end and i just aint got the time
we go round and round dont know where we're bound
baby this is true romance take it while you see a chance
the dealer's made another deal
feeling nothing deep inside
feel the music inside you i'll be there too
and we turn into music now we never will lose it
a feather duster's no substitute for the real thing
of memories i've cherished so long
staring at empty pages centered 'round the same plot
every day every day every day oh lord
each day is music reach till you find the song
father loves both of them blood's thicker than the mud
thy will be done
fill me up with your tenderness
fill me up fill me up show me how love's supposed to be
and it's come right back on you
freedom overspill
coffee and tears the whole night through
talking 'bout the things that you do
take me away beyond the night
telepathy
pouring out my soul to you
i cant believe she's going
can i cope with today
soon someday i'll be boundand i'll cope with today
dreams never lie
use up a lifetime looking for the break of day
hard rain following on cold wheels moving on
i'll give you my loving on that you can depend
know i'm gonna give you everything i can
we all want one more morning just to feel it all again
a shadow on the run
fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume
daylight breaks while you sleep on the sand
i couldnt stop myself from having fun
now comes the time i know it's gotta be you
gimme plenty lovin gimme plenty lovin
the day's almost gone but night is still ahead
voices shouting in the street life lived to a ragged beat
and from then on nothing seemed the same
real love is what we all are looking for
get on through it roll with it baby
come on and just roll with it baby you and me just roll with it baby
the beat keeps running on on and on
go down babe a slot machine to take my dime
baby's eyes feel them looking at me
here's my shining song and i know you need it
you're so far but your light still arrives
sunrise a womans eyes good loving one warm afternoon
for faded love songs and feelings in the wine
gotta get back whoa back to my baby
the feeling's the same as being outside of the law
nothing was happening i was ready to go
we were written in the stars above
i wanted to make her part of my life
you've lived through all the nights
you've got what i have to find
bring me a higher love
we walk blind and we try to see
i'm not too late for it
bring me a higher love
all you got to do is
walking to this state of mind aint' no big deal
holding on and this time i've got it right
people soul searching all night long for a reason to help them live
i will be here standing tall
well my pad is very messy and there's whiskers on my chin
well i'm a man yes i am and i cant help but love you so
all so fine i still see them shine
when i look within i see them shine again
help us feel the light inside us help us feel it everywhere
and your soul was a wide and deep blue sea
with no clothes in the sun
they've plowed they've sown they've harrowed him in
they've hired men with their sharp pitchforks who've pricked him to the heart
the huntsman he cant hunt the fox nor so loudly to blow his horn
yeah now come on and have a party
i know you've got some lovin it's something we can share
just wanna hold you in my loving arms again
i've been so lonely and i've been so blue
when the road's getting tough and you think you've had enough
oh girl you got to
you got time on your side and this door is open wide
baby i got what no one can give you all my lovin
the power to love someone up above is good to me
but you and me girl we're gonna give it a shot
hot love is a fire and you can get burned
it makes my life a carnival
'bout what goes on in the real world and such
half of us is easy the other half is hard
sometimes i think i know too much
it's a fine line a very fine line
spy in the house of love
who hold to the game
though sometimes it does get lonelyi still walk out in the morning light
here's to players who cant leave their song
take it as it comes
some like it hot and some like it cool
all the plays end there's no curtain call
any day now the curtain may fall
an out of work musician plays a solo saxophone
it's all that they can do
woman never minds pulls the shade and draws the blinds
and we'll drink our cup of laughter
i will live while i can
and lovers try
the golden dance life could be
while you're living beyond all your means
it'll happen to you as sure as your sorrows are joys
you see the good and the bad the eyes are sad
now i'm free
there's a choir singing
like my thoughts in the summer sky
time is running out
always being criticized for being his age
it's no good being lazy
everybody's got a gun
there is no more unity remind me what it used to be
to the country fresh and green
but oh the heart the hurt keeps on keepin on on and on
music high and sweet then she just blew away
music high and sweet then she just blew away
then this life is just a haunted dream
he said i think of the beauty i've had
say a prayer for the stranger
they say it's a new age
all day through here for youthe world is full of players in the night
when some cold tomorrow finds you when some sad old dream reminds you
and that old gray wind is blowing and there's nothing left worth knowing
laughed with saints and cried with clowns lived that up and down
so glad we made it so glad we made it
been a hard day nothing went too good
i want you gimme some a lovin gimme some a lovin
hey
gimme some a lovin every day gimme some a lovin
i'm taken back in disbelief
everything's heaven 'cause life with you has been a blessing
said it makes me wanna get down and pray
ooh i can feel it we're moving in a new direction
said it makes me wanna get down and pray
when i'm feeling low and all alone
'cause it makes me wanna get down and pray
i've tried to live my life alone
all my life yeah all my life someone like you
i didnt know how to quench it
and fill it up some way
i just did it on the floor
let me hear it make me a part
a crowd of people stood and stared
woke up fell out of bed
and though the holes were rather small they had to count them all
i could shed another million tears a million breaths
i still love you
or wear this pilgrim's cloak or be a common thief
their fires burn into the night
i'll be gone long before the morning
before my lonely life is set
still be love in the world
after the tears have washed your eyes
aint no sunshine when she's gone
hey i ought to leave the young thing alone
i'll be the rock you can build on
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all
the one you need
now it's all for one and all for love it's all for love
she's got me flying like a bird in a bright june sky
she can be all four seasons in one day
she's my gift from the lord or a fiend from hell
she can be kind
she can be all four seasons in one day
endlessly to the sea
if i had my way i'd take a boat from the river
endlessly like a silent tear
were the stones the workmen found
have you ever had the feeling
that love is not around
misspent with angel eyes tonight
and why my angel eyes aint here
if africa escapes starvation
every day that goes by
imagine what your taxes buy
trapped by insecurities
the only thing i really know for sure
the blood runs so red to my face
a lesson once learned is so hard to forget
never to make promises that break
from the deserts of the west to the shining sea
and all i need is another day
beneath the desert moon i sing
from the smallest little bird to the crocodile
we see the eastern sky's on fire
i'm wanted almost everywhere now
when i sat down i cried
hadnt had a bite to eat
i had this sense of doom
he thinks that i'm a lunatic
i'd like to fly away
and why would you want to put yourself through all that again
when you were still together
turn the clock to zero sister
baby wait a minute wait a minute
the river's wide we'll swim across
you're the glove and i'm the hand
i'm the devil in your soul
you're the sum of my equation
we're starting up a brand new day
hangs above my head there in the dark
shall i call her good when she proves unkind
thy love will be thus fruitless ever
it is reasons will that love should be just
who for thy sake did die contented
i see you've sent my letters back
but you'll be sorry when i'm dead
you follow in my step
you call lies in the mud
you call lies in the mud
the children of england would never be slaves
they're trapped on the wire and dying in waves
we keep together like a family should
the age of chivalry is not dead
of blood we lost a dozen litres
mother told me i was the clever one
love love love is stronger than justice
roaming the country for the common good
lomesome nights in a coyboy bed
the maidens numbered only one
i settled down with the family
everything that falls your way
swelling in the world
listen to me girl
at the centre of the fury
dont be seen alone without your friends at night
no life at all
hush child
all in sorrow
my heart was lost on a distant planet
every footstep only you
it would make a prison of my life
in all our histories without love
with every prison blown to dust
y no piensa en nada ms
another lonely day
but i should have known this right from the start
a hundred billion bottles
there's a moon over bourbon street tonight
now i can only show my face at noon
how could i be this way when i pray to god above
unspoken invitations everywhere
we must be careful not to lose our way completely
for all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight
as summer in a golden church
then you can turn a murder into art
and you're flushed with your very first success
it's as easy to learn as your abc
it's as easy to learn as your abc
that the world is not my playground
we could be lost we could refuse to try
and you could've made it through
if i had to do this all a second time
my one and only love
whenever i speak
tells me that you are my own
although we all must sometimes stumble
i need some lips to feel next to mine
i know we can make everything alright
and you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer
and there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night
and she told him she was never coming home
in his imagination she's a universe away
i'd never imagined before
but that was the past
although he's changing day by day
one day he'll love mew d
we've never been closer than this
one world is enough for all of us
in our world there's no time for sorrow
i dont want to bring a sour note
it may seem a million miles away
only you
help us to see the beauty of the least of thy creatures
bring those who bear hate closer to thy gentle creation
an innocent world
panis angelicus fit panis hominum
i was so happy just the two of us
j'ai neglige le primordial pendant trop longtemps crois moi
i wouldnt dish around here
i'll wear my best collar to his funeral
and a perfect love so strong
i wont be wagging my tail for one good reason
and what i like about this guy the most
desormais nous sommes trois lui toi et moi
it's a dogs life loving you baby
aprs toutes ces soires passes seuis en tte tte
and i would follow you through every thick and thin
they didnt believe my words were true
everybody left but you
cause everybody fell
in his arms she fell as her hair came down
i never made promises lightly
upon the fields of barley
face like a weasel
fill 'er up son
yeah that's a real diamond she be wearin
i was lucky to get the job at this gas station
i can sort it out later on the phone
why were you going to take that stolen thing
you're gonna fill her up with hate
you've gotta fill her up with faith
you gotta fill her up with love
sometimes in shell the orient's pearls we find
there let me live forlorne
my fortune is throwne
it's just the way that the world evolves
to negotiate for peace on earth
so let's just get on with the past
is our love really beyond repair
you're moving way too fast
the siege guns had been pounding all through the night
for i cannot fill the chasm
and if i built this fortress around your heart
i had to stop in my tracks for fear
jamais a nossa voz vai calar
que fragilidade que fragilidade
ficara fragil demais
to clinch a lifetime's argument
on and on the rain will say
ni se lograra
acero y piel combinacin tan cruel
lloras tu y lloro yo
all men are free justice is a sword we hold
freak the mighty freak the mighty
freak the mighty freak the mighty

dont give up the fight
dont give up the fight
and now you see the light

but you cannot fool all the people all the time
dont give up the fight

dont give up the fight
his icy sinews
the fire's embers
a cloak i borrow
a mast without a sail
the last thing i'd expect
or have tasted the bag of the bee
the royal astrologer was run out of breath
he prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain
heavy cloud but no rain
sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
sooner or later
sooner or later the world first day
be what you come here for
i burn for you i burn for
and your love flows through me
the horse he kept running the rider was dead
here in the courthouse the whole town is there
and out in the distance a trick of the brain
i have to hold my head
leaving me too soon
i cant make up the fire
all i hear is that lonesome sound
they got me in their sights
from the wound a lovely flower grew
the blood of the lazarus heart
to sacrifice a life for yours
lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower in the rain
seas have their source and so have shallow springs
and night after night she would stand on the shore
i'd give three ships of spanish gold
and day after day he would stand on the shore
no debt was paid no dowry to be gained
the secret marriage vow is never spoken
there are the soul cages
these are the soul cages
a vintage that blessed every ship in the line
these are the soul cages
he dreamed of the ship on the sea
if it should happen again i shall worry
found myself on the deck on a rolling ship
at first just a rustle of canvas
held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship
lost on the wild wild sea
they're dancing with their fathers
they dance with the invisible ones
one day we'll dance on their graves
danzan con sus esposos
dancin with her invisible son
why is there this sadness in their eyes
they're dancing with their husbands
they're dancing with their fathers
one day we'll laugh in our joy
danzan solas
they're dancing with the dead
and though a million stars were slowly turning
your distant sun your shining light
devil to pay on judgement day
to bring me back into your arms
i was cursed with x ray vision
in guns and body bags guns and body bags
and those little cotton flags
on the white cliffs of dover
a war on our dissent
and every nation
this was never meant to be
and now you're in the arms of someone else
i tell you this was never meant to be
here comes the john from his other life
a small transaction we must meet
i dont need forgiving
his dress is stained with color red
dont judge me
you could be me in another life
tutti frutti au rutti
tutti frutti au rutti
she's a real gone cuckoo yes sirree
fifteen miles down the track
and that's it more or less
left her with my friend jack
til this midnight express
this isnt how it was meant to be
i know i cant be late
hir speeches notes of that night bird that singeth
and sees of service divers sorts in sowing
everything she do just turns me on
now i know my love for her goes on
now i know my love for her goes on
she said how much do you need me
but before our future course is set
with a circus mind
it's alright
some would say i was a lost man in a lost world
i never saw no military solution
if i ever lose my faith in you
then i wont understand 'til the end of my days
though the pages are numbered
there's a promise of heaven and hell but i'm damned if i see
i cant see where they lead
here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
and all the noise is silenced in the room
except when this moment comes near the dancing's end
there was an old guy with a beard
i cant see nobody better so you'll just have to do
we had no time to worry though there was just to much to do
he's god's best friend he's got a seat on the board
so we said we had a mission for his favourite dove
rock steady rock steady
walk the streets for money
told you once i wont tell you again
i dont subscribe to this point of view
there is no historical precedent
what might save us me and you
i've been searching long enough
the spirit moves on the water
all the saints and angels and the stars up above
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
i've been thinking 'bout the things that we believe
if somebody up there likes me somebody up there cares
the minute i saw her face the second i caught her eye
the minute i saw her face the second i caught her eye
it's a promise or a lie i'll repent before i die
send your love into the distant dawn
but still the earth is moving so fast
send your love
throw a pebble in and watch the ocean
and fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing
a kind of ultimatum note
it's plain to see
ask if i am mouse or man
if i make up my mind
wednesday would be fine thursday's on my mind
he does the best with me he can
shadows in the rain
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
but that's not the shape of my heart
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
she dont like the things i cook
she dont like the clothes i wear
she might prefer me as i am
she's too good for me
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos y si me dices que si
the primal root of a womans charms
to howl at the moon the whole night through
i'd like to add her initial to my monogram
wont you tell her please to put on some speed follow my lead
wont you tell her please to put on some speed follow my lead
but our thoughts kept returning
in the circles we made with our fires
from the wind on the moor so wild
at the feast of the crow
what's the use of worrying and feeling blue
so easy that it must succeed
spread a little happiness as you go by
spread a little happiness as you go by
it only takes a moment dont be afraid
spends the night with his lover there's a trace of her cologne
but there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne
you promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone
will eliminate romance
are a millions deadly spores
come and be my wife
if i should seek immunity
come into my door
if it's just for my sanity's sake
take me to the sun
and what's bad for his spirit is bad for his health
i've been saving all my days for a break
you have the means in your possession
across the desert he would fly
with their cups full of sand
'cause when the night begins and i'm at an end
tell me that you love me
and bring it all back home to me baby
because i need your love so bad
our saviour christ and his lady
o they sailed to bethlehem
and all the souls on earth shall sing
i wondered how i could win you
and where the two birds were flying
and that our love would always last
i was blind but now that i can see
were the wounds that would heal me
i was blind but now that i can see
you could say all of this and worse but
but every time i close my eyes i see your face
if you want to keep something precious
that's all some people ever want to be
if you want to keep something precious
can you forgive me i hope that you'll be happy
he got me joint custody and legal separation
something made me smile
i said everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime
my music hellish jarring sounds to banish friendly sleep
inside the circus of the wind
inside the songs of our defeat they sing of treaties broken
love is the fire of the world
inside the dogs are waking
love is an angry scar
love me like a father love me like a prodigal son
billy was born within sight of the shipyard
they launched the great ship out to sea
all the workmen suspended like flies
that night he dreamed of the ship in the world
i never knew how much i'd miss you
if the night turned cold and the stars looked down
you search the city for your only friend
if there's one guy just one guy
it's hard to say it
it's hard to say it
you're not the easiest person i ever got to know
the jury's out and your eyes search the room
my horoscope said you'd come back
i have my doubts you see
i have my doubts it's true
everyone saw the big clock ticking
sometimes they tie a thief to the tree
when popular icons failed
there's a little black spot on the sun today
it's the same old thing as yesterday
there's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall
i guess i'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
that's my soul up there
i'll always be king of pain
je pense tu sais
tu en a ras le bol
he looked beneath his shirt today
to sacrifice a life for yours
every day another miracle
where does she get the strength to fight them anymore
he'll guide you well
when the doctors failed to heal you
and your eyes turn towards the window pane
let your soul be your pilot
and fold my darkness
into another night
allied to death child to his blackfac'd night
come again that i may cease to mourn
all the night my sleeps are full of dreams
found nobody there
but to look for heaven is to live here in hell
i said what about our politics philosophy our history
i said there must be something in our scientific treasure
instrumental
she's a big lass
and her stockings once was white
an they caall hor cushie butterfield an aa wish she war heor
whan aa axed hor te marry us she started te laff
noo aw heer she hes anuther chep an he hews at shipcote'
their logic ties me up and rapes me
have words to thank for their positions
is all i want to say to you
they're meaningless and all that's true
did you ever wonder what you'd been carrying since the world was black
yes i've been walking now i'm hanging from a dead mans rope
the shadows fall
all the days of my life i will walk with you
tied to the tracks and the trains fast coming
i'm a three line whip i'm the sort of thing they ban
i'm a three line whip i'm the sort of thing they ban
you say that this wasnt in your plan
this desert rose
i wake in vain
sweet desert rose
i wake in pain
and as she turns
i close my eyes this rare perfume
sweet desert rose
and oh how like a song
but now the winter seems to stay too long
but here's someone who's hoping
of schoolgirl fantasy
you know how bad girls get
to hurt they try and try
dont stand so close to me
well i've been down so long
so long as it's somebody else's dime
and then a fat man takes my money
high hopes and dreams
what is my reaction what should it be
protest is futile nothing seems to get through
amores invisibles
otra mujer seria torturada
un dia danzaremos
danzan con amores invisibles
pronto se terminara
sus nios tambien
they chased him through the fields
and be towed by the drag of the moon
at the end of a pale afternoon
they chased us through fields
by the drag of the moon
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an englishman in new york
then he's the hero of the day
steal my eyeballs and come back for the sockets
you dont need to read no books on my history
pick my brains pick my pockets
you'll still know nothin 'bout me
you'll still know nothin 'bout me etc
check my records check my facts
turn over everything 'cause i wont be at home
every game you play
i'll be watching you
chase the dog star
how will she know of the devils i've seen
and water's my grave
i hope my legs dont break
feet they hardly touch the ground
you stay
some may say
i cannot get to my love if i would die
to ferry me over the tyne to my honey
our blood has stained the coal
but deadly for twelve thousand years is carbon fourteen
one day in a nuclear age
this way of life is part of me
power was to become cheap and clean
that now lies sleeping
i see me with you and all the things you do
we'll be together yeah
call me baby call me just call me
the angels watch us sleeping
shadows on the wall
and all that they're containing
when the angels fall
a million suns at midnight
same tape i've had for years
you make the best of what's still around
i run 'deep throat' again it ran for years and years
you make the best of what's still around
when the world is running down
when the world is running down
when the world is running down
tell me where would i go i aint been out in years
no one to talk to me i've listened here for years
you make the best of what's still around
i'd move town
i keep the faith in my fashion
and i'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
come and live with me
i'm gonna love you more than life
whatever bread's in my mouth whatever the sweetest wine that i taste
something's gonna change
whenever those dark clouds fill the sky whenever i lose the reason why
whenever i say your name whenever i call to mind your face
one day we'll be together
hauling on frozen ropes
dark angels follow me
why should i cry for you
wilt thou unkind thus reave me
farewell farewell
sweet sweet my jewel
be estranged be estranged
like a snowball down a mountain
like a tunnel that you follow
and the world is like an apple
was the sound of distant drumming
like a circle in a spiral
but to whom do they belong
like the circles that you find
in my bed tonight
that you believe of me
when i'm so sure so sure this isnt so
you still touch me
i lay awake the whole night through
you're like a plaintive melody
you wont forget it if you ever had it
you dont get it no you wont forget
coming down
trip the witch and ride the shame
hold me closer let me go away
quite like the moment
there's so much i could teach you
so for the moment

so keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbead motorcade
i cant walk
but all i got was humble kidney pie
i can booze and steal your shoes so i can move
lived on a summer with new shoes tumble in the rough
i can booze
all these things i think about
all these things i'm sick about
two times and it has rendered me
sometimes it blows my mind
hey where's my cigarette
bought to farm but the farmer done died sing that song sing that song inside
if i was stronger i could be a mountain range
can you speak without lies
burn your wicked garden down
out of the dark that blinds you
would you tell me things that you wouldnt have
i think i spread myself a little too thin
musictolkkilyricstolkki
in the eyes of the world
shades of night i'm walking through sleeping village
i'm your god computer's my name
log you out of my system
so let's all join our hands
4th reich is rising
meaning so much more
my life is changing i cannot recall where i've been before
a morning of no recall no memory nothing at all
was i meant to fail every time
musictolkkilyricstolkki
maybe it's like you would throw the dice then hope that nothing goes wrong
is life down here just one big endless curse
i can hear you calling me
that stays with me forever
before the summer turns to winter before the dreams will turn to snow
again i see you standing there watching me
my black diamond
i cast the spell on you never let you go
love is a stream that endlessly flows in me
i see through history
they say that we are the crown of all creation
i have been sailing across the oceans
searching for loving from strangest places nothing is left but the pain
without you i am like a ship without it's sails
take my hand it will be alright for you and me to go
they will put you down with their minds of steel
the times are changing so fast i wonder how long it lasts
look all the things we've done under the burning sun
i control my life i am the one
so please wait for me
distant skies
looking back through time through my childhood days
i will close my eyes and float away with stream
why dont you take me there wanna feel some infinity
so long i have been accepting what i've seen
cant make no compromise and to stop what has begun
seeing the new face impression the moment the thought
i cant believe what's on the screen
we're flying so high
i am facing the truth
courage and faith will show me the way
i'm walking down the road that i choose
there's no on ehwo could stop me now she'll be mine
the path of wisdom is the only way to reality
musictolkkilyricstolkki
reign of terror
on winds of time my soul will fly
listen to me now i'm so close to you
all the sorrow and the pain will be washed away
hasty deeds spoilet the chances of mine
walls that sometimes the skull is called
until the damage is done and the beauty is gone
before i go to sleep
tears of ice falling down
what you did to me
dont know what is happening
but your eyes light my way
dont turn on me please wont you stay by my side
what happened to all your dreams
wheel of the time
approaching visions of things
staying there alone reaching for the unknown
i will take things as they come
i'll turn
other side is calling me
the spirits are calling me
leave me be
where are you now alone just like me and venus in the morning
like venus in the morning
as we are reaching the end of the century there's message we can send
nostradamus century i v43
save us we are the future
end end end of our time
soon there will be no one to fight with me
did you ever give a dime to things that you really believed
what will we find
canceling tasks i've delayed for so long now it's do or die
but i am here and i am wondering
if you want to have a look in future world
silence is all i hear blackness fills my world
breaking the silencewinter blows colder
the witch hunt is coming to town you better look around
take your little life and ride away
he leads us to destruction
it shouldnt be all up to them
music by tolkki words by kotipelto
but they cant chain our minds or hearts
i stand alone in the darkness the winter of my life came so fast
as long as i live
change into blessings if i change the point of view
look through yourself there's a mystery full of you
pain and misery is it true when you say that you never
it's fright night
in the heat of the blast watch the beauty of the mushroom cast
we were ment to be free
the earth is rolling in her grave
the demons sometimes find a way
i feel the glory of the world
acquiring more still there's never enough
telling salvation comes from above
remember you get just what you give
unlock the door
the look that's in their eyes
lead us into the light
higher than the sky
we'll keep the mem'ries we gained inside our hearts
i'm fighting
under cover of the night
years he spent in the cage they did not help him at all
more clear it's each day
millennium to the new day
the tears of pain
we should have learned by now
your mind is aching and you cant go on
musictolkkilyricskotipelto
now all is so clear i can finally proceed
i know you've been inside but what were you in for
now you're taking it time after time
now he has gone
you'll have to find another no one to take the shit like i have
watching all the women shaking slimming
watching all the roads that bend
and they're making eyes at suburban boys
at suburban boys
loved up doved up hung around stoned in a lonely town
la la la la
anything is possible for the bentswood boys
he said
i dont care who's wrong or right
oh if you were the one would i even notice now my mind has gone
and when i start my new life i wont touch the ground
and when i start my new life i wont touch the ground
i feel schizo every so psycho kicking at an old tin can
so give me this and give me that smother me and give me some of that bad stuff
there's a great big crack in the union jack
took the film to no i
with dreams of gasoline drying our eyes
and sorrow breaks the silent day
and the ambulances sigh that you're down
and the audiences cry that you're down
and there's a madness in your smile
and she sits alone by the telephone but they wont call back again
oh li da di da dioh li da di da dioh li da di da dioh oh
we kiss our love with lips like pain
we got a love between us and it's like electricity
it's bigger than the universe
as lovely as the clouds come and see them
getting satellite and sky getting cable
well she's show showing it off then
she sells heart she sells meat
hand in hand
let the parties fall
he's on your left
get rich get stitched get lonely
you thought you'd come and amaze me honey
and we're moving so moving so we are a boy we are a girl
if you can take it i can take it all
but with a tattoed tit she'd die for us all tonight
oh he is gone
he's my insatiable one
down through the platinum spires
and what she has said
and we spread it around to a techno sound
it's like a new generation calling
tragic as the son of a superman
dont you worry
hey such a lovely day such a lovely day
in the new loves under covers in the cold touch of the right
cold cold as the night high as the trees slow as you like
and it'll be okay like everyone says it'll be alright and ever so nice
oh whatever makes her happy on a saturday night
and she gone gone gone
she another night another pillow
nowhere faces nowhere places no one wants to be
and she's in fashion
then two is one my love
the sunshine will blow my mind
he said she's not dead she's gone away gone away
too siamese to catch the leaves from those trees
we're so young and so gone let's chase the dragon oh
she walks the streets to pass the time
she feels the wheels and needs a line
sadie
cos she's star starcrazy getting stupid on the streets tonight
crawling the walls under electric lights
and this still life is all i ever do
lying in my bed
lying in my bed
as i listen to the band
i know a girl she walks the asphalt world
it's in the blood stream it's in the liver
when you're there in her arms
i watch the skylinefor him to come
this is the way
and maybe were just streatham trash and maybe not
it says oh do you believe in love there
i love that deafening thundering sound
look just like an elephant man
i love that deafening thundering sound
look out all of you fairweather friends
i have to leave
stars in our own car we can drive away from here
give me give me the power
she walks the streets to pass the time
she feels the wheels and needs a line
sadie
two silhouettes by the cash machine make a lovers dance
lying in my head watching my mistakes
alone but loaded
all we see and believe is the dj and debts dissolve
a day in the life and dream of sheep
listen to the music in your head
she'rocker hear the audience scream for the death of the king
an we wash it away we wash it away this grey
oh we wash it away we wash it away this grey
i see her by the window waiting every night
i think i'm going to heaven on it
let's get something straight
just think of the life you'll save
when you're on your own
the tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
it's in everything we do
just trash me and you
you wake up with a gun in your mouth
they're sparking up with someone oh
out in the sticks out in the stickiness
where the pigs dont fly i do
we'll jack the politics for premonition and fire
cause when the stylized kick of the filmstar whip
side to side
he gets lovely the more he's ill dont od on him now
so fucking what if he's licking the bag dont od on him now
les says punk isnt dead
insulting everyone picked up your sister kicked your son the young men
through every station through every town
people on the streets do whatever we please
piss our money down the drain
life is just a lullaby
under the jet plane sky
everything will flow
what to believe in when they change your name
graffiti women draw pictures on the wall
graffiti people got nothing got no name
have you ever been this low
i am the one i sing the song
you know oh i wanna do it again
cities die
come on come on and
she walks in the beauty of a magazine
my marilyn come to slum for an hour
cause me and them we like to get out
oh if he is dead
you smile from your window
with the style of a widow
into a song
like the carpenters song
sulking on the subway music in our brain
hi fi in the white city yeah yeah
she called you from across the city you hired a car to crawl
images of violence fill up my mind
and stabbed a cerebellum with a curious quill
introducing the band
a fifty knuckle shuffle heavy metal machine
introducing the band
oh jumble sale mums what are they on
and they know that when she's stacked up top
he's a killer he's a flash boy ohoh and athena loves your body
the kind you find on cinema screens

of robbery when nothing is worth taking

tap twist snap x4
are we seeing eye to eye i'm believing all the lies
and making out in the sand
as we grew up under the sun
can you tell me
'cause the words have so much meaning
the summers that lasted so long
but my view from the hollywood roosevelt
kept you waiting
oh yeah all right
if you decide to change your mind
and when it's over
have gone out the window
i know
all the favorite tv shows
when it's over
have gone out the window
all the songs she used to sing
get up
please dont leave me hanging on and on
get up
it aint that easy
get up
baby
she says these words
get up
get up
you seem to me
on the verge of running
you seem to me
could be needing
dont bring it in
at angels door
crowd the day with unrelated histories
notice newfound courtesies
they live on every street
have a life
they seem to x2
and you learn to
behind the curtain
as girls go x5
as girls go x5
floating in the sultry air
but he doesnt dare ask the right question
too much too soon
what price to pay
i will pay for my life with my body
he said you look from your direction
beyond the duty and the discipline
all feeling
i wait to meet my love made real
when it begins at your knees and goes right to your head
birth day
there's this black widow spider darling and she's been walking on my hand
you've been to long darling and it looks like rain
but blood makes noise
i think it's really
when blood sees blood
how did this come to pass
and my question to you is
'cause pictures lie
you'll see
always
i took your urgent whisper
number every page in silver
has taken its toll
might still want me
i am asking you
bitten my soul
better go into town and get then friday night
you'd think that maybe by now you'd see the light
but i think you ought to use a little more sense than what you're using
'cause i know if you were gone i'd miss the sound of laughter
and i brought him into me
my hair it blows long
i kept him here for years
and my song in the wind
and long for you
how i would live with myself
these things begin
i only turned to see
what could be
we look for a sign
ah
soon it will hit the deep freeze
wondering where the hell
and in the evening it has flown loose again
she sits by the window and eats sunflower seeds
where they wrestle and they play
her wit and wonder snuffed
love is never blind
no shadow or shade of a doubt
i dont want to hear it
it's making me nervous
fat man and the dancing girl
it's making me nervous
and most of the show is concealed from view
never dreamed i would fall
does she tell the truth
get rid of it soon
i never imagined
the floor to your room
i had to know
even
each night
as she's lying in bed
i love you
i've come to you
will she try it again
all i've got is my guitar and a couple of dollars to spare
that i'd better start moving if i want to get somewhere
he's so true she is too she says
they woke up and they broke up
to be in love
in the tickling
in your pocket
you and me
wintertime
if it were only you
every sane person is asleep
do you fear the light
you slink along the sidewalk outnumbered and out of place
to destroy all in your way
by day give thanks
find the outline things will
now i watch you falling into sleep
what's underneath all of the deadpan face
it will cost you cost you cost you
i'll match you i'll bet you i'll play you
i said i think i am afraid
i said i think i'm dreaming
but i dont know who it was because
i said i dont know who you're talking to
watching as the field goes dry
i ask you please
i wait to hear
looking for your fingerprints
i ask you please
turning to ash as it hits the air
years of an inch and a step
years of an inch and a step
years of an inch and a step
dark life
it's out of his hands over his head
she turns to tease the camera and please us at home
it's out of our hands over our heads
by numbers by mirrors by water
a suspended ring or the mode of laughing
by red hot iron
she'd come to my house
the top of the umbrella had come off
once when i saw her
something will shine through the body
mask will keep your features in check
if i may
i'll make you see
is so large to me
and you'll know
so small to you
is a woman who's drinking
is his symbol of freedom
or a family or a friendship
every sigh every sway
and put their fingers in your hair
in the burden of the sun
into this world although they try
is in my memory
rush and foam and choke
water through a rusted pipe
hear the creak
wave goes back
it comes with the skin
and it's gotten and given
i am watching you
i am scattering like light
turning in your hand
daddy's a dark riddle
you are my little kite
never use your threes and twos
shuffle up your luck you see you almost won
solitude stands by the window
and she turns to me with her hand extended
and then she turns to me with her hand extended
and she turns to me with her hand extended
if we had met in a darkened room
i could have played your mistress
we talk and talk we tell the truth
her mother i can see lives within her still
by the brass candlestick near your red velvet coat
still i am sure i was only but one
what stinging tune
i came to you to see if you would take me in
it had been so dear to me and i kissed you as you lay
and a number you could call
a face under a street lamp
as cold
and i knew that you loved me
and so we went to bed
they had come to the wrong man
and this will be a mystery
with silencer and stun
in a pocket knife attack
so just put down the hostage and we'll
upon her belly and her throat
if you were in my movie
if you were in my movie
that you hadnt done anything yet
conjure up some grace
and so you go
so i'll see your face in dreams
the light is pale and thin
he sounds like he's missing something
and the boy in the belfry
i'll be the girl who sings for my supper
like a hunchback in heaven
and i would burn myself into your memory
i would still look you in the eye
waiting for our faces to be seen
take my place for what it's worth
where to point the aimless rage
in the ironbound section near avenue l
in front of the ironbound school yard
where the portuguese women come to see what you sell
backs are cheap and wings are nearly free
bound up in wire and fate
into the ironbound market
fancy poulty parts sold here
remains untouched it's way too much
you're playing near that line so thin
well there's no time now for explanation
and it's better that way
is friends
oh i know and you know
we've got to keep a little distance
oh i know you didnt mean it that way
do you love many can you love one
one side fire
what i am doing
until there's nothing there left at all
in her body
and watch while the queen
in a silence more eloquent
in a timeless placeless place
are all laying low
with realms underneath
gone
you can hardly tell them from the petticoats of sin
but trouble is still trouble and evil still evil
in the corner
but i'm only
somewhere inside of us
off of the strip
i'm looking at them
left of center
and i grope about the embers
of the time burned away
in the ashes of the time
some little crumb of affection
i've been where you are standing
go on home
another generations parties
love is the only thing that matters
i find each stoop and doorway's incomplete
just dont ask me what it was
yes i think i'm okay
like a phone call received
standing so loyal
skin trampoline
refusal
and dont talk about it later
i walk to your house in the afternoon
i think it's called my destiny
but feeling the thing
you know that it was
you dont feel your will
or maybe your vision
depends on the day and if he's eaten yet
go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray
and into the places where people dont stay
and we'll all go up and go down we go down go down
hangs so far from me
it will be so sweet
maybe a boy will steal it
and i know that it must
clientele
and i always thought that she
seems to have resigned
so if you've seen it anywhere
and i did not know waht to say
oh she's gone
do you know where friendship ends
was that she was never nice
so i'm assigned to read her mind now
it's between the binding
her hair again
she's cut down
straight lines
of cold metal
and he likes me
he loves the city
this is ok we do not mind
writing letters
the sun is like
but still you will
have marched across this field
where i was waiting there
and hold him to the flame
the soldier came knocking upon the queens door
and she never once took the crown from her head
and she said i've swallowed a secret burning thread
but she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
out in the distance her order was heard
i am singing for my supper
tell me what do you do
and i like to hear those little birds
i am feeling like the devil
her hair blew all around her
i said lady why are you crying
but i am the youngest and my father is ageing
so she sadly turned away from me
i knew she had sent it from wherever she was
i can feel his eyes when i dont expect him
i cannot give in no i must refuse him
they know health
move in light
it's just that there's so much to do
and i'm tired of sleeping
i like a tombstone cause it weathers well
but i do try to see the kingdom
on the corner
out the window
her umbrella
up the paper
for the funnies
really see me
is getting wet
once upon a time
every day
i watched it drink
unbound roots unbound
at the root bound at the root
i would leave only bones and teeth
i wanted to learn all the secrets
to be that sleek
and now i have you
so dont expect any slow and careful
you cant expect any kind of mercy
on the battlefield
though i saw it splinter
but save ourselves when all omens
so consider me a widow boys
but save ourselves when all omens
i hear the click these men are hard
the letters on the door and you know what they're for
wait here steer clear
in the night the walls disappeared
a moving piece of sun
alive
and for riches strange and new
down the waterfall and i'd swim over the brim
west end avenue
of america on this street
wash away wash away downstream
with pictures in your eyes
and let me hear you through the heat
you have hands of raining water
with a long and slender body
blowing by one day
and she's every girl you've seen in every movie
and she's every girl you've seen in every movie
plaster and paint
they never know
call on the saint
he's taken form in human likeness and manifests himself in all our darkest dreams preying upon centuries of weakness feasting on despair and our own selfish greed
what's become of the world the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze conditioned to fear the voice that we hear calling an end of days millions of souls under control like pawns to a king led by a string to the final hour
a chill grows near you're faced with fear
so fly away
nightmare of fantasy
marching on staff in hand
as we fight to stay alive
knew
untrue reality
begin your fantasy what does it mean
as fallen star divides the sky of divinity
empty minds still wait i'm here
answers to the voices i hear
now at my feet the dying voice of balance nevermore shall there be a way to fly a way to fly on wings of divinity as words of wisdom fade away
in your time of dying dont call my name
time closes near
solo
another question in my mind
winds of change bring songs
i'm forced to run away and hide
play the violent strings of my symphony
bow down in the platinum maze
bow down in the platinum maze
forever lost and enslaved
merciless judgement in the church of the machine
praise this child and the words of her rhyme a sacred gift magic of the five will bring you tranquillity a new order of equality
watching and waiting for curtains to fall
arrival dressed to kill it's a tragedy
gaze in these eyes my child and see here by my side you're destined to be fears in the night flee with the sun if we are one kingdom of gold i lay at your feet ruler of time and space you will be rivers of truth forever will run if we are one
great ptah khnemu sacred priest of the temple of ra and the keeper of truth crystalline spheres the power of light grant us keys to the stars and the secrets of flight 'five shall be as one'
was i sure of my fateful wish to evoke the night from the day thousands now join as one be afraid what have i done clouds are dimming the sun with his wrath of disease and decay this masque of vengeance leads my death parade what have i done my shadow burning my shadow burns across the land
a way to carry on what we believe
silence fills the shrine giving us the sign
the feel of her kiss steals my breath away
my desire echoes from a tale of ancient lore
lady of the snow holding me
your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
458music romeo pinnelalyrics miller
desperate cries hail of fire deciding
summon all to heed their cryinnocence fading away
realize that your cries
elusive to me progressions are now violence in disguise
glow silver and white eternal and bright in the sky
ohhthe hunter
ooh mother will you help me
he will not break me down no
chorus x 2
who dares to invade his sacred ground
desecraters of rachorus
the hour of judgement is at hand
scanning eyes turn into stone
through the eyes of time i see
endless dreams are all encased in disarraythrough the eyes of time i see
solo
and heal the hearts that still bleed
while you grow old
you've realized
my heart you thrust a dagger
all adversions still remain
savage curtain closes in on you
behind this illusion
decaying hope and wasted years
i pray someday the sun will shine
the straw that breaks the back
the straw that breaks the back
feel it eating secrets within your mind
but i really dont want you to stay
but i really dont want you to stay
then cast me into shades of gray
they reap the harvest that we sew and take like trusting fools
weaves our souls to roar
live with shadows and fears behind smoke and mirrors
a faith that's misleading and vague
power controllng my mindit's so sad our world is breaking down
savage and notorious
sworn to the quest for the rest of
bring peace to it again
strength within
to understand
this justice thunders our condemnation
or our tongues from evil
watch him jest as you bleed
solo
eternal is the pain that leads me
music of the spheres
the other side
and from the mansions of glory
eve of destruction
like the river styx the gates of hell
eve of sacrificearmies in the skydies trae
and all i know is my paradise has begun
pray for a glimpse of touch of sunlight
a chance to dream fast asleep your nightmare ends
close your eyes on the edge of forever
tell me now do you somehow
to the isle of deadly shores
be found by me
this whole thing is mad and still i can see
can i undo the things i've done
i cant leave
malicious designs built strong and iron clad catostrophic
ten thousand tyrants preach their treachery
conquer the wicked
solo
silver cross in ancient halls deep inside the castle walls
prey and siege in voiceless woe who's dust was scattered long ago
a dreadful scene to behold
in the witching hourhaunting minuet immortal duet
i try to elude these prisions of flesh but return to
there's no image in the mirror
part i
through a bird's eye view can it all be true
dream within a dream
talking in riddles on ears fallen deaf
now remove the masque that's obscuring this dimension
do you believeall the things that you're seeing are true
we could never smile
and i'll die another death
there's an empty place inside that is hurting me
why you gotta be so mean to me
chorus
why you gotta be why you gotta be
i would wait forever and more
believe me believe me
believe me believe me
stand protected under bigot sunshine
but i'm far from home
when you were just a little boy
make you wear the dog collar
oh they'll pay top dollar
oh they'll pay top dollar
speaking separate tongues
speaking separate tongues
so we came across the water
come stay with me a while
come stay with me a while
come stay with me a while
there's no peace of mind
if you ever need somebody
if you ever need somebody
underneath the confidence
i wont hide my scars
do you know how it feels to be hurt
alone alone
hard for me to bare
i did everything i could for you
holding lightly
your future says run
no you cant even talk
it wasnt good enough i wanted love
so you can trust me again
so you can trust me again
when she says she loves me
and what i must do
you're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there
you give your love but you wont
i'm not fit for soldier
for now you fight or i'll take your land away
over the seas over the seas
they send me away send me away
come on baby walk with me
sister moons been shining all day
nothing but blue skys coming our way
saying everything was fine
you always grab a hold of the ones you know you can change
knock down walls for you
cause i need you
make way for the lemon parade
always i'll want you
so take another shot boy
never learn to be malicious
you can never break me
of his heart's command
or be it underminded
in the palm of his hand
on the mountain
i stood my ground
that i cant deny
swallow your pride
i've carried those pails
the men they sing a song of fear
do you tell her everything's gonna be alright
underneath the birch trees
it's all part of the plan my dear
that you'd let us all down
could have been enough to try
beneath the blue skies above
you just need something
to get you on your feet again
they'll go away
they'll go away
just let me go
she said she'd do anything just to meet you
did they tear you all up inside
queen wanna be queen
so give me love
but somewhere we'll find the answer
there was a time that i could not believe
if you want to be my best friend
the roses always grow
i just wanted you to know
i just wanted you to know
for the reasons out of our control
'cause there's not enough time in your day
hey little girl
the sweet soldier's daughter
sugar my burn
show me what i need to feel
sugar may hide
all i want is to be your sunflower
i'm not asking to be more than your lover i'm not asing to be more than a friend
but you're pushing me down
mmmmmm
fear falls like rain
fear falls down like rain
i'm not broken
and they all have got you tricked
my love she dreams
cold water runs deep
spread your wings and fly away
chorus
life is good life is grand
dragged me down on a razor
and nobody can change your world
waltz with me
tell me something
oh tell the tale of the wicked soldier
some say the rope she is hanging
all others will compare to her
all others will compare
you will never say that you were wrong
for a love that isnt there
i got to pick me up when i am down
more than i could handle
and what about the deal on the flying trapeze
and gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
how we'll rise to the height of our halo
blinded by choices
without you to guide them all to zion
you're going home
give me my x5
please forgive this bold suggestion
like the calm beneath castles
life's just too short to push it away
it wont be long now
dying and cancer and crying
here in this hopeless fucking hole we call la
fret for your contract and
followed by meteor showers and tidal waves
learn to swim
fuck your tattoos
and i'm praying for tidal waves
i cant imagine why you wouldnt
so smell my soul burning
i must arm myself to fight you
at the bottom
you'll let me through there's nothin you can do
i've got the cure you're thinkin of calling dr love
love love love dr love
you need my love baby oh so bad
you'll let me through there's nothin you can do
underneath her skin and jewelry
and keeping distance from my soul
but what you want and what you need
i've got to brush them all away
cleaner who saves the day
i am the demon cleaner
ein halbes pfund butter

english
and no eggs
bake at 200 degrees for 15 minutes
and i begged
save our brothers
when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes
you can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it
mention this to me
we wish you well
ranting and pointing his finger
standing above the crowd
dont you fuckin lie
to ascend you must die
ok um um ok
the population to now they are not
so i take what is mineand hold what is mine
i was wrong
i've been picking
for a piece to cross me over
clearing out what could've been
listen to my muscle memory
i choose to live and to
step into the shadow
my blood before me begs me
my blood before me begs me
under these tears
my fear begins to fade
and considerately killing me
he thought
and if i'm the man
so i've got some
dumb fuck
fatass dirty
kill yourself
these lyrics are played backwards
shelter turns to home
spark becomes a flame
move by will alone
and yet
how can i tolerate you
because
dabble in all the way down
i would
wish it away
i'm just trying to hold on
shine until the two become one
breathe in union
and that punishment
consequences dictate
kick you
eleven is standing still
under a dead ohio sky

stronzo 1 stronzo di merda 2
my heart beats too fast

this body this body holding me be my reminder here that i am not alone in
you are a part of me
i know you best
i was so young and vestal then
my lamb and martyre you look so precious
wont you come just a bit closer
you look so precious now
one of our songs
a comfortable space
from a different angle
that is not only comfortable
managed to push myself away
and your pushing me
you still love me
slipping back into you
if when i say i may fade like a sigh if i stay
terrified of what may come
you still love me and you pushit on me
but i'd trade it all
if when i say i may fade like a sigh if i stay
but it will end no other way
and in my darkest moment feeble and weeping
i must crucify the ego before it's far too late
angels on the sideline
baffled and confused
right in two
fight over the clouds over wind over sky
right in two
or something wet on my birkenstocks
and all i could think was
and after calming me down with some orange slices and some needle spooning
you better
'cause this shit never happens to me
finally it's my lucky day
strapped down my bed feet cold and eyes red
the details of our ending
god damn shit the bed
repeated
point the finger blame the other watch the temple topple over
sense of compassion
jesus wont you fucking whistle
i will find a center in you
my life i
my life i
terrifiedterrifiedterrified to be forgotten x4
nothing seems to satisfy
say the word and we'll be
i dont want it
how can it mean anything to me
tell it's me by the clamor now baby
you ran the night that you left me
c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon up
then i crushed your face
wander in and wandering
and sinking
seems like i'm slipping
and staring and thinking
and takes me home
it got a bit messy all over the curtains
clutch it like a cornerstone otherwise it all comes down
unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen
to consume you till you choose to let this go
draining patience drain vitality
this tedious path i've chosen here
and if there were no rewards to reap heal
rob the grave to snow the cradle
'til you pull it out boy
who are you to wave your finger
when you pissed all over my black kettle
what's the difference
your're balls deep in muddy waters
view of reality to think for yourself you must question authority and
on my back and tumbling
i've missed you so much
to pull the pieces from the sand
i've missed you so much
i thought that you were hiding from me
you have turned my blood cold and bitter
take what you want and then go
i've been struck dumb by a voice that
but i'm so comfortabletoo comfortable
and half as clear as reason
i'll die within your undertow
she used the poison in his tea
stare like a zombie
why cant we just admit it
why cant we just admit it
angels in the hearts of men
vicariously i live while the whole world dies
fell at the hands of
well might of told a lie
how we rise to the height of our halo
blinded by choice these hypocrites wont see
other than tremble incessantly
tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
difficult to see you in this light
time heals time congeals around us
i've cried 1000 oceans
i'm aware what the rules are
just fade away
i'm floating in the darkness
he walked 300 miles
in lovers' communion
get your suitcase
in the land of the midnight sun
in lovers' communion
break even break
nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
and dont look so upset why you actin bashful
just the two of us 2x
and you dont want a brother do ya nah

just the two of us
she was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
just the two of us
we'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
just before our love got lost you said
in my blood like holy wine
love is touching souls
i met a woman
i would still be on my feet
night after night in such a cold world
girl take my hand see nothing has changed
and i was talking to you
a sorta fairytale
i could not erase it
you then
and i'm so sad
something about
so we go along and we said
desert cold
with you

and i i dont
but her hips sway a natural kind of faith
lost without a verse
he's got palm oil for hands
blues on the way
of course they're not mine
and blues on the way
yes i've been known to delude myself
if i just curled up and died
no not footballers that are rich
that lie now in between the facts
yes we have all been robbed of song
my heart to fear
and now she'll bring me home
chorus
healing machine
he cold light you up
chorus
where will it lead us from here
let me whisper in your ear
dry your eyes

to the thing one girl fears in the night
is another girl
you tried to show him that you can
but you can never rush a man
bachelorette

love is what you'll find
to enjoy the brotherhood of baltimore

on the other side of this
i said she is risen

sifting through the grain of gold

about how life without love

and old bank loads
violins and old coat shins and colored elastic bands
and wagons

i'm loving you too much
with his argentine baby
in a land of scarlet ribbon
if i have a heart attack at 23
it's these expressions i never give
and i'm getting old
but i find that i have now
i'll show you the roses and brush off the snow
maybe i'm just the horizon you run to when
hey do you know
all the things that i never thought
sometimes i breathe you in
thought we both could use a friend to run to
and i thought i wouldnt have to be with you
so are you gay
from tender stem hath sprung
ivy
holly waits every year
of all the trees in the wood
from tender stem hath sprung
where the deer and the antelope play
a thief down to his heels

every road leads back to my door
you've got to give something sometimes
in the springtime of his vodoo
warp speed
and right there for a minute
in the springtime of his vodoo
so when i was out
i fell out with a dragon
who taught you the names
mama layed me on the front lawn
what black magic can do
she's still in recovery
make me laugh
guess they did in camelot
jarkie's strength
i wake up to find
with the gales
bring your torches
bring your torches jeanette isabella
night after night
fairest snow with cheeks like roses
the only sound moscow burning
dropped off the edge again down in juarez
and the desert
no angel came
need a light to use
pillow cold but she wont stray into other lands he said
boys you play well into midnight
could it be the weather
oh god
so if you jump you best jump far
was
there's a sea secret in me
a lilac mess in your prom dress
i've got you mind i said she siad i've you voice
brothers and lovers she and i were
their thread and their bare
arica palm
florida coonite
and not need more blood
belize shrimp
red velvet costus
orange jasmine
marching to the beat of a hot roof o'er me
pump the water build the pressure
pull that lever
happy workers
it's the perfect job
which side your on
round and a round this time for keeps
and the sheriff now cant ride away
you'd never tell i am not asking you to believe in me boy i think you're confused
you'd never tell
she's in new yourk somewhere
i thought we told
and i'm gonna take him by myself
and in an elevator
just see
can somebody tell me now am i alone with this
that sacred pipe of red stone could blow me out of this kiss
but if we believe that its they who decide
if somehow i could reach you so
i have to trust you'll know
switch you on my friend
fading
and they put you on the street
you go back jack
your black cards will make you money
come on to me
athena will attest
what will be will be over my dead body
and you'll have to play second to her wish
hmmm
i guess i'm way beyond the pale
devoted satellite
see the boats go sailin
hear the people singin
yes it is yes it is
a woman did this to you
stay awhile
kisses for the beast
ancient savageries
stay awhile
here with me
and ransom captive israel
rising on the wings of the sun
break the silence
words are very unnecessary
all i ever wanted
kicked out of france
who i am
hear the west wind
where or when
new york is cold but i like where i'm living
your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
what can i possibly say
sincerely l cohen
but all you do is complain it aint a maserati
girl you got to find you the man who
what luck i said
you always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
from the aeroplane
and beenie lost the sunset but that's ok
steady girl on your feet
littered with corpses
stead boy watch them pray
plant another seed of hate
you took my sex
with a little more fayth
took my love
i could wake up and face the day
fayth
ashes blow in the windy sky
when the only band is made of gold
baby it burns
see how they burn
'cause she's all
but not to be saved
to set fire to his plain
bold enough
will you choose fear
i've seen flaflaflavor flavor love
what does it feel like
this orbital ball
you know i believed you
every night i wait
tv turns off
that our spirit
floating city yeah
to your floating city
they say your brain is a comic book tattoo
are you out there
even the milky way was dressed in black
'cause they cant see what you're born to be
take a trip on a rocket ship baby
'cause they cant see
poppa i'm sure
make you strong little girl
a funny little chance
and you make them with ladies hands
from the hawks that have stolen the bird from the sky
you're friends but she is not the love of your life
and a willing coalition
riding on backs of palominos
big surprise there was
blood in the cherry zone
a girl disappearing
where they can still see you
clutching her faded photograph
screams from the bluebells
anda in their do's
and i ride to work every morning
do i have regrets
twists itself to take their mistake
soon before the sun
it's a freebee you sure look deprived'
just then you go and disappear
and then when it all seemed clear
i may not have to die
you make pretty daisies pretty daisies
i gotta find why you always go when the wind blows
pull me back down
we make it up we
i have your photographs
as we are looking
i was here
we make it up as we go along
i'm freezing that
of laura mars
i dont
dont say it's time to say
to the customer and say
as mars sauntered through his door
with my little tune
like a lizard on a window pane
mother superior jump the gun
because happiness is a warm gun
the time is getting closer
there's judy garland taking budda by the hand
the sun is geting dim
oo who
i believe in peace
i believe in peace
we're in the wrong band
as much as you can
i think it's perfectly clear
said there's something believin instead of just leavin
fifteen hundred years
thoughts right now
in the pain of the respect thereof
as the radio plays
you aint a beauty but hey you're alright
that's alright with me
and wraggle his wings
and wraggle his wings
the band is going home
and their memory's like a train
so just close your eyes son
and a kiss upon his lips
over mountains
butter yellow
with a toast he's telling me it's time
i thought i'd see you again
sing 'em all your happy song
splattered and swattered
you are my sweet
but i know a girl
gonna twinkle
i sure can
chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
still coming out of your mother
my daddy would scream
upside down
i said dont we love to turn our little blue world baby
purified in my satin
purified in my satin
velvet revolution
and even wait for their savior to come
to ghetto pimps and presidents
oh virginia
dont you hear the laughter
on the way down
i'm just sitting around being foolish
for very different reasons
perhaps a phantom
out past the fountain
go on let the liquid take off what you're on
you better bring your own sun sweet girl
is it deathly cold
anything but
what child is this who laid to rest
nowell nowell

i tell you that i'll always want you near
when you gonna love you as much as i do

for the whole world
the wine ham secrets
kiss on queen wearing his wreath
from the starry heavens
wrapped in ribbons of gold
thought i had a witness to this crime

thought i had a witness to this crime

driving on the vine over clothes lines

indigo in his own
i havent moved since the call came
i have my little pleasures
i will be safe
past the mission
he just gave me a smile
and i smell the roses
past the mission
past the mission
who adore you
black satin is what i wore
shower the world with pink if you please
deep in my dreams moroccan sand
cant understand you
shines on the frontier
shines on the frontier
and on a dark night
there is a light that
so you got a playboy mommy
you're so like me
talkin 'bout hosanah
police yourself

full of winter you are
will you strike before he's
police yourself
because i like you

in the seventh grade

well what's it gonna take till my baby's alright
we gotta be big boy
beautiful anbgel

so okay then i just back off
too much cherry
it's grim but never dubious as motives go
if i'm marooned or where the purple people go
for me
thunder wishes it could be the snow
does anyone konw why you play with an orange rind
dont make me scratch on you door
i'm trying not to move
there's a light in you platoon
but i've got a place to go
a lifeless object alive
your time slips away
i am not from your tribe
things are getting desperate
boy you better make her raspberry swirl
i'm her friend
and her neverborn child still haunts her
she says that a girl needs a gun these days
to be just us and them
but nobody's really sure
so dont call me a faggot
'cause there's women running past you now
she's a girl
just picking up daises
a look in her eyes says the battle's beginning
it is your time yes my angel
then you and me can rock a bye
you can ring my bell
do it to you do it you know
you know what you know so you go chain her to your flow
my man is moistening
this alliance
you know what you know
my man is moistening
the fire in the man
or when i stopped wanting to win
do you think of us still
that and you leaving
she simply would not take the garbage out
gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal
rubbery blubbery macaroni
and none of her friends would come to play
the children remember sarah stout
the new sheriff said
yes they're free to leave
the new sheriff said
and i did and did
eighteen wheels in a high heel
but me losing you
you still got your secret spell
sold a dream at twenty three
but you know you wanna be me
the way she makes you crawl
and is it true
getting mine back
excuse me but can i be you for a while
but what if i'm a mermaid
who thinks really deep thougts
years go by
one more casualty
take hold of my hand
silent all these years
and it's been here
silent all these years
master shamen
are lighting candles in our hands
and all those up there are making it look so easy
got a wasted gun
and a lobotomy
something is coming back again
got a rubber boat
you're
i've been drinkin down your pain
so you are a superstar
i've been drinkin down your pain
m i l f don you forget

black dove
the other side of teh galaxy
but i have to get to texas
but i have to get to texas
by the woods
by the woods
so many storms not right somehow
black dove
friends of the black swan

he likes killing you after you're dead
those graces
blood roses
come on
sweet communion
come and kneel with me body and soul
'cause i think you're wrong
body and soul body and soul body and soul
i'll put on my silver
but that wont bring her back
we could make this easy
bouncing off the top of this cloud
so one ways now and saturdays now
when you've got iron veins
candle candle
guide us and protect us
this poor youngling for whom
keep
get me neil on the line
and keep your eyes on her
still the rain cant confuse the thoughts that come
you and your crocodile clip
keep on drivin
boys in th emiddle
and you still got that belle dragging your foots
maybe she will caught a lite sneeze
i can feel the distance getting close
pour the wine dear
i think that you can hear me
someone's knocking on my kitchen door
you can go now
i'll be wearing your tatoo
you can go now
circles and circles and circles again
i'll do this last one and i'll grow me some wine
being trusted and lusted
i'll do this last one and i'll grow me some wine
across the room
happened here in a glass world
concertina i know the truth lies in
i'm not afraid to let it show
c'mon baby
build a home in the sand
cool on your island
baby i'll just run away
speed racer is dead
this is cooling
tree
this is cooling
givin us a yo heave ho
gone to the other side
rabbit where'd you put the keys girl
i knew it was real
drive all night
found that i
through the dawn
settle in
kicked off my shoes
he will show up looking
figures that my courage would choose to sell our now
every day
i know a cat named easter
please be
every day
i dont know why
like today as you sh sh shock me sane
why cant my balloon stay up in a perfectly windy sky
by the time you're 25 they will say
it's not what it is
curtain call
knowing what they'll say
these dead petals honey
all over the river
and wave to the shade of the peppermint tray
brought me here
for some sick promise of a heaven
brushed back my tears and he said girl
we're on the dark side of the sun
and soon you were drifting away
some wait and pray and scan the horizon
water cleans the system
pacify your emptiness
acid head
but johnny is no more
in the bloodiest battles of our nations history
known from the dead that washed ashore
escape the sonar the bathyscaphe
then you can enter into grace
i know your defense is to say god said dominate them
forced to take drugs we've made
the truth is they can see but not as good as you and me
this is why i am the way that i am
nobody's fault but yours
please excuse me for yelling
of shrieking sounds that evoke the legions of hell
he said they're simply notes put together in bars
to me it's two hundred beats per minute
you stopped playing father
i'm sorry for annoying you
but i'll get up
you're the only one
no morning cup of coffee
for supremacy
you wear your poker face
the past is just that
its not the wieght of the stone that's holding you down
x marks the spot at 145 a stone dislodged held him fast
the beast that held him was a 10 pound stone
we're being trained
would mute cries fall on deafened ears
feeling numb
if i cant face the consequences of my actions
i crank the knife with another
is it joan of arc revisited
with emotional rigormortis freezing your step
the wildlife still hear it crashing down
thousand acres a day
you were gone before we even knew you
and there's no way to ever get you back
it matters not who is guilty who is innocent
bind the ropes set the horses afoot
without this shadow my life would shine
drop the platform brings an end to my crimes
an alibi is what i need
indulgence by proxy a broken rope of seven
with holy tongue of fire the commandments were cast
then only then can you truly be free
what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his
as scaled wings erupt in brilliant colors spectrum's view
from the world's first dividing cell to the loneliest quarters of hell
flesh and blood though we are not
i promise i will do my best for you
nigh does the master
the iguanidae sees east and west simultaneously
spiritual migraines still persist
sleight of hand slight of mind
with our judgement and mind polluted
too white too foreign too smart too boring
imparts to those he calls his own
to pain beyond compare
spiritual death kicks off its swan song
subdural detour shuns the embrace of logic and reason
blind cavefish inbred victim of ocular atrophy
avoiding the vital confession
'he's coming back' isnt forever
it's about time you put away your finger
out of the anguish the quiet voice is mesmerizing
when sorrow has it's grip on you
three feet more
god's got a funny sense of humor
when you put away bitterness
burn me twice
inability within
boasting set adrift
christ alone completed me
lifes only what you see
there was a rich ruler
if we walk in the light
was i there
worried smiles across the room
is like the man who gazed into the mirror
just to be down with the foe i cant understand a coward giving
or maybe you dont you never knew
so go ahead friend open up the door
the consequence of diligence
i realize i aint all dat
under the carpet sweep your dirt
swarms to bless them
swarms that we cant see
korah could not see divine authority
by words you'll die
the ungainly truncated form of the docile pipsisewah
torment no more
the emaciated figure
skeezix reposes high on a knotty forest crag
that's what you have to do
when you walk through the door
reminded me of what i'd done
cant you hear the beating
complete isolation
pronunce you clean
heal you let him will you
you're gonna lose
that you dont need religion
to the religious
and lead me to the well of life
now given to the manifold miseries of mortal dismay
wisdom calls from these halls
is contingent on being blessed
so he can take it
detested and forsaken by family and friends
rewarded for his faithfulness
answer me
cant you see how holy my exterior appears
have you noticed sin i lack odometer has been turned back
when pressures come that doesnt fly
and the holidays they come and they go
as we lock our priceless heritage away
shrouded in a mystery
chinese water torture cell
dollars for happiness that's what the world tells us
be made
body infested with debilitating proteus strain
body starts to shake in violent burning rigors
then you must acquire this toy
but make sure you can see through
a land of tears and sadness
death to things
or that is christ himself
when all of the answers
ohh that's what i need
god's grace will be torn
and that's what it's there for
so proud to tell us how it goes
our calling should be heard
your world of black and white is surreal
i could do it in my sleep
do anything be anyone
had to have more more more
shut the world outside and rot inside my headphones
good enough for them is
the same way their vow was now
a weakness that severed your power divine
the coiling is fast
the coiling is fast
surprised by such an evil thought
so aimlessly i search around with no answer to be found
when you think that you've arrived thousands more you have to drive
the father above has been glorified
the check's in the mail
can you tell that it's me
summons the priest
unavoidable laryngectomy
set in motion human course
to the devil she will hold to the end
no more
virgin bride the holy blood justified
ever flowing and all knowing
ever flowing and all knowing
would i hide in shame or would i laugh out loud
he was the sacrifice the lamb
all the blood and the sweat on his brow
i wait and wait and wait and wait but nothing good happens for me
the next time you are quick to say i'm just waitin on the lord
who can take away the pain
the horrors of night seem twice as harsh in the day
and hanging plants mournfully wilt and waste away
years of hateful thoughts will get you back
but the way your raging words and actions
broken before the one who understands
through myriad eons of lost time
and i will give you rest for your soul
just another day the dead half a million lay
has his dignity completly destroyed
all you got to do is pick up your telephone
but if i'm just a little bit late
now that you're tired of pretending
when i think of you i'll remember
that's a bad way of saying goodbye
i aint been around the world
thought i'd been moved
no there
no other woman
the only stampede that he's ever seen
he aint right for you
all hat and no cattle aint gonna get it done
that's all i ask for any more
let 'em outlive me by a hundred years
trust someone again
and there was you
that it could make up for the lies and wasted years
and i'm proud to be on this peaceful peice of property
and it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels and saluted me
across the lawn up the stairs
i've been away way too long
they'll be burning all night long yeah yeah
oh i couldnt wait to get here
i talked my way
me and my no brain
pretty quick
anyhow
you and me alone darlin doing what we do best
well they can boogie woogie all night long
big time we're gonna grab some
troubled soul all alone
all your heartache and frustration
but if you need a place to land
maybe love is what we'll find
feels like i'm doin somethin
'cause girl my desire might make you mine
feels like i'm doin something
can i want your love
chrome get her leg up high
her favorite color is chrome
maybe you were right maybe i was wrong
make it better after the fact
come home come home
at least i aint seen 'em yet
or even give you cause to doubt
though i had to let you go
now i know how much i have to give
well boys i hate to leave good company
and all day long she's been there alone
right now her arms are open the house is probably smokin`
it should have cut me right in two
if youre tellin me thats just how it is
that moves me that proves to me im still alive
repeat chorus
chorus
i wish it was me and i wish it was you
i wish it was you
chorus
before the bad blood and busted radio
mile marker 215
if i fall you're goin` with me
with a woman like you
if i fall
i've got to get back to the farm
am i gettin used to these lunatics who cant discern between friction and fact
it dont get much better than that
give me some more of that hee haw
dont worry darling
i'll be there for you
but i guess i didnt do much right
you were wrong
but when you said someday that
this gettin up early pullin double shifts
but i keep on tryin
never do anything you might regret
there's always a mountain in front of me
but all i can do is all i can do
the random blend of time and place circumstance
that only angels in our hearts can understand
she grew up in the city in a little subdivision
blaring charlie daniels yelling turn it up
blaring hank jr yelling turn it up
ladies love country boys
lonely
on a dark night
it lives on
wont leave me alone
'cause if the sun never rises i wanna go down in flames
'cause if the sun never rises i wanna go down in flames
both police cars came but i got away
says we're gonna need more space i said i know just the place
that i need to fix back in metropolis
another back breaking typical day
but until i'm home with you again
that ol whistle starts screaming again
all i want all i need all the time is
there's no doubt about it i cant live without it
too strong to resist
sounds like a beautiful place to be
but i believe there is a place
my heaven is where i am now on the front porch of the wood frame house
and i realize as i look back that
and feel every single prayer she says for me
go out there and do your family proud son
they were just making sure that i
tappin on the dash with her bare feet
when i happened to see my whole world drive away
she was doin eighty five in tennessee
nothin but leavin goin on
all the tender times
you creep into my dreams
and i would't start this story
no i wouldnt start this story
and one two drawer nightsand
how i got where i am
so i hit the hotel bar with her
that picture and my wedding band
when you just know
just you and me
the sweet anticipations too strong
you move me
i need another one of thoe nights baby
that i let cross my mind
that i let cross my mind
primer and rust all over the door
i'll rock you steady

the way i feel about you girl i wanna just
moonlight falls across your skin
cant help myself i gotta
wishin it could be like it was before
red taillights fade out of sight
she dont look back she's seen enough
so i guess you're curious just what became of her well
jills in arkansas with husband number two
with a red ribbon in her hair
workin at the dairy queen
on the refrigerator
without a prayer i'll ever find someone like her again
she didnt leave me a chance in helllike a snowball in el paso
darrell scott
then i'll be on my way
then i'll be on my way my way
i will break this heart of clay
a little rock and a little blues
yeah they're all just
i saw him he was standing there
songs about me
songs about me
it's right there across that mason dixon line
and hey y'all drawls melt you like butter
bama belles set hearts pumpin

yeah amen son
hold on now where you goin

solo
goin goin goin gone
i'm a thankful man for every turn
she taught me about the lessons in life
oh it's better than i could have planned
he lost his job that mornin stopped off and bought a fifth of pride
it serves as a reminder that the man she left behind her just couldnt change
trace adkinskenny beard
but i swear i'll love you for the rest of mine
but i dont care
my great granddaddy's son
you said the good lord's work
but you keep fightin on
my great granddaddy's son
mississippi sunset

makin us scream makin us sweat
i was still a boy

where i sleep
and we're still through
on the floor beside our bed

as big as your dreams
deep as a river in a raging flood
and sometimes it's the old cold shoulder
but she can be so bad
oh you cant have one without the other brother
oh you cant have one without the other brother
i wondered why
now i'm her man and she's my girl and we're livin on the farm
she had a big ol hat and big blue eyes and blond curls
call me crazy but when the choice was mine
between drag racin cane raisin girl chasin
repeat chorus
dont love make a diamond shine
that looks cheaper than a cracker jack prize
with three little words it'll knock you blind
kostasmelba montgomery
she's finally made you break
try real hard to forget her
it's gonna take time but i know you'll do it
dont take her she's all i've got
i'm beggin you friend
i'm beggin you friend
i cant say looking back right now just where our love went wrong
worked real hard most of his life till the pushin came to shove
you're goin crazy over him i see the signs
driving me out of your mind
driving me out of your mind
just when i think i can
i say i'll forget her
but every time i do
no i shouldnt get the blues when i think of you
can love you as good as me
it just comes naturally
its an everyday battle
getting me over mountains with her lovethere are days i wanna give up
i dont know how but she makes it look easy
i want a well made out of style
if the heart's been broken
good ol fashioned love
have just gone up in smoke
to try and make you love me
and make you want me near
but now there's tears each time i hear that cheerful goodbye
they've all forgotten what it means to lend a hand or cry on a shoulder
but the only time i'm free is when i view the heaven in my womans eyes
now all my dreams are comin true
do they have a way to count the stars
pay the bills and feed the kids
dont ask meask that couple in the waiting room
how much does the world weigh
let's forget who's right or wrong
i dont believe that you dont love me
why would i leave goodbye open ended
you're breakin my heart not the law
just because you havent seen me
the good times never end
even though ive settled down
without leavin the house
but now i find i cant keep from wishin
i wanna feel that way again
feel your breath upon my skin
chokin the life from me
so dont insist on standin in my way
there's a half a tank of freedom in my chevy and i'm leavin
livin with the crazzies and the old wildcats
we love ya like sunday treat ya like saturday night
were from the country
tryin to provide the best for the kids and me
cause if we are you need to realize
this is not about not loving cant you see what's goin on
one by one i tucked 'em in and kissed 'em on the cheek
heaven knows they're worth the sacrifice
you need a man with a tender touch
you need a man wholl walk the line
if thats what you need to do
english version
find a way to mess it up
this chemistry between us feels so wonderful
just let me be in love
anyone can see that shes too good for me
forget the future disregard the past
este amor entre los dos es magnifico
they wanna do a story 'bout me and you
they wanna see my fairlane up on blocks
lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
i'm talkin 'bout lifestyles of the not so rich and famous lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
i might lose the battle
when i zeroed in on love
yeah love you done all you can do to me
yeah love you done all you can do to me
and if you're so inclined
i wanna take love lessons baby from you
you cant ask too much
is to be neededi know this aint easy
wrong with the world right now
and when i build trust
well he did it too late
it's made to last
if you let me fix your heart
rodeo aint no ordinary life
he's got a gold buckle on his mind
but nothing ever seemed to fit
the feel of leather in his hand
its nice but it just wont ever quite be the same
oh i got a new life but i still like the old one better
just where she stands in this crazy game he plays
on again off againshe aint gettin any younger
one day they're flyin high
this on again off again
blue collar heaven domestic bliss
blue collar heaven domestic bliss
it just doesnt get any better than this
she puts coffee on
a girl like her fell
oh but i'm gonna do my best
she puts coffee on
on the back of a piece of paper
beside me on the seat i was looking at five small fingers
you can reach out to me anytime
would you reach out to me one more time
and he'd walk around
they didnt cost a dime
but her heart longs for those yesterdays
they could still put a smile on her face
they had big plans they had no doubts but then the bottom fell out
somebody's world gone up in smoke
man across the counters thinkin what price tag he'll put on
and never find another you
i will follow you to the end of the earth for my place will be with you i have taken you for better or worse someone to give my love to
well goodness gracious what's that i see
lord have mercy here she comes
i need something to brag about
1st chorus
baseball hot dogs apple pies2nd chorus
you can settle down in mexico
it doesnt really matter if you wanna rock or roll
just take me with you when you go
i walked in the band just stunk
and i revealed to her my two left feet
and after round seven or was it eight
three rounds with jose cuervo
swing me 'round that hardwood floor
i'm here to dance and nothing more
heavens smilin down on me
it takes my breath away
thanks to the keeper of the stars
somethin that i havent learned to do
you said id be fine but you were lyin
since i told her i could not stay
for leavin tucson too soon
undo the right
undo the right
i've done my share of walkin out
i'll be a better man for where i've been
i'm back to stay to the lovin end
i've been called an old tomcat
he'd live to see the day
walkin the line
i'd spend all my time
girl i might as well be
you said you'd always be my cowgirl
i'll be stickin out my thumb
and walkin
rind county watermelon festival ahead
let me show you something that you aint never seen
if you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl
have fun you all
so daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight
as cold as december
when mama aint happy aint nobody happy
and the pony she named wildfire
and on wildfire were both gonna go
you touched my cheek and told me not to cry
and you told me this pain was not the kind to last
a different one for every day
and dream about what i had before
well you never know just how good you've got it
i'm on a white line runnin down the interstate
and you wont see me when i start fallin
and i cried a river cried a mile wide one
she knows every move that a man could make
boy you can bet if a move can be made
you've never seen me cry and carry on
i'm gonna cry out loud
everything she does i somehow justify
like a frightened runaway child i always return
i caught a tear as she slipped off to sleep

i'm about as lonesome as it gets
it would't be enough to numb this hurt i feel
it's a crying shame what fools we've been

i'd give anything if you loved me
and there's alot of good memories in my way
a better man
lose our heads and gamble with our hearts
aw cause we aint perfect yet
i never felt as helpless as i do today
if i could lord knows i would spin back the hands of time
take a second look at what we had
we could walk barefoot
and another woman twenty seconds to have him crawlin again
first he said he loved you he promised you he'd be true
even though he hurt you he's still the one you want
no milk today
no milk today it wasnt always so
how could they know just what this message means
no milk today my love has gone away
but all that's left is a place dark and lonely
but sitting here it just occurred to me
and turned away from those tears in her eyes
lately i've been seeing a certain glow upon your face
you're tearing me apart with everything that you dont say
chorus
running eighty miles an hour in a thirty mile zone
i got a rock it i cant stop it
what can i say i'm an exciteable boy
it was where i first got up the nerve to steal me my first kiss
as lightening bugs and crickets danced in the evening air
wish i had a way to let you know
'til it came undone from what i didnt do
her eyes blue as diamonds her hair black as coal
your love held strong
there it was on my machine

oh is that a tear
and stealin thoughts of holdin you has been my only crime
taking off in the pouring rain
it could be a good thing
its all how you look at it
its all how you look at it
from this ear to ear grin on my face to this feeling that makes my heart race
in the middle of those running years she walked into my life
there was nowhere left to turn to but back to my old self
we aint in no hurry
and your doubts about me
give into your desire
as daddy showed me wrong from right
granddaddy was a man i loved
they dont go away and they dont come cheap
it's time to get lazy had enough crazy
this makin a livin is killin me
lay in the snow white sand
i'm dreamin in color livin in black and white
lonely like the way you left me
he has sentenced himself to life
if i was nearin the end
some they are drawn to gold
to see the look that's in your eyes makes the tears well up in mine
eternity cant you see
it ended when she said your second home just became your first
i dont have to mow no lawn
i said dont' worry baby it'll be alright
our california dreams went south
with every stroke he brought to life
for a while she'll be mine again
a little house on the edge of town
put her there in the front yard swing
got new tires and a good cb
but i got a cousin that i want you to meet
i want to show you the riviera
but i got a cousin that i want you to meet
always clinging to some old star
they'll take any wrong direction
but they'll be raising hell till then
yea i'm always runnin i'm always runnin behind
watch the world go by while i unwind
and you know i'm always saying i'm sorry
but the boss says little brother got the call
somebody paints the wall
chorus
how could i have been so wrong
the day that i left home
so i went crashing at the speed of a fool
lord i cant help what i'm not
girl my hearts on my sleeve
darling i'll hang the moon for you
little baby boy sittin round his toys
a teenage boy in a rented tux
to be afraid
stands and says his name
this material life with all it's value
but the words you said just tore my heart in two
these sticks and stones may break me
along this winding road we're on
we'll have children they'll have children
birth stones stepping stones
one by one they mark our passage
she looks so fragile looks so so soft
yeah so strong
she gets down
yeah so strong

but i look at you and then
i dont guess we had enough sense least that's what some folks said
yeah folks round here still dont know who that was that was us
chorus
guess my poor heart dont want to play the hand that it's been dealt
a room with a view
that week we spent in the santa belle sun
you look at me as if you see a worthless man
dont let what you think you know throw you off course
and broke our sacred trust
i dont know which hurts the most
tag
for the evil that men do
their new connection
i'm flyin a fighter jet up to the stars
daddy's drinking beer listening to the radio
the south moves north the north moves south
time marches on time marches on
yesterday a jealous man
instead of gettin mean and loud
i've gotta stop your love from dying
he and norma jean painted that town
he's forgiven
yeah i'm a little tired i'm a little wired
but i've been up all night
never went quite as far as loving you blind
i've been up all night
we dont touch the way we used and it's breaking my heart
on the day mama died she called daddy to her side
what a memory oh what a memory
what a memory
and a hard road back
i know temtation is out their waiting
it's a long way down
but while you sleep
i'll let you know my dear
broke the chains of ghosts from my past
and i've let go of thinkin
cause she never let it show
from the outside looking in nobody could've known
makes enough to make ends meet
when you reach out your hand and heart
it takes more than having everything
from what we give
well hell just froze over tonite
to a heart that has turned cold as ice
yeah your heart drops and your world stops when you're falling out of love
god made woman on a good day
some like to cook some like to dance
repeat chorus
oh your memory has colored me lonely tonight
steel guitar
chorus
just because you're looking at me
still i'll sit here like a fool
no she doesnt have a clue
he took it hard when she ran off with the beauty supply salesman

he just dont give a damn
she left me on this lost highway
she said she'd stopped awhile in san antone
and a million high line poles
now i'm dealin with a heartache like i've never felt before
while you were thinking of me
that the reason you're long gone
cant stand to live without you
right back to you
with a good ole boy bound for glory
and each and every waitress is divine
i've heard that slamming door too
hope you dont take this wrong
i've still got the scars
oh i never saw that look in your eyes
repeat chorus
and asked where all that money went
he said money dont mean nothing in this game of life
diamond rings and furs swampland in new jersey
it was always me who got his way
what it was that i was fightin for
and even now that's where part of me still lives
i'll let you go but i want you to know
i'm here and you're way out therenow your friends say you did the right thing
but you cant run away from me
or any place that you might be
'saying mama leave the boy alone
you'd a long been dead if you were anybody else
i'm gonna go to heaven but i might be late
they got the jams we'll have some fun
i was once a believer till life got the best of me
bridge
you are the only on in color
you would've come when i was so tightly wound and so full of doubt i'll never tell you that
chorus
chorus
only through the pain i could find a way to learn
you'll need someone to turn to and i will not be there
can you tell
we are shadows on our own
i search for the one who bleeds
so help me take this all away
i reach for
raining softly
without you
will you break me out
to swallow me up
and set me free
dont think i'm pulling through
i was out of addictions by my own admission oh i've been keeping score
bridge
still time to close those eyes
if your secrets cant stay silent
cover up cover up
everybody turn your cameras on
chorus
let me know let me know i'll watch you break it
curiousity kills x3
let the whole thing pass me by
repeating over in my mind
i dont want to be left alone not when i'm right next to you
dont be the one to be alone
who really knows who really knows
chorus
now i see the truth i got a doubt
i know that you are wrong
that's how you play i guess you get through every night
i know i know all about
somewhere in the middle you are now caught
you call upon your blank thoughts as you try
i was so bored with the old life i used to live
the masquerade has
the real you is never shown
pouring down
to get high again
are you under
chorus
now
just this once i found something greater
maybe just this once i found something
find a way to crawl inside to find
that my canvas is incomplete
this cant be everything i see
and my canvas will set me free
carve me from stone
when will i ever know
right to the bone
will the plot ever twist
with the dice ever roll
and i dont need to hear your answer i just need you to see
and how far have we come too far to throw away the past
i've opened up my mind so tell me how to think
free to choose as long as i live your dreams
i want to know who you're running from me or you
chorus
i wonder if it's good enough to make you stay
i know only time can heal scars
i'm ready when you are
anyone forgive
you have my word
i am a repeat offender
i will live with this forever
looks are every thing
with another pretty face
you make your decision
so fill the empty space
skin deep
skin deep
why dont you let me be
i have had enough
you've gone as far as i'll go
after insult 9x
you wanna see a reaction
keep it inside the image portrayed
i found a line and then it grew
our memories so intertwined
i rememberthe way you made me feel when i was with you
you find yourself standing in front of the mirror
so afraid that you'll lose
no one to catch your insecurities
so conversational everytime
your story was always based on fiction
left behind
i commit the crime
i've been here too long and i've spent to much time
and nothing's what it seems
loneliness a ritual
but still you cannot leave
i know that you use me to use you
i've been dying to let you win
i want your eyes on me
it's never easy to forget
i wanna be your new victim
i'm right here
that you wanna go
and i'm waiting for you
anytime i wanted i could show you how i feel
and i've been waiting for you
i'd cross the line if you wanted it
you dont ever ask me why
whats the cost whats the cost
i dont belong
simple mind
it doesnt matter what we say my own wasteland
i'm already gonne
how will this be when all is said and done will i know where i'm from remember me
we have nothing left
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll be wherever she goes ever she goes
and when you cant hear a sound will the silence drown you too
so many things you couldnt let me know
it's getting harder to sit here alone
high heel shoes short skirt with her shoulders bare
but i thank heaven every chance i can
yes you gotta love the lord for makin girls like that
she had me stoppin at a quick mart before we made it out of town next thing
and its a long way to richmond rollin up on 95 with a sherriff right beside
'cause there's no one else i swear holds a candle anywhere next to you
i was dealin up and down the highway
i broke out of jail this mornin
he said a man fell over my razor
and my back is up against the wall
and my back is up against the wall
now some people think i'm a loser
i always thought we'd do
girl i know just how lucky i am
had a body that was made for sin
what a chance they were takin when they first started breakin
someone said they went to vegas back home it didnt take us long
with the lord and the bible belt
i bust my bottom every day eight to five
we live a life rich folks could never understand
so before we go much further girl can i trust you with my heart
chorus
in the parkin loti said it's mighty hot
i shoot a mighty mean game of pool
chorus 2 x's
if you knew the question
oh i'll be tormented forever
that burns in my mind
well i handed you a lie and now i'm sorry
yeah dont you give your heart to a rambler little girl
guess what i heard out on the street
i'm sorry pal i didnt know
she had double trouble coming down
paul kennerleymarty stuart
feel i'm going down
if you keep draggin my heart aroundi believe i'm slowly sinking
i sit here surrounded by people and lights
and wish for our future on a faraway star
chorus
turn out the lights the competitions over
and more than just a lover can provide
and there is nothing i wont do for you
knowing what it's like to feel
travis tritt
that i love you more than you'll ever know
that i love you more than you'll ever know
yeah
no more filling up my tomorrows
i swear i heard those shackles snap
no more lookin over my shoulder
traveled all around the nation
and there's no one but myself left to accuse
and there aint no vacation
and if she's wondering how i'm doing
i thought i'd be just fine without her
travis tritt
and we must all adjust
'cause they dont do no good
have corroded into rust
and i've still got some loyal fans
that's the first time i heard waylon and old bocephus sing
we played some shows in atlanta on sunday afternoons
when the music gets you dancin
i still love old country
settlin down never crossed my mind
yeah i can hold my own i'm the restless kind
rough and rowdy restless kind
and every hair on my head aint in its place
i'm a little rough around the edges but i think i'm exactly what you need
the man my mirror is showing me
but by far the biggest curse of being left alone
and my feelings on my sleeve
been black and blue a time or two
she turns heads in every club
she dont want nobody else
so listen good now fellas
that girls is my best friend
as i walk down this road the rain is just starting to fall
will there ever be someone for me
jum mcbride stewart harris
practiced his law out on the street
would ct him like a switch blade to his soulrepeat chorus
repeat chorus
come on baby drive it home
there's somethin more
start the car we gotta move
whoa
there was a time i thought my love would set you free
tell me why do i go on believing your lies
mercy look what just walked through that door
cause mama never told me 'bout nothin like y o u
hey say hey good l double o k i n g
wiped the sleep from my eyes
i hope things arent what they seem
but i'll find a bar
well i start to feel like superman
in this town
i'd have one more
'cause in my mind peace i'd find when they'd start to pour
so somebody ran out
so if you're ready for love
i've been around a time or two
i'm so glad you found me
i kept thinkin that she loved me
of that old grey house where i was born and raised
when he looked up
where corn dont growi remember feeling guilty
no matter where you go
'cause to think that you'd walk out on me
i guess i should have listened
well that's just wishful thinking on my part
chorus
but deep in the back of our minds
another day on highway 41
but i finally found one thing that's free
repeat chorus
chorus
and i'll pay any price it takes to keep you
do you ever cross my mind
that's a lonely bridge to cross
oh and it might be a sin
who's helping me get over you
maybe one of your sordid affairs
guitars ring in the dead of night sing so blue sound so right
in the darkness down the hall black light posters on the wall
homesick lord for home sweet home the boy's homesick
how could i have been such a fool
what goes around comes back they say
and then run back to my arms where you belong
i've looked at all the pictures from our good times
with the brokenhearted grieving
like a fish out of water a dreamer without a dream
so as long as you're beside me
you can always see the dawn
i'm all the man i'll ever need to be
but late at night you could hear him say
i'm gonna be somebody
i'm gonna be somebody someday
i got rice cooking in the microwave
there's some hard times in the neighborhood
and it's a great day to be alive
might even grow me a fu man chu
what made you think i'd let you
i once believed you cared for me boy was i ever wrong
for a big disappointment when my paycheck comes
but i cant swing the payments on a double wide
i reckon that's a lesson i wont have to learn
lord i'm just livin on borrowed time
starting now i'm looking out for number one
he tells me every day it's getting clearer
and everywhere i look i see temptation
them politicians treat me like a mushroom
oh they're billing me for killing me
verse 1
verse 2
but that's ok cause he's still her hero
if that's what you must do
but a lover is forever
but a lover is forever
an act of kindness a tender smile
for each and every bell that rings
another angel it's a wonderful life
an now i'm feelin the wind blow i've never been so high
baby dont you let go now
put your hand to the plow
baby dont you let go baby dont you let go
and if there's any way if there's any way
believe me baby i lied
if you were out of sight and out of mind
that was my wounded pride
and all the tears in the world wont help you now
better your heart than mine
you broke my heart in two
all i want is you tonight
i'd rather have i love you
bring me all your lovin
bring me all your lovin
come back when it aint rainin on you
come back when it aint rainin on you
talk like an angel talk like an angel
walk like an angel
you look like an angel look like an angel
oh yes you are
making you stay
down on my knees
i'd be down on my knees
she knows a nice young man
everybody knows what to do about my misery
but i cant even walk down the street
but it was all
it's some reward for all our time
but in my darkness
but like a compass you were there to point the way
follow the winds into tomorrow tomorrow
i trust where it leads me
why you would turn from love and run
just let the phone ring now isnt that strange
and it makes me happy
late at night i write my own movies
i didnt think about you
it's a start
and thank the lord that you are mine
for reasons i've forgotten now
seein the fool i was
damn the pride that makes me want
yeah this is a perfect love
see what kinda fun we can make
we're not tryin to make history
i met that cat in a two bit juke joint
tell your mama dont know what happened
well i keep fallin for all them bad boys
instrumental break
i've never seen two people in my life
it's a powerful thing
well it's out of our hands
make the angels sing
it can open up the heavens
i dont buy the lines in magazines
and this old town may be as far as i'm goin
this real live woman
cause i'm a real live woman
and shouted oh dasher and dancer
boarded his sleigh and then yelled lets go
i told myself i'd stay away
well i thought i saw love's reflection
instrumental break
well you pull me under
for a while i've been watching you steady
dont worry darlin it'll slip your mind
sad eyes never lie
got no sack on my back
put out the light
and offers your heart a chance to move on
then out of the blue you meet someone
reach for the moment
you look so careless when they're shooting that bull
there's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
the boys say when is he gonna give us some room
her daddy says he aint worth a lick
parked in the very last row
she'd follow tommy anywhere
but mama breaks in says dont lose your temper
she's in love with the boy
and curse or blessing i'm here confessing
if you see dark skies in my sad eyes
and i was in crazy motion
it's apt to confuse me
to get next to me
something so right
well it's likely to lose me
guess you're not checking your message machine
you got me working around the clock
i've got a gourmet meal soft music and candlelight
you got me working around the clock
honey trying to figure you out
you feel like you dont belong
i cant see the grace in it
by standing out in the crowd
standing out in a crowd standing out
they made you be born in a manguh manger
sweet little jesus boy
ceilin fan stirrin up the heat of the afternoon
my pretty new blue blue dress oh yes
it aint the catchin it's the reachin
mmm mmm mmm sweet
every soul has a need for peace
merchants counting down the shopping days
take a walk through bethlehem
but this town has ears and this town has eyes
throw me out a lifeline baby
just needed some room to clear your mind
that's what i like about you
that's what i like about you
that's what i like about you
he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and my love was waiting there for me
and i've heard the lonesome whippoorwill
rode in limousines with the tops rolled down
just as sure as i leave honey i'll be back
it was like a dam had broken in my heart
we were up above the clouds
it was just around the bend
you would think i havent gotten very far
for even if the whole world has forgotten
a parole or pardon free
you can remember
brought no gold
but as you walk the road remember who you are
to keep believing in your dreams
yes and i have learned some lessons on my own
i can see you turn away
'cause that hurt in your eyes
that you say
if there are sorrows that bring back a tear
i already made a vow
you must be talking to
there goes my baby
is all that i deserve
right here by my side
now that i finally see
i've been thinkin about you
in the back of my mind there's a secret place
i left home with nothing but a few tears in my eyes
and keep me drivin drivin
more times than in
till i get it right
you made me love you so bad
you made me love you so bad
i'd do it again
and i looked in your window
they're so cynical and bitter
my hands are tied
but i dont believe you believe you can ever get by me
when you count up the odds there's still no guarantee
the day that i began
i've watched myself get stuck
i've screamed your name i've slammed a thousand doors tryin to love you
some people dream about streets paved with gold
from the sky
everybody's lookin for higher ground
the world is spinning around and around
just tryin to find a flame
as a victim of the game
in the shadow of the shame
at a victim of the game
and that boy's just
underneath the texaco star
he's a wrong kinda paradise
born to be a leaver
now that we're alone
till the whole world cries
flowers grew in winter time
in the world we knew
well i'm good one of a kind
most every night on
nothing but you
but i miss talking with you
i'd make your every wish come true
then you can follow me
where your road leads
i will follow
an made the car that took him away
and pain i've been feelin
for all of this heartache
what can i do to get back to you
nights i cant sleep my tears are cheap
makin me wild for you baby
and tonight he wont be coming home
when she goes out to walk the line
i sigh when you kiss me
wouldnt any woman
now i'm leavin with what's left
i've been living on the wrong side of memphis
a full tank of gas and a '69 tempest
she's an american girl
she's an american girl
she's an american girl
and baby you can sleep while i drive
oh is it other arms you want to hold you
the one that's up above me sounds so blue and clear
well i heard some conversation that i was not supposed to hear
just show me the way around it
and sometimes we may falter
and even though i know that all too well
so i give you every little thing you choose
i'm not alone now alone now
my baby you're where i belong
you're where i belong
you're where i belong
never gettin out of control never hanging it out
sensible predictable and strong
it makes a heart real hard to find
i want to roll those dice
and when i set my spirit free
take a chance
i want to roll those dice
i would've loved you anyway
i would've loved you anyway
i'd do it all the same
ought to be enough to see me through
if i aint got you
but it dont mean nothing
no it dont mean nothing
but you'd be wrong
and i'll tell you i would do anything
than anyone's ever been loved before
i'll give you so much back you'll see
more than anybody
well it seems these days
i'm the kind of girl that never fails
sorry baby i guess i lied
sorry baby i guess i lied
in another's eyes
they dont realize
and it's a blessing and a curse that love is blind
in another's eyes
i'm waiting for you there aint no one else
what makes you laugh what makes you cry
i wanna dig down deep i wanna loose some sleep
he knelt by her
and i believe he did his best
it wasnt his child
he was her man
everybody comin up once in a while
well you get the shade baby i'll get the lights
i'm plannin on doin it a whole lot more
but the fire is so delightful
all the way home i'll be warm
my career is slowly dying
tonight let's close the door
let's keep hangin on
dont be afraid to close your eyes
and if you feel the weight of the world
it's never easy to keep all the promises you make
i hear a lonesome dove off in the distance
and that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
we held the greatest expectations
you went your way and i went mine
and all the laughter and the pain
on love alone
the fire in me blew out
silhouetted cross its face
just call it quits if you cant commit
baby just love me or leave me alone
baby just love me or leave me alone
it's gone gone gone
i put on a real good show
but it did
while i stand on sacred ground
and you would be here soon
i told the starry sky to wait for you
everybody's heart aches
maybe it's love
so i turned myself to ice and stone
maybe it's love i miss
i'm tearing down the walls inside
saw a wino on the corner gave my winnings back
got a job in california they sure like my style
now and then i go back to biloxi
and the dogs wouldnt leave us alone
his chickens might fall to the fox
when evening fell i heard a strange sell
swim to the nearest distant shore
you're trapped between his lies and the great unknown
every heart for itself
a second chance
and i'll take you into my arms
it's down the track aint lookin back
a brand new day wash those tears away
when you hear my tires squeal
then it'll be oh lonesome you
with the snow falling down around you
in a church in downtown new orleans
like a face in the crowd
if you can truthfully say
and just one time
well that makes one in a row
the georgia rain on the jasper county clay
as the sky fell in an the storm clouds poured
you fixed your daddy's house up nice
i could talk till i'm blue in the face
i need that old friend that i once knew
and i need that man
you came to me like a revelation
i'm amazed by the wonder of you
opened my heart and washed me clean
sent from heaven above
there's a new kid in town
there's a new kid in town
an if it is well i've done my time
how about it
hey i'm tired of this hard luck
do you know how tight i'm holding
promises are like little diamonds
and i'm no angel in disguise
your the best at self defense
you never turn around
your the best at self defense
and she will stay with them till all hope is gone
now from the moment that love comes to call
i was singing when i freed you
now i can no longer keep it
i would finish what you started
when the sun finally rose
so she hitched down the highway
said fix up what's wrong
oh i'm looking at paradise
it's something i cant hide
tempting me with you
if i had to live without you
and i baby i dont know what i would do
how do i how do i
if you ever go
with all those tears i cried
for the reason you dont love me
and i cant understand
you knew you couldnt have
oh but then i learned to cry
i learned to laugh
too strong dont mean it's for long
i cant feel what i dont feel
i dont understand my own heart
it wasnt you it was me
are out the door
and i dont paint myself into corners anymore
are out the door
'cause baby baby
sometimes a moment in time
once you let it out it's done
i'm goin crazy
pretend we've never met
someone who loves me too
i hear the children crying
sad song sad song
you better call out
how longhow longhow long
how long to sing this song
dance with me
shake shake
and and you can go there too
starting a landslide in my ego
what are the feelings
those cars
more lights
twilight breaking through
uh huh
heartbreak hotel
a primitive love
and you hunger for the time
a high road out from here
oh oh ohon borderland we run
tonight
through the rain and fallen snow
you can feel the enemy
and you can dream
yeah i'd break bread and wine
and you can dream
so dream out loud
responsibilities
plowmen dig my earth
because the hour is getting late
there's no reason to get excited
she waits for me to
it was a cold and wet december day
birdland on fifty three
she says it's heartheart and soul
falling to the city in broad daylight
your dreams and on your way
stop shake out
they came my way
i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
we lie
in the freeze frame
to an ordinary guy
babyface babyface
babyface babyface
if you tear yourself in two again
into the night
to let it go
tell you what i would say
condemnation
and so to fade away
you're out of luck
it's a beautiful day
it's a beautiful day
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
reach me
to drown out the other voices
without a change of clothing
new york
religious nuts political fanatics in the stew
to you and your vices
new york
where the jungle shadows fall
and under the sun
i think of you
night and day
night and day
just fine
dont ask
dont piss in the drain
just play another chord
dont change your shape gimme some more
dont shackle
dont spy i feel numb
dont cling
dont expect
dont jerk
dont fence
dont rhyme
dont project
october
we see the sun go down in your eyes
from the ground
we run like a river
raining rainingraining
or do you feel the same
leaves you baby if you
we're one but we're not the same
more than a lot
love a higher law
one life
carry each other
it was so bad
i had the opinion it was out of control
i was of a feeling it was out of control
i see a line of cars
i see my red door
if i look hard enough
oh no not me
and so i sing along
i think i know what you want
i'm sick of the pain
will surely overtake you
whose sons are living in the ground
over the radio
to tell the ones who hear no sound
peace on earth
what have we got to lose
i never did see that movie and i never did read that book
we'll go diving in their pool
you had to win
so you never knew how long you'd stoop to make that call
from the boot of your car
november december remember
one man to overthrow
what more in the name of love
in the name of love
i'd like to be around
ohtell me
see faces frozen still
yeah you leave me holding on
our love runs cold
you're all that's left to hold on to
we wait all day
lovehas seen its better day
but you cant escape
alone in the spotlight
and i'll bring you through
are tumbling down
everything's crazy
i cant change the world
step on a steam train
you got to cry without weeping
with her eyes painted red
still
it's a promise
please
baby dont say no
shake it shake it shake it salome
i love to watch things on tv
i love to watch things on tv
up to the sky
repeat until end
like a thief in the night
fall rise andfall rise and
do they know where the dance comes from
who is it now
but i know oh no
i'll walk home again
hanging from the ceiling
no stars in the black night
broken nose to the floor
they came to collect
mister i aint got nothing
silver and gold
scarlet eyes and a see through heart
no i dont know why a man
slowdancing
dont want to make a mess
dont want to be a pain
my love
ohlovesweetheart
ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
head in heaven fingers in the mire
some days are dry some days are leaky
some days are better than others
taking you to another place
some days you feel ahead
wey hey hey baby hang on to anything
oh than you need me
dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes
summer stretching on the grass summer dresses pass
not the only one who's happy to go blind
afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside
afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside
because when he hurts you you feel alive
and when i touch you you dont feel a thing
london belfast and berlin
three o'clock in the morning
he looked at me like i
and i wish you were here
sleeping on the floor
of anything in this world
carry your own weight
the nights you filled with fireworks
of what you dont really need now
i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
and if our way should falter
oh i cant close my eyes
it puts my back up
sunday bloody sunday
wipe your tears away
and today the millions cry
bright blue eyes
she tried to be a good girl and a good wife
oh the city's afire
die to myself someday
clouds above clouds above
there's a boy i know
take me to the clouds above
toy broken toy
you're spoon fed
i've found me way home
when i'm a brother in need
gave me a cup of gold
for the first time
so i'm telling youchild
all kill their inspiration and sing about their grief
we're falling from the skytonight
there's a lot of things if i could i'd rearrange
it was the ground beneath her feet
let me bring you to where two roads meet
splashes the soul of my shoes
if perfume is an obsession
dont wake her she'll come around
'til the colours come flashing
then will there be no time for sorrow
her mama say one day she's gonna
woah woah
and take her to this promise land
woah woah
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
i wanted to run but she made me crawl
aint love the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
walk 'til you run
walk on through
and if the mountain should crumble
tonight
where the ground wont turn
and sons turn their fathers in
but the thought you'd be there too
a spirit who would not bend or break
yeah i left with nothing
in this love song love
hey hey love wont find
wont you come back tomorrow
dont go to the door
and who was he for
i reallyii wantii
the blind to see
thank you
i just wanna go
t t touching you
the heart is in the place
somebody save me
now i think it's time to get it right
i was calling out
and you wet my lips
angel
in the distance she saw me coming 'round
i'm gonna run to you run to you run to you
around the world
he was tryin to throw his arms around the world
like a fish needs a bicycle
i try to sing this song
ii try to get in
i'd give it to you
ii believe in love
dont believe in cocaine
his type like a curse
you glorify the past
ii believe in love
you had to loose yourself along the way
didnt want it that much anyway
i'm not coming down
and when she walks on the street
she travels outside
between her fingertips
in everything
on the wrong side of town
born and raised
i'm gonna be there
hallelujahhere she comes
i'm gonna be there
hawkmoon
like black coffee
like a phoenix rising needs a holy tree
when the night has no end
i need your love
like a freeway out
see the sun rise over her skin
of the shining cities
like a burning spear
heaven knows this is a heartland
and i see you again
from the theives and you got caught
you're a star
star
you're a star
come on come on come on come on be good to me
looks good on me
come on come on come on come on be good to me
i fall down
you fall down
when i'm falling down
when you fall down
these city walls
it was warm in the night
carried the cross
somebody else
i was walking
going nowhere
be my brother
i was blind i could not see
when they pulled the four walls down
your eyes your eyes
nobody made you do it no one put words in your mouth
it's been a while since we saw that child
does love light up your christmas tree
now it's hard to get in the door
into a glass of water
if you wear that velvet dress
and i got my own hands to pray
in a little while
to sunday on my knees
it's been a little while
slow down my bleeding heart
we need new dreams tonight
we'll punch a hole right through the night
in god's country
i run there towards the light
the spark that set the flame
two rivers run too deep
on this the longest day
boy girl boy girl
sometimes fall behind
a picture or a disco or a roundabout
up and down and all around
i'd like some freedom
into the heart of a child
on new year's day
we can be one
though i want to be with you
sometimes i dont let go
stories for boysstories for boys
i look into his eyes
twilight cant find my way
twilightlost my way
in the shadow boy meets man
but if i'm a fool for you
two hearts beat as one
i'll leave that to you
oh yeah
i said dont stop the dance
and the day is as dark as the night is long
there is a silence that comes to a house
ultraviolet
hanging over my bed
baby baby babylight my way
lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea
love god speed your love to me
i spiked your drink
but my sorrows they learned to swim
for to face van diemens land
'til this hour has gone around
wake up wake up dead man
listen over the rhythm that's confusing you
did you think to try and warn her
that you can bring
walk on
you could have flown away
walk on
if you never had one
leave it behind
all that you care
she said it wasnt cold
turned left onto the north strand
your legs were crossed
a room in the wild town
let me
so clear and so true
when your thoughts are too expensive
when i look at the world
tell me tell me
when love comes to town i'm gonna catch that flame
that was the day before love came to town
when love comes to town i'm gonna catch that train
did you crack it
where did it all go wrong
did you walk
did you warm it
when the weather's getting warm
you walk on by
i want to tear down the walls
where the streets have no name
we're beaten and blown by the wind
and when i go there
oh when i go there
you're a piece of glass left there on the beach
and you killed it 'cause i wanted revenge
oh the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
dont turn around and dont look back
i was a monkey
did i know you even then
yeah just blowing in the breeze
but is there sweetness at all
wild wild wild
call me
here we are again now place your bets
that's right just keep me going
i give you hope
at each other
where we were still
see the thorn twist in your side
with or without you
my body bruised she's got me with
i cant live
in your blue room
see the future just hanging there
saw me calling
so much fun to me
no cellular phone
i'm ready for the push
i'm ready for the shuffle
it's alright it's alright
that's alrightzoo station
zooropait could be yours tonight
no reasons to get back
let's go to the overground
i hear voices ridiculous voices
see it driving nails
jacob wrestled the angel
this guy comes up to me
you take the staircase to the first floor
into the arms
they're rining a song
baby please come home
baby please come home
you know everyone in the world
when you see daddy coming
he gives you the keys to a flamin car
repeat and fade until end
some strange music drags me in
headed for a spin
i'm dancing barefoot
thirteen years old sweet as rose
door is closed behind me now
you cant return to the place you never left
deep in the heart
over the counter with a shotgun
oh sister i cant let you go
and you dont know the half of it
what i'm trying to forget
a work that's never done
i'm in you
you know what that is but you still want some
the song that you hear in your head
but you know you're somwhere else instead
discotheque
if you can tie me down
do you feel loved do you feel loved
do you feel loved
you got my shoelaces undone
take this tangle of a conversation
but it feels like the rain
do you feel loved
take my hand
i'll cross the sky for your love
his love will last
with wings like eagles
the sea it swells like a sore head and the night it is aching
electrical storm
i know that's not enough
to love and only love
i've got no self control
maybe you can educate my mind
you make me feel like i can fly
going down excavation
elvis
had his own aircraft
elvis
elvis
elvis
the white nigger
stamps
christ
elvis
and i believe in you
like no one told you to
but you feel like sentimental
where you were going where to
to let go
so let me in your heart
and you dont
tonight
you say go you live
give me one more chance
yeah the real thing
give me one last dance
take me higher
hearts gone astray
then you'll realize
everlasting love
welcome love we once knew
whatever love went wrong
need you by my side
you know he went astray
at the howling wind
hand in the pocket
can also pull down
falling falling
falling falling
there's a fire inside
it aint me it aint me
some folks inherit star spangled eyes
it aint me it aint me
singing this song makes me pale
i have got you under my skin
that i've got you under my skin
wake up to reality
it repeats and it shouts in my ear
something
you need some protection
which way the wind will blow
a man who sees
not so much i couldnt taste it
figure of eight
la la la la la la la la la la la
what i'm talking about
bur she thinks we're better off that way
she's at a bus stop with the news of the world
the world turns and we get dizzy
you got to give it away
but never in the daylight
to colour in the cold grey night
and i feel
with banks and cathedrals
when we look for something other
a man captures colour she's your destination
like the words i have to bring
exactly who are you
too right to be wrong in this rebel song
and if you cant help yourself
you find your own way
love comes tumbling down again
around me
love is clockworks
oh my love
all the secrets
blindness
they ask me to reveal
i see my reflection pass
love rescue me
i said love oh my love
the future is here at last
heysister love
she is the big wheel
hold on to love
not because i need you
surgery in the air
big girl with the sweet tooth
got the car and the car chase
i said you looked like a madonna
is there a time for keeping your head down
is there a time to walk for cover
here she comes
come fiume
you'll come to me
bono
passes rain
passes rain
white dpoes on punk staring into the flash
still looking for the face i had before the world was made
around each other
stretched over black and blue
you've been running away
johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
it's alright it's alright it's alright
you could standthere
she moves with it
he said i got a little story tell me what you think
and all the sinners were gathered in white
breathing eloquent
always draw the line
i always keep a watch on the ever changing future
never gonna slip cause i never lose the ground
chorus x2
i always hear the school bell ring
pray by the candle and i hope to see light
can you see me walking through the trees
and now it seems it's been a while since anyone smiled
so it's time to leave our home
i'm infected by the lies that made me colder
and i'm here to free you
come tomorrow break it right down to the place you were before
you're going down again tonight

chorus

the sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes
but the words didnt come easily
but there's one thing that wont change
through the four winds blown and gone
my daddy wasnt much of nothin
in the hills of caroline
i fall to pieces and on the wings of a dove
he's walkin hand in hand in hand with god's only son
a secret that sure makes me smile
spend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to rise
im the luckiest guy in the world
there's no way i can picture me without you
it's not too hard to realize
come wash these tears away my friend
well i wont be depressed

she couldnt understand why they were gone
chorus
thrown away and soon forgotten
what a lonely place my world would be
i think i'd just pack up and leaveyou gave me a reason for livin
if i had my way
love will find a way to turn everything around
if there's anything i can do
repeat chorus
the music has ended still you want to dance
we danced in every ballroom down in beaumont
honey i'll take texas everytime
but when the stockings are hung
is there someone new
well i still love you
about tellin me we're through
waitin for the train that was never comin back
jenny laid a penny on the track one day
would you kindly keep it country for me tonight
i dropped straight down on my knees
i know it's hard for you since your mama's been gone
sneak out your bedroom window girl
i'll make your daddy understand
so lets send a prayer
repeat chorus
ill take the little things
weve got everything we needright here in this room
oh i'll answer when you call
all those nights away from home
from hangin out in honkey tonks
you've got my name
little liza jane oh little liza janenow you've heard my story
still leaning on each other
in a hundred years from now
the shyest kiss
its natural as breathing
your hand is warm but your heart is cold
day by day
i cant deny that look in your eyes
i'll think of you each step of the way
and i hope you have all you dream of
and it's left you even more certain
and you're so afraid they wont heal
just take your memory with you when you go
someone to hold me when the cold wind blows
or play the game
we came so close to love back then
we could have been
could top us two
we wont dance no more
well i'm not all that i could be
we wont dance
is there someone you'd turn to as soon as i left
would it mean as much as used to
you know i'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do
repeat chorus
this gift you've given humbles me
and with her lips still warm with lies
should i just stand by
i let her go on
but nobody answers when i call your name
chorus
ive never felt such release
love is the power that makes your heart beat
repeat chorus
and when you smile the world turns upside down
i've got two lovers in my life now
cause a heart only knows what feels right
my heart can finally be true
i wanna be with you
i'm so in love with you
just you baby
and slowly fades away
there's nothing quite as ugly
girl the reason my heart's beating is for you
the love that you have shown is unlike anything i've known
but you trouble's gettin ready to start
i just hate to se eyou wind up with nothing
magick speaks with tongues of fire fortune take my hand
take me where the falcon flies a symphony of steele
tragic in splendor in death you are free
the distance leave it behind there is no meaning when the promises are
that they're through there'll be no mourning the skies are alive a whisper of
death i bring to you seven meanings of our love there'll be no warning the

i hear the voices calling i see the king's return
a blazing presence rips you through and through
blinded by such beauty caught so unaware
the shrouded angels meet his gaze
no more tears or dying on his throne he's shining
anxious weary my mind wracked by fears unnatural i scan the horizon
once so great now lost and cold hungry spirits stalk these halls
the god of fire proclaims it so
no no more from me let actions speak awake
like blood and gasoline
another night on the highway blood and dust in the air
with the blood of the salnts
light years flash before my eyes
dare forces conspire against thee
face to face with fear and death and hate
cry another day
one nation one kingdom one child survives
i'll meet you again through the eyes of our son
fatal beauty innocence
chains of fire the night's alive the dark is burning
oaths made in violence punishment in turn
i'm fallin i'm callin
and the dead will taste a deeper treasure than youth or life
this is it a sin to know can it be death to taste is ignorance your creator's
are we born to live again
i'll never die while the light races over my head
to truth
i'll never die while the light races over my head
i know that you wanna believe
with one judas kiss
seven years spent in torment alone
of the way it might've been
under the hunting wings
chorus
oh i dont need you
earth
slay your clan clouds and furies now fly in the face of despite i take your
earth on earth
chorus
open up your arms i'm coming home
i've felt the tremors of hate
the black sky cries out your name
in the hours of the damned
sidewalk screamin rat race
dont gimme your prayers
jet black black as the night
kingdom of the fearless kingdom of gods
light up the sky light up the world as we run
your're flesh for the worms
kingdom of the fearless kingdom of gods
die die die
after 3 days i will rise again to teach you all
promises you broke woe
it is finished
burning the street's on fire
even death can take an holiday
gunfire up in heaven no religion here
i've lived among the ruins walked among the dead
we walk the desolation hand in hand against the cold
always wanting more
i aint looking for love
i can hear them say
caught in the spell of winter dreams
i will
my name is in the sky
will heaven let you in
swim the seven seas of rage and ruinalive for all eternity
time will make you mine
and the bite of her lip
darlin love is blind
like a ship on the storm
'cause i cant love you
you shed your blood upon the sun
like a snake in rny arms
are you ready cos we're leaving tonight
endyamon on the bridge of hades searching for a sign on the brink of
and i know
endyamon i see my vision i see the line circling onward looking for nine
just died today
oh i never believed in good bye
yes the winter's comin onand i think of all the time
oh i never believed in good bye
a noble stance
chorus
innocent eyes shine down on me
i'm with you now
a union of power your love i will devour
ooh do you know from whence this hunger grows
and the day goes to sleep
i wanna make you mine
they say you're too young to feel
tonight my virgin child come
i will meet you in the sun
tell her that you saw me stand proud
fortune is now waiting like a vulture in the sky
proud rebel thief stealer of fire i never kneel
i am golden my force flies unseen
a river of ice a mountain of fire i'll not reveal the one
return of the hero our conquering king
glory too high is a dangerous gift from the gods
elders elektra
you're the deliverer king unchained
against the hosts of heaven the sun turns black and falls
you will die
chorus
there's fire in your eyes
can ya feel my love
music and lyrics de feis
the fire is cold in the ashes of memory
you you'll try again save yourself
in whiteness descending the souls steals a star
indulge in your passion be quick make haste
immortal no longer we blame you
voice of god
the serpent's to himself
music de feispursino lyrics de feis
chorus
music de feispursino lyrics de feis
heigh ho silver
sex religion machine
it's judgement day babe
aint noone of their business
stay on top never go under
but the good times make you cry
stand up walk away
a glimpse of my power my armor is flame gold i sever the sky
above so it shall be below we invoke death with one final prayer
we are descendants of the ancient ones the race beyond the wanderers of night
she walks in starlight
oh take me home
she'll have you on your knees
the evil in her eyesshe's always out there
oooh my love is real
sentenced to die by the sorceress her evil eye
with holy fire the golden pyre death
music and lyrics by david defeis
watch me take her as you die
chorus
none can ever tear asunder
when the light of life is over calling from the other side
you must never look back
purgatory awaits
i dont know what you've been told
the godheadi am the master of this world of ours you are a thorn in my side i
humanity through blood and fire promises and lies through blood and fire
look into the eyes of death
through the ring of fire
all
bright are the signs of the godhead
klytemnestra
elders elektra
onward through darkness
immortality
in the darkness of our years
heed the voice that is calling
open up your heart
get it on on on
and it makes you wild
cirl show your love'
'cause i feel that's when i'm with you it's alright
it's so lonely so lonely
i'm gonna see you burn
on this mountainside
fell to the fround
cold rain runs from the sky
the dark host marches eternal it's the last great war
a circle of fire loud we sing
bold enough to stay your prayers
unholy water you'rebringing me down to live is to die
unholy water her breasts were full her hair was wet
victory is mine underneath a savage sky
victory in mine noble tears and kingly pride
sworn by the light of the moon
we are coming
and jealous lies
a victim of illusion
music de feispursino lyrics de feis
your father's eyes watch from afar
i see the scars and the pain
i see the scars of the pain
i cant bear the thought of your leaving
oh yeah
i'll have to accept that you're not coming back
emelaith
i will return to wreak my vengeance
child of the desolation cry to me under stars that have died
and created light
the promise of peace is never
fight fight tooth and nail
your teeth can rip in two
slash and tear
once more into the cobra's nest
how the spear faction blazed
by the strength of herakles arms
in the distance black rivers flow
you're never forgiven your destiny's earned
if terror is scheming your freedom is burned
flames of the black star shine in my soul
silent drifter on a highway side
calling and pleading
so let's go all the way
klytemnestra
great sword of flame in the sky
great sword of flame split the night
great sword of flame rip the night
there's a thousand eyes upon you
if you cross the gates of wisdom
war rains through the skies
i'm gonna get you anyhow
dont you think that it's time that you stop
music de feispursino lyrics de feis
heaven will not receive me
let me know where to find you
you best believe me
under desert desert moons
when you see me coming
oh my poor soul
are you old enough to love child
child warm my soul
like a thorn in my side
bringing laughter in disguise
do you think you want to fuck with me
spitting right into your eyes
i will come for you
murder and torture they rape and they slaughter
under stars that have died
i'm hot and i'm ready
i hear the call of the wild
and you're my mealyeah i'm a phantom of delight
oh no you cant
lashed by the winds of fate stung by the gods of hate i'm rising in power i'm
the godhead die fall on your sword fall on your knees die like your son
lashed by the winds of fate stung by the gods of hate i'm rising in power
serve from seven points of darkness shining heavens's rays across the ocean
back from the world between the worlds there are no masters that i serve from
one child cries in the depths of hades
and now this shall pass for my judgement
strawgirl is there a lover who's searching
waiting somewhere for someone to call
and he will make you believe whatever he wants
electron waves a pixel face
happy in your world and you cant imagine
i'll give you everything but you'll have to join me
we can no remember what we wanted hey hey
earth heeds not my warning forever sleepwalking dreaming
but it will be here for months
and this thing will continue throughout the ages
research has no end containing the power
sunday rendezvous mister phobia
jupiter and saturn
lime and limpid green the sound
dead planet

bio tv is what you see
in no time
means their brain mutations
it hurts me so it's a brainscan
erasure i'm empty
you cant even close the gate
translucid language
terrorists everywhere
opinion grows too much
but they killed the wrong ones
i'm not from here
another attempted murder
plasma flowing from a cask
all movement brings a message
cant wait to see their faces
i shall persevere
one more cosmic watergate
ground is shaking
all things good
i want some action
there's no place to be safe
emanating a gas
setting the machine
a mistake
memories
decay is my foe
to the other side
it really exists
i have to realize
conquest is what i can expect
meeting in this race
i'm in the machine
i'm not afraid to live
a new world waits to be seen
i dont want to go home
i'm on my feet again
they made too many speeches
computer station look them all
all systems go blow the reactors
in the jail with no gravity
crusing the day my maker took
i fight alone
loss of this world
anark my given name
is this quest forever
i ask my positron self
why do i dream of kites
exclusion principle
fluorescent light
a transmutation
maintain respect
promising heaven celestial home
betray thy god
all riding the blind

going into the experimental room
died through illness the ravenous medicine
the reasons why

i've passed the entry of the system
that's not for me too much for me
that's not for me too much for me
under hypnosis i take a walk
i'd rather think
silver beams analyze
one day will we understand
my father gave me a small stone that he received from his father this
light tears wept like a child
she is bound to drag me down drag me down
hiding alone
old streets
protecting all my crew
i'm starboard to nowhere
on your own
user of the dead hand
he is anark
on this train
this world is droll
from the drastic truth
but mystic mistakes are never made
yesterday will come
it's now it's real real real
they cant take the time to realise
that they're all the victims
it's all over shaking the ground
will i go back and forth down on line

you live in a nice neighborhood
electrical collision course
it rips you off keeps you in

beside the last door
open in daylight
my privacy starts to fade
within the mirror
for me there's no alternative
seems like we got electronic alienation
you lose your function
some say they've got our lives in their hands
the fear will come from the sky from behind
around the corner of my mind
out in the dark a shadow sound
there's the bridge where's the man what a scam
when one looks for gold
you wont look dumb
chop a breathing hole in my vice
no more control
we'll show them what we got
revolution is evident
it's another rough time
maybe we'll win maybe we'll loose
but i wont forget this gang
cant you see

and that's what i've got to face
there's nothing left here to remind me
and that's the chance i've got to take
shane
cause we shared the laughter and the pain
and that's what i've got to face

and that's the chance i've got to take
i kissed her and she kissed me
my life is gonna be bee yoo tee ful

it's not the way i choose to live
is it all
those times i dont believe it's right i know it know it
with a simple telephone call
or nothing at all
cuz i want it all
with a simple telephone call
chorus
and said that i cant hold on
oh what are you thinking of
until you bring back your devotion
i guess i'm holding on to my faith
i couldnt see it
and all the others had me thinking
for a break that would make it okay
in the arms of an angel
there's vultures and thieves at your back
from this dark cold hotel room
the only thing that means everything to me
it's written on angels wings
angels wings like letters in the sky
on angels winds an angelical formation
like an endless summer
yeah we'll find our star
far away from where we are
is there in our reach
this feeling's too strong
that's why i can yeah ye eh yeah
this feeling's too strong
i'll put my hand upon my heart
good things good things
i love how they tease me
nice smile so wild
that makes me want to sweat feel them wet
kuala lumpur and miami got some bad girls
each city day or night
each city day or night
when i lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head
was a stop too late
and put my mind at ease for sure
and put my mind at ease for sure
fear of rejection kept my love inside
tried to fight it but it cannot be denied
what could have been
out my league
so damn my foolish pride
inside
i'll be no worse off
it doesnt matter if it turns out bad
baby that's ok
it doesnt matter if it turns out bad
at least we have a moment before
out of my league
it doesnt matter if it turns out bad if it turns out bad
rules are made for breaking
need to hear you speak my name
everything that we could find
did you know when you're around
to fall in love with you
but how do i when all words pale
to catch my breath to catch my breath
how can i change the world
so i close my eyes and tell myself
got to get to you somehow
got to get to you somehow
all those late nights i left you alone
baby stop before you make a big mistake
when all i wanted is you
let me change your mind
baby stop before you make a big mistake
a'when the sun begins to shine
i might'a saved that clementine
oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin
but wherever i may be
and you'll be here with me
a part of us will be together
is there anywhere that love cannot reach
till your drifting away
you're all i'll ever need
i kept my distance i never let go
i need you to know i've never been
i've never been this close
draw on my heart
to you
write on my soul
take a picture of what you think love looks like
use every word you've ever heard
when all your hopes are sinking
can join the tribes of man
when we stand together
i didnt know what to say
it's a love crime
and even though you look so good tonight
but i know that for you
the way you move away from me
shane
cos baby i need you
love takes two
love takes two
mark
love takes two
lies a body just oozing life
could it be our boy's done something rash
i remember all my life
i never realized
the tears are in my mind
and i need you
when you told me you didn`t need me anymore
when you told me you didn`t need me anymore
should've sensed the danger
i'll get you back someday
just stop
wait a minute
i'm gonna show you i'm in it for life
maybe tomorrow
and the warm winds that embrace me
how to cut the thread and leave it all behind
a fool in your eyes
i just wanna say it straight from my heart
cause when our love seems to fade away
i do
i miss you i miss you
i do
if i'm with you
as good as today was
that every moment
i love you more
every moment
i love love love the moments
is not the words
that you love me
it's more than words
all you have to do
what would you do
when it's cold outside
i've got so much honey
all
well i guess you say
talking about my girl
shane that's the same old story
i wonder how
reaching for a love that seems so far
to see you once again
i wonder how
reaching for a love that seems so far
to see you once again
yeeaahhh
find the place i love the most
dreams will take me there
where the fields are green
everything you do everything i see
we see the sun come up
autograph my heart
picture me all over you
when there are no more heroes
through hopelessness and darkest days
of splitting one word in two
no no no no
did you ever think about
nobody but you
to take your place but you
no no no no
than walking up without you here
there's no place that far
did you notice me
two hearts are inseparable
there's so much more
you dont ever notice me turning on my charm
bryan westlife
i've made it obvious
shane
i'm not so good with words
i'll say it in this love song
all
bryan
you can put your head down on my shoulder
all
baby put your head on my shoulder
that will shine on
shane
you lift me up on the wings of love
whenever i'm weak honey
in the morning light
for a telephone call
but still she leaves you wondering
and times you really want to cry
and wake up alone
have you ever tried to find the words
you'd give anything
to look into their eyes
bridge
even though you're near me
though you want to
sorrow such a heavy load
for the first time
but it's not you
who can heal me
like a movie that you've seen
if you feel as though
you'd probably want some more
i'll be yours
and i've been reading the papers
and say whatever
wont let them change your song
youre a champion of science
i've almost got you there so let me take you all the way
and hit you with the real thing
and hit you with the real thing
bring it till you're high and low
and be hypnotic and the trip wont stop
chorus
another sunny day
and i've been keeping all the letters
i'm lucky i know
i want to come home
has come and gone away
i'll be home tonight
fearing the unknown
and to know that you love me
if everything is real i'm feeling
never wanting you to leave
cos baby you're the best thing in my life
shane
if you were the one you wouldnt hurt me so bad
you taught me how to break a heart
you gave me the world
i'm takin all that i learned from you
how to break a heart
to break the spell
cause you're not here with me
oh please somebody tell me it's not true oh girl
i cry
you still love me
cause i know i'll never breathe your love again
i want you to know
and that's the honest truth
please understand
a fire inside of me
when these two hearts would entwine
without you
cause baby
how can i leave
lets not leave ourselves with no way out
no more
girl to live without you in my life
i dont wanna have to try
is a lie without you
i forgot what we were fighting for
i cant dream sleepless nights have got be bad
chorus
i have a dream a fantasy
i hae a dream a song to sing
shane
bryan

es algo increble
en ti deje mi amor
se que estoy bien a tu lado
chorus
this time it's real
far far too long

as i lay my love on you
i'm going home to my city by the bay
just let me talk to you
i love you i love you
when all i wanna say is that
i love you i love you
that you are my world
some say love it is a river
it's the dream afraid of waking
just remember in the winter
there is nothing for me but to love you
mm mm mm mm
that i wouldnt steal
chorus
oh yeah to be loved by you
when it's through it's through
so you can be on top for once
and i can make you start to smile
the way that it should be
i will care for you and love you girl
my feelings are so true
my feelings are so true
so put your best dress on
shane
all
so put your best dress on
tonight i'm gonna make it up to you
turnaround every now and then i get a little bit terrified and then i see the look in your eyes
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time
once upon a time there was light in my life
and i need you now tonight
i really need you tonight
a total eclipse of the heart
through any kind of weather
when you fall down down
baby you thought it was forever
when you fall down down
try again ooh yeah
stumble and fall
they say
i want you to know
yes i'm ready to be all you're dreaming of
mark
yes i'm ready to be all you're dreaming of
and i found you
you give me a reason
in things that i already knew
bryan
to put my faith in you
all
it's hard
to put my faith in you
held me close
believe that you're mine
this love is unbreakable
i've been blessed by the power of love
each time you whisper my name
and each time i look in your eyes
all
and i find myself longing to hold you close
and i'll promise i'll be right by your side
'cause i know that if you would be here
i'll give you everything that money cant buy
mark
i'm gonna try for an uptown girl
just because
and then i'll win
as long as anyone with hot blood can
my uptown girl
you and i weve been at it so long
cause it's us against the world
mark
and you make it better
cause it's us against the world tonight
know that we are standing tall
us against the world
you turn the picture on to me and i'll turn over
as i walked down the alleyway it was a sunday
but i was so embarressed when i missed your party
a whisper in a choir stall
time goes by
and all this time
i'll never walk out on you
and now i cant get enough
no matter what you're going through
swearing he's forever true
underneath one sun
all of the fear and all of the lies are
cause sometimes it's necessary
and all of the lies are the lies
if you just believe
we were two we were two
and open up to the ways you made me feel alive
shadows fade into the light
for all my life i am yours
baby before it's too late
come fly with me let's take off in the blue
once i get you up there where the air is rarified
a fragile heart was broken before
it's hard i know but oh
there's so much to lose
i dont know why
anytime you want me to
with each time i lied
dont leave me lonely
babybaby
anytime you want me to
cause i need you
but there's something about you
i'm head over heels and it shows
i get lost
i dont know what went through my mind
open your heart
to tell you how much it matters
if you open your heart
oh baby
to love me once again
between safe and sound
you saved something for me
i have visions of many things
fruits of love
what becomes of the broken hearted
all
i'll find a way somehow
what becomes of the broken hearted
te falle y se que
vestida esta en glamour y en rock roll
con lo bien que te ves
como quieres que te olvide
que no haria por besar tus labios
desperado why dont you come to your senses
now it seems to me some fine things
the sky wont snow and the sun wont shine
before it's too late
just walk out that door
girl i always knew where my heart belonged
or you'll stay a while
bryan open your eyes hear me now
i know how to ease my pain
oh oh oh oh oh
i refuse to see why
oh dont get me wrong
and baby this is how i feel yeah
time after time
dont get me wrong
dont get me wrong
dont get me wrong
why cant we talk about it
should i stay
work out what love is about
i wanna know as people grow
and deceiving that someone who cares
dont say it's too late
and i would risk it all for you
for you
better take a look inside
chorus
it's not a fantasy
if i ever break your heart if i ever do you wrong
some people let it show some people wait too long
dont let it play on your mind
i'm easy like sunday morning yeah
ooh that's why i'm easy
i'm easy like sunday morning yeah
hay un angel que est junto a m
te entregaste a m sin condicin
en t dej mi amor
en ti deje mi amor
en t dej en t dej mi amoooor
down my soul
and pray we'll stay together
wonder why you wanna stay the night
you're the only girl that i need
cause you're the one good reason
sometimes when i'm out at night i think of your smile
every now and then i get a little bit cold
yes i do yes i do yes i do yes i do
and the everlasting love
let me know
ever since i've come to know you
chorus
it's everything everything you do
you're never too busy to just be there
and everybody knows
all
that bridges all divides
they wish they had a love like yours and mine
there's no searching anymore
in other words hold my hand
one thing that makes it all complete
some in their solitary lives
cos who's to know which one you let go
and it's like flying without wings
shane
mark
so impossible as they may seem
it's little things that only i know
and that's the joy you bring
and who's gonna take my place
cant believe that i'm the fool again
you never gave me
oh oh oh
all
before i go to sleep at night
i'll be loving you forever
it's so much more than i could have dreamed
and tore it apart
all mark
i would love you still forever
i let go
found out what was missing
miracles appear i know
and at this very moment
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
found out what was missing
smile when you're around
she is the dream that you seek
girl you gotta let me know
girl you gotta let me know let me know
and no other will exsist
it's like the planets have aligned
knowing tht unconditionally
she'll be your air
and too many
when i'm with you you you
nothing replaces your touch
and i need you in my life
what's a photograph
they try to break us
like a piece of me is missing
when i'm with you you you
you're the only one
when i'm with you you you
and what we had before
when you come around
there's so many reasons
you dont have to worry
you only have to smile and you knock me out
and i want you to know
down from the sky
and feel the pain
and bring you
to stop my tears
nothing is above me
no matter where you are
i should have know i was wrong
i dont wanna live my life without you
and you're taking it out tonight
i dont even wanna try
when you're looking like that
ojos de tigresa que te tiran a matar
que tonto fui porque tu fuiste mia y te deje escapar
que hubo un dia que te tuve y te perdi
no te puedo olvidar amor
when i left her for a life in pity
how am i supposed to leave you now
how am i supposed to leave you now
how am i supposed to walk on by when you're looking like that
i cant believe what i just gave away
made it this far
now where we are
we got to let
dry despite the rain
stay stay where you are
thats where we are
a minute to late oh girl
why did you have to be untrue love you like i do
why do i love you
i can think of nothing else but you
when you come around
we got a little world of our own
and fooling around is over
i let you in where no one else goes
it's feeling right now baby somehow
shane
all
dont be afraid
when i see how my path
been through lot of heartache
was written in the stars
shane
you're everything i need
you are so beautiful
you light up my days
you you light up my life
we were crying together
i've been trying to leave you
chorus
must've been so torn apart i can see it when i look at you
must've had a broken heart
you raise me up to walk on stormy seas
sometimes i think i glimpse eternity
you never close your eyes any more
whoa oh
now it's gone gone gone
bring back that loving feeling
thank you for the memories
at the start of the day for all my life
thank you for the weekend
on the way when
at the start of the day for all my life
these pictures in my head yeah
every time we meet
i feel i'm losing my defences
the picture is complete
she's the puzzle of my heart
bryan
i'll always look back
the queen of my heart
i'll treasure this moment
and there you will be
queen of my heart
dont lock all the doors
'til you land at your own destiny
reach out
i wont be
reach out
when all the birds are singing in the sky
you tried to teach me right from wrong
we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
shane
but the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
i go driving
everywhere that i go
i cant feel you
it's you reminding me
shadows
of how we loved
she's back inside of me
she's back again
oh baby
you'll see the sun come shining through for you
you'll find that life is still worthwhile
since the day that you were gone
it has come to be
in my heart you were the only
why did you leave me
but now i know better
i've been thinking
dont you leave me alone
baby open the door
somebody wants you
i got nothing left to prove
now baby i didnt know myself

and guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
so you should know this love we share was never made to die
i swore to share your joy and your pain
you'll know i'm not lying
gotta let you know that i
but we're still trying
cos i never wanna see you sad
i see a love that burns eternally
i swore to you my love would remain
oh that i'm never gonna let you go
i swore to you my love would remain
mark
who ever told you i was letting go
all
all over again
but even if we try
i swore to share your joy and your pain

the crossfire in my head
cos we fought an endless war
my life passed before my eyes
love me while there's still time

cos i've been kissing you
good god
but till that day
i dont believe it's true
i got a feeling girl
less is more
cos i cant say goodbye
you're ridin high in april shot down in may
i pick myself up and get back in the race
many times i thought of cuttin out but my heart wont buy it
maybe i was wrong about it
that's what it's all about
that would be a lie
it's all about love
it's all about you
that's what it's all about
all about love
maybe you were right
it's all about love
'cause you made me realise
no matter what the situation
chorus
i just smile and say the same thing
that's where you find love
the dance we shared 'neath the stars above
but if i'd only known how the king would fall
there is no reason you should feel like this
i promise you that i promise you that
but still there is time to turn it around
i promise you that i promise you that
i wanna grow old with you
it makes our risk right all along
things can come and go i know but
i wanna grow old with you

in songs of yesterday
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
'cos i know what it means
here i go
like a hobo i was born to walk alone
coverdalemarsdenmoody
'cos they all take whatever they can
you can keep your lock and key
i've got a burning heart
i'm hard to handle
i just cant get enuff hot stuff
i walk the street 'round midnight
i just cant get enuff hot stuff
i start to shiver i start to shake
i've got the weakness of an ordinary man
chills up an down my spine
i cant get enough i cant get enough i cant get enough
waiting on your call
'cos it's really got a hold on me
is this the love that i've been searching for
the night is gone
touching everyone
through fields of fire
in your darkest night
we walk toward desire
my love can open any door
like rolling thunder i feel the power of love
so dont you worry you can ease your mind
is your own reflection
keep on giving me loving
you can think it over slow
and the priest forgot the words
if you got love to give
sweet sweet child of the street
'll tear your heart out
repeat verse one and chorus
you give an air of the dolce vita
woah you know mama that tonight's the night
take a look in the mirror
for too many years
yes it do
but those lonely days turn into lonely nights
now i smoke a lot of cigarettes
but you dont believe a word i say
when night time comes to call on me
wont you take me back again
take me back again
sorry little girl if you cant stay
'cos god made men to satisfy
gonna spread her pretty legs so i can see
i know you must have cried
the stronger the emotion
an those nights are growing colder
an those nights are growing colder
the deeper the devotion
and if you would dance with me
they were promises to you
the time is right for love
a shoulder i can cry on
of my own uncertainty
i wanna be the master of my destiny
but i'm never gonna wear the frozen smile of a clown
give me love
so tell me baby
there've been too many tears falling
did i hurt you so badi guess i'm fooling myself
where did i go wrong where did i go wrong
so tell me baby
looking for a place to hide
and i got what i paid for
trouble always coming my way trouble always coming
i'm down on love
just one more lonely night
an i feel like a fool
i am a victim of love
one more lonely night
so many times i thought about it
i never know if in my heart i'm really guilty
i left with my guitar and said
everyday i realize you can see it in my eyes
when you hear the thunder roar you're not alone
get my motor running ready to go
full of honky tonk rhythm an blues
you get what you can
but i love wine women an song
wine women an song
i'm talking 'bout loveoooh love
repeat verse one and chorus
said i should walk away
you shame the devil
woman trouble blues
i'll stand accused on judgement day
come an get me
would i lie to you would i lie to you
baby unless you wanted me to
for a woman just like you
well it's five in the morning
in the playboy books
your lies aint gonna make it no more
tell me no lies
cant you see baby
dont be afraid just call on me
dont try to hold on for anyone
an he wants you hanging on a line
'cos i got what you need
cant sleep at night
angel spread your wings
'cause it seems so long
back where i belong
your precious love
on your face before
you never let me forget it
you told me twice
was meant to be
now you say
'cos this time's the last time
the thought is driving me mad
come in out of the cold pretty woman
but the boys go wild
i'm gonna make you mine
come in out of the cold pretty woman
i've been a gypsy
just trying to get inside
looking in
wont give me a chance
i stand on the outside
i would do anything to be near you
when i touch you inside i feel you burning me with fire
an i dont know what i'm gonna do
check in on any night time flight i dont mind
i'm just trying to get a message to you
dont wanna be teasted
i want you to rock me

inside my soul

so you better run you better run
by the sweet way that you talk yes you do
coverdalesykes
looking for love

an finding only heartache
i looked around an what did i see
love aint no stranger
i ask my friends but nobody knows
i aint no stranger

you was born to succeed
i'm back in the saddle again
just like the spider an the fly
a little love an affection
love an affection
watching your pretty flower grow
and i'm doing all i can
i am a love man yeah yeah yeah
i would get down on my knees
and i am a love man
dont you hide it away
i said baby if you need my love
solo
maybe if you want my love
i need a woman to treat me good
and use my tail on you
i'm a love hunter baby
i'm a love hunter baby
if you dont want an answer
if you break my heart
'cos seven to eleven made a fool out of meso if you dont mean business
or gimme a beat
you get your fingers burned
that just cant be denied
i'm the medicine man
there aint no use in crying
i will be your medicine man
try'n to make a livin somehow
it's all i've ever had
they never used to make a pass
might just take your life
'cause i know yes i know i've been mistreated
since my baby left me i've been losing losing
a superstitious woman
let me love you
let me love you let me love you let me love you
a loner in the city streets
an i cant go on
cant you feel the love
when all i have left is the memory
you're all that i need
now you're gone
you're all i want
and only my love keeps me from
whispered voices in the distance
only my soul
my mother started crying
outlaw born outside of the law
man on the run will always take chances for fun
outlaw outlaw
honey you move me
that we have after making love
like the wind thro' a willow tree
you gave me the answer
the ashtray says
in the key of c
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
the ashtray says
what you once were isnt what you want to be any more
the fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering
i know i would die if i could come back new
at least that's what you said
and if you dont let it show
without your blue eyed soul
i just cant find the time
'cause that's the way it should be
the way i want it to read
candyfloss and shes a safecracker
she's in the way
i'm the boy that looks excited
you get so low
our prayers will never be answered again
you get so high
as god's love
it's all beginning
your prayers will never be answered again
and the dealer keeps on joking as he takes my last token
and i've been puking
i move so slow a steady crushing hand
i will always die
jets hum
because i've found the way those engines sound
with songs about things we all know
and after awhile
with a light shining off the lake
and his young one is gonna take it all away
the clouds will blow away
either way
oh what have i been missing
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing it's gonna
it's gonna
oh i know it's right
dont forget the flowers sunday i know you will
dont forget the flowers someday
to the handshake drugs i bought downtown
way for me to be exactly
i was looking for you
exactly what do you want me to be
i try to stay busy
what am i gonna do if you never come home
i'll check the mail
try to keep myself occupied
another and another
she fell in love with another
and i'll think of all the right words to say
to make all the good times last
please dont cry we're designed to die
you cant deny even the gentlest tide
you've denied
if you dont learn how to steer
i should've been your lover but i hadnt seen
but if it's your mind that's wandering it'll fall in line
whenever i hear your heart talking it's a song it's a song
theres a whisper
but you know how ive been untrue
to make this easier for you
it means i'm partially there
there's bourbon on the breath
my voice is climbing walls
they cried all over overseas
sleeping eye sockets
every moment's a little bit later
every song's a comeback
cheer up honey i hope you can
picking apples for the kings and queens of things i've never seen
when we came here today
i'm bound by these choices so hard to make
about so many things
i'm sure it seems like i'm takin my time to get back to you
i'm not lyin sure it seems like i'm tryin to get back at you
a wooden floor at dawn
finally full again
sometimes there is art
no
my pop quiz kid
and a bruised road
stuck
i warned you not to drive
daddy's payday is not enough
a pretty war
like a man on the sidewalk remembering your face
your life's been stinking your heart's been sinking
you blink and you're blue
we should've been in love
the rain applauds
as we all can plainly see
the old buildings downtown
that's good enough for now
even if i make it through
one more worried whisper right in my ear
fill your heart with smoke
a fixed bayonet through the great southwest to forget her
the type of sound that floats around and then back down
die alone
i assassin down the avenue
what was i thinking when i said good night
i am trying to break your heart
to do what you always wanted to do
bye bye bye
i dont think you even understand
oh hold on
turn on you
i will
i'm gonna turn on you turn on you turn on you
like a bird in a cage
on a big wheeled wagon
i'm always in love
i'm the man who loves you
all i can see is black and white
just hold your hand and you'd understand
i'll do what i can
impossible germany
now i know
some trees will bend
and barking dogs
last week i was thinking about traveling by land
you were right about the stars
i'll be around
your voice is smoking
with echoes in my heart
a heart i know by heart
phone my family tell them i'm lost
living in pekin livin in
you cant hear 'em on the radio
the best life never leaves your lungs
can you believe it
honestly
you shiver at your soul
the night is dissolving
so you can see
honest when you're tellin a lie
you're staring at a picture of me
positively unemployed
nothin at all
blister on a turnpike let me by i only wanna wonder why when i dont die
well i cut class in school yeah now i know i made a mistake
it sounds like someone else's song from along time ago
his black shirt cries
his black shirt cries
it's just a dream he keeps having
and i leave it on the shore i'd leave it for somebody
i'll tell you mine before you go
that's not the issue
you were the lonely one
you you're the lonely one
inlitterati lumen fidei
oh in so many ways
a ghost is born
so long
i couldnt be any closer to you now
you cold hot blood ran away from me
i know i'll make it back
they make me think
via chicago
what am i going to do
you're just right
honey i think you're just right
you're gonna lose
if you want to want to be alive okay
i say that were just friends
i try to make amends
and you want other people to sing along
when there's a light what light
just remember what was yours is everyone's from now on
there's a light what light
you been tryin hard not to think i'm a liar
what's the world got in store
stuffed nervous with gold
and i blend with kings
can you be
why would you wanna live in this world x2
fill up your mind with all it can know
the turntable sizzles
open your arms as far as they will go
what would we be without wishful thinking
why is there no breeze
i have no idea how this happens
our faces stitched and sewing
he was chrome and he said
i felt no fear
come with me
of the fences in between
sun gets passed sea to sea
i look in your eyes and you'll be mine
suns gonna shine wind's gonna blow
and everyday i wonder what it would be like
and i wanna thank you now
disappear your low low lows
there's no guarantee that love will be
once in a while the mountains move
so when you dont understand
goes a long long way
repeat chorus
chorus
the rock of ages goes unshaken
except for the rain and the wind in the trees
in the things you do and the things you say
baby baby baby
help me i'm flaming
it's coming closer
you light my morning sky
others may promise the stars in the sky
who knows when it's meant to be
i've been scheming dreaming up a plan of how to get to you
with a chain chain chain chain reaction
chain chain reaction
baby if i could change the world
we ran wild
i knew i would love you
how could i know
you told me that you wanted somebody to talk to
dance shout
time to walk away
youve already said goodbye
dont look back into those eyes
that aint right
i know that look
dont you throw that mojo on me
oh wont you save me father sun father sun
i think i hear him whispering
a hole in the screen door big as your fist and flies on the butter
oh oh oh oh oh oh
repeat chorus
cause i'm as free as a bird now
things just couldnt be the same
her older brother knew somethinwas up
what's the world coming to
boys as a species were all a bunch of zeroes
her parents breathed a sigh of great relief
gives a little grin and blows away the jerk
i saidlooking in your eyes
i got your heart hot on my heels
sooner than you can say you need metrue love is a funny thing
not quite heaven sent
he can throw down with the best
come on taxi driver
but heaven help me
if i ever lose your love
so hold me close again
for a while i guess it was
i'm asking please
help me
help me
we were sitting there talking
that's such a lonely thing to do
my angel is here my angel is here
so come on angel make my heart sing
my angel is here
now i'm all alone and scared to stay
and i'm afraid he'll always bei gave my faithful heart to someone
gotta hock my clothes to pay my rent
when nothing changes and every day stays the same
aint been easy babe
the damage is done now i'm out of control
i cant deny you even when i catch you
dang brakes that's life
got my back against the wall
i aint gonna let 'em hurt me now
i see forever in you deep blue eyes
im old enough to know better
i have sailed a boat or two
one flies high and stands alone
emotions just seem to let go
rescue me
chorus
i have seen my share of hard times
and a dead end street
is the law of the land
is good solid ground
who never did dream
the feeling got strong enough
over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
over the line
you need a nice warm place to stay
you got to find somebody to love you
'cause overnight things can sure get cold
and all this fame
you'd be there while i gave the rest of the world all i had
sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy
it's a mean old love
i cant say goodbye
i cant say goodbye
cause now i can see
i used to be your very own
i hope some sweet tomorrow
it takes a special kind of fool
an even bigger fool might think
what kind of fool does it take
so you're at the end of your wits
sit down here with me
and you'll make it to the other sidelife gets hard
that's when you'll be ready
and you all know my name
'cause there's a wild streak running down from the roots
you aint never been shown
love that's worth fighting for
baby come what may i'll find a way to get through
and even when we're worlds apart
for a troubled heart and a troubled mind
repeat chorus
for you baby i would swim the sea
and not even worry about getting burned
and swore death would be the only thing to keep us apart
she's living proof it still does
to no particular destination
as long as i can be the master
dont wanna work real hard
without any rhyme or reason
everybody's hungry in a different way
that's what the world needs now
bridge
and bid farewell to one more day
and though your eyes ask many questions
i had my mind on the open road
and let it walk in
your love started talkin
it never crossed my mind
i cant see another's face
if it's not you who am i supposed to love
but you know it's just a lie
who am i tryin to fool
but what about my heart what about my heart
now you're back
should i turn my life around
you never realized how much i tried
repeat chorus
it's in the little things you say
your fingerprint
send them away
love is gonna come around
remember who you are
open up your soul and
chorus
and the life we had might have been
it's good to know some things remain
and turned to go
'cause i aint wearin
i gotta take a little time
i cant stop now i've traveled so far
it looks like love has finally found me
i found no comfort in placing blame
i will be brave
repeat chorus
a taxi's waiting in the driveway for you
but i'm not up to being strong
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh it all comes down to love
oh oh oh oh oh oh it all comes down to love
chorus
they've been called on down the line
and love was just a lesson
it is what it is
it's never quite enough
so bite your lip
i know what your future holds
to keep the magic goin strong
repeat chorus
thats the original paint job too
oh boy it rides just like a dream
and look at it now its just like new
i'll find my way but until then
i'm learning to live with love again
let's make a baby king
the good news that i bring
teach us wrong and right
i'd fly through the storm to find my way to you
repeat chorus
and the angry words that came
i was brought here by the power of love
but one we can leave behind
when all your hopes are sinking
i would give my heart's desires
we can do anything anything
you better start cutting the man some slack
and never do him any wrong
gonna push him just a little too far
when you said we were
now i'm crawling the wallpaper
and just when i thought that my vista was golden in hue
so with a mop and a bucket
if you let the sunshine come through
each watch i smash apart
will halt the flowing sands
of 25 o'clock
quiet or witty girls by the quayside
down in pearly tears upon your cheeks
i'm happy standing on my feet of clay
dont need another satellite
dont need another satellite
i flick on the video to soothe me
as scenery sunlight shifts away
silent film of melting miracle play
apples and cherries
battery brides ha ha have you ever tried
every morning from your bed
powered on the the beating of hearts
and a tune to which no one is listening
chorus
i said they thought it was hunchtime
it's your big day your big day
statistics they dont say a lot
like on the big day
and we'll bring back cheese for my auntie jane
to protect you from the man in the moon
brainiacs daughter
so i reach to hold her frozen hand in flight
and i love the lights that blink on and off
in the sea air
in the gorse
from her head it's growing
all you do is smile you banish the night
i cant stop this grinning
i'm turning night into day
talking to me
when it's put in our hand
and we fought with the weapons in our
everything looks smashed and broken
if you doze much longer
careful dont look down the wrong end
it's just a complicated game
someone else will come along and move it
i said god it really doesnt matter where you put your world
you may have walked out
crocodile
skinned and stuffed with drink
with the jaded jealous smile
in the crowded room i wont touch too much
day in day out
day in day out
in the street 'cause they cant make opinions meet about god
devil as well no pearly gates no thorny crown you're always
the public is laughing
as i fall to the floor
much to your surprise
and watch it grow
you can travel far to distant lands
well we're as helpless now as we've ever been before
to tell the world just how we feel
there is no muscle in our tongues
but the words got in the way
put your foot upon the laughing gas
omnibus take all of us
dont waste time go on and taste them all
aint nothing in the world like a green skinned girl
selling guns to simpletons
in the outside world
you can keep your animals
if all of the tears she cried flowed into a brook
well then her garden would always be green
and the sea in her hair
i take home my notes and coins every week
but the church says to remain this meek
la la lo it's iron
that the songs are too slow
everybody walkie talkie
real by reel
or when they let you play
got their sails in the sunset
it's not a fear it's not a crush
the swastika and the hammer and symbol
joe stalin looks just like uncle sam
reign of blows
in cosmopolitan proportions to their daughters
it's in the way their curtains open and close
or am i fast
or do i turn
jets should hide i'll fly alongisde
i've been up in the clouds
crow crow
where's the message that's written under the base of clouds
if i die and i find that i had a soul inside
and yields are good
silhouette against the sky
snipping snipping snipping goes the scissor man
if you refuse to believe he exist
she inches close but out of reach
she's nearer
she returns to sand so get ahold of the girl
darling dont you ever stop to wonder
it's growing green
is there a god in heaven
about the clouds about the hail and thunder
who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle
just repeat
we have the pool
get the expert on mademoiselles
keep her stood in line
dress in all that skin
how she carry you
she really shake you donkey up
talk a walk under the subway
no strings to tie my kite
and i sure dont know what's right
the first time i saw you standing in the water
impaled on your hair
under mats of flower lava
drowning here in
raise his regal head
all the faces white now
hit him back make him mad
i feel like i'm walking
the feeling just goes on and on
boy and girl girl and boy
i've been praying i can keep you
we shouldnt be sadder
dont get me wrong i'm so proud
who have goals for the betterment of life
into the mouths of babes
funk pop a roll for fish in shoals
funk pop a roll beats up my soul
like never before are tired of being actionless
until the battle's lost or made
if you fancy we can buy an ice cream cone
great fire burning
great fire burning through my house
eyes bring water
eyes bring water
so we sing
shy and quiet neither scene nor herd
have you seen jackie
the air male that she pick up
i really think its about time that she came down
she talks and banners unfurl
laughing
laughter
other lands became a larder full of all the good things
humble daisy
cast the milk and coins of morning's cash about
i am the audience
cause i'm the audience
i bought myself a liarbird
all he would say
it changed to a cuckoo
``just like a household name'' is
on an average english winter's afternoon
squinting at the sun through eyes
fuelled our bodies kindled fire in our minds
and when i see 'em fiddling well i think you've guessed the rest
dancing around your daisies
in loving memory of a name
i drift away
that's really super supergirl
supergirl
but you're never going to stop me crying
how you're changing the world's weather
was all he knew
then came her
but his seat's always here if he wants it
peter pumpkinhead pulled them all
but he made too many enemies
oh my oh my oh
that they want to be chief
plays a tune for broken hearts
they blot the sun to black
he slithers
smalltown coughing in the toilet
next you'll be telling me it's 1990
and that's how i'm fed
smalltown coughing in the toilet
who took no compass guide or chart
a bag to keep life's souvenirs in
all the lies he'd ever spoken
the man who sailed around his soul
hmmm the meeting place
hmmm the meeting place
i'm the mole from the ministry
i'm the mole from the ministry
mole
we are all mesmorized
we're the smartest monkeys
to give itself a pat on the back
first there's the handshake
on a cake called nitty gritty
the thing with politicians is
see the unattractive things that make us real
then she appeared
now shines from her blue eyes
now shines from her bright smile
yeah yeah
this is
will you sing about the missiles
because he wanted to win the craziest race
everything upon the surface of the world
towers of london
for the bridge that doesnt go
they shouldnt do that no no no
and i'm told there's no more coal
cant find the wound from where i'm bleeding
all that time so cheaply spent
hypnotising you to need
so i leave the world behind
think they know the score
when she's here it makes up for the time she's
you get to know the world
by the girl who smiled and made the lift
and a man was close to dead
who cares
oh my my this war dance
everyone wants a slice of
about the stirring of those young hearts
what in the world
they're staying at home
throw us a line
then your heart nailed me under a jinx
living in iceman town
no fast car
all this talk
each moment you slip you will bring near the hour
and others the canvas we're dealt
do it today
asleep at your desks
it's the airwaves of the world
it's confusious the chinese say
setting fire to the night
make no sound
you're still a good man albert brown
and her name was else
you're a good man albert brown
and i dont ever know if i can give you up
you're my drug
you're the wish you are i had
she caught the same bus as me and she sat down behind
then send me to hell hell hell
when you were ill so ill
bring your horn of plenty
i think my watch has bust and so is time
through the greeney grey pebbles
they danced and laughed spelling all i fell into was love
where i questioned the blue birds all about it
where i questioned the fishes all about it
you'll spread no wings to fly in fright if i'm beside you
ladybird
your name
everybody says something
everybody eats something
we are the happening
i am a success
and gold word ribbons rope and rodeo
build a jacob's ladder up to love
she's a little lighthouse
it's hardly love all and somebody might
and hope they make it up before too late
make a play of lust intention
love at first sight etc
we will drink and prepare for marriage
we will drink and prepare for wedding
we will drink and prepare for marriage
we're only making plans for nigel
nigel is happy in his work
just like the struggling summer flies that
the strings of your instrument were strangling me
me and the wind are celebrating your loss
alcohol is an easy key
i saw the children at heart
summoned by drum rolling surf
grown to child since mermaid
millions all flow at water
fine art never moved my soul
there she goes
'cause my bird performs
catch a saucer and i'll be around
my love explodes
i dunno what she got but it seems to have a grip upon me
that's right
you're standing there and wondering how
you you put your hands together
neon shuffle it's going to do it with blue
mincing smirk dancing on the hip of his lip
more than you could know
i may never get to look deep in your eyes
sharin our dreams
anywhere usa

asking for the level where a world devides its answers
live for the breaking free
i've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied i'm on my way
watching for the signals that some easily
waiting for the waiting to be free
when you see you get it
for a sign from god

caught in a total nuclear greed
to be free

andersonbrufordhowesquire

reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
all is left for you
all impenetrable youth over all of our lands
wish the sun to stand still
and you were standing close to me
the summer's too long and it seems like the end of my life
speaking happy words of promise
moving through the night
like the black and white of love
we exist through this strange devicemoving to the left
moving through the night
in the flowers
counting out the statesmen
they the savage innocent
this place this place
of recent changes
andersonhowe
if they dont give us the keys
cover me up get closer to the power
how are they to devine
if you dont give them the keys
there is a special reason
just hear your voice
of all the known religions
nothing can come between us
see the world for what it really is
fourth dimension dream
sing all the songs of the earth
so giving all the love you have
walking away from illusion
walking this dream everlasting
re defining this long lost passion
long lost brother of mine
something you did touched me
changes
root yourself to the ground
changes
only such jealous hearts
it's calling your name
one word one word can bring you round
will barter as the homeless burn
all are sacred
where equal rights for will rent assunder
children of light havent you heard
waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around
there then arose where nothing really stood there before
grecian galleons the sack of troy to the gardens of babylon
as the circus finally changed its invisible course
no no regrets at all
he young and tactile
so the street guys so observant
solo
we'll be waiting for the night
i once knew a sweet young dream
and rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
not right away not right away
i get up i get down
as armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
passing paths that climb halfway into the void
for the crucifixion of her own domain i get up
in charge of who is there in charge of me
a constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man it seems
close to the edge down by the river
i get up
get the wind as it slowly turns
call this free love
far away in the depths of hawking's mind
call this free love
until we pick it up again
let our hour of passion
power defy our needs lift us up show us now
power at first to the needs of each others' days
straight jacket freedom's march is it all far beyond
power at first to the needs of each others' days
innocence no answer
the rhythm of love
night time fever burning till you're higher
in this situation i have found you
present and relay the struggle out of which comes a positive source nous
constant doors will open eyes
till we're coming home again
constant to the soul
we receive all we venture to give
move around surely sing
going home

in and out the valley
there with you

in and out the valley
there with you
the rim of the land
the words will make you out 'n out
i asked my love to give me shelter
and all the pieces fit forever
and you're left with an empty room in peace
there's something around the corner it'll pass you by
he turned around and pointed revealing all the human race
now that you find now that you're whole
only one more body of love and they're rolling they're rolling back to you
so in answer to the dream
the one you feel so close to the order of the sun
we were all alone we didnt need much more
shoot high aim low

in the homelands of love

it would shock your fall into landing light
if you could see all the roads i have travelled
yes yes and the feeling you give me
the pleasure of the giving things within
until you reach and touch your own redemption
they marched as one with earth
surie
and i heard a million voices singing
and i heard a million voices singing
how the stories can be heard
head into the headlight
see the dancers of the nile
speak when you are spoken to
blood flows in the desert
yes i can make it through
when the feeling calls
wait take your time
sunshine shine on shine on you
hold on hold on
how many times is time enough
you're not that innocent
out of all my disbelieving
see the more we find
how can it be so hard when all there is to know
a child begins to play
as the power proves you right
a question of origin
just what keeps us so alive
devotion fast enough together
took upon themselves to guide us
the secret of
it's what keeps us so alive
nothing can change us now
as i will always need you inside my heart
so we worked all around amidst the glory of life
taking aback instead of giving taking aback more or less

two million people barely satisfy

something calls at reverse and it comes to you
i would have waited forever for you to return into my life
experience everything but dont let the land slide
to be the true you
if only you knew
to be the true you
if only you knew
then i take a deep breath and know that you understand
you caught me when i was falling
so you give me this big story
blasting all their lives away
seen as a godsend to us
a simple peace
running
there can be no denying
this time brothers in time
as it kicks on time
seen as a godsend to us
i am a camera
there where the lens is wide
you can fool yourself
it's a constant fight
look out look around
it happens in every way
there's a crazy world outside
nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere
nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere
as you happen to say
it can happen to everyone eventually
beginning is one place i've been before
make me believe again
free to believe again in my human side
making me see again

how ya gonna laugh when the joker forgets his lines

ooh ya ooh ya ooh ya
that's seen as we go
choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor

his heart that touches me
you got to stand stand to to together
not afraid to learn new words
rhythm of sunfire
some people see it
the spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark
the more we live the more we learn the more we know
conserving the fate of the world we grow
to lose control
never underestimate a giver
never let the fools destroy your dreams
it's the balance of this everyday feeling
political ends as sad remains will die
coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed
just remember when you're gone there's someone after you you

so the ends meet the river's son
in the days of summers so long

and achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
crossed the line around the changes of the summer
now that it's all over and done
the solution
there must be more to this life than we all know
giving it out
down we go
set yourself free
it's all up to you
cutting our musical solidarity
to your destiny
i dont believe in devils
as long as we see there's only us who can change it
and in a time that's closer life will be even bolder then
have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again
have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong
there's a word and the word is love and it's right for me
it's the sound they make in heaven
everybody wants some
just wishing for the secret
everybody wants some
the signals coming to you

moments decide
now he's marching soldiers in the rain as on to war they rode
he's going home
there is no heart in harold land
how can the wind with so many around me
me
relates to all the words sung
i feel lost in the city
emotion revealed as the ocean maid
all the interest shown
the mother earth
look around you as you drift downstream
love me
like rivers our hearts entwine

two hearts are better hearts
you sing the answers question time
one heart's for love

lost in one embrace
how you understand my life
always doors to lock away your dreams
after all your soul will still surrender
just looking around ev'rywhere

waiting in the night
round and round and round i go
just as long as you have control
just as long as you bring the power
they will give you light
in the night of nights
making the world
and the wish you are
reaching for the farside show
they will bring the rain
it will count for you
so close so let your heart enter
dancing
dancing on the out earth
whole
dont forget to seek out the world
you get the heaven you like
can it all betray
is it any wonder in my lifetime
even tho' i make it up as i go on
the horoscopes you read everyday
pushing the real world away
supposed to feel
yesterday my history
chasing the reason
talk to me
is there something that
your voice is the perfect key
talk to me
are you ready for this if you're ready to believe it treasure you'll find
wanting to feel wanting to feel just what it means to be free
are you ready for love
on a beach
this dialogue
new ways of letting go
singing as one
there can be no stopping what is ever changing
we will be forgiving to the ones we love
ready or not
ready or not
that will eventually bring our living once more with you
as you hurtle to fear midst the challenge of everyone
where we are coming from
onward through the night
onward through the night
i believe that
when the change is gonna come
it's time to face reality
in disguise
i believe it
open your eyes and discover
change is gonna come

squire
i've been all around the world and seen so many faces
and we will find that we we need to be where we belong
create a new dimension
i learn in ev'ry single day
and one peculiar point i see
saying we have the whole world in our hands
when what you'll see
my eyes convinced eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
down at the edge round by the river
i get up i get down
i have time oh let clay transform thee so
as winter calls he will starve
he would touch her
remembered all those many years ago
as a pearl deep in your eyes
all those many years ago
wanting to know where it begins
our existence caught in the blink of an eye
wanting to know where it begins
religion man made
beyond the sun
all the fear i feel from doubt
the more we feel alone
tell the moon dont tell the marcher
we have heaven
all the life
every life

turn the night into daytime
viva las vegas
well i'm glad just to get on and home tonight
you been layin out all night long
just to have you do me good
lying near a pile of wood
when i i woke up with wood
i get a little crazy but i wont be denied
rumbling in a world of swirl
we was goin to the country for what we came for
ride my chevrolet
you didnt have to love me like you did
you didnt have to squeeze it but you did
you didnt have to shake it but you did
i want to thank you
i'll shoot it to you straight and look you in the eye
isis with the scroll of life
love was the curse upon my soul
i'll live again
i shall live again there is no end
i sold myself the death of me
denied of this life is what you are to be
something is very wrong
just to be shunned away by you
the charred remains of the holy rollers
fear the angels holocaust they're screaming
the last goodbye to those she loves
she wants to live
of flesh and blood she leaves
free from a life of despair
awakened from this nightmare
the tragedy still haunts her
be strong ride forth in pride
cause on this day in this hour it's coming true
marked with the proper math the child's none to late
born of the beast in eastern sands
forever we will be
feeding you the inner beast
side by side
you've got to see
bow down your head
now behind your reflection
lies foolish lies
living life in total lies
initiate the beginning
to unleash my retribution
no turning back
in the end all is sinful
for you i feel no sympathy
i am the one that binds this world
you'll see the things i see
every note
make my sacrifice
take the traitors thieves and liars
cast their bodies to the flames
their ignorance brought about undying pain
guardians of primordial light
from the war and deceit which infests our world
walk a little faster now
dont expect sympathy
your money's gone
schaffer
now our world crumbles it's happening within
oh you ought to know
shackles slice her virgin wrists
when was created the murky haze
standing now before her eyes
can one man feel
thanks maker for questions unanswered
cluttering up his thinking
so the beast resides in me
set in motion now armageddon
chorus
now disciples of the watch
questing through the nine plains of hell
for this is where all things are left behind
a hurricane of hate mocks their helpless pleas
the sullen and the vain
howling to the sky
medusa's inner soul
they'll suffer here eternally
the traitors freeze for all eternity
unaware of what ive become
experimenting to understand the human soul
unlocking the human life force
the deal was rigged
you will obey your destiny
i will refuse to be his slave
challengers call him from all around
when the smoke clears he will arise
the blistering rays of hate strengthen me
we shall rise and conquer
in the twilight of morning i rest my weary eyes
not longer than nine score
and though my blood runs cold
and die for mankind's sins
it's in your eyes where deception lies
a holy predator the wolf in sheepskin
i've gotta do as you say not as you do
you're a man of the cloth i'm comin for you
i see her face it comforts me
the order of the dragon i feed on human life
i am the dragon of blood a relentless prince of pain
for centuries past many tribes know the tales
a techno city state
you'll live your life a slave
patient and contrived
with our technology
to everything that's pure
but if you just submit
has to break these chains
overwhelmed by the mourning process
robbing graves of the nearly dead
he turns his back on his own creation
now you're always searching
you pray the lord my soul to keep
you speak to me
here i'll walk in the field where i fight
this isnt what i planned
oh when i need you
what makes it hurt so bad
the wind it blows cold
you are the chosen ones
earth fire water and air
the pain it shows
hell it put me through
god knows why
you shamed meyou shame god
i'm hiding right here inside you
evil takes my soul
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
here is our fate
we're damned by our youth
so we take the final step
last december
visions come and visions go
the reflection an aging soul
schaffer
i see the sadness in their eyes
the things i've said and done
look at the pain around me
nothing less nothing more
there is one choice that i see
singing of a word
as the moon fades away
everyone's in grave danger
you wont see us there you wont feel our stare
now you're frozen there in your human shell
so heed my warning before our own existence falls near extinct
oppressed for centuries await the prophecy
and so our world is doomed we'll lay claim again some day
i know it's wrong i cant deny
pure evil
we paint the sky with blood tonight
and as my life slowly fades away
lifeless cold and grey
nor of ones you leave
lyrics schaffer
i brought this all upon myself
musiclyrics schaffer
now i'm just a puppet god for the devils own descent
and will the wrath of god have mercy on my soul
father said worry not what they say
hear what i say
it's a leap of faith
storming demons travel through the night
what is this that i have done
my life's my own it's my pride
i vindicate and cleanse the earth of all mankind
i bide my time planning your fate
on the sixth day
i walk the earth another day
descending angelic force
she swore an oath an allegiance
prechorus
bridge
repeat chorus
forced power besieged in me
this is the path that i choose
y erik my love i've waited all my life for you
carlotta's head and the other death's i planned
y m what's behind the mask
bound forever to this barren land desolate
as you plead on your knees
on the night that it came to me
chorus
the henchman awaits you
i chose this fate no turning back
undying in his will to kill his bloodlust is profound
for the families of these bodies which held such precious life
demonic clown and shapeshifter
watch it beat as you cry
for weeks and weeks i cried
oh i know oh i know
i know he's an angel now
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
into the burning lake of fire
brings me to my knees
fill it with sweet desire
bridge
our sacrifice reality
we knew it was the end
what will be the price
our fathers told us of this hell
there i was in the garden of eden the serpent more crafty
searching for someone to devour and destroy
master master of disguise
master master of disguise
you need another way a shelter from the war
you're staying down too long it's time for you to fly
answer to the master when we reach our destiny
and mind collide
but somewhere along this road
with nothing no words to say
selling their pride and temptation to hide
twisted by tales of a demon
when the heart is blind
hunting you down soon or later
and they've got control of me
your memory's haunting me
burning burning for your love
when the sun goes down
a street smart talker with a gun in his hand
the city's on fire
stepping closer to the grave
dont you know judgment day is at hand
it's your life in the palm of your hand
in the light are you ready to stand
see the tears roll down another victim of the night
your heart is bought and sold
cross to bear
for every mile there's a party to see
one hot jacuzzi big swimming pool
down so low and maybe more
passion like adrenaline
everything i do and everything i say
every little word and every little thought
all fired up and ready to go
the lightening flashes through the wasteland
still there is famine floods and earthquakes
find your way to saving grace
face the grand illusion you hide behind the mask
sin after sin nailed to the cross
better turn yourself another page
so you better pray there's no delay
stuck in the middle in the dead of night
when i saw the smoking gun
i had to change my evil ways
in my time of trial and agony
you want to have it all
now you refuse to listen
but i say your headed for a fall
in the hot desert sand
keep your eye on the prize
gggg grin
grin and bear it
your sanctuary is hanging from a chain
soon the sun will shine just hold the line hold the line
i hear the sweet voice of the love i cant deny
i'll be with you all the way
what will i see
i ask you this have i gone too far
i'll wait for you
to make it right
you choose between wrong and the right
you read the horoscope and swear your palms read
ready to stand your ground
take the promise of the word
let your love shine on through the night yeah
got to find the narrow way that leads to paradise
taking our place with the ancient of days
as the mist upon the highlands
lost forever
you never come down
free yourself before it's too late
left a bitter taste a heart of stone
i'll wait for you
take my hand we'll start again
to turn the hand of fate
cant you see our love is so right
i've tried everything i could find
i'm walking in paradise
i'm walking in paradise
forever i'll share life with you
knowing what's on the line
open up your eyes
now turn away
there's still time to turn away
never surrender no take the power of love
and never surrender
what really matters when i cross the finish line
caught up in a rat race playing in the devils game
living in the fast lane and i'm burning the flame
she always was a winner
secret lover comfort me
speak the silence talk to me
i've finally found my home with you by my side
now i realize cant live without you
so i get out of bed
but since you've been gone
your telegram
i'm out of my head
and his spirit's dying on the way
stealing everywhere and no one seems to care
where's the peace where has it gone
reflecting like a mirror
heading from the east into west la
that perfect stranger stand in line
together we can have it all
together we'll share in the harmony there without treason
stand or fall
tears in the eyes of the world
dying traditions selfish ambitions
in the silence of the night can you hear the cries
into the valley of sorrow
into the night they will ride
solo
there's no turning back
when he's running with the pack
another mindless crime
papers signed at immigration
into the air to fly gracefully
when you're under the gun it's a cold sensation
when you're under the gun it's a blue damnation
freezing by the fire while you're chilling to the bone
victim of the system living in the city
deadly stare into the monitor screen
my remote controller's in my hand
visual decline etched upon my mind
i've got a brand new band
and you walk inside my shoes
but momma i aint now painted clown
'cause life aint no crime
i hope someday you see what i see
walk away you're a prisoner of lies
it's only fear itself that keeps you chained alive
am i wrong or right
but i could feel him
am i wrong or right
sick and tired of being pushed around
cant hear the river run without a sound
double chorus
shine brightly while you can
i feel the warming one
all around
all around
see the rising sun
i wanna tell you
all the people
hear the voices
hear the voices
nothing seems right
but you wont get far
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
never givin up on the wrong
respect the sacrifice
when you're looking out of control
trying to take another ride
all my troubles soon be leaving
mine
turns them into real things
closing all the doors
with some cat inside
with the neon ghosts in the city
beautiful girl stay with me
well i do hope it's not too free
uneasy with your morons smile
for all who never began
in the shadow of death
of my endless search
when the love around
of your needs
and you cant find love
push away those bitter tears
one day i think i know myself
my mind is a planet
body language
body language
where has our innocence gone
are you comfortable in your skin
some days i am everything i hate
it's no use pretending
i love the day in the life
dont stop it
cause i understand
in the dark of night
here comes the clown
i wish you were
read the late paper it was full of bad news
take the chains from your mind
light beams from outer space
communication disinformation
so entertaining
show us the truth
got to find a reason
put a rope around
comes around knocking down doors
before they cut your roses down
letting god's tyres down
argue with itself
in a moment's glory
we're making trouble
who's going to teach me
use your delusions
if you push to hard baby
use my delusions
counted out in loss
taking over
whispering
i'm looking this way
trying to do to me
with the look in her eye
look at them go
with the look in its eye
never will ignore
feelings that you know
you're so fine
disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear
lose my mind
lose my mind
rocket shoes on our feet
the darkness is like a fog
each one has a purpose making borders on the land
ah ah ah ah
a place to work and grow
ah ah ah ah
heart shaped hedges
say when you get up
it's just the first star
public transit
money can buy almost anything
the tender heart we will ignore
sometimes you get kicked
when the mountain moves away
baby look ahead
kill the pain you feel
take the curtains down
we find the seeds of doubt
look a little closer
these passions never seem to end
chorus
good intensions are not enough
sweet perfume trails behind
you look around
to seduce and bewitch
enough was enough
your wondering what you seeing
gonna laugh it up
we're looking out to you
some interpretation
inside yourself
so you want me there now
sky is blue i'm watching you
and the stars
the sky is blue i'm watching you
on the radio
where they have control
they said
enough is enough anyway
what i say now
thinking
just for you and me
that's what you asked for
dont you feel it sinking
that's what you asked for
choices made to be
hallucinate
the number eight
fabricate
fascinate
clear the state
dessegregate
a white black state
emulate
deviate
why things are going this way
love is dangerous
is there more to this love
i am not alone
is there more to this love
i am not alone
she gives me reason
shake the tree you find
she gives me reason
in perfect time
must be the time to rearrange it all
one day he wakes up to a different drum
give it up let him in
give it up she is rising
she is rising
and from each moment
this is the story
when does that thing
the skin is deep
when it does that thing
yeah you got a plan
shining star yeah

ah elegantly wasted
trust like the air we breathe
change keeps us moving on
everything you do for me

built upon the hazy plan
history's written always red

to the answers
of romance's
navigation of desire in my heart

message received loud and clear
there's jan calling from the rooftops
her friends wont argue
her peoples needs their basic rights right
noble word to me
of all we seem to be

if a had a chance at all
the echoes of a life

to catch ourselves
storey to storey
but my mouth my mouth is shut
i dont see
men and women

but there's holes in your sacred sails
not enough time for every kiss
and every touch and all the nights
and everyone to you

rolling the dice of their life
but i'll keep listening
sun ra

and there was a time when the facts did stare
but did you know of the murder committed
dream on black boy
dream on the name of love yeah
give me fever like a man blind from passion
how can you stop when you dont know how to start
how does a child become a man without a child
sees no tomorrow
it's like were staring at the sun
your giving up on the future honey
these are the crimes
these are the crimes crimes
the swing into never never land
the swing into never never land

but there will always be doubt
i play russian roulette
he's on his knees
counted out in loss
oh shadow take me
maybe we came to the wrong show
we are the vegetables
well i've got this feeling in the back of my head
i walk this mile
like anyone
you look for love
picks you up and drives you down again
i've come a long way by car
fed on your mind
all the facts before me

and the reasons why you're living

i'll be your one
that's what i have
all men i'll take you
i say loving heart
all men

poison in the well
there's a woman downstairs
this time with a fireplace
and then i wonder why i'm here
what there is for me
and try to take the hurt
kill for gain or shoot to maim
go to war again blood is freedom's stain
as the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
dance to their song
so if you're looking for a good time
you can take my honest word for it
everybody stops and turns to stare at you
what you want
it's no life for you stop all that screwing
there's no time to waste
roll over spin round to come in behind them
run live to fly fly to live do or die
was born a son

shellshock in the kitchen
tables start to burn
in the village
just for a second a glimpse of my father i see
we're blood brothers we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers we're blood brothers
and if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
blood on the worlds hands
it's out of control
and one day it could be happening to us
beauty not needed here
messiah before his fall
where is salvation now
in a brave new world
if i said i'd take you there
charlotte you've got your legs in the air dont you hear all the laughter
dont you care who you let in
'cause you're making love all day
god knows he wants to go home
smiles as the flames sear his flesh
you'll burn again tonight
and you know that this moment in time is for real
have you ever talked to someone
leaving you to count the cost
'cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
pour from the eastern sands
but you dont know how
all my hopes and expectation
is this a new reality
i only dream in black and white
nothing that i can compare
i only dream in black and white
lost a parallel existence
i only dream in black and white
sitting here i think it's gonna be a new day
gonna keep on roaming gotta sing my song
and it wont take long
killed the beast
one man and his honour
repeat chorus
fly and touch the sun
fly as high as the sun
i'm scared for life but
i am living in my own world
fortunes of war no pain anymore
you're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
a rat in a trap but you've got to survive
in gangland murder's up for sale
as they fought a viscious angry battle
so they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
yesterdays sorrows tomorrows white lies
i shall return from out of the fire
just a babe in a black abyss
as the eye of the sun rose on her lips
no storm or heavy weather
mesmerises one of the wedding guests
hoping good luck it brings
a terrible curse a thirst has begun
water water everywhere nor any drop to drink
death and she life in death
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
but they lived on so did he
see them stir and they start to rise
the mariner's left alone
that we must love all things that god made
but many came too much for cree
soldier blue in the barren wastes
out of money out of luck
chorus
harris murray di'anno
he spends all his time on gambling and guns
chorus so give me sanctuary from the law
and i'll be alright
chorus
you've got to hope when you are falling
on towards the sea we go
one in front with a cross held high
why then is god still protecting me
and the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes
the name of the rose a fire in the sky
ohi never felt so strange
all my life's blood is slowly draining away
hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
nobody there to reason why
when i cry there isnt a sound
night and day i scan the horizon sea and sky
lost and far from home
so all alone
sunlight falling on your steel
life is like a wheel and it's rolling still
what are we fighting for
where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
why did they make a war
the choosing of guns or fighting with swords
the best man wins in the end
the angel of death hears your last breath
where the blood red journey ends
and for my sins they gave me one
and the temptation is to take it all to far
now i stand alone in the darkness
reflecting on my past life and it doesnt have much time
it's not so easy to stop from screaming
catch my soul it's willing to fly away
but i never have felt no i never have felt this way before
i have a lust for the earth below
chorus
i cant accept my soul will drift forever
when you werent there to help me
i never had no trouble
lord i'm running
they're coming in from the sea
the vikings are too many
axes grind and maces clash
you'd better get away
as it falls upon the floor
up above my head iron maiden wants
cluthching at straws to find a way
if you had the chance again
all of my life i have believed
killer behind you
compelling to satisfy me
in the house of my soul
knife of the truth
look for the truth
fate has brought me to these shores
i dont want existence to end
saints and sinners
what we deserve we just dont get you see
branded a leper because you dont fit
mother russia how are you sleeping
now it has come freedom at last
it was cold it was starting to rain
there's some people coming down the street
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
murders in the rue morgue
should i return to the scene of the crime
gers dickinson harris
i accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
you're the phantom of the opera you're the devil you're just out to scare
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
so bring me the blood and red wine
but open the gates of my hell
slave to the power of death
i'll die oh please
oh help me please
and it's driving me mad
the bushes with it open wide
repeat
with every step you tread
it seems so futile
turn to look at who's on your heels
pay to kill die to lose
nowhere to run nowhere to hide
toe to toe throw the line
show them no fear show them no pain
nomad where you go to no one tells
your reputation goes before you they all say
your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
nomad you're the spirit that men fear in us
were they reflections of my warped mind
666 the number of the beast
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
you wont get away from my grasp
you have on us all
dont you stray from the narrow way
i'm on the run i'll kill to eat
i know where i'm goingout
you'd better scratch me
but what makes a man decide
a new generation brings
i will live forever
wider divide that you can see between good and bad
you'll take my life but i'll take yours too
and as we race towards the human wall
and as i lay there gazing at the sky
is there something that you'd rather be
all my life i've run away
do you really care what people think
he knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
he can push his own boat as you set up off the track
in the kingdom of the sands
on the desert the planet dune
he has the power to foresee
true leader of men
cold as steel the darkness waits its hour will come
to crush them like a fly
gone ar the days when men looked down
i cant get used to purgatory you know it really makes me cry
i try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
i close my eyes and think of home
cant ease this pain so easily
no one should go where eagles dare
it's really impossible to climb
i was born into a scene
until i find him
some say it shouldnt matter
until i find him
i have sailed to many lands now i make my final journey
take my heart and set it free
i will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
forever now i cant think why
you get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
for a devil to get ready and take over your mind
and the power is inside me i've decided to pray
'cause i am the chosen one
to banish the conqueror who's taken the land
we will engage
forces united forces arise
forces united forces arise
i fought for liberty and faith
be with you after this war
the iron will survive
into the unknown
ghostlike appeared in the sky
assailant lash of the world
a heep of debries
enslave us and chain us
broke all the dreams of unification
all you do is to back at the moon
in her cold embrace we will find our graves
atlantic will fall life it will finally decent
brought us to the lair
the stars are black beyond the gate
lost in the void
the stars are black beyond the gate
out of the black abyss
just like a machine programmed and build to obey
where the perfect people life perfect lifes
escape the nightmare you cant even dream
of biogenetic design
kie
it this you like thunder draging you ander
you're plaing with fire
gonna wrack you up please break in up
the sleeper is trying to get in contact with the bio unit of the savior they are the last ancient atlantian beings which makes them brothers of the past
brother before it's too late
together we're facing our destiny
this is our legacy
102
that is might be related to the lost
be the guardian to guide us
let us life or let us end
be the leader to lead us
lost in the dark millenniums ago
distant voices sources unknown
is it for real will we fall
509
my future is calling i know
out future is calling i know
save me before i will drown
come and and take me home
my life's redefined
i've been the dragon and once i've been strong
my own peace of mind
they haunt me no more
music and lyrics by excelsis
so dont come to grief
your ancient land
seems now the tables will turn
eye of the world
into the night moonless cold and black
eye to eye facing a deadly thread
flames of fury like the purgatory
and victory is on your side
twisting in your head
solo 2 piet
you closed his eyes
dont look back just keep up the faith
starwings engaging
they're thrusting their way
dragons of light
fires in the sky
hopeless
for the freedom
liar
for the freedom
return and let your soul take control
for the freedom
hello is anybody out there
and forevermore our union will remain
i have no fear
music and lyrics by k hansen
now you're up there above the clouds
circuits chips and bits and bytes
you were supposed to be a millions dream
and this illfated devastating
for i've been so wrong
sorrow and grief possessed my heart
solo piet
one of a kind
out in the void of the vast
now i can see
a shadow from somewhere beyond
oh atlantis i hear your call
a body of metal a mind made of circuits
the power has brought me to live
the silence of ungiven answers will drive me insane
going insane lakes of doubts
give me guidance in torrents of time
i am your leader
we will attack
on fire they ride

the bio unit is about to return to the reality of lifefor far too long it has been wandering through a world of dream illusions and madness it wants to return from his prison in the void
countless years of existence in the cold
but then i found sanctuary
now i must use it to leave my
i have been seeing the light
and the time of unification for all of mankind is about to come
i must gain control
justice i'll defend guardian of the land
sheltered and hidden from the human race
riding on fire and your heart it dies
riding on fire take you up so hind
the tyrant will die on the day that you'll return
riding on fire and your heart it dies
we're the warriors of light
termination extirepation
the forces of darkness will burn
the innocence of madness seems to grow
i've seen the madness down below
'cause i'm riding on solar wings
the fugitives of atlantis are searching the vastness of space to find a new homefor several generations this trek of the last survivers has been on the quest they are the starborn children of atlantis
forever we're riding
from all we've left behind
starborn children their destiny
music and lyrics by p sielck
will i live will i die
wings launch weapons load
in unit we stand to fight to fight
nazareth
that you wish upon
blackness everywhere and little lights shine
got the headphones up high
when we meet again baby
in peace and in silence
the chains that have held us are broken
the shadows of war
free and united
jan the conqueror's been banished
the throne in the sky now is
the fortress has vanished
i'm watching the mountains
cause i'm watcher in the sky
i'm not a man i'm not machine
of a lifeless cold machine
bit i am lost in time
you never be free
i was just a lad nearly twenty two
originally contained in genesis' the lamb lies down on broadway
if you know what i mean what i mean
gave my heart deep in hell
handing out their trash
he said i had none to blame but me
be your husband if you'll be my wife
dont you treat me so doggone mean
in a little cafe just around the bend
i am calling you oh
and in that hold there was a bed
by his bedside standeth a stone
babyyou're so cruel
these are dreams of mine
yeah you're moving moving on again
why did you come here
you undo you life with too much cocoon
by the light of the sun murder comes
how would you like to be the happiest man in the world
fare thee well my honey fare thee well
when i wore my apron low
i'd be at home in my mama's bed
with her head in her hands
your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
did you really think this bloody road would
pave the way for you
you better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye
i'll be waiting right here just to show you
how our love will blow it all away
i know everybody here thinks he needs you
while this time's busy sleeping
dont fool yourself she was heartache from the moment that you met her
tell myself over and over you wont ever need her again
long enough for the clouds to fly me away
and i feel them drown my name
tell the man i'm never coming back again
blood red with flaked gunshot glitter
left my coins behind
the parting was mutual the moment i became
i heard there was a secret chord
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
there was a time when you let me know
it's not somebody who's seen the light
lay your nails down till they rake over me
my world repeated my love
and take away my blues
paranoia will write the world prayer
bolt the doors and hire your guards
hmmm it's a brand new power
when i count down from ten
you are soft and young to me
if we wanted to be
and all the past we once knew
if we wanted to be
they say every man needs protection
all day long i hear him shout so loud
but a little cry wants someone badly
'cause i cry all over madly
dont do anything to it with me
kisses in my mouth with his
i remember the words that you told me
i never want to see my face
sweat pours down
because the lies of the spirit possessed you
say for me that i'm all right though things get kind of slow
her stay
so long ago when i was small
rien que nous deux
ah mon amour
even pepi from napoli
maybe it's still there still there today
i know you are a woman by the way you burn below
crystalize illusion shine forgot i'm here
jewel box of sadness bring to catch your tear
she takes just like a woman yes she does
she takes just like a woman yes she does
i cant stay in here
then you ache just like a woman
you were at the party
saint john
hot sweet and tight
resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
that's what
j buckley
baby maybe it is just because i didnt know you at all
maybe you didnt know him at all
under a lilac tree
lilac wine i feel unsteady like my love
i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
child you know how much i need it
ohor will i ever learn
my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
'cause it's not too late
an cov'rin the crossroads i'm standing at
but mama you're just on my mind
i'm lying in my bed
the memories fire the rhythms fall slow
it's you i've searched so hard for
spring water on the floor of this
bliss the abyss
she cheated and she lied and you stole her
can you hear my love again x4
all for the law of gravity
and the price of admission
i had to send it away to bring us back again
what am i still to you
i have no right to wonder just how or when
your whole family's splintered
no stars to revolve around
there is no single entrance
feel no shame for what you are
fall in light fall in light
leave your home car leave your pulpit
fall in light fall in light
all young lovers know why
dont know what you asked for
so new to your bedroom floor
so new to your bedroom floor
it's overflowing now inside you
how many times have you heard someone say
but one thing's gone for certain when it comes my time
take away these thoughts of mine
dig the holes for me to sleep inside
dig the holes for me to sleep inside
she is free
i thought i'd hurt my mother
back when i was a baby a baby saying his prayers
lauraknow this song for always
although the door was open there's nothing left for you now
strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
and jump the hedges first
oh oh sweet thing sweet thing
my my my my my sweet thing
oh sweet thing sweet thing
nevermind now with your heart how much he's all
and i'll keep you happy for the rest of your natural born days
gone astray
good riddance goodbye
there is nothing sadder than
and when her baby comes to call
watch the evil black the sky
to the people that the public can ignore
let's see you take another drag
that will now black the sky
i have no fear of this machine
love that's the right time
do do do do
and turned to each other saying 'i love you baby i love you'
good night
come and call the question
please let me bring back this gifts of mine to the woman
i'm your loan shark of bliss
when you see my face
mother dear the world's gone cold
what will you say
what will you say
jbuckley
he's out there somewhere still
we're all lying natural
i cant help from looking outside for a guarantee
through the yard through the yard of blonde girls
so run run run run run run run
so run run run run run run run
fear we may come
if we had only known in a way
i adore you
you and i you and i you and i
kitty your flesh is so nice
come on and let me give you that o
your flesh is so
i run on empty too much it's just my way
i fight my insticts all the way
easy come and easy go
though people say it turns you blind
are you satisfied
than they are now
when you pull me in and everything is
all the things you want from me
how how do you do it
it's like i've always wanted to feel this way
than just a time between tomorrow and yesterday
when i'm going somewhere going nowhere
i'm feeling fit to burst
you're never going to say the things you want to say
like try to write a song but in never rhymes only sometimes
that is waiting patiently
the romantics out there say
you're evil personified come to avenge
the state of us now is this how it'll always be
you came at the right time filled the right space
the greats of ths world would hang their heads in despair
so i'm trying to clear my head so i'll be
you can dream
'cos the rubbish i talk is getting deep
oh we had some magic and used it all
and i'd rather be damned 'cos i know
thought about me thought about you
i dont know if i care
so insecure
i'm burning
i'm burning
well he he hey yeah
you know that sleep is getting hard to get
it really gets me down

for climbing a mountain for taking a gamble
mary hangs from the rearview mirror
but i still want it
you take these broken bones
i changed my name and you changed your mind
now something just went wrong inside of my head
cheap greeting cards hollywood films
i could get a job in a bank
and it's truer now than ever before
we stumble through
i think i know what you mean
do you feel real
and if so i'd like to know
do you really feel real
do you feel real
bob dylan didnt have this to sing about you
and if anything
watching the world wake up from history
nothing ever goes quite as planned
we just need someone to blame
she's my
there is no good no evil only me
on the wall there is a red light
let all in
stripped oh
time that i took what's mine took it now
things arent what they where they're what they are
and dream of better things to see
i couldnt tell yo if it's black or white
and i dont mind all the things they say about you

how about that

will make your face go pale
at the outside at the outside at the outside at the outside
who am i
live fast die young the words of a fool it seems
timebomed stick around see it all go up in smoke
that separates light from dark
when it's yours that is the lions share of
you dig your own grave
expecting me to share your views
this time the revolution will be computerised
the oceans part and the patterns in my mind
cash to jim i took it home
my first and last time with you
my luck should be so bad now
a little flat tin case is all you need
i know my clothes seem shabby
in the haze of smoking pleasure
has changed his world my friend
wont be what i dont want to be
ages passed i knew at last
in all good places
through far marches of acres wild
with cement fingers
giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be
will you still be there further on
will you still be there further on
eats but one in every ten
no the mouse police never sleeps
hope everybody's dancing to their own drum this fine morning
so take a minute to remember the part of you
well there has to be some better way
apogee through the night
tight lipped soldier on
i'm gonna get some
pink cotton undies and blue telephones
watching as the frilly panties run
and warms his feet
when the ice that
stand naked with a telescope
under a big sky
you to yours and me to mine
astronomy
so why are you holding my hand tonight
so why are you holding my hand tonight
the script is blowing out to sea
but the rock and roll star knows his glory is really nothing
but god is laughing up his sleeve
automotive science and engineering
things are humming
they didnt see me wink my eye
having chosen nothing
where no one can ring me at all
just wond'ring what things to do
what the hell was i thinking
she's a breath of champagne on sparkling night
you can call me on another line
ale spew puddle brew boys throw it up clean
throw soft shadows on the water in the night
as the ship moves sadly from the pier
died in the falklands on tv
there's a child and a woman praying for an end to the mystery
where the real mountain men are kings
got nothing but sit in the sun
him resurrected from the grave
in chains of history
you'll be praying till next thursday to
i really dont remember
i could he sitting on the left of you
who's got the cheque on this hot dinner
i go weak kneed at the suggestion of you
to snatch you if you fall
and swing your big bear down
well there is no rehearsal
but the safety curtain falls
and the prompter in his corner is sorry that he came
the first violinist's hands are chilled
i looked out of my window saw a stencil black
no step no step
no step no step
wet pavements thin apartments
are you on routine assignment
feel my steps quick in the headlights
black and viscous bound to cure blue lethargy
prices boom in aberdeen and london town
be happy my way
there's good times to be had
no i say i have the answer
ceilings crash the walls collapse
paint your own deceiving sign
nothing to say
to trip you up
occasional demons too
sheepdogs howl make tracks and growl
on eddies whirled in beech leaves furled
another tea time another day older
who hides his head pretending to sleep
as i pull on my old wings one white duck
so fly away peter and fly away paul from the
i'm available for consultation
the critics falling over to tell themselves he's boring
``but you're wrong steve you see it's only solitaire''
so come up singing above the cloudy cover
i'm high on your love and i feel fine
old dog of experience
ripping through the black and yellow cabs
dodging rickshaws and the bicycle boys
well meaning overkill
and while the child within is raging
they just tell me gotta close it hard
make a marked card play
`til the force comes through
by dun ringill
there's a wink of seduction from the mainland
singing the mainland blues
island in the city cut by a cold sea
it's really up to her
washed up a new identity
to the warmer beat of my european legacy
fallen on hard times but it feels good to know
giving us a hard time my friends
nine miles of two strand topped with barbed wire
and the big road's pushing through along the valley floor
they say they gave me compensation
no chance of finding a woman who
i believe in fires at midnight
fold your clothes neatly away
dont lay your bait while the whole world waits
did our friends all catch the needle match did we
did our friends all catch the needle match did we
not fishers of men
no hope of immigration keep on passing through
no one left the tale to tell
calling my name into the night
which at one time it seemed like a dream
it was they who were wrong
and the ape's curiosity
walking with you
they grow very still
jack kerouac ren'e magritte to name a few of the heroes
through clear skies tracking lightly from far down the line
fail safe forget the things that you saw
a few bridges tonight
the tall general points
is crossing
of the convenient alliance
my head wont deliver well i'm sold down the river
but i'm turning again
yes `n i'm turning again
hard liner she brings ice when i bring fire
how does she retain my heart's desire
but i remember warm and loving nights
she's a real hard liner
face up on the last card
i'll close my eyes and count to ten
cold drink in your hand
no use trying to board the train
flies at the nostrils plunder
let me find you a filly for your proud stallion seed
and you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls
bring a song for the evening
thrill to the sound of all
heavy water on me
what goes up has to fall back down
i'll be here to do all things to comfort you
and let the angels take me home
to where the path was barred
boot leather flashing and spurnecks the size of my thumb
i'm just a normal low born so and so
oh jesus save me
got no reason to go anywhere no friends call anymore
taking on the simple life and i feel the grass roots growing
all the places i've been make it hard to begin
and i wont worry about a thing
well i'm thinking it does to me
i try to get through to what lies deep inside of you
scattered all around
i'm a monkey puzzle and the lid is on
can you guess my name and can you guess my trade
and have you guessed my trade
staked a claim in your heartlands put grain in your store
strange avenues where you lose all sense of direction
and somewhere in the crowd i think i hear a young girl whisper
she walks between the lines
stuck out in the august rain
while your mummy's at home a sleeping
get out and get what you can
red lights pin stripes short step shuffle into the night
well the dawn was coming
no sense in sitting there hating everyone
what i was looking for got something on my mind
the chequered flag sweeps across the oil slick track
two biscuits and the morning paper mystery
the lemming hearted hordes
in high rise city canyons dwells the discontent of ages
synthetic chiefs with frozen smiles holding unsteady courses
oh gladys
felt a searching hand to frisk her
got fixed up now she's doing fine yeah
he said ``you'll need someone to help you
up that dusty hill on the rattlesnake trail
i'm going on the rattlesnake trail
warchild dance the days and nights away
in the heart of your heart there's the tiniest part
the edge of a half dream glowing
are still here for the taking
it's the whaler's dues
money speaks soft hearts lose the truth only whispers
i am the first piper who calls the sweet tune
climb in the saddle and whistle along
all of you sit up in bed dont think in straight lines ahead
think back to that dream you had
warm rains
she peeled from a stretch black snake
mosquitoes buzzed in her hair
i'll follow you beneath this dome
all these nights playing precious games
think i see us in these promenade days
puppy dog waves on a big moon sea
still shaking my wings
it's been a long time
the old rocker wore his hair too long
and prays that he always will
so the old rocker gets out his bike
stopped off on a long drive
she went on in this way for a while
there's a ladder you can climb
oh she says
ohh oh i'd like a cup of black coffee and a piece of sweet cake
i'll be a truck stop runner
upon the snow
so i raise my lips to coax
one more arctic desert day
send the chamber pot back down the line
as you slip on the greasy platform
with someone you can trust
wrapped up in your smile
tell you when not yet
next to the transit lounge
break the story in heavy type
snap it up flash away
communications down
the news is running late tonight
could you meet the eyes of a working girl
there was a tear drop sparkle on the inside of her thigh
wont let it move me but i cant sit still
and i want it
just like me p'rhaps he's hungry
i am with him
well i'm on my way three cheers for doctor bogenbroom
he sits quietly under every tree
jack do you never sleep
oh jack please help me through my winter's night
sending water lillies sailing
dipping and weaving flutter
and the first moths of summer
in the paradise steakhouse
a sheath of steel so you may hold
i'd like to eat you i'd like to eat you
old meanings move in the drift of time
roots down in the wet clay branches glistening
try a wee sensation but first you have to want to join in
do the wolf pack crawl
with your books
strange foreign chaps in white bed sheets
like a clone smartly dressed in your pressed uniform
you and exorcise the beast
for you everywhere's a danger zone i'd love to help
let your voices swell stare that beastie in the face
oh you dont fool me `cos i know what you feel
i'll visit you down on beggar's farm
i'm beside myself
forgotten charms to soothe me
small child messing down messing down
we werent on the glasgow train
i'm the big dipper
run up to the radio calling out to the wind
steal a little inspiration steal a little muscle
looking for a face staring in from the sunshine
brightest flower in my garden
with freezing rains melting and no trains running
black sunday falls one day too soon
born in the minute of my next returning
vivas cortinas weaving in their wake
out of the north no oil rigs are drifting
all kinds of people come down for the opening
and stamps from the green shield
bless with a hard heart those who surround me
while she ran a perfect circle
along a skin of satin sea
you know it rippled just a hint of muscle
i thought i saw her at the late night restaurant
walking through forests of palm tree apartments
with claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
he's a lover of life but a player of pawns
we'll give it to john to supplement his camels he dropped on his
she made you tea
when you're stuffing yourselves at the christmas parties
with the angels of the night
in a cup of silver liquid fire
desolation of valhalla
it's the house of commons brawl
as with jackets off they fly heaven bent
to end the commons brawl
move the old lady on
to be still more independent
as your agent scores another front page photograph
tear it down in double quick time
there's a suite down at the hotel
some angel from the midwest is regretting being
best boots and road suits and nine lives
did you buy a passport from the queen
cross eyed mary goes jumping in again
cross eyed mary finds it hard to get along
all the media here for the show
a regular boy dressed in blue
but they cant seem to get the deal right
will heed the song that calls them back
pass the wit of ancient wisdom pass the cup of crimson wonder
desert candle in a tented space
and i wont peek behind those dangerous veils
desert candle in a tented space
said the butler in the hall
the big jet rumbles over runway miles
the politicians weep
where keepers kept
closed pages
dharma seek and you will find
and i've been treated for growing pains
that you've been causing me tonight
tuned to crazy imperfection
seems guaranteed to send you mad
dogs in the midwinter
you look around and every face you see
when you're looking at each other down the muzzle of a gun
she doesnt talk with workers on the rest of the line
my lady of the meadows
in which to hide my head
the thread that holds me down
misfortune like a sparrow hawk hangs over you
oh no me no saboteur
i wanna be no saboteur
but if your dream is good why not share it when the nights are cold
that separates eastern steel from western gold
she looked at me like i was jack the ripper
and i'll burn for you
and so began the age of man
then god the director smells a rat
i'll give you a steady push on a six knot simmering
his side
cecil is a sea lion
no central heating or cement
as you light your cigarette on the burning deck
as the crowd grows uneasy and the boos begin
and make no pin cushion of this big balloon
where they built their industries on the edge of town
what do you do when your river's turning blue
oo my my my
i'll sing very softly so if the phone rings
one day you'll wake up in the present day
to do the things they should have done
well do you ever get the feeling that the story's
and sometimes she does
and just when i feel like dancing
timeless unreasoning
take a hand and take a bow
you played for me that's all for now oh and never
court jesting never resting he must be very cunning
i dont believe you'll cry there'll be a smile upon your face
rare gems upon her fingers
for ten thousand years
pausing briefly in the corries
of a white london town
''permission to breathe sir'' dont talk like that i'm your old man
and only things i feel
you dont hear what i dont say
to make you feel much better than you could know
as you drag down every lover's lane
songs from the wood make you feel much better
and not the pathetic lie
are for yourself and not for me
gonna get a piece of my mind
spine tingling railway sleepers
like a faithful dog with master
on the late commuter special
hey mr policeman wont you come on over hook me up to the power lines
who's left to make the most from least
they made you feel they loved you all seeing they say
nice girl but a bad girls better qualifies in both ways
just cant help come when she calls
by hours in a minute by those ladies who bless them
stepped out on a new horizon
get the tax man to agree
should i circulate her likeness
should it be her place or mine
there was heavy traffic on the radio
barre but sometimes i'm an owl and my feathers are really smooth
to eat meat that's infected
keep the stiffly starched collar
the wardrobe mistress
but you wear the old god's horns
take your cues on the up beatbeat down
as the verses unfold and your soul suffers the long day
and the symphony sounds underground put you under duress
daddy said it's just some flickering
it's you you're the man on the tv screen
are grownups brave or do they just pretend
well i dont care to eat out in smart restaurants
well i dont know about carrying out
and i mean tall
well maybe i can stretch for it
once i used to join in
runs the all time loser
in bed and having fun
he picks up gideons bible
failing to notice pussy cat has come out to take a leak
look at the animals look at you well how would you like to queer one
he regurgitates the whole damn mess into an aluminum pail
than to spend the summer crying
and summer could have come in a day
so when you look into the sun
to see if my love has seen the light yeah
you'll see a quiet determination on his face
gonna get your attention but he's carrying his cross
hung from the highest station by his old school tie
panel beaters freshly day glow'd factory cheaters
looked at all the friends he'd made
and it seems there's no body left for tennis and i'm
it's just the nonsense that it seems''
indian restaurants that curry my brain
didnt make her with my baker street ruse
walked down by the bathing pond
with his long red beard and his sister's weird
stole it from a snow man
will look around and blame the mess
mister universe
come running up to me
your nose feels like an icicle
well it was up to me
not easy for us to do good trade
get him off that mountain
all containing
never a care with your legs in the air loving
and the long grass blows in the evening cool
of civilizations raging afar
there to powder your sweet face and paint on a smile
open your windows and i'll walk through your doors
his eyes like lights from a laser burn
trains go by
he's watching me watching you watching him
i think about the bad old days
remembering mornings shillings spent
but for your own sake remember times
tell us what the blacksmith has done for you
when he door came off its hinges like a cork from fizzy wine
if you thought they had me crucified i guess you werent there''
oh yeah when jesus came to play
the other's tapping at my car window
did she see warm safety in my numbers
i could have warmed them but the moment wasnt right
and with the clearest eyes of forever grey
or if they said that i was a fool
you had the whole damn thing all wrong
i dont believe you
washed clean by the water but nursing its pain
for him he's going to be late
with whom i can be what i want to be
just one week for the feeling to go
the excrement bubbles
searched for the last pigeon slate grey i've been told
in the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth did surprise
will the years treat us well
and for my pay i worked an honest day
and as i grew the winds of fortune blew
who would criticise my success
i'm a working john and i'm a working joe
i wont cross yours if you dont cross mine
they left for china better left for dead
there was a time for the tooth and the claw
bringing you love in the cap in his hand
i turn and walk away
you can take me home if you can take some more well all right
if you set me to simmer if you grill my steak
and they say ``hey ray let's ride away
i'll do what you want to
if you ride with me on a friday
and mars
and my rudder slowly turns me into the marylebone
til i looked around and found another song
the deadline for the headline is the breadline
big friendly cloud builds in the west
and so i watch two new suns spin
she waits in her castle of make believing
she longs for the east and a pale dress flowing
to throw us silken whispers catch us by the anchor chains
since we signed our souls away
since we signed our souls away
they'll wine you dine you undermine you
hold your head up to the gun of a million cathode ray tubes
be a quizz kid
moscow radio
from my radio free moscow
yes i'm getting pictures
and i dont care which way i ride
feels the urge to chase the sun to rest
and i dont care which way i ride
no hostage taking
no excuses for who i am
you're not seen you're not heard
what a reason for waiting
with a wintry storm blown sigh a silver cloud blew
o requiem
ring out ring solstice bells
joyful as the silver planets run
two old boys in a stolen racer black rubber contrails in
doesnt everyone have their own rock island their own little
i'll be your life raft out of here but you'd only drift right
two young cops handing out a beating
wonder who you're talking with tonight
well now how about some heavy rolling
you wont be satisfied when you feel the sudden need
and those wild cats howl running in the moonshine
the sun shines golden and i feel like my car
daddy says girl dont stay out so late
your mind says girl you gotta stick around
we'll never find the same thing
chorus
chorus
chorus
i've seen pain cloud your eyes
promise me now
down
it's a long slow slide
is for the mystery to be named
it's waiting for you
i make myself translucent
they will lay you out in moonlight
oh adrian come out and play
oh adrian come out and play
yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
he's like an unused toy
that we'd give up
try to let it show us the way
the passing steady streams
'cause if you will i will
there is no giving up in love
and if you will i will
there is no giving up in love
nibbles at your veins
screams at the sky
where's my hope
all right
everywhere i go seems like bush is on tv
getting high in america
take the bad with the good
have u heard in america
so dont you worry
sancta maria
ora pro nobis
i'm afraid i am alone
god wont you please hold me release me
show me the meaning of mercy
i reach beyond myself 2 see
oh i am not yet born
i will let you undress me
and there's no
feel your love again
break me
feel your arms again
hearts helplessly fall to the ground
stewardesses like cosmo magazine
there's not much i can say
from the air things look so ridiculous
there's not much i can say
yes i left the refrigerator door half open daddy
'cause i'm your creation i'm your love daddy
but you heart like grape gum on the ground
well it's these little times that help to remind
well it's these little times that help to remind
when you're drowning in deep water
she always looked good
she said
dont try and comprehend
oh
who whittle love down at the knees
kiss the flame
let's run with the hunted the untamed
wrapped around some mink clad smear
your bones filled with hunger
light bulbs and nylons
like an old time radio show
all you need is a heart to call home
you hunters of dreams
warm when it snows
all you need is a heart to call home
chorus
i believe in love dear
let your eyes say please i will not leave
i've heard you anguish
there are plenty of people who pray for peace
and lend out voices only to sounds of freedom
you know that aint right
to avoid the same questions we must
are all we know of love
knockin on his door again last night
you started to shout
they jingled everytime i thought of you
your brother was a rose bud
why couldnt you do the same
why couldnt you do the same
love me just leave me alone
that jesus christ is born
o'er wand'ring flock by night
that jesus christ is born
we're tired oh we are weary
and we shall lead a life uncommon
come on you unbelievers
and we shall lead
let the phone ring let's go back to sleep
it's you that i adore
we'll stay together in the end
dont think you realize the effect you have over me
they only whisper the sweet things you'd say
and it makes me want to make you near me always
till he appear'd
o night divine
the hopes and fears of all the years
o holy child of bethlehem
i come closer
it's time to start
you say space is what you need
you want a world of slaves
a thousand times or maybe just his smile
a lovely world
she went running
love i leave but only a little this world holds me still
eighty years an old lady now sitting on the front porch
she's an ugly girl she doesnt pose a threat
you say he's a faggot does it make you want to hurt him
oh jew oh jew do you hate him
then one foggy christmas eve
and if you ever saw it
then how the reindeer loved him
wont u come 2 my side
for all the songs that i can hear when u are near
la la la it's a lullaby
that she cant see over now
cuz everybody's so shriveled up inside
no matter where you go
there are souls stuck in a bone machine
mistakes are allowed when you're a
life lays out just like a road
and that we are doin fine
this thirst of mine
please let me forget
and say that you held my hand
i got a plastic jesus a cordless telephone for every corner of my room
but i've been down so long
we've been down so long
being alone used to be just fine
you're heart beats inside of me
so i drive to you tonight
know how much i love ya
the clouds in the sky are blue yea
it wanted nothing more
blue is that you
stranger enter from the east
cuz everybody needs someone sometime
cuz he thought love was best on the run
sister mary used to be a nun
for i have seen the face of love
wanting to never be seperate again
he feels little inside and filled with pride
you daddy's little boy
you're always crazy like that
well in case you failed to notice
your philosophies on art baroque moved you
somewhere along the line i must've gone
you took your coat off
but i dont want that 2 happen 2 me and u
could not be happier than me
u have 2 be careful with me
lamb of god
gloria in excelsis deo
standing with the fridge door wide open staring
it's gonna be it's gonna be it's gotta be
is that if i should fall
but still we laugh
my youth scattered along the highway
so goodbye alice in wonderland
i thought you had to love me
chorus 2
and the ones that you've been sold
ohh so goodbye alice in wonderland
cant decide if
and love equals pain
telling me i'm dirty
immune to all reason
you got glitter in your pocket
your grey matter
for light does the darkness most fear
for someone must stand up for what's right
i will get down on my knees and i will pray
we are never broken
we are god's hands
hark the herald angels sing
hark the herald angels sing
born to raise the sons of earth
the shadows in my heart
why it is i cry
and it's driving me crazy
i'm gonna haunt u girl
when jesus was born
a small pale blur
the clubs are full
we'll make a stand
we'll make a stand
so please be careful with me i'm sensitive
that way what they believe will have taken place
i'd rather see the world from another angle
there was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill
two boys are filled with violence
i want always to feel the wings of grace near
where people's souls may be seen and made safe
till you give extra whitening a try
what can u do for me
it's what there body can do for me
let ev'ry heart prepare him room
repeat the sounding joy
the lord is come
round yon virgin mother and child
silent night holy night
sleep in heavenly peace
and i'm sorry that
a very nice man
down in the hollow
this love was a bell that
on a stamp
and i'm sorry
i never got to
ruined your day
oh well
i never could comfort you
and flame licks the air
and i'm sorry
walk in a corner shop
marvin gaye there's no brother brother
we meet but do not touch
cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
beneath the darkened sky
between fight and flight
like i need you
the call tomorrow
out of the corner
and do you want me
i'm too far from home all alone on the road
and i moved his ex old lady's things out of the closet
trying to find a decent high noon cup of tea
but there's no hand to hold no doctor martin luther king

does your conscience bother you
they pick me up when i'm feeling blue
sweet home alabama
chorus
where it is that i lay it could be
let me feel your breathing
thin and graceful the sun shining through
is when that little bird little bird
a great and many faced nation
chorus
'cause there's no force to unite them
chorus
of self freed slaves
to feel how i feel now all the time
and promise me
chorus

moments in time they shared together
that we got no sense at all
and walk their floors
i cant really speak to you
they are so tough
hello all you losers
it's hard holding on to nothing
when you see her give her some compliments
you've got nothing to fear
drive through the carwash
in the valley of the thundering hearts
forget about heaven let me stay here forever
i'm beloved and betrayed
lord the higher i'll go
and i spit in the eye
i have prayed and i have sinned
lord the higher i'll go
and hold your woman in your arms
if i could just open my heart sometimes
make up my mind
under the boardwalk we'll be falling in love
under the boardwalk we'll be falling in love
he told me what he thought i should know
and once he called me cain
i played truth or dare with the angels
i need to find a warmer place to sleep
chorus
if you are one of the fortunate ones
on the wind
chorus
to find you if you're still at home
he gave you dreams and schemes that swirl
on your front door some night
would you build up your big walls
or could it be your fears
and we lived happily ever after
that we're just a pair of tumbling dice
what if i came knocking
well my girl she's a walker
i passed a very uncomfortable feeling last night
when those crazy nights come callin
and your mother was never nowhere to be found
when margaret comes to town
she likes to keep things upside down
or if she thought she was coming on to me
my biggest enemy
whenever we wanted to
with confetti in her hair
we just did what we did
standin in the darkness
standin in the darkness baby there i am
old snakey's not a sinner no he just shows us how it's done
where the world began
all the girls walked by dressed up for each other
come on out and dance
have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm
that i know
from where he might be sitting you hear him singing
see the moon roll across the stars
your life is now
if you would only show us how
your life is now

about cowboys and babies
who will love you for life
and never once complaining
everytime i fall

i wouldnt dream of letting them down
to shake up this sleepy old town
jerry holland

about half past 8
i'm gonna ask for your hand
i've got to have your full time love

this part time romance

verse 1
chorus
repeat chorus 2 times
you looked my way your eyes held something new
and into my soul
in a poor boy like me
how was i
you like romantic movies
show you you're everything that's precious to me
i would make you my world
you dont have to look very far
i would make you my world
to lose your faith in love
that you're right where you belong
but i'll walk away if you prefer
if i could wrap these arms around you
hear your heart beat
'cause if i were to sleep look at all i'd miss
or the way your body feels in my arms
'cause if i were to sleep look at all i'd miss
we can just stay right here until the moon goes down
for just you and me could make the world go away
now if you're in my arms
with everyone watching like we were insane
at sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times
i could never live without you
that takes me back to you
a little more every day
i miss you a little i guess you could say
caught by surprise i felt i was gasping for air
oh and by the way i never stopped lovin you
yeah it looks like it might rain today
if you've got love you can move a mountain
if you've got love you can move a mountain
it's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
but let me tell you
but i dream of you 'cause there's nothin finer to me
no no no no
john calvertaaron sain
country aint what i sing it's what i am
he said work hard and let the good lord do the rest
this hat aint something i wear for style
somedays i'm in the saddle
somedays i hold on for dear life
just like a rodeo
play it hot 'cause i came in here to dance
leave 'em at the door
when the boss man gets you down
give that country girl a whirl
allen shamblinsteve seskin
sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
picked myself up and came back for more
sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
packed an old cane pole
always believe in the good lord's way
full of girls and teenage dreams
once you get a line on love
and i promise to be good this time
but her heart breaks as her little cowboy cries
as his cowboy cries
an when it stops it's out of my hands
no matter if there's mountains you cant move
i'm yours long as i live
'til the lord says it's time to go with him
who dared to climb
it's a brand new day
that's just the love working
love working on you
jb ruddvip vipperman
sure is making good off my mistakes
the way he's smiling i can tell he knows
johnny macraesteve clark
and that old weekly paycheck
of nickels and dimes and love
and when i get to thinking times are tough
got three little kids and no one to help
every now and then late at night
she's gonna be ok gonna find a way
you sell a war then we sell the truth
i havent seen that for a while
you wouldnt like the way our conversation
oh how she shines
shines a light on you
all my blue collar blues away
we can get there early
too loose with a two step
still she's always telling me
when i look at the sky
when i think it's out of reach
she's steady as a rock
it's still gonna be alright
stacked against the bills
it's still gonna be alright
fallin for you was so slow and steady
you're mine
where i saw something i just had to have
she's an eight she's a nine she's a ten i know
yeah i never seen anyone lookin so fine
the way we met that day
an i'm about to bid my heart good bye
now there's a little gal i know
and i've been up a creek
she knows how to
just south of tupelo
and walked away without a scratch
i could just shake it off
this one's gonna leave a mark
with a heart of stone and i couldnt feel
i know deep down in my heart
is to bring you happiness
where his true talents lie
my that dog is restless
that's all my body's got a mind to do
and nights get longer all the time
if you wanna know the truth
now that my baby aint around
rolling down a two lane road
roll the dice when i need a seven
i wanna be a red corvette
headin down to key biscayne
i'm so afraid
a vision of fire
in the night
you're possessing me
and powerless begin to explore you
you better hope your memory fails you
they send you back and disorientate you
twisting the strangle grip
drawn out of anger
blade of destruction
it's the way you stand
you take the lead
you rule the roost
it's been a lifetime since i found someone
you cant hide away to ease my passion
tell the world how much we living for
lies forming
baptises
they prey on grief
but there's no fear
no sign of life woodpecker on his space
keep the world with love and sin
but i'll go down fighting
you wont make me
automatic sniper
you wont take me
you wont break me
hands of justice
blood stained hands
blood stained hands
turn blind eyes
for life
and while such predators
it's sending me
bloodstone bloodstone
for the world to see
pull the plug
sentenced
extricate me
condescending words are said
comprehending
drip fed
so much for the golden future i cant even start
breaking the law breaking the law
and questionize my
by gravity
dark eyes scanning in
bullet
do you remember well
to see you again
have my sacrifice
you're going to burn in hell
i can hear you whisper
you are going to blister
we've got to make love tonight
i know you feel the flame
so i string you up to keep you hanging around
as we spiral down into oblivion
corrosion eating us
can save us
in cathedral spires
offers no sanctuary
time that we retire
oh we're so tired
i reached the dressing table kicked away the door
if you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
let me hear you roar
do you want it
turn it up
come and get it
no firing squad will make me
cut us watch us bleed
not while i'm living
no prison cell contains me
no surrender
they're seriously mistaken
oh ok i'll tell him
electric chair
shake with fear
shake with fear
take it like a man
death row
decapitate
you've lost your head sir
decapitate
oh let me tell you dont you worry
got gleaming chrome reflecting steel loaded loaded
the air's electric sparkin power loaded loaded
when you make the moves you make
you've got me in a frenzy
then i descend close to your lips
excites you delight you
we roll all night makin heavy sounds
i'm comin to the point i cant hold back
'cause i'm gonna love ya' to death
'cause i'm gonna love ya' to death
wo oh love zone
wo oh love zone
never seen nothin like it no
everybody get in
from off i've seen my perfection
machines are taking all over
electric madness
run for your lives
burning glaze
feeding like a virus
like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth all corners of the land
they could never bind it
could not contain the hunger
could not contain the hunger
changing you changing me forever
changing cast changing fast no more tether
when the night comes down
oh no say it isnt true
dont look behind you
straight out of hell
the end is drawing near
come to me it calls
cause i'm a reelin and feelin ok
yeah i'm doin what i know is right
not even the pink or white noise
646
this day will last forever
destiny calls me
i still see the banners fly
the fears are comin back to me once again
i know it was you i hurt
i want you
give me a chance baby
shut me out
shut me out
shut me out
i've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin true
you bring me pain but you give me pleasure
rides the metal monster
blasting bolts of steel
nevermore encaptured
but i live it to the full
no no no
no no no
put on my jacket for you get too old
parental guidance here
i dont believe how you'd concieve
no give and take
keep your hands off me
i'm too good for you
i dont even care
private property
oh oh
to ram it down ram it down
screaming with power in the air
thousand of cars and a million guitars
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
no one can stop me now
reckless comin at gale force ten
body burning bright
bursting through the clouds
and i cant stop talking 'bout my rock forever
and i cant stop talking 'bout my rock forever
switch into this lifeline
get a grip on the action moving heaven and earth
rock hard with a purpose
so we crack the music louder and our voices turn to power
man eatin momma steam driven hammer
if you think you can
ten pint a nighter
we are defenders of the faith
shake down rock 'em boys crack that whip strap mean
well we dont pull no punches we aim where the crunch is
'til it seems that we're gonna break
full moon is rising
my body aches but i'll not rest
i end my quest
eat my diamonds
took my dreams
oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
goin under
you got me by the throat
hearing the voice i'd known
speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there
yes we both know what memories can bring
stab bawl punch crawl
i'm stabbing and bawling i'm punching and crawling
dont go please dont leave me
dont go please dont leave me
we thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
we are lost above
then with an arm raise the slaughter is started
get out get out go and do your job
like a second flesh hot skin
gasping from the heat
spread eagled to the wall
i'm watching all the time
you dont know i'm there
the old mans sitting there his head bowed down
he's our tomorrow just as much as we are his yesterday
but why i did not know
never knowing where i was going
evening star guiding me so bright
evening star guiding me so bright
i wanna get inside your mind
and wave compassion by
is where my dark side feeds
here we distance now call on your niece and attention to be
oh so bad in running but it's trouble than
darkness filled my soul
fever you set my soul on fire
oh how strange fate is
to carve a road for us
we're spitting flames
has never been the way we keep
mercenary batalions
imminent liquidation
lost in cold perplexion
save me my heart's open wide
end of all ends body into dust
dead or alive there's nothing
i never hear society
cause when they see me coming
you would it a jungle to me it's a kingdom
your present nobody but sadness and suffering
till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
spin you round in the torture before the dread
the world is defiled in disgrace
the world is a manacled place
black sun rising time is running out
he roams the starways
wont you help them pray
cant you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight
diamond visions softly breathing fire
when the enemy comes he will never be heard
ruling the earth
repeat
you're gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop
and if you wanna keep going just shout out for more
and together we will take on all the world
leave me be
why dont you get out of my life
all night dragging us up or you're bringing us down
everything survives
you're in for a shock
all hear my warning
any back alley street

a cathedral bell begins to toll
now facing one another
amidst the dying bodies

a chance
and i'd a went skinny dipping with jenny carson that time she dared me to
but i wouldnt
and if i'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
there's no matchbook in his pocket with a number and a name
'cause a woman knows when there's another woman

i'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
i'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
the clock ticks and the cattle graze
back where i come from
where i'll be when it's said and done
that's where i come from
daddy in his good hat mama in her sunday dress
and my sins went for many were washed away and gone
down with the old man up with the new
i've had it up to here with this rat race
in this palm tree paradise
where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star
do you know just where you take me
anywhere i ever go
whether you're right by my side
because of your love
so many thoughts to sit and ponder
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
so i just
sit right here have another beer in mexico
i loved till i fell
i've drank till i stumbled
get reckless when there's no need
i struggle sometimes to find the words
you should know it before it gets too late
that i was better as a memory than as your man
i wish i could say now that i've learned it all
she was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday
she signed autographs like she was garth brooks in a skirt
so she sings tonight to 20000 plus and the young girls scream out loud
and a head full of crazy dreams
and there's nothin left to do but fly away
a place where the sun always shines
she's thinking about what her kids are doing
she's dancing for the credit cards
if u do it right it makes the time go fast
she's dancing for the braces
and they play her song
ghosts underneath the bed
still i reach for the things i crave
says she needs my company
there's demons chasing me
dont blink
i was glued to my tv and it looked like he looked at me and said
turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
wake up and you're twenty five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
oh you havent changed a bit
to this day i still taste that first kiss
that's something that just dont happen twice
one bottle of wine and two dixie cups
of never ever bein alone again
her perfect picture of her white horse prince
forever lovers and forever friends
just look at us there on that beach on that blanket
all that we have is a world full of time
this fire in my heart lights the world when i'm with you
a little chill and the october sky
no i'm never gonna feel like that again
then we drove down to the water blue and that's where she kissed me
cindy lou was in that way
another chapter of my life i'm writin
five hundred dollars it was mine all mine and i never wanted nothin more
and thats all i need
glory hallelujah good god almighty i never wanted nothin more
the sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
the sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
for atleast a month or more
lately they've been findin out
it's no small miracle when love survives
to the way that i see it
i've seen the world through a bus windeshield but nothing compares
sittin in the sand
sunlight dancin on the water
when the world was ours and she was mine
dont know how i'm goin to find her
hit the engine but she aint a turnin
how the same old story same old act
i get the message shes sendin
one step up and two steps back
lets leave town on a permanent vacation lock up the house pack up the station wagon make
baby drive through the county down to the lake see if the catfish are jumpin set out bait
got good tires and a good cb
we might not see no eiffel tower
i'm stayin here with some friends
there aint no gold
and then lie awake at night
and all that i aint got
that fell from the sky
i've gotten good at being that
blue eyes staring through me
baby you scare me
and how lost i'd be without her
and i make sure she sees that she's what
dont you be concerned
she gets that way but i understand
'cause a woman like her
no there's no harm done
she's always starin at me
she wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
well she aint into cars or pickup trucks
she thinks my tractor's sexy
had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
'cause sherry's living living in paradise
works at the jewelry store
she flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin
the girl she was in new england
is different now and dead
it's easy to see she's the perfect girl
every sweet memory i can recall
all of my love my hugs my kisses
all of my love my hugs my kisses

now love dont have to be a ball and chain
thank god my search is over
lets that love light shine on through
drivin my first love out to the levvy
i go back to the smell of an old gym floor
singin bout god brimstone and fire
to watchin summer fade to fall
with a tear in her eye she looked at me
better or worse one thing's for sure
she walked out the door
i picked myself up off the floor
if i lost it
someday i might get over you
someday i might get over you
someday i might get over you
back when our love was strong and real
i wanna wake up to the day
your memory wont stand in my way

a corner bar an it just seemed right
'cos it's the first long kiss on a second date
we sat there an talked as an hour passed
was the sight of her holdin my baby girl
an look into those eyes so deep in love
it may take some time
and some clarity and inspiration
and find the strength to close the ones i left behind

coffee maker copy repairman
back then you know i had this plan

and every way we were was right
i feel her kisses on my skin

for 7 years in an ancient rhyme
it had been there for years

the christian cross is hanging high above
the baby cries someone here will die
outside the leaves are slowly falling from the trees
and they were not alone all my dreamsshattered to the bone
a year agoi signed a sacred pact

the poltergeist living in my home
they will never ever know our game
the spirit of the candle
a little girl in lace not a single trace of crime
she grabbed a book and spoke aloud an ancient rhyme
the pregnancy would not last overnight
speaking with different tongues
listen hear the spider's lullabye
oh and his pillow case
hoping to catch a fly
oh noi could feel the trees have eyes
then the i didnt wanna hear howling at the moon
in what is known as the devils hide
la reymie

we are the servants of god we believe in the devil and we're found this
destroyed
something wrong with the way
and the doctor's gone
now everything turns to darkness
you better stop kissing
the wedding dream oh the dream
help me please and it's me
here it comes out of the hole a magnificent light
the one who did not died on the cross
it doesnt matter who or what you think we are
i bet that not even you will ever understand the truth
to the morgue take him to the morgue
had become the home of spiders instead
the smoldering eyes in harry's head
and the cellar in the morgue is a nest now
the moon is looking on
trick or treat let us go hide and seek
how does it feel to be digging for someone you love
you better start digging
one blow to the back of the head and
they're talking me so far away
singing twilight symphony twilight
drlandau returned and i told him the story
he wouldnt tell me anything
one little girl with dirty fingers
the should be far away watching the sun go down
they would be laughing still having the best of fun

you could never deceive
living life in disguise
all my attentions
too much damage has been done
chorus
all alone and constantly at war
i need you to come back baby
remembering what you have said
i have never seen her cry
i dont think she's hurt inside
gotta steal a kiss
faking sorrow while you're falling
broken faith is what we're heading for
healer aint your name my man
soon you wont be amused
a spell she put on me forever in my mind
one lifetime in mind
such grace so rare to find
but how you hurt someone you love
it's been a while since i last talk to you
now it's time to tell em
on my knees i'm praying
living in this world aint easy
keeping cool inside
gonna jump the tide coming back alive who knows
having peace in mind it's a long long time ago
i thought that love alone would break all stone
my past you've said will catch up strong
true love that's what is was
to catch another smile
it seems i cant get enough
are you the one
make no sound start to feel
disbelief killed the seed
that we'll give it to you
we dont wanna stop
right
feels so much better than
and you want to rock
easy talking hardline
sticking to my own commitment
and how she feels he understands
someone who will take the time
tell her that you love her
to stay with you forever
it dont come everyday
and tell her
that every woman needs her man
chorus 1
flames are growing
knowing the way it sure aint enough

worries never known
there's fire growing slow
thinking it's all so bad

i can feel what's on your mind
let's end what you've begun
love away
maybe you just dont
you're really all alone
in search of the light
chorus 2
more restrictions more convictions
holding tight
protecting the rose

please dont act so surprised
i got no complaint

old japan land of honor
i have seen enough
shine on me help me see
i could spare you the act of a madman
breathing hard is what i've been doing

once you're caught into the trap
starting out find a friend
now that we're at the end
chorus 4
there's an electric feeling in the air
sure i know

geboren um zu verlieren
und jetzt verliere ich dich
just enough to catch my breath
you can break me down if you want to break me down
you can break me down if you want to break me down
i will lay me down
your time has come to shine all their dreams are on their way
vor dem winter sind sie auf ihre reise gegangen
deswegen bleibt sie an seiner seite
er auf dem boden
er wird nicht aufgeben
where she sat gazing down upon her mate
they wont give up
he's got a broken wing
ooooooooh
aber ich liebe dich
aber ich liebe dich
i dont like to be alone at night
and i love to kiss you in the rain
and i dont like to be alone at night
hat man so ein magisches gefhl
sobald eine leichte brise
du wirst wissen
til the sun goes down
but you know
underneath the starlight starlight
but you know that you cant fight the moonlight
try to hide from my kiss
but you know
way out where the doggies roam
when the night wind blows up and slow
that when i close my eyes in sleep eternal
come on and sing me a song of praise and glory
purple rain purple rain
i only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain
if you know what i'm singing about up here
put a little holiday in your heart
but to share a simple kindness would set there heart aflame
it starts with you it starts with me
yeah you gotta put a little holiday in your heart
i'm slipping fast
that only you should know
like the distant roll of thunder
and i'm lost inside you
know all about
shouldnt wanna spend my time with you
they dpnt know what goes on
but i just cant seem to
but i need your touch just too damn much
strikin the sky
on the river of love
take me away on the river of love
but i've found some brand new arms
momma dont you remember how it feels
he's gonna rock me
let it stir in the wind
with a million point of views
rumor bout a revolution
and i gotta chase the high
if you give me everything i want
constantly throwing myself in a bind
i want to live or at least die trying
i want to breathe like it's my first breath
and i will always love you
you gave me strength to live each moment
share my love
she's got you
it wont let me be
or has it got me
she's got you
to be so confused
every breath
where you have to choose
break down
i feel a little closer to heaven baby
all i know is that you got me feelin so good baby
that i belong to you and baby baby
my baby loves me
nothin short of a miracle
it's sad to think that some wont find it
a little faith will pull us through
repeat chorus
something i can feel deep down
something i can feel deep down
what did i do to find someone who gives me a love and
31 candles on her birthday cake
she says something's gotta give
that's the biz baby
31 candles on her birthday cake
i will be over you
soon i will be over you
someday soon
someday soon
hang your stockings and say a prayer
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
he'll come around when the chimes ring out
just how much longer can the silence go on
honestly
talk to me
wie wrde ich die nacht ohne dich rumkriegen
ich will das wissen
ich wre verloren wenn ich dich verlieren wrde
wie sollte ich ohne dich leben
and tell me now
there would be no wonder for me

how do i ever ever survive
i still cant believe you hurt me
i fell in love and it hurt me
it amazes me
i dont need noone to prove your love
there to see me through
to prove your love
you're all the hope
i believe in you just because
i believe
every time i hear a newborn baby cry
you cant make your heart feel something it wont
you cant make your heart feel something it wont
first chorus
oh i know you wont always say and do the right things

i fall to peices
each time someone speaks your name
but friday means it's over soon

at both ends till i'm unraveled
'cause he's the one who knows what is ahead
and no tears will ever dim the eye
welche das leben einem bringen kann
in deinen armen ist frieden
weil du mich zu weit gebracht hast
i need you like water
when the cold winds rage
that carries me through
make a love that will last forever
once i was easily rattled
every tear i cry
and it gets me in the mood
when i tell my daddy bye
and every moment in between
s saure erinnerungen
und ich werde dich immer lieben

with one foot out the door

i felt like a little kid
when you love when you love
girl i can tell ya
a little stretch of river on a big green field
chorus
i wanna get lost in the dark and know you're near know you're near
these sleepless nights might kill me
go on and go on with your life
i wont be lonely long
from the moment she was born
turns the sound up
what a wonderful child
we can never meet again
you dont have to ask me
just a stretch of mortal time
but this i am denying
in which we have no scent
there's a shadow hangin over me
he wouldnt say
in yesterday
you inspire power and devotion
you are the potential in me
you are you are the potential in me
and you light up my life
you light up my days
i used to breathe you
i used to think if i surrendered
you made me find my dreams
chorus
you take me home
and dancin on daddy's feet
the whole night through
will tell on you
like fallin rain
is a love that's forever
and make me go weak in the knees
less than what i deserve
who's playin for keeps
who's playin for keeps
you could have anyone you want to
just like the purple ink in your tattoo
i've never loved but i'm about to
s saure erinnerungen
und ich werde dich immer lieben
i dont know what comes over me
well i've been in love and lost
love must be tellin me somethin
givin me some kind of sign
i finally moved to jackson when the summer came
sometimes it's like i'm losing touch
but i just take it day by day
'cause if i'd never seen your face
chorus
the heat it's gonna burn gotta let it burn
close the door and throw away
tic toc
tic toc tic toc baby
cuz everything you do is
hurry up before it gets too late
come on

i've got the lovesick blues yeah
i's holding bobby's hand in mine
from the kentucky coalmine to the california sun
for nothin left to lose
of the love you shown to me
chorus

me speeding off in tommy's car
oh the trouble you'll get into
oh nothin 'bout love makes sense
the way that we dance

just wishes on stars that never came true
yeah this diamond ring gets kinda loose
but baby you're drivin me crazy
but i gotta good man and i'm a damn good wife
then we aint' doin nuthin wrong
the close and distant calls
after all the try agains

after all the might have beens
the close and distant calls
i'm the kind of woman who understands
you been gone
told you i was

heaven knows how long it will take
oh i'll get past the what was
one of these one of these days
looking out into the great unknown
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
and buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
then the truth came shining like a light on me and now i can see my way out
und du wirst mit gestern allein gelassen
als ich fr dich da war
nur mit den erinnerungen
wir haben jeden tag zum strahlen gebracht
i had you with me
please remember please remember me
and remember please remember me
and how a dream was out of reach
play pretending
it's only natural
pretty things will fade in time
pretty things will rob you blind
i wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
i wanna strum my guitar and yodel le hee hee
and i'm crazy for lovin you
the heart grow fonder
that the way it happens every time to old
there you go again when ya
just to push me off the edge
you're pulling and a pushing
you can see right through
damn you
you know it yes you do
you're pulling and a pushing
trash everything in site
i wish you'd silence your opinion
but now i want to feel no pain
du siehst aus wie ein engel lufst wie ein engel sprichst wie ein engel
du bist der maskierte teufel
you fooled me with your kisses
the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
with your white picket fence
doesnt everybody want the same thing
doesnt everybody want the same thing
den einen tag ist es warm
wenn du mich liebst na ja dann werde ich dich nie vergessen
dont worry 'bout me
it might happen to you
well dont worry 'bout me
though i may be blue
then go love i'll understand
then when i tell some heart one heart good bye
you never look into their eyes
and when it's hard to hold on
chorus
this house is everybody's home
we played the part of lovers
almost happy endings have no way of coming true
that to me were so dear
that you said good bye
left me at home to pay for his mistakes
i ran away and ran around with a man twice my age
it's where i start and where i'll end
ich habe immer von dem tag getrumt an dem mich mein traum finden wrde
fhlt es sich wie zu hause an
es spielt keine rolle was ich gewesen bin
fhlt sich wie zu hause an
you are in my life
i kept my faith yeah that you were waiting there for me
but it feels like home
i've never known this feeling before
i dont want us to ever get to the point where we cant recover
who was right who was wrong what we said but we'll regret what we've lost
lay down with me tonight
i see i see i see for the first time
i feel i feel i feel a flood of light fall on my face
gott segne amerika
stand beside her and guide her
to the oceans wide with hope
for me to get what i need
i'd be happy to have a happy hour
every now and then every now and then
more about you than meets the eye
i'm liking that easy temper
i'm lookin into the face of love
baby i've got this strong feeling
so i'll go
for we both know
i will always love you
turned my stumbling blocks
when the odds were against me
if it's the last thing i ever do
the moon just went behind a cloud
how do you cool your lips
by the vagueness in your eyes
how do you free your soul
i thought that you might have some advice to give
vier uhr am morgen
ich werde nicht zusehen wie mein leben ber mir zusammenbricht
htte da sein knnen
baby i cant find the words
staring back is the man
could have been there
hurt me now get it over
if there's a new love in your heart
in everything that i do
i'm not leaving you behind
always be with me
leaving's not leaving
i'm not leaving you behind
du hast mich ohne zweifel am pool liegen lassen
ich wnschte dass ich das wusste was ich jetzt weiss
oooh es ist ein kampf der wirklich wahr wird
ich sollte es besser gewusst haben aber das habe ich nicht und ich kann nicht mehr
whoa yeah
and you're still thinkin you're the daddy mac
life goes on repeat 2x
oh life goes on
na na na na
na na na na na
no turning back
we find our warmth
reveal what's in our heart
every obstacle
i blink as the green lights turn to red
long night
i want you all to myself from now 'til the morning light
and describe it to me
my life is worth while
and love just took me by surprise
and there are some things we dont know
marching on and on
they found a flaw
to breathe down here
waiting for me
denn zu sterben oder zu leben
ich werde meinen privaten kampf meistern
denn pltzlich findest du dich allein
pltzlich findest du dich
suddenly you're in this fight
suddenly you find yourself
the best of me
time
take a look
well i'm not gonna switch form hot to cold
just for you
one hundred percent guaranteed love that's true
and i dont wanna fight it
surrender
got all i need
then i might just
is surrender
so dont keep me waiting
i can hear your heartbeat pounding
ready to hear
the angels all stood ready to take him from the tree
it must have looked like rain
god turned his head away
suddenly to my surprise
a song on the radio
put an old memory out of your mind
ooh yeah
dont ever lose that light in your eyes
just let 'em see that light in your eyes
dont ever lose
for all eternity
like some old movie
there for the world to see
history
and the rest is history
when you pressed your hand to mine
romance for the ages
the rest ist history
say my name and i can fight it any more
a mistake i'm makin
i shouldnt wanna spend my time with you ya
and now it's bound to be a heartbreak situation
well i should try to be strong i should try to be strong
an endless aching need
that never learns to live
on a night
i wanna believe that i can save the world
that only you can see
on and on and on and on
and there are more important things
oh it's the weight of love
we will grow old together
this love in me still is only to feel
all that i'm not
it's worth all i go through cause this life came with you
and we've lost another day
let's take this love
when you are the woman that i really love
i cant get no relief
but you and i we've been through that
a wild cat did growl

men dressed in white sheets

i'm gonna get it
dont go and put a bullet in your head
a different kind
dont go and put a bullet in your head
because it is what it is
when the children are cold and alone
all the birds in the sky are singing
he rode in town on a white horse
with his empty hands
who fooled the word
in his empty hands
a toxic waste and an acid rain
waiting like a branded steer
more wounded soldiers another burning flag
ouh yeah yeah yeah yeah
the blend of colors in the air
just you and i
i've ever seen
she's got her shit together
as a freedom fighter she
flower child oh yeah
jungle gym playgrounds
that everything is waiting to unfold
to anywhere i please
let's fade into the sun
yeah yeah yeah
yeah with you yeah yeah
i want to get away
love is something
makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine
when will we realized that the skin is just a glove
and to be equal is the freedom of his love
god is love
god is love
god is love
she said i want the money
i dont believe in you
were you not thinking of me
if you want to play
and i havent seen hide nor hair of you yet
lenny kravitz
take me to the river
after all these changes you put me through
put my feet on the ground
feel your power that is deep within
all they sell us is a pack of lies
we should take time out to really love
we should find out who we really are
hey hey
i know we can make it
that we were to climb
does this have to mean goodbye
and your money sucking friends
you call me the mean man
think think about the children
to reclaim all his souls and set us free
that he's coming back again
on shaky ground
you can live your life for so long
and that's a heavy load
but when you're walking on thin ice you will fall
oh i'm thinking of you
tell me mama no more sleeping
and i'm trying now
that i'm missing you today
make me happy baby
lay me down inside your flying bed
make it funky now
i i i i want to spread the news
until you use me up
mick jagger
you'd wish you were in my shoes
mick jagger
when you love me i cant get enough
yeah baby
baby baby baby baby
my cup over runneth with the fullness and grace
we've ruined what's pure down from nature below
it's gonna come around
i'm gonna take you higher
or is teh fate of man at hand
we've got to keep on praying
and one day we'll see the light
imagine a planet with no air
through the battle sequence you must fight
but i dont want to play
'cause it feels like a curse
without you
i dont think i can make it without you
there is a way
the one thing constant is that there is always change
i want to keep the master's plan
the world can give you everything
while the evil eye was searching out was staring at me
and i will be all over you
and you are what i wanna do
you're my flavor i'm dreaming of
is like a needle in my vein
you're my flavor i'm dreaming of
you're my flavor i'm dreaming of
you're my flavor you're my flavor you're my flavor
can you tell me if i'm near to anywhere but here
i wish for a place where the earth doesnt shake
school school swimming pool
do you have to be
when will it snow it's been raining for hours
and why do i feel so alone
so what is this weather and what is this darkness
but we can fly solo
oh you know
the sofas are worn in
over the ocean
they had their barbecues we have our arguments
so scared to be sad to keep the tears in
but i was quiet and i was tired and i wanted you to bring me up
they set in the bottom of the globe yeah now
and it scrapes my hands across the pavement
but you cant run away just to come back
you know they all had faces too
like the world around you does
and it scrapes my hands across the pavement
but you cant run away just to come back
in love with a life you'll adore in love with a woman you'll adore
then embroider me with gold and i will fly with the angels
in fragmented words too weak to hear
i'm waking up from a bed of past lives lived
days are different now
you looked out the window you looked at the moon
i kick you back
if i ever will see you again
i dont know and i dont care if i ever will be there
and i'm injured again
and i'm not feeling so good again
insomniac trends
everyday everyday everyday everyday
once i went out just to look at the stars
she wanted to be a cowboy
at night she'd wait for the sound of his feet on the doormat
the time between meeting and finally leaving is
the time between meeting and finally leaving is
you want to suffer and show me you're angry
i shouldnt be any great inspiration
you change your shoelaces
i wrote this song is that what you want
you want to suffer and show me you're angry
your smile the soul of witchery
and i dont want to drown in my dreams
she's terribly freezing she always knows when to go
you see my heart it likes the feeling that it gets when i'm with you
i see the stars up in the lights
goodbye to all the past
goodbye to friends i tell you
and to all of you
all the past is left behind again
my stomach flutters and i feel sometimes ashamed
i could be trembling oh i could be afraid
it's like why does your heart beat and how do you cry
how does you heart beat and why do you breathe
but behead this woman she's a hurricane
i've compassion for strangers
cause i'm a sunburn slap upon your arm
you're trying to convince me that what i've done's not right
i could be erased
you dont seem angry but i do
i cant take it
may leave me feeling lonely
to the inside
i can forgive but i wont forget
it's over it's over it's over
your dad died cause his heart hurt arking away his forty five years
but that's not all that i'm about to do
to be here playing house
to dig ourselves out
if we're really going
to reach the right conclusion
you lied upon the mattress c'mon tell me where you've been
let's forget about it
i've been sleeping on half of my bed lately
i've been sleeping on half of my bed lately
you always wanted more
do you wait for it to ring
i feel so selfish even asking
look me in the eye
that you dont look me in the eye
so touch my lips and feel the words
i guess it just to tough to give a lot not knowing nough
that i want to say to you
some things dont need a payback some things are sure
dont follow me out i'll think your coming for some payback
tangled she got halfway
bedtime
your hair falls soft like animals
your hair falls soft like animals
she stares at the food on her plate
she's weak and she's tired of feeling like this
and they sleep in the dark
you're my medicine
it's a slow dive down
when will you come rescue me
it's a bad day
you're my medicine
who forgot what it's like to dream
you try to hide between the lines
how do you keep it up
it was there between the lines
i did not want to be stuck
that a car could hit me in it
i dont listen hard
dying since the day they were born
you said i caught you 'cause i want you and one day i'll let you go
i ask you if you will hold my hand
happily ever after just like it will begin
'cause i need to know the same of you and you the same of me
my friend's got a bruise on his arm where i shove my elbow
i kept talking to myself
until i start to think that nothing's even wrong
sometimes your intentions
i do this all the time
maybe i am
maybe i dont want to see it
appear severe
you're so still
it's you i love
not a blow out but a screeching halt lots of ice no salt
driving i wasthinking
you're just a pliable just a dead wait on me
she was like a pipe dream not a bad position
you cant right this wrong now cause i've met her
truthfully you
i'm finding finally
truthfully i
truthfully
now i understand that i more than like you
waiting for wednesday my stomach doesnt hurt enough
waiting for wednesday i pray you'll put me on the spot
waiting for wednesday
i dont want to be here
completely unimportant
other worse things i could mention
when all the stars were falling
i fell down down
but i could be restful i could be someone's home
that's not what i want that's not where i will start
i just want this to be good
and it's not always candy spun from head to heart
you dont know what you're missing
it shows on her face
she doesnt know that we know
we dont see her much anymore
it's nice to see
you say you can tell
thanks to you
i miss you honey but life goes on
i've got to get out
i need a night i'll never remember
to take this load off of me
only one thing that can stop me now
i was scared half to death
if your prayers have all been prayed
she was comin down the aisle
all we have is today
i thought only one thing really matters now
there aint no time to be afraid
to keep you safe from the world outside
'cause it's all in the line of love
only for you
track 3 time 436
and where is she now i'd love to know
can make the days so long
i dont know but it dont feel right
and i'm missin her missin her tonight
you hit me where it hurts
real love's not a matter of
we both lose the war
bad for us
but i'm too weak to make it on my own
mixin memories with old forgotten wine
dare to fly
there's got to be a better way to lose my mind
it happened to her overnight
she used to be a rock 'n roll baby
it happened to her overnight
there's been a chain of tears
every time before
yeah
track 6 time 258
you'd better dance
you'd better dance
and dance with the one that brung ya
now that i dont have you
but this storm within my soul
down in the valley with a rocky mountain high
but there's a first time for everything
i dont spend all my time in the past
'cause if i've learned anything
yeah
i always thought that someday
to help to get me over you
ive seen some pretty faces
god blessed texas
if you wanna see heaven brother heres your chance
track 9 time 301
mama and papa and the good lord above
i am a hit country song
i've seen her eyes when she's in love
so just treat her right
i could make new plans
and if i have to choose
but until you do
between living without you
i cant eat i get weak
i aint no fun to be around
seems like life just aint fair
i cant think i cant sleep
track 7 time 325
than we will ever learn
but it can bring us to our knees
than words can describe
'cause we've never looked inside
and say you dont love me anymore
this is the night when we forget our love has died
and from now on
track 1 time 342
yeah you got to kick a little and be tough
you've got to kick at little and cause a stir
yeah you got to kick a little and be tough
sweatin bullets while i was sneakin in
'cause i'm livin in a bullseye ground zero
it's kinda scary when the arrows fly
you roll out your red carpet
up here on the wire
oh yeah
with every hungry kiss
track 1 time 330
and givin in to nothin
never did nothin for me
i take 'em as they come
givin in to nothin
oh yeah
i should have known not to fall so far
but everybody has to love and learn
chorus
burning out of control
my love my love is ready for you
only to you then my love
is i dont know what i'd do without your love
you're the one that keeps pulling me through
against your skin so brown
and i got a peaceful easy feelin
yes i'm already standing on the ground
it dont take much to please
a redneck like me
track 5 time 309
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
track 1 time 252
that i've got you and that's enough
but i thank the stars above me
some guys have all the love
of a warm wind through the pines
her voice is like the whisper
her smile can reach the soul of any man
but you think you're ready for another time around
but you keep on going even though you see the signs
track 8 time 423
you can keep it all inside
you cant deny it
when you get the call
you're gonna answer
chorus
yes they might be the best days we will ever know
no we'll never know
with someone i've loved for so long
than you'll always love me
but if i were to leave you
dwayne o'brienjim rushing
should've taken that job in dallas
wishing wouldnt change it anyhow
'cause yesterday's gone forever
memories surround me
i pull off the highway
i can almost see your golden hair
i can almost see your golden hair
she tries to hold on to promises
your days with her are numbered
no it wont be long 'til she's mine
your mama wont let me make you mine
somehow i got to change her mind
your mama wont let me make you mine

little swami always walks his beat sweet feet
and take it slow
but the beauty of this vision alone just like yesterday's sunset
but the beauty of this vision alone i cant shake from my tree just yet
and all my bridges i would burn
if i could be for only an hour
my name would then be handsome jack
i'd sing the song that i sang then
we'd be so happy there to be
when my angelic work was through
from the earliest days
washed her feet and blessed her name
everyone's dreamin of a truth to be
her placenta falls to the floor
like a rollin thunder chasing the wind
should of chewed off my hand i'm sick of all the false glory in god we trust
and if you break my will i will come back again to destroy everything
from the north pole down to mexico if you dont know the words fuck it
madeleins my christmas tree

the new dreams gather
held so tightly in her hands
on the street where
and she can take her
if you see her
there she goes
my death waits like a witch at night
may death waits to allow my friends
my death waits among falling leaves
there is nothing much t o do
tired of the future
the intellect is fine
it's the distribution of fear
i volunteered you my eyes
with your dad with live
transmit your love to me and silently make me whole again
keep it angry
i bowed to save my head and
whatever we called you
get a ugly chick and ugly chicks can screw
they're very bourgeois and so seditty

and when you're finished doing that
just do as i say 'cause i'm the man of the house
if you've ever know peace
for you are the world fighting mating warring
99 years
but who's tellin the truth it aint like that
for example a man wants to get ahead
material things they couldnt retain
every time i do good it makes you mad

who'll beckon you on
and one for your dreams
so pay the price
the fools of love are misunderstood the mystery is with me now
turn over

grabbed her by the ass and she gave me head

and have they laughed too much do their dry voices crack
the little cat is dead and no more do they sing
and then they go home to the old silver clock
it doesnt matter now the song has died away
the old old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
chorus repeated during breakdowns
i'm like a dog in heat a freak without warning
i'm a freak in heat a dog without warning
i'm like a dog in heat a freak without warning
never to the movies just straight to my house
yeah it's a crazy kind of cold
my only friend in the prison
fire
in my heart
my head's in the ground
my head's in the ground
but i cant seem to rescue myself
for the flowers in the corner by the room
i'll run to your needs with strength and fervor
the kind that wakes you up
loud boisterous voice of an opera opera lady
all around morning humor
me myself myself and i
i've been wanting to tell you this for a while
oh no
now what the hell do you want
all you have to do is move somethin
look baby doll dont lie or front
on monday there's melissa i like to be with her
2x
cause she doesnt want her rich friends to know the truth
she knows what i like and that's to please her
i thought i came in her mouth but i was only peein
if this is love then i
as if it lives somewhere
covering my belly
when my innocence was lost
the high heavens did not fall
of my first case of gonorrhea
i have taken to bed
in a voice grown dry and hollow
no love you're not alone
you've walked your bloody mile
come on love come on
when that was all we had
yet somehow we survive
i promise you your day
where no one ever goes
and start where we began love
nobody knows nobody knows nobody knows
and liar after liar with nothin bout nothin higher
not the kind that they feed to me with their emptiness and greed greed greed
two and two i took of my shoes
in the bedroom all day and all of the night
get your face out my ass motherfucker
heard a lot of talk about a lot of things
heard a lot of talk about this jesus
let it go
heard a lot of talk about my soul
means nothing at all to me today
and let's get it back
so drive me out out to that open field turn the ignition off
tryin to play big money aint it sad aint it funny
comin out of my room to the next man

and the guilt that hangs around your neck
put your head in the water
over again
i said honey what's this you gave to me
she's dressed in black as you can see
turn a light on turn a different light on now
whatever its gonna take good luck keep it real where are the boys in live

evening's come let's settle down
where comes he from where will he play
sink into your chair with fright
or were they always this lame
we'll lay flowers at the grave of jesco white
i will not be moved
and lay our spirit down
'til we can say this world was just a dream
we'll cut through the madness
burnt to the core but not broken
carousels and calliopes
again we go around
a crazy ferris wheel
a crazy carousel
a crazy carousel
a crazy carousel
we feel we've got to yell
and up again around
quickly turning for you and me
and up again around
and down again around
again we go around
la la la la la la la la la
i can smell your armpits
the crowd is all around us
it's amazing what we can do with love
bro brother marquis

the party people turned and walked off the floor
he tried to battle me and found self destruction
our beats are always strong and never dyin

a double team with a friend of mine
chorus
grip it with your pussy go up and down
lemme hear you say
the ladies repeat
she was so beautiful and not at all am i
i saw i saw them arm in arm enfolded by the sea
we were never two friends fanette and i
with lyrics so def it's above the rest
let me discuss and make a fuss with the use of the mike
i can tell whether or not if you hate or if you like me
afraid to suffer the wound
he's crazy she dances in the light
always fighting the storm
saved by the river now saved
dont believe that the world is empty
the mouth of god is wide
and love is bought and sold
these babies become old
forever may not be long enough for my love i have a will
just how far i would go open your heart and everything will be alright
if the mother bears your children without tears
will you run and tell the papers
will you call them freaks
if the mother bears your children without tears
like we will like we will
take you for granted but i'll always know exactly where you are
it just feels right you know it
it just feels right you know it
i want you to know that i feel bad for not making our dreams come true
remember the way we always left
and my mistake was being already married
i wanna make a leap of innocence
but all the money in the world is not enough
and rough
see the moon rise so slow and shallow
let's roll
squeeze her knees underneath a book you know
let's roll
i can be a complicated communicator
rocker panel
spinning
yes i'm winning
spinning
i feel energy bein pulled off from all sides
if there's anybody out there
that can get to the baddest dude
make 'em do what you wan 'em to
i love my bionic eyes
i write with a number two pencil
send it up on fire
death before dawn
but i cant get out of what i'm into
the things i have to do would make a slut blush blue
ooooh lord ooooh lord
i told him that i knew julia roberts when i was twelve at summer camp
bus out of control ploughing the road
you're about as old and piled
you can count on my love
some day if we never said it
you go through your whole life waiting
and you'll never be rejected
you better roll me
johnny my love get out of the business
i know all about the ugly pilgrim thing
may flowers
'cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
boxed it up and buried it in the ground
and the license said you had to stick around until i was dead
i kissed the buddah and made him cry
i kissed the buddah and made him cry
about all of those things i did to please you
we'll make it together just wait and see
do you really know me at all
head underwater
watch him travel
but i burn letters that i write
average every day sane psycho
i am extraordinary i am just your ordinary
i am extraordinary if you'd ever get to know me
average every day sane psycho
all around us people are changing
you saw your mother with another guy
what does it mean when something changes how its always been
what does it mean when something changes how its always been
i guess it's just another thing to stand up close and ignite you
would i lie to make the day blur into the night
who have i seen
who have i seen
after backing up as far as you could get
mesmerizing to you
and i'm starting to actually feel it seep through the slick divide now
i wont decorate my love
i never said nothing
and dont look at my hands in my pockets baby
all these babies are born
all these things i have done
wont you come take me home
so goodbye so long i'm gone already
and i would need a map
be involved
i would be involved with you
i was talking not two days ago
do you wanna be a polyester bride
you're lucky to be alive
he keeps telling me you've got time
do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here
'fraid of goin somewhere
scared the lights will turn red
you'll be like anybody else
you're always thinkin
you'll have to be seen
too scared to commit to even her
under your skin
i need a ride from you
now i lay me down to sleep
positive t cell
i want to be with a guy like you
yeah rock me all night
your mother taught you how to be a sensitive man
all my life for
baby baby baby if it's all right
tonight in bed sleeping
you gotta have fear in your heart
fast enough to get to where you are
louis is probably thirty years old but he looks like a solid 45
dont really see it that way
but it's better by far to get paid
it looks like shit and must be america
i would surely include lots of money
but i look at myself
i wish it could happen to me
walking down the street
baby there goes somebody's miracle
oh my look at you
stars fall
who are you
and from big to small
blinded by the flash
there the planets just like us
we all shine
we all shine shine shine
you havent seen me for weeks now
the sun was setting to the left of the plane
it took an hour maybe a day
it took an hour maybe a day
a flying giant friction blast
'cause you're a human supernova
i know the gossip flies around at breakfast
why dont you throw me in the panther cage
why dont you stub it in the carborateur
i'm leaning on the washing machine
watching helplessly will always forgive me
there will always be some kind of crisis for me
i still see that guy in my memory
wanna take a look take a look
wanna take a look take a look
the facts and the fiction
wanna take a look take a look
he didnt fight in the civil war
your beautiful wife keeps your life on a shelf for you
you might even shake the hands of presidents
but mostly we've been living here uninjured
i smell the earth in my skin
listen here young lady
and whip smart as the english channels wide
and games are just another way of life
i see you in everything
i'll see you around
i'll see you
why cant i breathe whenever i think about you
but wouldnt it be beautiful
high enough for you to pull me under
why cant i breathe whenever i think about you
it doesnt even stick
and simple ill will
well momma i would give some thought to it
you've gotta smile
howls around me
kick your shoes off
and it says

sunlight fell from your lips tenderly you shattered me
there's so much trust in your eyes they make me remember blue
i dont wanna be that strong if it means being alone
who am i to tell you why
tell her you're believing
before i close my eyes
even though it's hard to say

jack frost nipping at your nose

she's unusually unusual
absolutely unpredictable
and that's beautiful to me
baby for once let's dont think twice
'til our hearts start racin for that county line
but there wont ever be a better time to take this chance
what child is this who lays to rest
the king of kings salvation brings
the babe the son of mary
we got all of this time on our hands
roll away that book of rules
we got all of this time on our hands
what would it take to take me back
i would give all i own for one little stepping stone
back when the west was wild and cowboys didnt dance
thirteen hundred miles to go as they slowly made their way
didnt wear designer shirts
snow is glistening
then pretend he is parson brown
walking in a winter wonderland
the eskimo way
sometimes i feel like just a bump on a street
straight to my brain
when you're with me
i got my highs and lows
and it feels right as rain
nobody's here to see me cry
without you
still i'm
changing partners
then you came waltzing in
then you came waltzing in
you dont know what love is
if you think that i can fight this feeling
you dont know what love is
you dont know what love is
you walked in with legs up to your neck
yea yea yea yea yea

i couldnt think of nothin better to do
when you walk in baby love begins

and now i gotta get to gettin over you
on a silver platter in a champagne glass
all i want is everything
it's a big ol world
as strong as a saint weak as a sinner
i finally found a man who's not afraid to try
a woman with a mind a body with her soul
a heart full of love wont let go
and if my heart was in tact you know i'd let you have the first crack at breakin it
she stares into the mirror at the cross around her neck
just questions that she hopes to answer soon
she looks up to marilyn says your looking good
woo oh cross against the moon
i can hear you but you're out of reach
all the miles stretch out between us
dream on
dream on dream on
when you part you always leave a fire burning
that's the fine art of holding a woman
oh reach out and touch me
darlin if we do i'll show you
dont you really wanna love me
well i was drinking and talking and you know how that goes
get over it honey life's a two way street
we'll talk about this later
you look like you just took a long look in the mirror
yeah guys do it
but all she says is have a nice day
he winks once then he's gone she's got time to kill
to hear passion call me by name
i like it when you say you'd be lost without me
there's a simple way to show me
your love speaks my name
but only when the time is right
blowin on the back porch babe
you think i'm too strong to let you in
but so have i

passion that brought tears to my eyes
with somebody who shakes me

the act of love was slowly pounding
you know i'll never lose you baby
act of love
act of love
help me help me
so wont you take me take me
i never seen before
after berlin
help me help me
wont need no shadow man
what will people say
where will people go
and we've got to get ourselves
that was floating on the breeze
and i felt like getting high
there were children crying
aint it the truth now baby
what i say
the devil fools
your cadillac
dont it take you down home
make friends down in alabama
is less than ninety miles away
so i'll stop when i can
i cant forget
your crazy smile
our little son wont let us forget
our little son wont let us forget
still some love
back in the old folky days
with your make up on
oh mother goose
it's hard to say
there's room at the top
your hook and ladder dreams
and i hope it isnt you
in the wind
for every set of eyes
god shed his grace on thee
looked back at me
reaching out
like a pack of hounds
a good thing last
things went wrong
you're all washed up
american dream american dream
before the sun gets high
brings the money
and make a stand
are you livin like you talk
is it everything
and i let my missles fly
do you wish that it would stop
lefting and then righting
then i ran into the hangman
meanwhile push comes to shove
people sweat in planted fields
wow you're looking beautiful
around the world
now when we hit the road
a rock 'n roll band
i dream of sweet caress
bad fog of loneliness
should i call her up late
is loud and clear
never coming back
i've got
he went and lost
he's walking
but a prizefighter
not to beg or to borrow
i've been waiting for you
can you hear her sigh
that she needs
i've got to have it right now
well if you've got the craving
i've got to have it right now
waiting for him to come
his mind is confused
most things go whirring by
and wonder if i'm fine
i will stay with you
will i still be in your eyes
far from the jeers and lies
there's colors on the street
so i try to forget it
now she puts the kid away
keep on rockin in the free world
got a man of the people
i've learned some new things
in search of a line
late at night
well i went with mary lou
took out skinny minnie
the stroll with betty lou
wanna wanna wanna
in a matter of time
about the bubbles in the sea
dont you wish that
and the mountains erupt
dont you wish that
your draw is fast as lightning
you are so inviting
cant breathe
return back
and hours and hours
wake up wake up
was the last of a dying breed
of the conglomerate
tractors were burning
i'd hate to say the farmer
dont say much for the future
but for power and for greed
and the farmers all were gone
when a family cant survive
and three young girls who cried
i took you for a ride
she got down on her knees
i'll mail you back the key
the coroner was friendly
but i was afraid to ask
when a friend dropped by to ask
we have here
for speedin and no brake lights
like a black and white super 8
from inside his cell
living in the internet
by watching others too
this must to be told
it doesnt matter
been laughin too much
of those lines on his face
holdin on to what i got
let it shine shine shine
let me ride ride ride ride
let them dance dance dance
let me shine shine shine shine
riding on the range
when you gave good 'phone
looking for a good time
you're hung up on the line
of why we have to send our men to war
flip flop
but of course our president is clean
time is runnin out
i hope someone can fly this thing
you've gota face it down
let's roll for justice
people sleepin on the sidewalks
dont that trouble you sister
dont that trouble you brother
sleepin on the sidewalks
i dont know how you feel
to make a handout worth a lot
standing in the light of love
turning once to fire
you could have been
and i'm gettin blown away
you touched my lips
i want to love you but
who put the bomb
i would build such
get down on the ground
the gypsy told my fortune
we're gonna lose this place
why should we die
to house the chosen few
hangin head
only love puts a tear in your eye
a little thing called love
she comes to town when the children sing
good conditions
cross the line
running from the daily grind
oh that's the price that you pay
let yourself keep loose
and the king and queen
it's the prime of life
when i first saw your face
not feeling too bad myself
and ruin our band
from record company clowns
and she aint about to lose it
standing at the edge of you
knitting her fine sweaters
and far inside your walls
when you're on the ropes
who's got all the moves
when the sun is setting
when the red sun sets
if you just follow on
and over the crown
the well will be flowing
there'll not be another
sleepin in past dawn
it's rainin in paradise
it's rainin in paradise
let's go trippin
i'm standing in my line
i got to bet
that cuts clean through
imagination is my best friend
how'd you get the knack
with the little things you say
there's no place like home
there'll not be anyone
arrives here at last
they wont let you down
and bars begin to laugh
beckons you
they do
she flutters around
at the edge of town
and i'll be good to you
it was such a drag
the rejection
i got the revolution blues
when help was on the way
he brought out
and when we got on ship
he thought of every last detail
if you are full or empty
it was way too late
beneath a garbage heap
beside a garbage heap
he kills the bull
the big trucks rolling
sure looks like
but there's a warnin sign
keep on rockin in the free world
there's one more kid
we got a kinder gentler
keep on rockin in the free world
we were just a couple of kids then
roger and out good buddy
but before too long i might
i been standin on the sound
i'll be goin back that way
round and round and round we spin
you've hidden inside
to mend the tear that always shows
round and round and round we spin
till you turn to your eyes
to weave a wall to hem us in
the crutch of the lie
there's another beside
it wont be long it wont be long
it wont be long it wont be long
i'll know it's because
that that's the way it has to be
you want to be free
i've shamed myself with lies
i'm sorry for
and cant be recognized
you ever came
the light's go on the movie's gone
since she came to town
there's no reward
it's a cold bowl of chili
in penthouse thirty five
meet the winners in the dives
like a ribbon on the high plain
hair blonde
a new design new design
dont hesitate to give us a call
weight 110
when you energize
new design
i see a light ahead
i cant wait to see you again
bury me out on the prairie
trying to make my way to nashville tennessee
just bury me out on the prairie
i'd hate to say the farmer
until they get what they need
was the last of a dying breed
was the last of his kind
not one mans voice can sound
earth was flying through the sky
dont say much for the future
this city dancing
i really wanna feel
in the sound of love
the children sleeping
feel your love
i'm going' back to my house
there aint no way of telling
tryin to picture
where these seeds
you better find another shoulder
find another shoulder
find another shoulder
outside my door
no telephones were ringing
i'm your disconnected number now
let your fingers do the walking
i'm listed under broken hearts
flags that line old main street
sister has her headphones on
but he's already walkin past
we've sometimes won before
then i'm sorry to let you down
then i'm sorry to let you down
if i'm bright enough to see you
and barbara ann too
but i'm kinda fonda wanda
as good as wanda
yeah i'm kinda fonda wanda
on the morning sand
there's a palace in the gravy
people were drownin
fontainebleau
since the day i learned
how could you give yourself
all through the lonesome night
i hold on your love
who charge ten dollars
are now in granite laid
it doesnt matter
ride my dream machine
ride in the lonesome wind
but the stain will fade away
that you should see me through
for the big divorce
sometime it's distorted
can we make it last
comatose but walking still
broken leashes
filled with truth
on a changing sky
to the gateway of love
here in this life
help me now i'm sinking fast
i may be late in comin though
oh it might explode
think i'll get back on the highway
seems familiar
the negative thing
what you're lookin for
got to trust someone
everything you're lookin for
yeah
no one can touch you now
you'll find
and the curtain fell down
did you see them in the river
he hung up his eyelids
brown skinned indian on the banks
from the sun rays of dawn
that were crowded and narrow
oh this old world
that's how we kept
searching than in finding
and when you're high
i'm thinking about you
feel like i'm falling
i must apologize
falling off the face of the earth
falling
and everybody said
we were rockin in the city
said son i'm gonna make you
that big ol plane
did i see you down
let me fill your cup
dream up dream up
to tell you that
but you're not the one
how long can this go on
i'm not the same man
i hope that you care
i'm living with war in my heart everyday
to never kill again
try to remember peace visualize
that our flag is still there
i dreamed my dream and i
the children all do what
but nothing is perfect
they can bury their dead
to something worthwhile
the children all do
but nothing is perfect
then she took off
some things never change
some things never change
from the city lights
in a brand new way
happened yesterday
and the video jocks
the eldorado
dont feel dont feel
go out like a light
look everything is new
whatever happened to saturday night
'cause i cant park on a hill
and leave myself behind
it gives me peace of mind
he tried to do his best
but they burned his brother
open up the tired eyes
in his mirrors
please take my advice
make better lovers
out on the street
on what i'm puttin down now
make better lovers
to singing the meaning
'cause nowadays clancy
and who's trying to act
'cause nowadays
you cant lay a claim
who's saying baby
ocean girl
come 'round the world
and feed this world
they hold the world
or trade away
gotta get down to it
and found her dead on the ground
when i first got the bad news
while the band plays the
in this empty bar
through my hair last night
there's an anger in my heart
we may not be good looking
with his eerie light
was that the devils stagecoach
out on the floor
comes down the stairs
just then the sound
i've got some change
the air was filled
there's not enough time
his ears were sweating
the naked rider gallops
was the best old hound dog
old king sure meant a lot to me
never knew a dog
off the truck in high gear
been here before
she leaves nothing at all
blacks out the night
old man look at my life
like a coin that wont get tossed
doesnt mean that much to me
ah one look in my eyes
it's hard to teach
clean up my whole way of living
things turned around
from the wall where
though my problems
i went to the radio interview
get out of town
think i'll get out of town
now i wont be back
though the other side
can you feel it now
once an angel
towards the window
as i'll ever be
dont say you win
now it seems that time
though we both have pride
sharing words i always said were mine
and thank them all
and it wont be long it wont be long
to all the good friends i've known
like leaves from an old maple
one of these days
i think we're
you know a body feels empty
one of these days
you dont care
can break your heart
inside a dream
can break your heart
can break your heart
that old white line
it seemed like such a
right now i'm thinking 'bout
oh this country
what went wrong
but these fences are
and i stand before you
when i see the light
running through me
that there's a heartbeat
well his cattle each have numbers
beneath the floodlights
crusher syscrusher
in that palace in the sun
and the women all were beautiful
to the flatlands
cortez cortez
too young to leave
too late to pay
but who forgave her
i dont like to go down to flats
somewhere i can walk alone
i'm thankful for my country home
i got a right
i dont want nothin else
like anyone else
at your command
that makes you want
to change your name
on a grey background
well the cop made the showdown
said come on out
is a perfect track
and make sure that he's hungry
i take my orders from fools
there's still crime in the city
i wish i knew where he was
it's the best home i ever had
then i grew up to be a fireman
come across my mind
got a woman at home
bought my ticket honey
three fine children
well it's a crime of the heart
looking for a sign of true love
hasnt heard
make way
all the time
boo hoo hoo boo hoo hoo
you've been a free bird
like riding on a fast train
hey now hey now
old man crossin the road
with the barnyard cat
they'll be laughing
hey now hey now
'cause it aint too far
never thought love
dance dance dance
as the daylight lingers
danger bird he flies alone
'cause you've been
and he finds himself
when i left you
memories the rain
in the same old movie show
dont make me wait
he says he doesnt care
you could talk to me
in disguise of security
with a seven year warranty
see the turtles
there was a dying breeze
the cards on the table lie
who run and cast their doubts
but things aint that bad
they dont cut the grade
depression blues
the captain said
there's a garden growing greendale
one thing i can tell you
so my fair damsel greendale
where the big heart beats greendale
differently
but your signal i just missed
differently
but i know our love
bring to me babe yes i would
differently
your love back come on babe
the flash of a distant camera
fading in the mirror
like a dream
to sing for you
but i'm losing time
once before
and now i dont know where
trying to make it
right across the kitchen floor
and she put me
in the doghouse doghouse
let your conscience be your guide
we packed up all our bags
dont be denied dont be denied
dont be denied dont be denied
there we were on the sunset strip
that story told
the feeling lingers on
old true love
nothin i say is written in stone
i see you glaring now
dont cry my sweet girl
cold wind ripping
blind man running
can you hear the sirens moan
just find someone who's turning
last words cant talk
i know i'm alright
oh no dont pity me babe
oh no dont pity me babe
cant breathe
and he's doing what's
dont say you love me
and i got to tell you baby
i still got a lot to give
dont say you love me
tonight's the night
well late at night
at the break of day
out on the mainline
until the afternoon
and the sun was on the lawn
for you
too far gone
too lonely to fall in love
she's got the tight dress
lookin for a new thing
the tangled steel
old street lamps
slowly fadin
to touch the night
when i tell you
with destinations still unnamed
i'll always be a part of you
repeat after me
had pulled up for the night
i thought i heard him say
with two wheels on the grass
hands across the sea
just bounced around
for you and me
remote control
but we havent made it yet
unlock the secrets
when i look in your eyes
turned their back on him
truth be known
the summer ends and the winter winds
falling leaves in the autumn air
when the winter winds
while time stands still
for such a long time
the sun is settin
the world has changed since i first met you
in my heart in my heart
take me up to the mountains high
oh lord there's so much hate
i'm proud to a union man
is there any new business
signify by sayin ay
never put her roots down
the very air she breathes
somewhere on a desert highway
suckin blood
your window pane
good times are comin
twenty barrels worth
control the violent side
keeps out invaders who come
to control it
that's hard to change
the good old days
how to feel
i just cant see
what did i see
wont go away
just like the days of old
or the little sparrow
no one knows where
cant see the gas and machines
across the heavens
the warmth of ages
all the lies in your eyes
he can put an end to war
now someone else
then we'll never be apart
now someone else
of the outward bound
to the wayward wind
a restless wind
and i was born
floating through the clouds
it makes no difference
we never danced
we control the tv sky
we're controlling
cctb
we are in control
the weight of the world
but when i met you girl
i never knew
the weight of the world
for all of my life
welcome to the big room
it's alright
there's always dancing in the big room
yeah people welcome to the big room
it's alright
thought we might settle down
lying over the water
just getting used
in history we painted pictures grim
another free day
ready to go willin to stay and pay
just like a
he was the king
he was the king
and he never did look back
elvis has left the arena
i never give
for a heart of gold
for a heart of gold
we may not compromise
you may not hear me calling
we may not compromise
grab a bite to eat
like a river needs rain
on a clear clear night
i dropped by
is putting the tease on
she said you're strange
and my face
blue blue windows behind the stars
blue blue windows behind the stars
listen to the sound
of this old heart beating for you
you might say i'm here for you
go to the country take the dog
the spreading fear of growing old
here we are in the years
i know that all things pass
and the stars above
let's try to make this last
there's more to the picture
and into the black
rock and roll can never die
that's the kind of woman
she dont want to lose me
turn off that mtv
all dressed in red
and we were all alone
i know what you've found
that closed behind are cracking
of the closeness of the moonbeam
breakin through our window pane
looking forward
all that i can see
breaking through our window pane
thank god
i'm on the road tonight
i'm on the road tonight
thank god
take my advice
were just a hippie dream
in the streets
for the heart
room of meat hooks
smoked some then and i'll do it again
in the land of opportunity
and the endless nights
see or be seen
a little cocaine went a long long way
i had to count on you
it's good
push off the fears
crazy love
just around the next corner
hold on to your love
hold on to your love
when i hold you in my arms
you gotta hold onto something in this life
old buildings coming down
when i hold you in my arms
i forget what's out there
with a nail through your hand
of the writing on the wall
come along and say you can
of the ways he talks
at the end of the car
it's the loner
know when you see him
long may you run
when i last saw you alive
long may you run
although these changes
watching all the flags unfurl
if we are searching for the truth
from hour to hour
look out for my love
was i hurt too bad
i know things are gonna change
men with walkie talkies
look out for my love
walkin among our people
maybe it's colin powell
america is beautiful
i've been looking for a lover
and the mountains meet the sand
it's going to be
and dont mess with her mind
and make the best
trying not to use the word old
i'm going to live
like a free roamin soul
comin down the avenue
she took my brain
singin on the streets around
i built a house of cards
future in my hand
promise everything
some roads i got back
for a while
since you've gone
when you're on the losing end
singin with too much soul
your buildings if they rise again
that lies on the ocean floor
that i got to lose
so if you look in my direction
'cause my heart needs relatin
it's gonna take a lotta love
who couldnt wait
tomorrow is a long long time
love and only love
love was a winner there
love and only love
and my words are all so sad
between the best things i ever had
every room a hallway
ring for give and take
every room a hallway
kept me warm
churches long preach sex is wrong
till my plane touched the sky
come on lads we can go together
a handful of thorns and
you gotta move to start
you better take a chance
and they hold each other saying
late one night i was walking
walking in my place
in that mansion on the hill
there's a mansion on the hill
your old song
i'm a married man
it changes every day
and in the morning when you rise
will you look in my sons eyes
standing in the light of love
drowning in the deep blue sea
and you find out
the answer to that question
and wait for you
maybe the star of bethlehem
stayin power through thick and thin
you can say the soul is gone
that he was fighting for
who lately lost his wife
a stringman
when another one is close at hand
and i love you
and i love you
and the candy floss you had
you can hear the words she wrote
to the people who you met
aint it funny how you feel
you cant be twenty on sugar mountain
and started yellin through a megaphone
when the city is plunged into darkness
no one could explain it
so now when she goes dancin
hey mr clean you're dirty now too
he took her by the hand
let's go back to my place
she'd still like to meet julia butterfly
hey mr clean you're dirty now too
lonely nights i can
my heart feels sunny inside
but he let it go
for a pleasure cruise
weak in the knees
for a pleasure cruise
he caught the big one
sweet joni from saskatoon
go easy the doorman said
got mashed potatoes
got mashed potatoes
t bone
got mashed potatoes
got mashed potatoes
sailing heart ships
but young enough to sell
but young enough to sell
gotta make you feel alright
'cause we got a job to do
gotta make you feel alright
'cause we got a job to do
for those old country boys
with this old hillbilly band
with this old hillbilly band
i'm on the road tonight
before her work
blue to blue
get
some of them are with me now
the people have heard the news
dont need no madison avenue war
people from around the world
dont want to know how many people are like me
with such an appetite
dont need no terror squad
the restless comsumer flies
there goes what might have been
there goes what might have been
walking down the avenue
look around you has it found you
aint singin for pepsi
dont need no cash
it's been around for years and years
this old guitar
it jumps behind the wheel and steers
this old guitar
this old house of ours
'bout daddy
is built on dreams
take it all away
and made love
a man from the bank's
i'm asleep
they were hiding behind hay bales
hit the road before it's light
where sleeplessness awaits
to the land of truth
on the sidewalks
it was that great
but me i'm not stopping there
from the city lights
but love takes care
why man must bring us
the weaknesses are seen
the wheel of fortune
throw your hatred down
on a clear clear night
wont you take a walk with me
i'm familiar with your kind
till the morning comes
try to get back by eight
watch the moonglow
you know how time fades away
how time fades away
try to get back by eight eight
he's in kingston doin time
but they made him say my lord
when he called me up
but the boy dont feel too good
with the mounties on his tail
i know your day has been oh so long
new beginnings for another
surrounding you
and let the sun
and i might live a thousand years
save the planet for another day
paranoid schizophrenic visions
you can make a difference if you really try
faces frozen in the frigid air
dream the fisherman in his boat
he needed peace he needed light
be the magic in the northern lights
crossin the river in a big old boat
when i'm not with you
it's really not complicated
and be with you
i got to hold on now
as it lead me down the road
someday i will
well it kind of struck me funny
and she's not
always goin home
if heaven had a window
that'll never grow old
i let it slip away from me
i dont care
pounding on his back
the spirit talking
he was barely in his prime
pure as the driven snow
sometimes i feel
standing in the light of love
standing in the light of love
people welcome to the big room
there's always tellers in the big room
it's alright
people welcome to the big room
gonna leave the pain behind
in the dream we had
dancing in the sunset hews
inside of me
there will be another one
feathers fall around you
today
when the sun goes down
born and raised
i'd like to make her scream
lay 'em down
convincing you
you feel invincible
i was born to run run run
my head in the clouds
that grab at the sky
hitchhiking with her dog
bound for living on the edge
and living in the dark
they were bound for glory
the sun came climbing up the cab
bound for living on the edge
i ride the boxcar
where i'd already been around
i ride the boxcar
and that took a lot of lies
and love came running down
something doesnt seem
oh that's the price that you pay
the evening fog was rolling in
grandpa's face was on every one
but we can carry it it's not too far
pushing metal on down the super slab
we're all gonna rock forever
he wore big boots that made a sound
across the land and on the sea
he's different now
i knew you would stay
and not find you there
turn to dust in the air
i can feel it
i stumbled for a while
my world fell
she said that by the winter
was he planning only for believers
when god made me
when god made me
they dont have to say a thing
or get outta the way
if i only had a heart
my feelings going up
tell me what made him this way
when it falls it falls all over you
can you be the same
then it gathers strength in lies
you make it show
i can really love
then take a chance
i can really love
you're still movin movin on
when your lonely heart breaks
lonely heart breaks
though i know i'll never be the same
my tears fall down like rain
she'd take me in her arms
and crazy nights
keeps comin back to me
first fall was new
of their winking
no time to stay the same
will she join you there
i saw some things
the open road
i'm coming back up again
to live with one
i know i cant go back again
always warm
and i'll keep swimming
with the golden lights
sometimes i see
sometimes i ramble on and on
someone calls my name
baby if i see boredom
our tails together
who wasnt there
before the fog rolls in
this wont be no sadness day
through the dreamlight of your way
come back now come back now
i'm waiting for a sign
changing gears that grind
not compatible with you
together side by side
i've been talking all day long
i'm wonderin i'm wonderin
to plant in the lawn
between the lines of age
and how would it seem
you know i win
i'm searchin searchin
no the world on a string
wear something pretty and white
though i cant take that chance
the restless line of cars
meet me at the wrecking ball
i was to meet him
what you got to run for
peeked out
and he's not the same
open up and let the light back in
i was thinkin 'bout you and me
i was thinkin 'bout you and me
all i want is
i dont wanna break your heart
i thought i saw in your eyes
and walking proud
i would surely die
up on the forest floor
my girl
on the fourth of july
your time
on the forest floor
my girl
if you want to pet
try to not spook the horse
try to not spook the horse
dont take your love away from me
'cause when i make a promise
there's a ready young filly
renamed the double e
meanwhile granny
back in the day
livin in the summer of love
taking me for a ride
together we may get away
down by the river
taking me for a ride
in the hope that you'll forgive her
thank yourself alone for stallin
when she learns of all your lyin
to the words of a liar
down to the wire
where the hippies all go
downtown at night
young blood in his eye
jimi's playin in the back room
downtown tonight
downtown all right
running from the daily grind
running from the daily grind
the cupboards are bare
the cupboards are bare
and went to heaven
with a loaded gun
past club med vacations
another time or place
dreamin man
what i gotta do to fit
i like to drive my car
what about you did i ever
dont try to rescue me
you wont know me
with no one around
drive back
driveby driveby
like a shooting star
and you dont know
and i've just run out of fuel
hey hey and that's my way
your driver's license
slide rule
the gypsy sees the villa
the heavies all are there
claims another day
his hair is red as blood
late at night flashing lights
standing on
evening coconut evening coconut
evening coconut evening coconut
everybody i love you
and take it easy
this is nowhere
what it's like down here
resting in the shade
but when i'll learn to be free
everybody's alone
down to new orleans
all night long
everybody's rockin
while i laughed
babe ended with a cry
now you know i'd try
when it falls it falls all over you
another came along
then it gathers strength in lies
who's your saviour tonight
where's the big drum
that he aint said
when i was young
goals and visions and afterthoughts
the religious wars
in everything you do
dawning on the green
in everything you do
all day and night
over darkness you'll fly
looking at the grave
spread your life around
have never been a stranger
where things are useful
to take a hero home
home of the brave
i've never seen you
mine falls apart
at the pool hall
he pulled some teeth
i saw the movie and i read the book
the lasers are in the lab
i'm using too many covers
locomotive pull the train
see the sky about to rain
played it loud and then the man
could i bring my cat
turned on tuned in cop out sell out
the light shone from in your eyes
separate ways separate ways
and it's all because
things that people do
like a dog i'm fetching
there's a war inside
angel without wings
there aint no way
the touch of my woman
i stop to slap plastic at an esso station
without that woman i'm toast
back in the days of mission accomplished
both sides are losing now
striking out
their father's castles
loads and loads
in the night
i keep hearing shots
whatever we do
and the rain keeps pouring
i dont care
down on me and mine
they've got the places they can go
yeah
he got a bolt from the blue
spends his life in the courthouse
and the song he was singin
it was the incredible force
and they're training their kids
and said to him with a grin
know the difference
they couldnt get no relief
well the artist
so he balanced the ashtray
they lost all of their land
if it will fly or it will crash
they paint my car like a target
he says he looks up to me
but i wish i could see him
it's the best home i ever had
then i grew up to be a fireman
he wasnt worried
she was a teen queen
he's always on someone's mind
she recognized
impossible to take the time
the gates again
but i missed the rest
i was always behind
but something is found
when i was faster
close my eyes and i see the danger
i wonder why
more are being born while you rest
he said we all have to fly
we all have to sin
give me all the love you have to give
but the sand in my shoes
and i feel like a bull
it would be like a wonder
and i cant help but feeling
pieces from here and there
to sing for you
floating in love's atmosphere
we're on the road to never
hey ho away we go
we're on the road to never
where life's a joy
we're on the road to never
until you help yourself
a perfect combination
you know a man needs a woman
soul of a woman soul of a man
i saw cotton
southern man
your hair is golden brown
past the angry tide
it was mr jones
i put in my time
on your silver rails
i grabbed the lifeline
oh tell me where
but i've been a long time
two men stood face to face
a train load of people
from a life of crime
there was no one around
with five pit bulls inside
well it's hard to say
the vigilante people
they're puttin new windows in
and they dont know
nobody can figure it out
lee iacocca people
while two drunks sat
takin limos
for the modern home
yeah they're takin it
they're gonna bring
nothing was wrong
fake what they feel
if all of our dreams wont come true
i'm talkin to you
by myself and
what i'm smiling for
by myself and
my my hey hey
but he's not forgotten
than meets the eye
but i'm so down today
they make me look up
see the lonely boy
you open up and let me in
but we paid the price of time
we danced beneath silver rain
it's a fallen situation
it's a sad communication
pardon my heart
you brought it all on
i doesnt matter where i lie
i like to lay low
i doesnt matter where i lie
if a man is making music
no matter where i go
how about this new mercedes benz
i never hear my record on the radio
pulling like you did
found love in the people
peace and love
peace and love
you know it takes
but still
a long long time
like when you treated her kind
you know it takes
when the night's
lookin for a place
people walk in the street
floating to the sky
the concrete canyon walls
i had my friends
tell me i'm not to blame
someone's hanging out
i'm picking something up
electrical energy
'cause i'm here
tried to save the trees
when i got it home
i went back to the store
and the homeland
they massacred the buffalo
to sleep with pocahontas
and the astrodome
come along and say you can
you know you got
you know you got
there's a white boat
i hope they didnt come to stay
left me here
numbers add up to nothin
that pulled the trigger
going back to cypress river back to the old farmhouse
prairie wind blowing through my head
trying to remember what daddy said
prairie wind blowing through my head
going back to cypress river back to the old farmhouse
is the way it should be
from the ground
on a friday night
in these high heel shoes
in these high heel shoes
i got the blues
and the way the story started
been working his magic
because love is everywhere
love's the question
refreshing fountain
for the dj's daughter
i come down
how could people
oh yeah something more tame
oh yeah something better bred
oh yeah something more slow
oh yeah something more true
now you give to me
and you lay me down again
and so is the sea
finding that what you once
i believe in you
do you think
they all try to help me
but i cant find it yet
i got a problem
and what is wrong
who will understand
let me wonder why
i wonder why
do you think that
do you think that she'd
when you walk in a room
you know you got it
you're living like a satellite
if you got love
if you got love
hang on to my hat
that's the shape i'm in
goin goin
i've been to countries
i'm like a white man
i was driving way too fast
while i run away with you
cause i'm not tied
when they take another life
to the old boats
under lights
on the brutal crimes of love
and watched for him
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
cause i'm your kind of guy
i'll give it a try
in the great divide
you're gonna like the way you feel
you dont fit in too well
you are so inviting
by the time you stop to figure
once there was an inca queen
and they a mountain city raised
the drums were heard
she gazed at her sundial
in the sun
i'm happy singing
to bring my guitar home
calling me
instead of tearing
why dont we try
or the way that
three fine children
the ride has just begun
well i'm standing
thinking to myself now
of the birds outside on the roof
fading away
and the young birds call out to be fed
as he stops with the policeman to chat
just a memory without anywhere to stay
fading away
on the railroad track
aint got nothing on those
but the thought never struck me
you'll never be a hero
they chanted death to america
it's midnight on the bay
walkin right up to me
blowin down through the keys
watching old re runs
but by the elevator
there's a lone red rider
up in that new space station
except the sky is fallin
we gotta change
oh yeah
but when there are clouds above
once more laid down
your healing light
down to the streets
or trade away
are doin fine
sell borrow or trade
and i'll bring
says that detroit
aint got no digital clock
motorcycle mama
down the proud highway
i always get in trouble
my message is ready
oh hello mr soul
but a stranger
known me better
for the race of my head
i didnt feel the change
i lost the feeling
i want to get you back
let's say that it's not over
so now it's up to me
have you ever felt all alone
took a spin in the laundromat
just a mirror and you and me
have you ever been lost
i'm movin prety fast
almost time to live your dream
why are you growin up so fast
his flock is close at hand
take the lead somehow
i've got to keep my heart
it's not too late
than to fade away
the king is gone
there's more to the picture
explodes
flies
around the world
once more laid down
your healing light
down to the streets
or trade away
of my soul
you had so much
one more sleep
a natural beauty should be preserved
of my soul
i watched the needle
and the damage done
that turn to lies
does it say
all alone
why cant we
you cant hide
cant decide which way you wanna go
like singin the same old song
searchin for quality
i cant put it down
no one else will know
searching than in finding
my overcoat is worn
amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind
fields of fuel rolling on for miles
we only shot a few
ring ring
who was right or wrong
maybe now we can show the world
that it's painful
and i think
no time left
that it's painful
how i wondered where i'd go
land of promise
going down in the west
where even richard nixon has got soul
even richard nixon has got it
soul
i am a lonely visitor
things i know arent true
things i know arent true
i cant believe your lyin
and when i get to shore
i saw him in nassau in 1971
was passin its time
and when i get to shore
i'll give her the money later
now would be the time
she just couldnt face the men
but we had our share of good times though
that was a great vacation
when life's complete
change your mind
you just cant play the clown
change your mind
you've heard
embracing you
distorting you
the morning comes
without the magic touch
change your mind
change your mind
is that you stranger
a dreamer of pictures
a dreamer of pictures
good lookin milly's got
there's another poor man
pushed it over the end
falling down
pushed it over the end
we do get up in the mornin
aint a day goes by
when your friends start
it's no surprise
'cause when all is said and done
johnny wants to find out why
and hope came in the gun
oh yeah he's still back there
oh yeah johnny ride on
be the one to take this feeling
a reason to hide babe
a reason to run babe
let's go downtown
when the moon begins to rise
snake eyes french fries
come on baby let's go downtown
sure enough
it's not as bad
give me strength to move along
and that's all right
the laughter in your eyes
we got so much to be happy about
look in the shadow to see
shooting blind
in god's perfect plan
we got so much to be happy about
he only gave us the good things
in the cities deep
i used to build these buildings
on the hill where custer was
slicing through the culture
but for you i'll give it a try
elusively she cut the phone
she saw her clothes were changing
or crossing the usa
you're hung up on the line
you never gave good 'phone at all
call me up some time
good to see you
i've been down the endless highway
goodbye dick goodbye dick
said edith as she filled his cup
we couldnt even catch the cat
as she pushed the paper in
and they should cut the line
they wanted to interview grandpa on the porch
and it aint my crime
and loaded up both barrels
he looked like he was tryin to talk
fightin for freedom of silence
are filled with strangers
wherever she goes we'll be there
now we dont go there anymore
you wont fit in too well
do you know who you are
i took the time to try to fit you in
of hoof beats pounding
up on a hill
and it cut through the night
and they all were gone
guilty train
and though their love
and whispered in the halls
was hangin on a limb
and though their love
you feel it slip away slip away
calling like you always do
now you call up every day
slip away
come a little bit closer
because i'm still in love with you
because i'm still in love with you
i used to think of him he used think of me
for god's sake wont you listen to me
he never meant to hurt me
but he never meant to hurt me
oh johnny do you miss me
yes i heard you calling
you will be no friend of mine
if you call out in the dark
from these feelings i cant hide
when i saw you in my rearview
why dont we both take a ride and turn that key
i'll be there for you when you want me to
they hurt me so
and now that i actually heard it
just what you want me to
just what i want to do
just what you want me to
i've lost you x5
is about a child who now has gone
and tell me that i can
to be apart from what you've done
they hurt you every day
to be apart from what you've done
can you prolong this tragedy
when you watch the blood but you dont bleed
how can someone like you work that slow
we'd get along like a house on fire
i found myself forgotten too
and you will look inside
they're in retreat
i'm gonna give them up someday
behind closed doors
but there's no sense in telling me
i'm feeling like i never should
i get down on my knees and pray
those who came before me
but if it wasnt for your misfortune
when your heart grows cold
and i never could be true
there's a shadow of another hanging over me
the way you told me i was wrong
while i need words like these
i'm here for you
in an hollow land
and the sound in my head goes round and round
this is why events unnerve me
watching her these things she said
any kind of fool with the will to live
and i am not a part of society
and this is how it feels to be
sometimes the dreams are better
all i did for you
i wanna scream i wanna shout
it was pretty strange it's gonna change
by 4 o'clock it's gonna change
how can i ever make you understand
you've got to pull yourself together man
you just cant believe me
you cause me confusion you told me you cared
i was sure that i told you it was good from the face
and he's saying
on a frozen floor
it was summer now it's autumn
needs someone so keep it coming
keep it coming keep it coming keep it coming
it comes and it goes and it frightens me
inside of me inside my soul
in my mind thoughts are becoming clearer
the number of forgotten years
in our failures and it's not time
i need you near to me now
but i want to be with you
i cant live without your love
i'm not aware of the passing of time
i want it to be like it did at the start
charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end
i wanted to be like it was in the start
you'd dearly like to turn away
remember life is strange
save it for another day
i wouldnt even trust you
wake up every day that would be a start
just wait till tomorrow
i believe in everything
the signs were there for all to see
and even on the darkest night
well get up jack
you keep telling me that i am wrong
dont waste my money baby
it's too real to be shown to someone i dont know
some people like to deceive you
every step we take is the one
keeping my world in my hands
sweet and simple
which book to read
and my love for you will never die
good times around the corner
you work your way to the top of the world
but i know that i'm ok
change your mind and stay
anytime you want me
sometimes you think i'm ok
anytime you want me
i wish i could cross this great divide
no reason ever was given
all i get from you is shellshock
it's never enough until your heart stops beating
the fire in your soul from the end to the start
a victim of your evil sin
sister ray said i love you
that i love you
sister ray said i love you
see that bird is floating high
the sea was very rough
to hit and not to miss
so i got up on my feet
to hit and not to miss
i cant get enough of this
how does it feel
someone like you someone like you yeah
we're lost in a cruel paradise
but how can i afford to be
it ended up in an awful fight
you search for the life you need to find
every drop of wine
every time i hear your name
i'm not the kind of person that you need
it was like water down the drain
so why wont you let me recover
lets defend the things we say
anytime we wanted to
i saw his face and shook my head
is causing deprivation
that's holding our salvation
and all the sights that could be seen
is causing deprivation
so wrong they could be
when people work so hard
you wont even notice that you are alone
i live with the fear of the few with the gift
but it's time you remembered us now
every second counts
you make me feel so good
the smile upon your face
i'd end up on my own
every second counts oh when i am with you
every second counts when i am with you
and when we kiss we speak as one
you were once the main attraction
when she cried such a lot
at the end of the day
and when we kiss we speak as one
how much is free
cause we use what we've got
i see my future before me
wont you show me please show me the way
i said oh how i cannot bear the thought of you
i said oh how i cannot bear the thought of you
guess what i'm gonna do to you
to be a part of me
that's why i love you babe
but most of all
i need your love i just wanna buy it
you sure know a lot for a girl
i want you now something that you gotta know
i want your love how can you deny it
listen to me
i couldnt take this from no other
i was blind and i couldnt see
yes you'll come back to me
'cause i always know
shining so bright he'll get you flying
this leap ahead
he'll get you flying flying flying
shining so bright he'll get you flying
and now your life is running wild
what's that thing i saw him give you
you've gotta get back in control
give me give me give me
it's been ten long years since i've been home
if i hate the job and i hate the place
for a mixed up guy
my love falls from heaven
taken from the killing ground
caressing the marble and stone
someday we will die in your dreams
and coming back for more
we're so high
you are my jetstream lover
you are my jetstream lover
dont let it go
but that's what you do to earn your daily wage
i've got to change your mind i've got to change your mind
and this is where i wanna be
just give me one more chance one more chance
a hundred unions in the snow
from my head to my toes
but from my head to my toes
you were seeing someone else for all of this time
where you find sadness i find sorrow
with all this nonsense and your lies
and now i need an alibi
because if not you will be soon
i knew we'd get nowhere
could you tell i didnt care
i lived in a town called liberty
i knew that i could never give
why dont you look at me
i spent a lifetime working on you
i want to see my family
for my country i would die
then i looked into her hand
once out of reach we never speak we never compromise
assassin clears his hands i know that and i wasnt even
two times didnt feel quite right
i just want some action
i didnt know what i was doing
well think again friend 'cause it's not true
need some satisfaction
i tried but i cant find you
our rendezvous just ended in sorrow
oh i cant find you
crows crows crows i hate them
i want you i want you i need you i need you
i want you i want you i need you i need you
jolene i could've seen you there
only when meanings have no reason
thinking hard about the weather
we believe in a land of love
we believe in a land of love
the rain and the sea and the hours
same place same time
it's always the same
it grows so slowly
it's called love
it's called love
i've known you from the start
without you i'm left alone
know the feel of pain
without you i'm left alone
feel the rhythm sweetest sound
in port royal town the children are running
i couldnt look at you
by the hand of god
so desperately before
you got my time and you got my money
very small boys talked to me
to the childhood i lost replaced by fear
in a world that's just begun
to the childhood i lost replaced by fear
of the things that cost you too much
they're afraid of what they see
that my life would depend on the morning sun
i'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
seemed so glad to be here
i know they like what they see
dont steal my crown
take my hand
i dont wanna be like other people are
dont wanna have to work like other people do
tought that i was right
turn your eyes from me
what do you want me to say
turn your eyes from me
in the heat of the night
all those tears ago
time to go
i've seen what a man can do
i've seen what a man can do
i keep hanging on keep hanging on
i keep hanging on keep hanging on
i keep hanging on
but sometimes it's not enough
when you're gone
filling up this universe
when you're gone
how many words do i have to say hey
that's the only thing about it
failure of your moral code
who do you think you're talking to
at the end of the road
breath held tight inside of me
at the end of the road
someone i knew and he was lost
just like a lock without a key
just like the blood that burns in me
it dont mean much to me
sit against an open wide
he dont need nobody else
overtime 4x
try to get it right
take him on
its never gone
make your own play
its never wrong
but do it at the right time
is the master plan
we're playing the song
arrivederci its one one one
can you feel it can you feel it
how long would it last that's the price of love
go home young offender and stay undercover
like an angel
a search that shall remain
the search that shall remain
a search that shall remain
the path we can not take
give in a changing value
no looking back now we're pushing through
this friend of mine would fall apart
i'd often thought he was deranged
then a fight breaks out on your street
just like a feeling i need it's no joke
that was urgent to myself i do believe
oh no i've never met anyone quite like you before
all the jagged edges disappear
i want a little bit
take the skin and peel it back
it let's pick away at it
and on and on
and on and on
i will be beside you before long
held against your forehead
shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
the biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
dont try to tell me that some power can corrupt a person
trading in my god for this one
you get me closer to god
through every forest above the trees
but i watched it way too long
i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground
now just this hole it's open wide
come again some other day
i was up above it
i used to be so big and strong
used to think was me is just a fading memory
break you
just might be true
we fit perfectly
just how damaged have i become
and i cant turn back
on this track
i just do what i've been told
sometimes i think i'm happy here
a little bit comes bleeding through
it took you to make me realize
covered in hope and vaseline
get down make love
make love
in fact its too much
you wanna cool down
getting a little erratic here
nothing to worry about
i think i'm losing my grip but i can still make a fist
between what i've been trying so hard to see
how hard is it to see
and it burned so bright
with the color of your skin
and we see the light
slave screams he's being beat into submission
slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall
just some flesh caught in this big broken machine
no you cant take it
you're going to get what you deserve
bridge
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
i awake
we're tied to
and again
how much i've tried to
but i remember everything
on my liar's chair
goes away in the end
you know how this world can beat you down
i do not want this
you would know wouldnt you
i do not want this
i want to do something that matters
i remember sometimes
the smell of sunshine
chorus
well she knows exactly what i cant resist
i'm still caught up in another of her spells
i am purified
i give you all you need to know
mr self destruct
i give you all you need to know
chorus
carry out the sentence
scraping through my head 'till i dont want to sleep anymore
i just want something i can never have
just a fading fucking reminder of who i used to be
just stains on my sheets
drink the fountain of decay
swore it wouldnt change is different now just like you
i listened to everyone now i know that everyone was right
and when i suck you off not a drop will go to waste
i bet you think this song is about you
once i could see now i am blind
i'll heal your wounds
a thousand throats a thousand lungs
chorus
yes i do
but i cant stop what has begun
we went and took some more
i got survivalism
i got revisionism
but you'd do the same thing in the circumstance
hey god why are you doing this to me
that's what i get
that's what i get
the me that you know had some second thoughts
i can try to get away but i've strapped myself in
this is the beginning
we face no consequence
may be too late as far as i can tell
just for the fuck of it
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside
and things well things they tend to accumulate
but they start to make me think things i dont wanna know
there are so god damned many of them it gets hard to breath
the plastic face forced to portray
problems have solutions
fragile
i wont let you fall apart
where we used to meet
how can this be real
there's nowhere left to hide
all the one's that arent allowed to stay
i cannot make this feeling go away
why does it have to be this way
and when the day arrives
i'm going all the way down i'm leaving today
come come come on you've gotta fill me up
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive
i want you to break me
for you to go and take this to smash it apart
we cover ourselves with lies
i believed i could get better with you
i give you all that you want
now doesnt that make you feel better
maybe maybe just once i get what's coming
you know
i thought i deserved just a little more
what you want from me
hey can we stop
i define myself
we've had enough of you now
countdown to the end but make it go faster
this is your disaster
well times i passed through
memorabilia
memorabilia
i am the sex that you provide
i am denial guilt and fear
i am the needle in your vein
i am the truth from which you run
you and i we may look the same
can you hear it now
standing there in all your grand naivety
we will not go away
smiling in thier faces
you can keep on sucking until the blood wont flow
i know that you wont
i'm losing focus
yes i am alone but then again i always was
chorus
well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab
only x8
you're just too physical physical no to me
but you're too physical physical to me
just too physical
nothing can stop me now
nothing can stop me now
time starts slowing down
all my life
never be enough
purest feeling
purest feeling
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
oh my precious whore
and it's all
would you find yourself
while you're hiding in the trees
find yourself afraid to see
promise carved in stone
wrap my eyes in bandages
do something for me
to murder everything
the limitless potential
everywhere you go
you're keeping in step
are you brave enough to see
will you chew until it bleeds
will you stay down on your knees
i knew what side i'm on
i dont know i dont know i dont know
and right now i'm so in love with you
maybe i'm all messed up
my moral standing is lying down
and i want you
my fear is warm to get inside of you
there is a place that still remains
i was standing right there
so much potential or so we used to say
underneath it all
and all the might have

the doctor was not pleased to see him
the priest's expression did not change
wrapped in brown paper back to his room get every drop in the dropper
dropper cold hall and knocked on the door of room eighteen
with compound junk interest the old priest stood there feeling the boy

do you think i'm looking hot
running on empty but i have had plenty
do you think i'm looking hot
do you think this hits the spot
when you're laying so close to me
set me free
i can fool you and attract attention
no courage to show my true colors that exist
if the magic's in the make up
i'm looking at a picture of your face
for us to hang out
and there are flowers above to my surprise
i anticipate us making out
and honestly you can trust me
you're thinkin of drinkin on water
not knowin you're sinkin
unless you cork the hole
row your boat to shore
boat
in the morning i wake up
and i get one every year
social tradition interference
all the unknown chemicals
but i'll be buried six feet underground
with no elbow room
'cause you're only sixteen
'cause you're caught between
they're just products
like you're such a freak
listen to the flute play
slither down to your lair
hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war
concoction of malicious lies
slither down to your lair
open the basket
at first i cannot see and then i see it's me
is it 'cause the lights are too bright
but in the back of my mind i will be enslaved
if i had a chance to go back now
but in the back of my mind i will be enslaved
mean it
from now on hoo i mean it i mean it
the nation soundquake
aw the ground is shakin under me hey
chorus
i feel the grou nd
shake shake
and how it was
do you remember how it was
but i still think of you so much
but i still care about you so much
yeah sorry i'm not home right now
communication a telephonic invasion
no matter who calls
a likely story but yeah leave a message
i'm walkink into spiderwebs
how bad i feel about it
i got no other option
why'd you squeal
i cant begin to tell you
who's the narc who wrote it and said it
its kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake hes making
stand and deliver your money or your life
i keep staring i cant stop it
s t a r i n g
c'mon baby get the lighter
chorus
i missed you in my sleep
we're gonna start the fire
now let's spend the morning sweetly
your bitterness erased by my sense of taste
and all of the planets are lined in the sky
i cant feel
i love you i love you i do do do do do
but you looked like me on sunday
out of fashion so i can complain
you're on the other side of the mirror
and you want me badly
and trouble's what we are
i want to call you
we knew this was coming
suspension without suspense
i'm just nevertheless here for me
well it just wouldnt be the same
that's just me
but you still keep looking
you want it
another cool wind comes through and brushes my skin
pulling myself up by a rope
must keep on climbing up to the clouds
must keep on climbing up to the clouds
so i can sparkle and be the envy of my friends
confined it flutters
and there really isnt hope for the two of us
what's life like in a candy swirl
never try to rearrange
11 o'clock roll roll it down
total hate total hate total hate total hate total hate
now the drawbridge has been lifted
on heads that are small
whose dreams are buried
one too many times
whose dreams are buried
it sucks up our lives and proliferates lies
to life's paradox
and we're all trapped in a box
trapped in a box
ooh ooh ooh ooh
i'll be fine
with some time
with some time
i'm under some construction
cause i wanna know everything
some people cant be tamed
what happened to us
i'm so scared of what i might find there
oh i'm looking in your eyes
but you see the colors in me like no one else
you're really lovely
so many moons that we have seen
you were always burnin
oh that i'm sure
underneath it all
it's such a waste
i know
i dont know who i am anymore
oh being with you's such a delight
and i'll put up with you and your dirty deeds
i'll put up i'll put up i'll put up
i'm gonna play this game
all i can do is wait for you
just waiting in the waiting room
ooo you're so mine
will you call me when it's my turn
where's your lovin
the thought of you comin makes me come a runnin
what time will be chose
where's your lovin
as the correct way to exist
the big picture unseen
you see there's many many many
it's the dawning of a new era
the next you're gone
and win the race
you're misunderstood
they're messing with your mind
you can do it
he only knows what he may
you cant forget the first time you brought him home
no you cant teach an ol dog new tricks
it started out so sweet
my army of words
'cause you're so foxy
and it's painful but it's your fault
i'm lucky they had me on a leash
and it's so sad it's too bad
maybe i can make you feel better
you're singing in a band with a mic on in your hand
now it's too late to find your destiny
i'm missing you my friend i hope we meet again
cant you see his pants on fire
now i need to find you out
dont act so unaware
hey girl save the liar
now i'm you're brokenhearted detective
two sisters only have their parents to blame
he and she two different people
and think about the planet
are all the different people
look at me i'm my own person
and still i sit and lie awake all night
you gonna come down with the new lyrics
see now ooh woh
shall be the end corner stone and ah
you bound to come down with the new style
i wont wait so long
go take yourself for a walk you make me sick
and you're barking when she calls
you're in the doghouse
your mistakes i keep in the back of my mind
even a little bit
you got me filled up now
walk in the park under sapphire skies
dont blow it even a little bit
dont let me down
dont blow it even a little bit
so dont blow it no not a little bit
we used to be together
i know just what you're saying
mighty frightening
i dont need your reasons
i know what you're thinking
and i dont need your reasons
woo hey uh uh no way
i'm not your kneaded eraser
dont treat me like that
i'm not your shoe string your rope thing
and your sweet persuasion is making me weak
you fall and then i'll catch you
we always come back for more
why you playing around with me
close your eyes and think of me
come on i bring it on cant turn it off
i'm gonna take it easy
so tell me what's so great about perfect
got to get a change of scenery
gonna take it easy
i wanna be there
fills the air
oh ricardo dont you love me anymore
it's what i live for it's just a way of life
he's got it he's got it deep down inside
the bull and the matador together part
and it's so much more than a job
the years were flying by
i want to fill my glass up
let's end it on this
you see in the past i had a dream
geive me one last kiss
and now i know i've been dreaming
given one last chance
and everything i chose
so deep inside she had to know
to my best friend my faded lover
everything i do
for everything there is a reason
then we will know it will show
everything always in time is gone
the food is eaten and the boat is docked
everything's wrong
that's all i say i say no more
everything's wrong
when you knew that we were different completely
i find myself trying to change you
i'm another ex girlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
i'm holding sings up
chorus
please make space for me in the time yet to be
and there's a force
a little of your time
it all comes full circle
it all comes full circle
it all comes full circle
it all comes full circle
dont call me skaface
blink
no gesture too small
no gesture too small
so dont be so damn lazy
blink
we've only just begun
where are we going to
and when will they begin to help us
and where are we now
just like venus in the morning sun
so dont you let go
that's spinning so fast 'round the world
and we're so lucky
just like venus in the morning sun
the other way like the other ones
and when i'm in my room alone i feel good
i guess i'll get over it
greener pastures
there's no looking back
you killed the pair
that's to bad i'm not that easy
are you happy now
billy kill that drummer
both but not for free
both anything i want anything
and it's paid for and i'm so grateful to be nowhere
billy it's not for free
billy it's not for free
so insecure
i'm just a normal person
just end it
let it build up
just give up
'cause you're my heartbreaker dream maker love taker
you're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasies
and i wouldnt mind if my name changed to mrs
a creature conditioned to employ matrimony
i'm not how i used to be
a simple kind of life
if we met tomorrow for the very first time
when all i ever wanted was the simple things
so though we are in danger
here i come to save the day
sheep
compelled to spell it out no doubt in search
music's the life flowing through is it not
compelled to spell it out no doubt in search
dont be afraid let your feelings show
dont let it go away this feeling has got to stay
dont let it go away this feeling has got to stay
and i cant believe i've had this chance now
and i enough old friends
let me introduce you to my new friend

why me a three times
kick back relax feel happy and lazy
dont let it go away
and you're not familiar
dont let it go away

cant believe it
popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps
christmas day on the roof down 20 oxford street
when the skins left him there and went down the fire escape
i know exactly what he'd say
i could be wrong
it always comes back to you and me
one more summer
one more weekend
i'm your weakness
behind your barricade
'cause you're so scared of losing
and do it right now
open the gate up hurry
or i'm gonna knock the damn door down
a passive pondering of blackness
today 'cause you're not around
today is gonna be simple
paulina i wish she'd take off all her clothes
paulina i wish she'd lay down by my side
but i'm underneath the covers
i want a platinum blonde life
i'm gonna asleep my life away

with you right by my side
as fast as we can
sometimes it's hard to keep on running
cause you inconvenience
dont pretend to be naive
from the compilation mom music for our mother ocean
tried to see if i'll give up
sail on sail on sail on sail on aaaaah
so how will we know when there's nowhere to grow
checking in to check you out
but you can see it my eyes you can read on my lips
been around the block before doesnt matter anymore
and i really mean it this time
i'm a rough and tough i'm a rough and tough
trying to get a hold on this
i smashed up his last years pay
it's all over the deed is done
that's the way it looks when you show off
now thy name we call out
lay of ennui prince of the darkness
i am the substance of the chaos
the afterlife
the crowd was screaming in pain
the unknown came riding along
we'll lead the revolution through the streets
join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
now the time is soon at hand so beware
the fallen ones emerge out of the mist
to come on strong again
and the night will come and spell will
s
for my questions to be
my past still haunts me
the dragons blood
dragonisle
stand the chance stand in faith
might men would gather
it makes the sky burst into flames
look within yourself to find the true meaning
to live the dream you never knew
we'll be free at last if we stand as one
watch the reconstruction
eliminate the world
the powers will lie there unbound
been sent to hell and back
the dream about the day when i'll never die
we will see the shore of our land
death at their side
now men must laude the demons mark
give me a sign i'll carry on
only brave men with hearts of steel
beyond the stars to find the pentagram
to a land beyond the stars
battle begins
but the treasures are found
onward they ride always side by side
they will never give in
they will never give in
lives forever
the ring that she wears
by the rightful owners strong demand
petrified heart eases the pain
over valleys and hills
riding along the skyline flame
dyed in black
sword of steel will laude the one
standing lost at a crossroad
whose fate will be sealed
by the sword it settles
will keep our faith alive
below the unknown truth
serpent of death child of the darkness
eyes lit with fire a snake in disguise
feel the rage and the strike of the iron force
a knight is sworn to valour
before fear do your work
heed the command
you bear the powers of a second sight
your name is carved in stone
of your time long gone
no savior uo high
your soul will be free
search the inner soul
salvation is the crime
this cant be real wake up in time
the fury of madness the power of dreams
unholy powers are taking control
ride hells in fury an evil in believe
wake up dead
riding out in the storm
side by side
we could fight 'till the end
pride for the ones who died for the cause
would gather again so see through the eyes of
stare through the eyes of the
glory victory forever hail
the storm shall howl and now descend
a bell will ring inside your head
and all will be brand new
i dont know what it is
you want to be alone
what's sleepin in our soul
the things that sleep inside
what's sleepin in our soul
because we need
is it time to doubt is it time to wait
maybe your time is coming
to go through all the things that i want to be
you're gonna make a better day
wont you make me walk into the light
when you find out
tonight this is your life
tonight this is your life this is your life
as long as they've got cigarettes in hell
i dont mind not being immortal
your shit jokes remind me of digsy's
but all right now yeah yeah
and i know you'll understand
cos in a car you can go far
who had a face like a nun in pain
and all my friend are there at the bar
cos in a car you can go far
you're the hero that's still unsung
specially when your hands are tied
but you dont care because you're living fast
you're the un invited guest who stays 'till the end
i just avert my eyes to the pain
if you gave me a fresh carnation
i just sat back and i let it go
no one's gonna fight in a ten bob revolution
i feel like a bona fide
no one's gonna fight in a ten bob revolution
bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
chained to all the places that he never wished to say
slowly walking down the hall
wake up the dawn and ask her why
caught beneath the landslide
how many lives are living strange
in a champagne supernova
where were you when we were getting high
to spend your days in the sunshine
you might as well do the white line
cos when it comes on top
you gotta make it happen
i feel a chill in the air
my business everybodies minding
the wind that brings on the rain
what i heard is not what i hear
so here it is merry christmas
everybodies having fun
so here it is merry christmas
tomorrow never knows what it doesnt know too soon
what's the story morning glory
need a little time to wake up
well
but what you think that you heard slipped away at the back of your mind
failed the life in the city
i think no that's not the way
it must be the music
it must be the music
around this town you've ceased to be
slowly down the hall of fame
talkin 'bout my generation
talkin 'bout my generation
yeah and dont try and dig what we all say
people try to put us down
my my my my generation
you hide it so i'll never find
cause the lord i know dont got no faith in me
cause the lord i know dont got no faith in me
you're my lover i'm your brother
like diamonds in the sky
but i really cant take the pain
the feelings they go
call out no one would hear
people tomorrow they say well i say what a pity
keep on trying
show me who you are
and your hands right upon the wheel
there's no easy way out
you're not concerned about the way we are
the day's moving just too fast for me
tonight i'm a rock 'n roll star
it's just rock 'n roll
you bring me down i think you're rude
i can give a hundred million reasons
try to sit with me around my table
'cause it's all too much for me to take
kiss the girl she's not behind the door
kiss the girl she's not behind the door
you wanna be who you'd be
the paper boy is working before he goes
round are way the birds sing for yer
round are way the birds are singing
it's been so long
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
i know i'd help you if i can
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
throwing it all away
cause you dont mean anything to anyone anymore
i've been to the slaughter slept with your daughter
until this cold stop has ceased
you're the devil in me
i'd like to be somebody else and not know where i've been
it's the right time
and if the sword is among ya
and her ways are high and steep
with someone who loves me too
i've got my mind made up now
we dont get on with one another
and i want you to say
i hope the light shines on we as one
as we wish the world away
shout it out loud when i'm alive
but you said please dont
to do what we've done
i'll find a way
in which they live
it wont be long
but i believe that i rule my world
and i'm singing out my revolution song
go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
it was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend
the sink is full of fishes
she's a little pirate in my mind
then she flew away into the night
so what's the matter with you
if you're leaving will you take me with you
and i think that it's not quite right
she said to me
you might even think you're gonna call
i need to lighten my load
we'll be alright step out tonight
you'll never change what's been and gone
and be on your way
you'll see them some day
and stop crying your heart out
here is a pocket full of life with no solution
what does he mean
take it for what it is its only drunken lies
what you need
see how they fly like lucy in the sky see how they run
see how they smile like pigs in a sty see how they snied i'm crying
i am the eggman oh they are the eggmen oh i am the walrus goo goo g'joob
if the sun dont come you get a tan from standing in the english rain
the name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
i'm tired of my life but my head's alright
and it's got me on my knees
and i know i'm not alone
and it's got me on my knees
it's got me on my knees
and from my chains i think it's a pity
and if i hear the names you call
i'm feeling like i'm down on my knees
i will believe
i will believe
just you wait and see
no dont shake me
keeping an eye on the world going by my window
life my head i'm still yawning
and if you dont understand
let there be love
and there's no need to blame
let there be love
but everybody knows
if everybody came alive
was only sleepin in your brain
your shame is not enough
but what you heard before
the people here on life's beaches they wish upon the waves that hide the sand
and crashing in upon a wave
you demand the answers but i dont know why in my mind
my head like a rock sitting upside down
but you dont say what you mean
i will keep the dream alive
scream a symphony
to breathe with everything
to spend a little lifetime
shake up your tired eyes
just what is takes to get through to you
let's all make believe
let's all make believe
i've been and gone i wont be back
to free me from this naughty league
who's gonna make you pay
my way back home
but i dont mind being on my own
but my god woke up on the wrong side of his bed
little james we're all the same
i'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
how your garden grows
we see things they'll never see
but now is not the time to cry
a whole other world in my mind
the world that i want deep inside
nah nah nah
blowing my mind
love me and leave me
say hello in some astral bar
just love me and leave me
hey lyla
an extraordinary guy
will live and die by their own sword
i've been and now i've gone
but what for
the little voices in your head at night
but i'm not sure if it ever works out right
cos it never never never works out right
you need to find out
you cant be no one else
'cos no one's gonna tell you what i'm on about
will you sit down here for another day
cause i'm sat here on my own
so take me away
need a line
you took your last chance
of strawberry lemonade
i know i'm leavin
'bout how you saved my life
your eyes are telling lies
thank you for the good times
thank you for the good times
and it dont care for what you wear
and i'm howling at the moon
like a hurricane
you didnt believe
for you
it's a shame
up from the sky
or be shining for the rest of the world
cos to me it doesnt matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered
i get up when i'm down
there's a light that shines on
my girlfriend told me to get a life
i'll be fine
it aint no place to be killing time
and cast your words away upon the waves
which way they wanna go
the answer's in the looking glass
what is gonna be
i'm outta your league
now we'll take it all up tonight
all right i see the love in your eyes
it is shining
that ignorance and hate
of the beginning
so if you see me
and they got so blind
underneath the sky of red
so wish me away to an unknown place
hey you up in the sky
when you're inside me
welcome to my world
hey you up in a tree
when you're inside me
free to be whatever you
whatever i choose and i'll sing the blues if i want
whatever i choose and i'll sing the blues if i want
you feel you're older than time
and i hope you know that it's touch and go
and i hope you know that it's touch and go
i feel love
realized what you gotta do
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
by now you should've somehow
you're gonna be the one who saves me
you're gonna be the one that saves me
hey you've got to hide your love away
hey you've got to hide your love away
well it makes me money
girls grab their boys
and i dont know why
at your door
anymore
so cum on feel the noize
we'll get wild wild wild
i can go where i wanna
had no sun over my face
nature is calling for me you got me
know you're wrong you say you're right
your music's shite it keeps me up all night
know you're wrong you say you're right
'cept to sing for a rock 'n roll band
no no no
no no no
but i dont think we've been living very wise
if you would come to mine for tea
i dont wanna be there when you're
with all the things caught in my mind
so i start the revolution from my bed
please dont put your life in the hands
her soul slides away but dont look back in anger i hear you say
and climbing trees
and all of your dreams
and find common ground
are lying in wait
we can talk
are lying in wait
we can talk
the fool on the hill and i feel fine
and on my shoulder he asked me why
i dont really care for what you believe
you've boarded up every door
i've never even seen
the dreams we have as children
'cause i dont think you live round here no more
while we're living
y'gotta be bad enough to beat the brave
sitting upside a high chair
i spend my time sittin on the fence with a mate of mine
there shines a light like dynamite
we believe that everything said is a waste of time
livin on my own was like a flashback
saying what i said was just a different story
dont matter now

that the suns gone down
are coming to take you in
then get on your knees and pray

bless yourself with a fiery hand
i'm a peacetime killer killer

from the hand of the wrong
tearing into the last remaining

i filled my heart with hatred
are you gonna take a long time dyin
just dont care

with thoughts that go astray

one million dreams i've had
and we're never gonna live it again
it was your face that placed the blame on you
i know we have
shame on you you're your own monopoly
i see sharon and i see jack
tell my bride to bury me in stull
tell my bride to bury me in stull
opposite sides of the same fence

sick and tired of the same ol shit
when it's over cry for sympathy
bless my soul time has come
sometime think before you speak
hit the road
i hope to see you on election day
it's hard sometimes to keep it together
and you're just the kind who's liable to never be found
beware the overdose
look inside inside my soul
is that what you want baby
it's a doll faced polaroid gonna hang it on my wall
you ready here come the pain
turning on the light that blinds me to make it easier to find me
hey hey hey
4 again
listening to what you have to say
as the motors whine
fill it with anger fill it with rage
win or lose this is what i choose
there's no tomorrow for all of you
there's no tomorrow for all of you
there's no tomorrow
when you're standing all alone
without question
when you're standing all alone
life was but a simple dream now all i see is red
i'm coming
i'm just killing time
every time i turn around
into a vord and seal the past
yes i think it's time to kill
today is the first day of the rest a' your life
he's 22 today
time wont go away no it wont
so you're gonna get up
and it goes on and on and on
underneath the gas lamp
under one nation under one
flies are fucking on my face i watch the magots breed
before it all is gone
no more to say
so bite your lip and shut your mouth it's no longer up to you
un
you never were undying
wait not in a hurry
just enough to keep you down
2 again
stimulate me to satisfaction
so pretty what's your name where ya from

but i dont mind anymore 'cause now my mind is wasted on a dream
take a walk upside yourself
you feel the weight of the world

so you cant see
this the way it has to be
nothing sacred
we are numb to all we see
just one sweep of the wreckin ball
the wreckin wreckin crew
pay in blood i demand
think that you will end it all
when the hand of fate will slap you
when the hand of fate will drop you
when you're alone and you're chilled to the bone
ch
they never get tired of putting me down
but what they're saying girl it cuts like a knife
soon you'll need a man
just to the tell upon what is tell
to the firestorm that feeds me
i'll be gone for a minute but no more that a week
with a one mantwo bit congregation
seem to happen everyday
unconscious in too much too soon
lead sebastianjoe
prechorus
hear me ride

i'll steal your life and cut out your heart
death the welcome stranger
path of destruction

the absence of colour surrounds a broken dream
columbian

the end of the line
i was there when lightning struck
quick and took you by surprise
no kissin concrete
puchin the red hey full out speed monkey

lust is the fire which warms you in the night
fatal if swallowed a love you cant resist
2 again

paused to scream this is not a sin
ooo victory ours

look up the weasle feel the reign of terror
i call the devil laughing as you bleed

run hide from the demons fate
with a long forked tongue kiss
sucked away the rest of time
driven by the high heat
instrumental
garbage from the plate
go away
they stood and watched
burnburn
go higher
my interference put them down at their knees
my lack of tolerance nice as you please
go high
your words they go right through me
one more to turn myself insane
you wont deny me
makes my reality fade away
twenty first century
twenty first century schizoid man
it's the best
you know i'm alive
the man with the broken soul
i dont have any plans to go anywhere
but i'm still alive
you know i'm alive
freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
carry the news i want to see you
we never got if off on that revolution stuff
all the young dudes i want to hear ya
all the young dudes hey you there with the glasses
boogaloo dudes how do you feel
in the darkness i can feel
i have fallen from grace and my ashes are scattered
the spirit it never lets go
back on earth
back on earth
then when he's found who he's looking for
they cursed and buried him
listen in awe and you'll hear him bark at the moon
will i believe in you
speculation of the wise
yeah
yeah
yeah
how many more have to die
blood running down like water
i watch them dying in vain
until the judgment day comes
you'll think you got away
watches those flames get higher and higher
if you're alone
bloodbath in paradise
murdered in your bed
and i know it
dont hurt them
you there's hope for you 2x
just hold you
and you swear you like to live your life in danger
nobody hears the things i say
well i know
i've lived so many lives
they freak me out
i tried to so hard to kill
can you hear them
and again
all the voices in my head
they freak me out
the time is coming but also going
it's all within my mind
journey to the centre of eternity
both
we going through changes
we going through changes
they'll fight the world until they've won
bombs exploding and tears are flowing chasing rockets and gasping for air
burn the witch and hang deserters there's only one choice to be made
solo
baby i get so scared inside
if i close my eyes forever
in your warm and darkened grave
i'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
the mutant child of a twisted state
you're preaching revolution
what do i see looking through your disguise
and i would not have you walking through this world
so wipe the tears from your eyes
to take your pain away
you cannot rule everybody in sight
dont try to tame me you'll eat my dust
we rock rock rock
oh dont you ever dont ever say die
never never never say die again
it's a part of me that tells you
there is no use in dreaming
the things that were are history
and the memory of freedom
i will give you those things you thought unreal
i'm going to feel
forever with me 'till the end of time
thoughts about you just wont let me sleep at night
your love is like a nightmare
i hope i wake when the morning gets here
your love is like a nightmare
voyeur straining in love with his hand
no bone movies
trying to deny it
read the daily fiction superman is dead
night in the shadow of man
the crushing weight on my shoulders now
a stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
no more tears
a levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
i close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here
dont tell me that you knew all along
say goodbye forever i'll wait for you in no mans land
try so hard to break me but all your diamonds turn to sand
i'm not going away
overbearing woman makin it so hard for me
now you see it now you dont yeah
give me central heating hope that i can pay the bill
tell me where we're going
maybe i'm just better off not knowing
get it up keep it up
it gets it all off your chest
something in my vision something deep inside
i heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
you dont need a ticket to fly with me i'm free yeah
oh yeah
telling you now of my state
never put her chains on me
everything will be alright
and with one pull of the trigger
over and over again
like my mama always said
ah
oh
ah
all i ever see is them and you
oh let my mother live
and it wont take too long
before it's too late
could it be a dream
it's in the lives that we lead
we can never go back
poison the air that we breathe
we can never go back
the point of no return
god bless the almighty dollar
but still the pain wont go
the doors have all been tightly slammed
tell me who's the liar
the doors are closed and cannot be opened
i warned you then and i'm warning you now
when it's the ultimate sin
from media messiahs
what did you see or dont you know
without warning the wizard walks by
never talking
therapy therapy
but first you've got to say pretty please
and right before they dig into my mind
let right left right
therapy
you think you live forever
and after all this could be you
'til my dying day
line after line
day after day
thinking how it might have been
you'd be better off dead
no more goodbyes or yesterdays
it leaves me mystified
dying by the rail
i hear the raging thunder as it roars
and am i ever gonna make the grade
you dont understand
is it all a mystery
too late standing on the trap door
and the thoughts so vile
the sentence of the helpless
through the trap door
too late standing on the trap door
i dont understand
consider my feelings just one time
i dont really give a damn
deafened by silence
spare me from the light
and then you lock me in a tomb
i'm waiting for darkness
i know what you'll find
i'm waiting for darkness
we shared forbidden fruit
i followed willingly
although you think i can
here's two options for the bridge
as the far is now nearer
as the war machine keeps turning
wait 'till their judgement day comes yeah
woman i can hardly express
please remember my life is in your hands
i love you yeah yeah now and forever
till you're so fucking crazy you cant follow their rules
a working class hero is something to be
what they say is no surprise
things are so much different now
how many times can they fill me with lies and i listen again
wont ever change may think it's strange
'cause rock'nroll is my religion and my law
and i cant imagine what empty heads can achieve
can they fill me with lies
leave me alone dont want your promises no more
king of a thousand knights pawn in a table light
outcome is obvious
'cos rock amp roll is my religion and my law
years turned you against me
something's tellin me i'm gonna break all the rules
i cant do nothing but sin
if you chose to criticise you choose your enemies
tell me where do i begin
living my life in a way that i choose
i dont need no doctor
flirting with disaster
dont know where i'm going
i was really losing
i could've been gaining
i should've been thinking
tomorrow will i find the sun
we'll meet in the end
what you gonna do
and i feel i've cleaned my mind
but that's what lights my fire
but kicking back dont make it
because today has just begun
dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
cross my heart until i die
no i dont want to let you down
and if you're lost i could not find your way
so i dont wanna be your hero
my shine wore off as time wore on
but as i saw that life was more than day to day
when i was young i was the nicest guy i knew
you think you're special
your future's fading
the years are passing
youre heads exploding
tempted by your twisted mind
your will is breaking
i cant save you now
how am i supposed to know
nobody ever told me i found out for myself
everyone goes through changes
asking me who to follow dont ask me
i like playing with danger and fear
dont need no mental masturbation
all my life i've been over the top
i dont wanna stop
standing on the crossroads world spinning round and round
i dont wanna change the world
tell me i'm a sinner i got news for you
tell me i'm a sinner i got news for you
i've heard it said there's a light up ahead
there are no impossible dreams
there are no incurable ills
there are no unachievable goals
all my life though some have changed
when i think of love as something new
iron man
in the great magnetic field
kills the people he once saved

the ministry of joy that still hasnt laughed
all these tears i cry
look into my eyes
let it burn away
cause i want something that i never had
time to open fire
say's it doesnt matter
and we dont need the ladies
rocky mountain way
just another lonely broken hero
i try to find a light to guide me home
many nights of tragedy
underneath my masquerade
nobody will ever let you know
and you dont care if you dont see
stormy day wont find me sinking
waiting on the shore
a raging sea below
repenting to holy unknowns
are lost in sin
but underneath the surface is a wound that cannot heal
although my eyes are open wide
and i'll see you i'll see you on the other side
straight across the great divide
they cant try to hurt me now
i can hear their empty reason
but just like the wounded and when it's too late
will the voices ever set me free
i need someone to tell me what it means
i need an angel who can rescue me
slow down your haste is making waste
slow down your haste is making waste
what you get and what you see
my eyes are blind but i can see
dont tell me that it's doing me wrong
i know it's gonna make you cry
be my tomorrow now tomorrow's today
you're not with me tonight
all these tears i cry
look into my eyes
take the light that burns inside you
do you think i'm mad
filling up your bed
there's no way out
the spiders disappearing from the night
now you'll feel him crawling over you
everything is taken down in sane
there's no escape
now i've met your honesty
tearful eyes of joy is something new
then it floods away tomorrow
now you live inside a bottle
wine is fine
i'll be with you darling soon
i'll be with you till my seas are dried up
i've been waiting so long
and left me wanting you and your kind
they put you down and shut you out
oh yeah
pleased to meet you
when the blitzkrieg raged
i shouted who killed the kennedys
every cop is a criminal
pleased to meet you
what's my name
the symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
a symptom of the universe a love that never dies
god damn them
there is no question
then thank god for the bomb
then thank god for the bomb
as we near the final hour
thank god for the bomb
they're never gonna stop
they're just the result of our society
i've listened to preachers
you gotta listen to my words
instrumental
i'll introduce myself today
dont speak of suicide solutions
but deep inside i'm afraid
you'll never believe it
you wouldnt believe it
i knew for sure i knew for sure
nothing has changed nothing's the same
i gotta keep rockin cause it makes me crazy
and i will demonstrate my holy power
and i'll persist until the battle's won
screaming at the window
manic depression befriends me
is he trying to get out
everybody knows all the highs and all the lows
it's a feeling it's revealing
like goin nowhere like goin nowhere
i may never know when it comes or when it goes
i dream my life away
who dreams of better days
i'm just a dreamer
dreaming my life away
let's wake up the dead
through the night you hear their cries
i'm praying that you'll never know
more tears are shed
that i'm facing hell
i saw it i saw it with my own two eyes all right now
so it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild
now castles crumble exposing his naked flames
you know you've really been so blind
you know you've really been so blind
fire i'll take you to burn
'gotta get away from here
flying high again
you'd see that black and white is read
oh no oh no
no use sayin sorry
are you just too cool no you're just perfectly cold
and control is still in view for a fool like you
he's hiding residing deep withing the crowd
looks like you by a fool like you
battle lines being drawn
i think it's time we stop children what's that sound
you better stop
i tried to entertain you the best i can
i'm not the kind of person you think i am
got no control
i'm not the kind of person you think i am
i fight the demon but it just wont fall
my haunted head and her wont leave me alone
baby i've got this sinkin feeling
well i'm afraid that i already know the answer
how gone how gone is goodbye
we cant give it one more try
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was memphis
think about you on my momma's front porch swing
maybe it was southern summer nights
yeah i play the part
long as they dont see the other side
i'm not one to show emotion like some folks i see
there's a tomcat in the alley scarin up a fight
between a whisper and a scream we'll find a prayer
the sign is turned around
no need to hurry home
sheltered untouched and alone
all of this love that i'm saving for you
with all of this love that i'm saving for you
you see i've already fallen
yeah i've already fallen
you see i've already fallen
go ahead and take your time
and my love there's time when we
who's that knocking in the middle of the night
now you're out there wanting back in
better than buying your lame excuses
just an occasional dinner and twirl from a regular guy
she won 'em over with her southern charm and a satellite dish
she's got a big screen she's in the in scene
and she comes out every night
she needs someone to hold
matraca bergmike noble
how could she hear as we laughed on that warm summer night
sweet abilena looks out at the midwestern sky
you know he didnt really mean to treat me so bad
i could see it every time he smiled
just call me cleopatra everybody 'cause i'm the queen of denial
i got the bleeding stopped but there's gonna be a scar
we had some bad times but we had good times too
well if you dont feel that old thrill
livin their lives day by day
are you still in his heart
dont tell me what to do
so dont tell me what to do
so dont tell me what to do
i'm movin in slow motion but it's motion just the same
draggin my chains
every time i hear your name
every time i say this prayer
i go and lose my nerve
let me show you all the love i'm hiding
you can tell by the smile on my face
you have made my world complete
you know it when you find one shining like a diamond
soon as she can find her wings
all roads lead to home this time
a daddy on the road added to her tears and trials
i met a kind and gentleman who thinks the world of me
pam tillisjess leary
sweetheart before this night is through
mi vida loco so you're crazy too
to the lowest lows
if someone had told us then
livin in a state of constant change
never never be the same
aint no going back now to that same old same
aint no two ways about it something here had changed
oh aint no two ways
i'm sorry darlin sounds too familiar to me
once is enough to be somebody's fool
it's just one of those things
if this is good bye then let's get it over
it's just one of those things
and i still havent done my hair
am i nervous
and all i've been praying for
went on and on about that little boy of mine
everything that i've been waiting for
let him be the right one
she's a popular girl
walkin down the hall she's always on parade
so on it goes for a popular girl
and the quickest way around that lonesome feeling
and if i can make it baby you can too
yea i know just where you're coming from
and there's one in every dreamer
well it's never lead a sheltered life
well it took a few falls till it got smart

i'll shake the sugar tree
with the cookin and the payin of rent
til i feel your love fallin all around me
i aint even gonna to ask you
right now you hate yourself 'cause you knew better

not giving in to the night
oh and he wrapped his arms around me
honey you sure look good
and then you make me feel so right
lover's quarrel sweetheart's dance
lover's quarrel sweetheart's dance
make each other crazy
every time she steps out on the stage
tequila mockingbird flying underneath the neon moon
tequila mockingbird dreaming of a love that ended too soon
she never comes to a stop
and he rolls he's a highway
she's a river he's a highway
it didnt take me long to mend the heart she tore in two
all the tears have disappeared without a trace
breakfast in bed
something i can trust
a man who loves me
so many nights we didnt fight but never talked much
this is a fight we can win and after all this time
we must be finally doing something right
going out every night
we've tried everything else
let's try love again
i can see a new expression on my face
standing right along side of you
'til the day he crossed the line
in a string of bad to worse
and they'll say he left alone
the stage is set
then everything would be alright
that's the way i wish i was
lewis andersonlisa silverrussell smith
you're going to see me in your memory
'cause you cant have a good time without me
and you look like a winner to me
the way you dress the way you dance
happy to be standing in your line of fire
'cause we know it's just a phase you're goin through
and i quote
you havent scratched the surface yet
you put the blue you put the fool you put the tears on my face
i cant get over watching you walk away
i could play with knives
i could dig'em up
if i wanna hear some empty promises
under the sun under the moon
wasnt god feelin good that day
and i could really use my one and only
the floor's getting crowded but i dont wanna take part
i could sure use your company now
i'm only in between dances
you'll know when the moment is right
so i'll hold you and cry
it aint easy bein easy
you think there's some adventure that you're missin
they're just remembering what they had
it's lonely out there
enough to know a chance worth takin
it's taken time it's taken patience waiting in the dark
even though you're tryin not to let it show
intense pressure hanging over my head
dont play games now baby
killer comfort
well i know shes done you wrong
i wanna warm your heart
i wanna warm your heart
said she made him free reckless and young
then you let that pony run
and you know what you know
livin aint livin if you dont take risks
taking chances and we're playing with fire
let's get crazy
we just cant turn our backs on a feelin like this
when i'm just a woman
will you love me then
i will love you then
i knew that it would be wrong
knowing that you're not immune
every night you're on the town
i've been so lonely so lonely too long
all the pressures tend to wear you down
you may forgive but you never forget
the song came and went
a cool evening dance
running down by the lakeshore
my skin is cold transfusion with somebody morose and
chorus
a nazi gangster jew it beats a dog that's dead
i vent my frustration at you old man after
but these years of detachment have left me with
i'm shoving my life right down your throat can i

and when she died
i wonder aloud
i didnt care to look around

beggin to please
never givin her love
they say the bad guys wear black

'cause high noon your doom
daughters of the queen
to live her life all alone

my body coiled steel
rock forever
the man of a thousand retirements

diet of life shelter without the face that cannot
to prove i'll try again
out of my mind gun up to the mouth
i'll end the problem facing nothing fuck you off fuck you all
unity is a rare thing
rage from our hearts within
it's digging time again you're nurturing the weakest trend
you look just like a star it's proof you dont know who you are
the conquering of our world
we're harboring the meek
this question haunts my mind
centered man swings a punch spits a tooth postures odd
a lifestyle that's unexplainabledont try and save what is all meant to be
i said i loved but i lied
you keep this love thing child toy
i'd take my life and leave love with you
rejectionthe kind that's self induced the tongue that's
rejectiontakes life away from eyes will give you to
a faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long
long absorb through pores the great escape
and in this place
for the terrifier
the vanquished would rise up
mighty oh valhalla
he's living on in valhalla
what it takes who i am where i've been
you cry to weak friends that sympathize
inside ulcer unjust bastards file out face first
born different after all
a blistered revenge awaits in me
their eyes dont look right should they be trusted now
just like them just like you
the smell in the air is chicken shit
i walk the
goodbye pain
there's nothing special about it
yesterday dont mean shit
embrace and fly through the madness
it can only be that way yeah
your music is your friend but the roof
it's all that we could need to plant the perfect
but in the back of his mind he well knows what
let it move in you got thin and got high and
wash away us all take us with the floods
and at night they might bait the pentagram
my heart keeps cryin
tonite could be the nite
let this feelin
it fits the attitude
and making friends
we stand alone
to serve and protect
some things you cant enjoy
and call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
chorus
and slayer it's goddamn electric
fist rejuvinated isolated no pressure
smacked her ass i called her sugar when i ate
but you wouldnt know what you were doing because
the vein
my soul for a goat yet i'll outlive the old
you're in the danger zone
you fall down on your knees
i want to love you
chorus
but over your head hangs a black cloud
who cares if theres no tomorrow
some pay to pray
i know what's right or wrong
is where i belong
what's left inside him
it's as if he were dead
he as hollow as i alone now
hear my words before it's through
i've been known
i'm cummin down on u
beat you with my stick
and the storm
ever shining
for daylight you pray
i i am the night
one day we all will die a cliched fact of life force fed
i wont let you in to have a story to tell
i still feel incomplete
painted face olive drab swollen hole empty bag sunken eyes
spitting teeth oral lust alley fuck angel dust anal
who bears an evil mark
to lure you to steal your gift
to self indulgent ties
seeping down to the bone
it has given me life beyond life i take
life's ending slay in different designs
and your godforsaken ending to life
in the street
to my delight
wrong
my ears cant hear what you say to me
who might stop me
i vacuum the wind for my sail
at battle with a mass astrengent the bond
system destroyed exposed and unployed the fruit
tony arata
sums up the richest and poorest of us
these handfuls of dust
i dont fall in love as a rule
i let my guard down
if i call
that i'm a little bit in love with you
do you really want to know
goin through what's left of what used to be
a little on the lonely side
forgetting you is not that hard to do
forgetting you is not that hard to do
got the house on the market
after all
tell me it's not what it seems
they say it's a common thing
after all
the last thing i need's a shoulder
this broken heart is bound
but there's something
the world on a platter
to make a breakthrough
all i need is not to need you
oooh love has gone wrong
baby's gone blues
baby's gone blues
two timing double dealing
gonna get a bad break oh yeah
are you headed for a heartache oh yeah
mean mistreating loving heart
blue is not a word at all
as long as i'm with you
blue is not a word at all
picture this and paint it blue
we'd be lying side by side
a photograph of me and you
why must i always
on the lost and lonely ones
well i can be found
i hang around
well there's a honky tonk
blue side of town
you can find me hanging out where the music's turned loud
i cant get enough
we only get one time around
i hunger for your love it never gives me any slack
chains chains shackles and chains
chains chains shackles and chains
it just aint right
it just aint right
so thoughtlessly
stand there like a rock in a wall
some are 'bout as subtle as thunder
everybody's equal in the eyes of love
no you're not above it
i couldnt see one day that wasnt more of the same
and i dont want to feel like that
'cause i dont want to feel like that
you know it's true
let's tell the world to leave us alone
i just wanna be loved by you
i just wanna be loved by you
sometimes i miss who i was with you
in spite of all our chemistry
gary burr
i just cant concentrate
everytime i think i might
i forget what i should do
i just cant concentrate
there's alot of games in this old town
but alot of times no
say baby take a chance on me
austind gill
if it's the last thing i do
and i know i'll spend my future
to cry in the dark
a tear may appear when i hold you near
heaven for me has come true
i dont really want somebody else
the best years of our lives
let me go
you had better think again
you had better think again
you had better think again
your here with me in my dreams
and let's start life anew
that might have been
hinsontribble
that's enough to make me scream
when you dont know where to turn
about a quarter to nine
a little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
i aint the woman in red i aint the girl next door
and every old memory
oh i've got to stop loving you
and stop loving you
oh i've got to stop loving you
got a jealous bone
every last part of me is callin your name
got a jealous bone
got a jealous bone
i wanna drink my fill of you babe
i cant hate you anymore babe
i cant think of one good reason
tell me how'd you sleep last night
when you've been too long in the dark
with a new love
we've just been lonely too long
never mind these tears i cry
and i will not surrender
and the shadows that have dogged me since i cant remember when
lonely days lonely nights
the tears from fallin
are just the wind
missing you with all my might
where did we lose the flame
why they should want t stay
maybe we've been missin something
find a way to get away
try to catch the wind and saddle it
baby just live a little
take the chain and rattle it
that's the kind of mood i'm in
this is a sad song more than three minutes long
i think this jig is up i think i've had enough
baby this is a hook last line and sinker
craig wisemanal anderson
he's the last thing
and this empty bed's as big as arkansas
he's the last thing
'cause when i get to where i'm goin i'm gonna buy me all new clothes
she can buy a few new things to wear and still go out at night
dont let go of her hand
so let the walls come tumblin down
helps me ride this pain they were a blessin
that life has finally quenched my thirst
yeah let the devil do his worst
so hard to forget
and it's everything i fear
thats the trouble trouble with the truth
thats the trouble trouble with the truth
your love's sweepin me off of my feet
timber i'm falling in love
down the path to yesterday
oh i cant tear myself away
but leave leave it behind you
flowing forever away from the sound of your heart
but i know that i could learn to if we both had faith enough
and it gets melancholy every now and again
god moved in that moment and the angels all cried
and the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old
you're out there on a limb
he's not there to hold you
after got through
don phrimmergeorge teren
it's temporary pain
compared to those who have no hope
i'll live to love again
i know no one's ever loved me
god will save his fallen angels
when he draws their hearts together
daryl burgesstom britt
i will take the last train out
i'll leave my soul to wander free so free
when you stumble in drunk again
from the hell you raised
i used to be sad
stayin 'round here
found out you're not
wide awake at night
to the hell you raise
by the end of the day it's done
when the lord made my workin mans hands
he must of been thinking 'bout me
he must of been thinking 'bout me
just as good as you can be
i cant imagine ever being so blue
you are everything to me
well i'm not really fallin apart but baby
you can feel bad if it makes you feel better
and picture me cryin reading all your love letters
when you said you love me
you can run everytime we touch
i could feel all the fear in you
but you cant run away from your heart
she left the car in the driveway
you dont even know who i am
and you dont even know who i am
you dont get no more
you dont get no more
either get off or get on down the line
you dont get no more no more no more
get no more
but if comfort awaits you in the warmth of her arms
priceless is true love in a good womans heart
but when i'm gone you dont seem to miss me
i'm runnin fast to get home
withering in sorrow
and no more sleepless nights
saved me from dyin inside
when all is said and done
well she wont but i will
it's really not up to me
you're so cool
cool as ice cream in the summertime
can make a grown woman do
yeah you're so cool
it's so high school
i've ever done
you are so much more than i deserve
looking in the eyes of love
now that i found you
and give her a call
there's no hope at all
on each end of the line
wilsonhenderson
there's not a star in sight
broken like mine
mr man in the moon
knowing that someday this pain will end
loving you too much that was my sin
and as sure as your love changes with the wind
and sometimes rain clouds cover up the sky
i'll be there for you
rushing through the cold night air
and forty one goes on and on
bob dipierogary nicholson
i keep fighting to let you go
from the break of dawn till the midnight hour
a nickle into a dime
just doin the best i can
if i dont get your lovin soon
if i were a rich girl
i cant get no satisfaction
all my life i tried to find
like you
and just once in a lifetime
nobody else will do
like my stormy love for you
but it's out of my hands
tomorrow morning i'll be one day older
i hear you say you're leavin
going on overtime
love just crossed the 50 yard line
stay with me a while
oh baby take leaving off your mind
to face another day again
it shatters just like glass
and we're standing in the light
she drew a broken heart
it aint no cupid's arrow it aint no valentine
wally wilsondanny orton
only for him
and the snow is awfully deep for december
so he took a las vegas jaunt
waitin on his ship to come in
her dress was a little thin
two hearts cant be beat
watchin their ship to come in
lord knows i made cryin an art
how i prayed for blind faith to lead me
we give a slow healing heart
than a slow healing heart
baby baby you're my world
every night and every day
you hung the moon and the stars above
used to thrill me when you hold me tight
like it was some blue moons ago
not some blue moons ago
some blue moons ago
though they've scattered through the years
someday i will lead the parade
hear the sounds of my tears
that lonely sound
from now on
and left me alone
i could've left this road i'm on
to cry and never let it show
this wounded pride
i couldnt do this alone
i need a long legged hunk of honey to cool my head
if your memory comes a callin i wont be home
feelin good about feelin bad
yes i did
oh how i did
and if we had a chance
more than anything
what is this crazy road
the rain is fallin to the ground
i cant make these heartaches go away
where do you go when you find yourself
the scars aint gonna mend in a hurry
it was writing checks that my body couldnt cash
set it all down in a tear stained letter
whoaoh oh lordlord
i leave you with feelings of love
feelings of love
now i leave it with you
and if i'm in your way
but a woman can hurt
that we cant take the time
i could fly away
and to believe one day
there was a time
and nothing has gone wrong
spending your nights on the town
but i wont
well god does
god does but i dont
there's no place so lonely
misery kept me company
as being half over you
sinkin to his level
almost hittin bottom
yes i'm only going halfway down
at the bottom of your glass
and you know that you're just one step
a long time ago
and i aint comin down
heaven must've sent your love my way
my feet aint touching the ground
no i aint comin down
that's the only kind of love i've ever had
ooh i need somethin to hold on to
how about you
how about that i think you know
i watched my best friend jamie slippin further away
i held a picture of our wedding day
she opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
deborah allenrofe vonhoy
when you're in my arms
and your holding me tight
was only moving me on
you must go
with the dawn
i will try to be strong
i already miss you
if you dont count my wreckless youth
and i came straight to you
thought i walked a twisted trail
well i've tried and i've tried
well i've tried and i've tried
well i've tried and i've tried
kostasfolkvord

he phoned the fallen daughter in the sauna playing contract bridge
we traipse around the table talking sentences
dream about the witch trials
heaven is a truck
i know arks cant fly
i was dressed for success
an empty dock you cast away
but they're not as bad as this
last time last time
got you up my sleeve
hit the plane down
there's no survivors
i've got you up my sleeve
i've got to melt it x 10
look below her nylon stockings
but if you're willing to call my machine
and if the sight is just a whore sign
make you try 3x
i've been down and i could wait to hear the words
that little look in your eye
but you know i needed more than that
make my body shed around your
make my body shed around your
and what she was was a faded bombshell
brought my wheelbarrow
respect fun you might learn how it runs
and you walk all over me
one step on your own
one head in the clouds
i'm alone i never wanna be alone
she'll come back to me she'll come back to me
dont want to follow
'cause heroes come and heroes go
life has just begun
she wears a coat of color
stripped me
stripped me
i think i'll go there on my own
stripped me
cause now you are mine you are mine
by all those chains that bind that bind
bound and tied bound and tied
i know i have something free
through my head
through my head
at times life is wicked and i just cant see the light
believe you can fly
because inside i know that many feel this way
are we hiding in the shadows
against the faceless man
he looked me right in the eyes
i know i might not make it home
so wont you come inside and never go away
but our missions set in stone
i'm just a freedom fighter
cant you hear us coming
my life my love my soul
for the sould is so exposed
when dreaming i'm guided to another world
can you take me higher
to let love replace all our hate
come on lets go there
to a place with golden streets
is anybody there
so i can stay the same
things are going to get better
just an illusion
i'll go running into outer space
oh lines form on my face and hands
we're slaves to be free
in america
tell me which way to go
in america in america in america in america
what is right or wrong
i'm still here
when you're not looking up
there's a peace inside us all
let it be let it be let it be
for us my friend
and i ask so
they're gone
then rain took its course
so look to the sky
no more sorrow now its gone now it's gone
could have compared to the eye of the sun
but rose once again
and as the moon hides the sun
so is this the end for us my friend
every day you give me life
the walls are cold and pale
here there is no penance
see a vision of a cross
no time for mourning
i cry out to god
which only fuels their selfish pride
a sun that shines on only some
a perfect love that you gave to me
it feels so good to realize
when you are with me i'm free
i just want to say hello again
so let the children play
of youth's timeless maze
i wont let go of that youthful soul
inside your heart always
and with it let me say
i cried out heaven save me
so please come stay with me
the payment silenced the masses
why hold down one to raise another
i feel violent i feel alone
so i sat down for awhile
losing my faith
sell my pity for a dime
riders on the storm
let your children play
girl you gotta love your man
riders on the storm
let it roll baby roll
save our city
the dust has finally settled on the field of human clay
the stillness is so lifeless with no spirit in your soul
say i say i
say i yeah
come with me now
see the signs now
i see you
broken father broken brother
i will cherish every one of them
i hope i can give love unselfishly
but time keeps pushing so much
then i could still hide down behind the wall
your eyes stare at me in the dark
said eyes those eyes
yes i'm the one who
yes i'm the one who
the only one who
i kept up with the message inside
think i'm unforgiven to this world
to tell a story
my anger's violent
one early morning
and just imagined everything's alright
well if you just close your eyes
for we have crossed many oceans
and just imagine everything's alright
simple living is my desperate cry
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
take all this pride
what if you did what if you lied what if i avenge what if eye for an eye
because the answer lies in you
dont say a last prayer
see the signs
so what is the truth now
to rest our head on
well i just heard the news today
well i dont know if i'm ready
i'll show you love
i hope he understands
now everything has changed
what makes you unclean
from the thought that we might die
what if i died
somebody told me the wrong way
over his shoulder there was freedom
trading places in the circle
so young but overblown
been so tired throw away my surrounding
hope mine eye made of the soul choir
lean upon me
i remember callin love
scat lesson
should i take from the night
i'm coming slow but speeding
reeling in you now
i'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head
let the tears splash all over you
none of them along the line
and all along the watchtower
the thief he take
still make lemonade taste like a sunny day
you bring me hope i'll see you soon
hope i dont get left behind
i hope you
your hands to your chest
i swear
it's all alright again
makes no sense
he wakes up in the morning
he forgets them
no time to exchange
cut cut cut cut
bartender please fill my glass for me
bartender you see this wine that's drinking me
i'm on bended knee bartender please
and so can pull on through
and if you hold on tight
whatever tears at her
how it dreams to be a bird swoop and diving through the breeze
but oh god
but look at him now lost tired living in the street
rain in my dreams
take this my arms
the river taste me
without a care she floats above me she got me down here looking up
she's the one for me
curious hands and fingertips
oh our love how you do me
one healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy
he met another mary for a reasonable fee less than
the blood of our children all around
taken into custody by the authorities
the blood of our children all around
you've got your ball
oh and you come crash into me
in a boy's dream
hike up your skirt a little more
wear it so well
oh no no no
'cause i am the captain of this ship
the same respect for them that turn and change
i'm going back again
by someone else's lie
you give
got central heating and i'm alright
treading trodden trails for a long long time
little feet little hands little feet little baby
so much to say
come on now
roll on and run the red lights
our love is so right
everybody's tranced dancing tonight
i swear it would last forever
in a distant passing stage
with a fool holding hands
and in plays to write the wire in
and turned to the gate
you hung me out to dry
stirring my coffee
and maybe you're a little crazy
this drop of hope
the last stop reprise
wouldnt you like to retire with a million
rising up around me steal my soul away
wouldnt you like to retire with a million bucks
but all out in this world
yeah
reached up and i caught it at your chin
and it began to rain
now a night so fine
hey love
just the other day
little taste of the good life
you and me you and me
what a day
and i would do most anything girl
know troubles they may come and go
you set me free
ah
you look the same
do you remember lose everything
funny the feeling when forever ends
steal me away
that's you here standin well i am afraid i might get in your way
he feels the falling dark
you'll always be my baby
as crooked as danger
but wont you speak
now she's falling hard
how he had promised her
the last stop
this is the last stop
raining tears
the symphony of death
but why your lie
so it's not so black and white
and i hope that we can break it back
in a distant passing stage
with a one eyed jack of spades
i'll come back again
is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
with warring hearts
in a church in the middle of a crowded room
splash in your heart
what's wrong and right
why do i feel as if i'm in too deep
as heavy as stone and as blue as i go
i will run and i'll be ok
i was just wondering if you'd come along
tell me you will
so i can get in
i want too much
over my borders
your homes you know
tripping billies
for tomorrow we die
to get out of this place
so why would you care
you laid down and gave to me just what i'm seeking
to be sure these days continue
to be sure these days continue
say love watch me celebrate
nine planets around the sun repeat
why are you different
everybody's happy
we cant do a thing about it
dont throw away your playful beginnings
this question i found in a gap in the sidewalk
and soon i'll fade away i'll fade away
you can read in whatever you're needing to
the walls and halls have disappeared
how i love to stay here
and fear wells in me
of how the things we know should be
and pass through a night so black i cant see you oh
but the reign in the house so no one sees me
oh rainreign in the love of my mother my brothers
and the brotherly love and go away
upon this way
'cause of original sin
if you a monkey on a string
look in the mirror my friend
if you a doggie on a chain
just as i have
we're all drifting away
i dont hear you
what you are
just as i am
when the world ends
float there and watch it all
through the criss cross of the mountains
i'm going to take you by my side
oh when the world ends
ours just begun
i'm going to love you
i am no superman
i am no superman
let's go
cause you
cause you might die trying
the things you never did
breathing just to breathe
funny when you're small
the world has come to play
sometimes that is the problem
then again i will falter
call again
and crawl back to say
feeling colder
and when we call
too long

you know you got what it is i want anyway i'm gonna take it from you
you know
a hungry boy
'til we die
oh much faster pass the years by
tv preacher tell of heaven
dangerous hours
and i'll walk into the big line
hold me up
cry as i may
oh great light of love
it's hiding to cure you
you and i oh oh
i wanna be your hunger
and make a bomb of love and blow it up
to change the ugly ways of the world
you better lock me up i'll do it again
to change the ugly ways of the world
you got love
does it matter where you get it from
it was me right or wrong
yeah
as if i'm stuck in the ground somehow like a tree
then tell me what in the world would i sing for
if i were giant sized on top of it all
and here mother comforts child
if i were a king
i'll go on forever only knowing
and i know your the heaviest weight
i remember thinking
around my head
a remedy is what i'm seeking
i'll get back to you
day is gone i'm on my back
til i get to the end of this tunnel called jimi
oh sweetest smile in a confident come along
how they design and then we go again
whoa how is too late now
i let you down
dont walk away
i'm a puppy for your love
i let you down
when i'm walking by the water
when i'm walking by the water
i cant believe that we would
dreaming of things that we
i cant get your face from my mind
with luck i'll see you again
the wait is too long
dont you think
down by the bayou
brother cant watch him beat that girl down again

same old story again you ah
troubles do it again
tryin to play with the 'caine
slip into my lover's hands
lover lay down

leading me all around
sister chained and bound beaten and bleeding
he is holding up to you
mother father please explain to me
how it could be so this world has come to be
oh mother father please explain to me
we'd trade our world for a piece of bread
com on
we're taking on water
how we've come to this oh
and death comes to the fool
the music binds them all
of the open west you waitin
so lights out away
snap up the gate shut on yourself
with the keys on the inside
just step out into the light
nine planets round the sun
and the river dry
in her breath i'm swimming
but i dont feel safe
now our finest hour arrives
see the pig dressed in his finest fine
put your troubles down
has she really lost her mind
since she went away
how are you
it's alive right now
dont burn the day away
just love will open our eyes
but while you're dancing on the ground
dont burn the day away
but no reason to abandon it
wash out this tired notion
but that's ok
i am a humble monkey
then comes the day
all so good i'll eat you
'bout the two of us
shake your tambourine
right in through your window
the smell of something cooking
you alone have all of me
is like i'm drunk
and it'd take ten lifetimes boy to undo what i've done
well i found the truth friend let me whisper in your ear
you never know it all the ground beneath is nothing more than my point of view
the man stood and watched as he was leaving
some people do some people dont
and they go away go away go away
she and me go to places quiet
always looking forward to much more
reconcile our differences
my precious baby
to drink his wine
no where i swear
with the wine you gave jesus
of the kind you gave jesus
and i do not know
until i'm six feet underground
i've got no place to go
leave me here
needle to the vein
in my grave
make my great escape
and the world your balloon
tell me more tell me more
i laugh about the weathermans satellite eyes
look up look down all around hey satellite
and in your eyes i see
stay here with me love tonight
we kiss and sweat
but tomorrow go back to your man
and hear me call soft spoken whispering love
loverslovelovers
just to please you or appease you
the treasons we are seeking
take a look at me what you see in me
and our cup is overflowing
oh how i wish i could take it all down
dont be tricked into thinking so
fall back again fall back again fall back again
i beg the night just to see her
with your back to me now
wish i could bend my love to hate her
sitting smoking feeling high
and drink some wine 'till we get drunk
each moment the more i love you
you crush me
my love my love
but please please just let me always
i suck up into your mind
i come into your psyche
i'm going away
i'm talking to
mother father please explain to me
pulls the trigger on his brother's heart
mother father please explain to me
mother father do you know
how this world has come to be
we're taken the water
oh to keep afloat
it's just a game i play
your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand
your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand
through my head
while we wait head in hands
a mirror in which
but gold between divide us
into a cold dark space
human as to human
oh so be it
could i have been
anyone other than me
could i have been anyone other than me then i
dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
oh so i'm praying all at night
oh but the girl the girl is gone
surely you'd be speaking speaking no change
oh you may find you're faithful
digging a ditch where madness gives a bit
cause i'm
cause i'm
throw it in the water again
just room for me

yes i will call this home
upon these poor souls
that i dont need anyone but me
dreamed i killed god and woke up

and i'd dig my way home
dreamgirl yeah

and i mind

about the colors 'round your eyes
i say i'll come again
she broke my heart my grace is gone
you think of things impossible and the sun refuse to shine
one more drink and i'll be gone
baby your heart into a thousand pieces dashed
baby the two of us can bring it to the light
baby your heart into a thousand pieces
but i cant get out of this place
but they fall on deaf ears
says take what you can from your dreams
she feels like kicking out all the windows
were up against the wall
desperately i tried my best
alter or defuse
stood by and watched
i've walked the cage
escaped to nowhere
rockets in the sky
i never shoulda listened to you
let you do me like you do
and in the mornin when the corners are jaded
and it's hot like infra red
your hands are tied but your mind can run
we are the children of the damned
that after all these years i have the same old dream
do it right or cut it out
you're just a passenger and life is but the course
bad case of love
down to the canyon 'cause you cant get enough
your situations on the top of my head
it will never come again
for i cant falling in love with you
this sound of freedom called rock and roll
but you know you cant let go
wish i'd been born on a georgia farm
some may come and some may go
castaways children of the damned
dont you worry 'bout hurting me
i bleed so easily
we all come and go
for those who push hardest soon run out of breath
no matter how i try to get you outa my head
i'll be waiting on the platform to get you in my arms again
the rains about to fall
you used to carry the flag
you used to hold me up
you used to stare the night
thunderbolts and nightsticks
d before i die
in new york city
i thought i could avoid you but i was wrong
i've stood in open windows and watched the sky
i've tried to walk the narrows but it's no use
black man comin down the avenue
down to the wires hooked up to your head
said i cant do nothing about it
when i was 20 looking for a job
who's sold out and who is for sale
i had this kind of thing happen once before
i woulda been better off if only i could
i thought of you did you think of me
just to get along with you
when your ol man aint around
round and round
it seems i'm always out of turn
but i know i need it more
and i go to my room lock the door
and plan my escape
and run away from myself
the armies of doubt were playing war in my head
old habits die hard like a fatal disease
did you ever wonder why you'r stranger than close
with everybody yelling hey what about meme
i've touched it all and watched it as it fell away
i'm on my own
she's got a doll she sticks the pins
waiting for the rain to clear wonder if you know i'm here
i close my eyes for you
out in the blue
oh captain steer me clear
the strange society
then turning back and closing every door
get to where it's going on
gettin it cut getting it straight
innocence yeah we got no choices
we both know we're going down to the wire
i couldnt make the window i couldnt go back
take me like i am or throw me away
a twelve gauge shotgun at my back
i'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
and we closed our eyes to all the things that might
it's just the way i am
i've got a woman who still makes me crazy
they've got your number television eyes
the skyline was falling like the armies before
i gotta get away before i walk
as you let go of me
you were up against the wall
sooner or later i swear
i wanna rescue you
all the good and all the bad
thank god the search for me was the search for you
it's only revenge and the worst of it all
the hounds pursue the weary step
i've been dragged through the mud
seen the walking side of death
the way you've fallen too
no one sees the man with no eyes appear
that public cry that never knowing
that grand illusion that radar scan
it's a code red
murder in the sky
dream your dreams before you disappear
for some pass the buck justice
it's the last of the old ways
backstage spray paint security in rollerskates
time moves on so fast
it left no evidence
watch the falling star
you say your one of us
poisoned by the edge of social arrows
how much does it matter
we all pass through this wilderness
i coulda been famous
coulda made the right contacts
i coulda jumped on the wagon
crashdown crashdown
a place you go to find your soul
your entering the streets of despair
i take it to the limit before the glory fades
someone tripped the power the lights are going dim
they say we're playing vera if we dont get in a wreck
looking for another way but you cant help passing by
i couldnt play the lie it's just the way it's been
we seem to capture the pain before we face the wall
my tears have come and gone oh lord i got to run
and accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
come mothers and fathers throughout the land
i watch as chances pass
from a sea of wasted rhyme
they can see you but you cant see them
and i asked myself what the hell went wrong
watching as you go by
and i cant help the way i feel
i can see it in the light
cuttin like a knife through the night
asked where are you going
talks to the buzy tone
clutches the crutches of hate
rattle and shake their political cans
like a lost generation on lsd
there's a new kid on the block
it's easy to see what is not
deep in my heart right from the start
people want to know how come we stay the same
and when i tried to tell you
another heartbeat is slowing
i might regret the steps i'm taking
this time i have to go
d o a
i's tried to fit in where i didnt belong
i thought someday i might return
dont look back
you're so easy now you lost the game
i'd been pickin up the pieces from another hard fall
and why cant i no longer believe
woke up in the morning head twisted tight
i lost my job my life's a mess
love wont die no matter how hard i try
the red sky's moaning and the wind is blowing hard
you're running for your life while the scandals
i seen 'em all inside my dreams
can you see the ship sacrifice
they cant hear you anymore
i'm checking out
came at my head
so bring me my whiskey
it's the kind of hell you'll never know
tried whiskey to ease your hex
you wont give me the time
going down to shoot my old lady
i took out my gun
get a rope around me no one gonna
god damn i hate the blues
leaving me to take the blame
some people put' em in their arm
god damn i hate the blues
i tried to get you off my mind
but you played on me
i wont be the one who fades
where the lost souls are being set free
so dont speak ill of the dead
drifting out of paradise
disgusted by the point of view
touch me when you cry
looking through colored blinds
you've never faced the day when judgement comes to town
i've been noticing some changes
i was looking for relation
but i aint worried you know it girl
gettin beaten broken bones
gettin old gettin gray
chorus
that's gonna take a different man
it was easy to break through
in a world demanding of me
jane will you ever come back
strike in silence witnesses denied
i'm not ready to be so so
gone and gone and gone
burning the flags of freedom
so if we should survive
they'll only cut up you sky
we aint the first to be braced
i want you baby cant you see
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer
on a psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high
high still flying no gravity

this fall from grace
strung out as the night comes crawlin

that's me with the holy ghost
as you catch your death

when saturday comes

while others told of a final retribution
in fear of the thought of the end
a blinding light the sun had died
when the walls came tumbling down
nobody made a sound
every word you whisper
you're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light
already on your knees
you've got rivers of bitter tears
you're going off the rails
the white lightning on a dead end street
run you dance with danger
white lightning
who do you love is it him or is it me
dont wanna try love dont wanna buy love
make up your mind are you his are you mine
a restless spirit with a need for a mate
and in the garden lust began
women
what's that spell
callin every girl

all of this doubt
repeat chorus
when you dont know where you belong
i'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control
running going nowhere

only the good die young
to always to be blind and never to see
time is the essence the priests do say
but we have the power of finding
and with this message that i bring to you
there's nothing left inside as i walk this broken land
and does the fear make you run
living on a paper sun
blind to all the damage done
feed the demon kiss the flame feel your desire

i never said or got to say bye to my boy but
with the common love of music
i'm bound to the freestyle
walk in to this world with your head up high x4
worship play worship play
worship play play
it's the same sound it's the same same sound
youre the reason that my mother lost a bunch of bills
who take the fear from all of us
nor they have no shame
they do no good
stop
can you explain to me now your still able why
mistake
hey
far away
in free verse
remember the time i kicked the tv over
i know this pain
cause she'll throw rocks at me
i cant talk to her
we carefully mold like water lovers
in my room we're can dance on my walls
the same kind of thread
i cant diffuse
wasteof time
what takes it away
i cant
waste my time
it's rapture
but then again i havent the guts
but then i take such good care of it
feel blue
when you care for me
is still important for us though we realise
it's a question of lust
rather be home
it's just a question of time
and you'll believe what they say
and have their fun
sometimes i dont blame them
it's just a question of time
i need you like a drug to keep my fill
closer all the time closer all the time
to think that things couldnt turn out worse
the mountains and the sand
and seem so sure
set upon weary feet
i'm not the one
when everything that i've done
i've been staring down the barrel of a gun
oh little girl
i prefer
black celebration
seem like paradise
that we've seen the back
take me in your arms
black day
thank the lord
any blasphemous rumours
ended up
put it on
something so trivial
put it on
cant you understand
take me for a ride
i'm not very sure
they talk and they talk
i heard it on tuesday
put your little hand in mine
i dont know at all
who heard it from john
nothing of this
i taste when we kiss
i'm breathing in fumes
tonight
tonight
my pleasure at being
reminding me
now that i'm clean
i dont claim to know
i dont advise
and sliding out
comatose almost
i'm alive
comatose
this is real fun
to leave me unimpressed
and now you offer me eternal darkness
i find myself
inside your heaven
i belong inside
it's only when i lose myself in someone else
and we're different creeds
now you're punching
someone who cares
take second best
and you're all alone
a white house a white room
bright light
a second boss looking into
taking from the greedy
taking from the greedy
everybody's failing to understand
you'll find the reason when you discover
it's just time to pay the price
for delivering the proof
hide what you have to hide
but you dont know me babe
and everything you're thinking babe inside your head
are only part of what i started baby
one look and you'll always regret
now infecting reason man
flagstaff arizona dont forget winona
and talk to me
when i rush
heard my truth turn to lies
gave more for you
sacred
and a warm receiver
and a warm receiver
to write it down
going to send my message through to you
i'm a satellite of hate
his watchful eye
sea of sin know where you've been and i dont care
i remember the days when we walked through the woods
and if i'm reluctant you can pull me in
for a new lease of life
set me free
dont think i'm impatient
cant you see it's misery
you know how hard it is for me
and i've said before that i know you have too
in situations like these
soap wont wash away your shame
surgery wont improve your pain
something like a nagging itch
open your eyes
my angel coming
follow our stars under a painted sky
you can shine for me
can change the course of history
such a nice boy obeys all the rules
wishing for a moment so that they could see
i was screaming louder as the
minutes of a game we won so long ago
sister of night
breaking down your will
i'm trembling
sister of night
hey sister
share my innermost thoughts
though my views may be wrong
with every thought and with every breath
i want somebody
tell me
it's surprising this town
i'd put your pretty dress on
when you look around
so much pleasure that it feels like pain
no no no
pure possession of my heart and soul
no excuses to give
as the darkness closes in
i feel loved
and lead me through babylon
you take me to
i feel you
this is the morning of our love
and i know i like you
you're liking it too
whoa i like it
new night feel alright
i want you now
my body is burning
that's not what i'm trying to do
when everyone's gone
reading on the wall
she stood beside me once again
you can come with me if you want to
if you want to be with me
but dont forget
or moves at your will
will you lead me to your armchair
in your room
living on your breath
embracing me
wisdom of ages
the fire still burns
that doesnt matter
though it feels good now
you are dreaming
even when you're far away
if we should meet again
there's something beating here inside my body
from the moment i started
i'll lend it to you will you treat it tenderly
i will speak from my heart
there's something beating here inside my body
dont say you want me
till you see the signs
dont say you're happy
take him up to the highest high
he's stealing a god from the israelite
john the revelator
john the revelator
by and by
man will survive
cheating judases
if you want my love
we walk together we're walking down the street
you're like an angel and you give me your love
if i only knew the answer
leave in silence
come on and lay with me
i should say naive
truth is a word
little 15
she could escape there
and it's little intrigues
why pretend
all of these insurmountable tasks
in itself
all of the doubts
it's a lot like life
then this is the one
you know what i need
i would do it all again
be led hopelessly astray again
it didnt take long before
but it fell back down
this isnt a party
and in an instant the laughter's gone
my joy
my secret gardens not so secret anymore
cant stay long here comes the reason why
i loved it i loved her
i'm taking a ride
never want to put my feet back down
everything's alright tonight
but you can change the facts
princess di is wearing a new dress
i stand still stepping on the shady streets
features fuse and your shadow's red
i saw you in the picture
baby dont you let go
this aint nodisco
but when you think i've had enough
will you give it to me
because i like to practise what i preach
i wont say it again
i give in
come back to the land
i taste when we kiss
make decisions
let me hear you crying
i'm a man of flesh and bone
easily and elegantly
i'm a man of flesh and bone
couldnt finely hone
and it brings out the thug in me
reaches so deeply
nothing can stop me
i'm just a television set
i'm just a television set
changing for modern times
that is out of our hands
i walk blindly on
i feel love's wheels turning
who take the easiest girls
we're twilight's parasites
when delirious fun
we are the dead of night
just take good care of the world
oh the tears that you weep
and the love that they swore
love will be the death of
they're crooked love thieves
i've read more than a hundred books
know it's a feeling and it comes from above
if they could spare a few minutes of their time
i've never been in love before
a debt you pay with tears and pain
it costs you more when you're to blame
or we'll have to estrange them
and the rainfall
cleanliness only comes in small doses
how i suffer the sweetest condition
they know me better than that
how can a view become so twisted
about the things you said
i need to be cleansed
although i may flirt
and do those feet in modern times
told you so
if things arent suited
you dance your dance you dance your chance
you dance with pride and you dance with pride
exploding in my heart
i played an american
no sex no consequence no sympathy
no radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
all your cutting down to size
here i stand the accused
you should see how it feels
is tranquillity
and when i squinted
keeps us from the stark reality
the countless feasts laid at my feet
if you try walking in my shoes
and before we talk of any repentance
but before you come to any conclusions
if you try walking in my shoes
you're so pretty
we can go
keeps the heart imprisoned
of a girl
the mind will follow
oh i need your touch
but a broken back
it never will
if you want anything at all
her first boy
she doesnt trust him
let me take you on a trip
now let my body do the moving
all the heavens in the motion
and truth on my side
you substitute blindness
fix of injustice
where i'm bound
for bringing me here
to a desperate beat
god send the only true friend
that i belong here
nothing
nothing
you hear stories of old
not me
for saying this
now i've got things to do
let's surrender
arent meant to confuse
dangerous
you know by now
i'm coming home
i know that it was wrong
death becomes me
pain is ready pain is waiting
can you feel a little love
you party for a living
fused tomorrow
i talked of war
i'm begging for more again
she's a picture of the world
i lay here helplessly
cant you understand
words are trivial
in korea being insincere
tells the story of it all
to be flexible when the boat comes in
to be flexible when the boat comes in
waiting to die
death is everywhere
now
now
and fools dont run away
so call me now and tell me that you're home
i can see the pain that you're frightened of
just free love
to bring you free love
you've got to take this moment
let's make it clear
i can feel your desperation
let yourself go
i can taste the tears falling
playing your part
friends if you've lost your way
already told you once once or twice
when you're born a lover
when you're born a lover
when you're born a lover
the discomfort in your seat
when the walls come tumbling in
it will be worth it
happiest girl i ever knew
happiest girl i ever knew
under this roof
let's stay home
body and soul come together
inside this house
under this roof
i surrender all control
moved moved by a higher love
then he sat down looked around
can light up a room with a heart so true
to live my way
some were born to listen some were born to play
he'd ruled the town for thirty years
billy stepped up on the stage and conley whispered go son go
and wanna get out of this someday town
and one of these days you just might change their minds
the loneliness down in his heart
when you find the love you've always wanted
collected stamps since he was 10 years old
you ought to see him metamorphosize
chorus
calling out around the world
can i hear an amen
every heartbroken boy every lonely girl
but you're pushin different buttons
it's not too late to turn around
i'd rather be alone than be in love just half the way
completely
repeat chorus
there's peace in the wine
knows that he tries
there's not much that's sweeter
i took my baby out and bought her a ring
we made love in the broad daylight
now faithless love makes that willow cry
chorus
there's no path too winding no river too wide
some people need their space
for the love of a woman
chorus
your mem'ry came to stay
i know it's just a matter
yeah i'm lookinaint' everybody lookin
chorus
dont ask me i aint going there i aint touching that
hearts against the wind
they just wont mend
hearts that ever break
hold me now hold me now
here i go i'm fallin again
if i'm gonna fall at all
hold me now hold me now
two lovers stare up at the stars
that nothin matters like this love they're holdin
holdin lovin kissin huggin
that nothing matters like this love
it wont sound like anybody else's version of love
we could go through life together without a worry or a care
i have always heard you cant put love into words
that's how i feel
but this temper train i'm on just ran away too fast
but it's a long long way back to you baby
i miss you darlin
go a little farther anything to please you girl
go a little farther anything to please you girl
go a little farther anything to please you girl
a mother holds her miracle of birth
sharing a moment only lovers can
so if you trust enough to care
dont even leave one little speck of dust
dont even leave one photograph
make sure you've got it all
my new job is going great i'm headed for the top
but i'm livin way too fast
neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
when you meet in the middle
'cause we'd both give a little
'cause we'd both give a little
when you meet in the middle
bob dipierojohn jarrardmark d sanders
tell me who is the loneliest fool of all
the answer staring back at me
i guess i moved too slow and thought too fast
sometimes i hear that voice and see those eyes
a miss like this is a million miles
it seems i've had this problem since
and let the morning in
chorus
never gonna see her with the likes of you
gonna write a song sing about her hair her lips and her eyes
norma jean riley's gonna marry me
has our kind of power
and every day i'm awake
you save up your money buy you some shoes
'cause boy right now you're nowhere bound
where to now do you know
so tell me why she would
i only know how much i miss her
chorus
and my heart still aches
coming on strong
one more time
that's what i'd do with one more day with you
i fell so far that i cant get out
lookin better than she ought to
pick me up so i can fall again
world began to change
blue suede shoes and rock of ages
i still live in this old house where we were raised
the way that love should be
holding each other close
and saturday morning sleeping late
she bought a ticket at the greyhound station
saved her pay checks and bought an old ragtop
she waved good bye and looked back and smiled
something cool set one up for me
seems to me i'm always thirsty
he had a freezer full of bomb pops
truth or dare with the kdis on our road
even though i was out of school
he's just fumin and she's just steamin
she's whisper all her deepest dreams
and they're both walkin their separate ways
they were so in love
and he's so stubborn and she's not budgin
a dream that is real and a heart that beats true
love is a feelin i never knew much about
jack's sittin back in a pitch black box
if you dare to be individual
2nd chorus
your mamma thinks i'm lazy
i love you so and you can bet
we're headed for that silver moon
one way or another i'm gonna cross that line
feeling better every mile i roll
let the hurt take its time
and they fill this empty space
if that's the way it's gotta be
he sees 'em come
he sees 'em go
they must not know what service really means
from the island of his
how my heart stumbled into someone so kissable huggable lovable unbelievable
but every time i talk
sometimes a careless word just rolls right off my tongue
even hearts that are in this deep might think about an easy way out
we've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
then tied the shoelace that read superman
as she talks to the door of her daughter's room
he's as scared as a man can be
the boss man says son you're gonna get fired
cant stop the hunger for your love
all i know is that you're driving me wild
i gave you my all and i gave it again
oh give me a clue what is it with you
randy albrightdebi cochran
to be loved by you
it's more than my heart can fathom
a love this true
if you need to chase the blues
i will be your boxing gloves
showed my fingers to my daddy while he was shavin
some are gonna come and go
they're just a product of time and true love
they're just a product of time and true love
i could not see past yesterday
no i dont expect your memory to let me
didnt dare look up or i'd have drowned
cause you make me feel every single drop of rain
i never thought i'd ever really love reality
you make me feel
chorus
but you have to need me too
i spent the next eight hours wondering where on earth you were
the thought of life without you is something i just cant live with
jon veznerpaul williams
no medicine can fix
now i know god has his reasons
and the good news is i'm better
chauffeur us all the way up
it's like flying down these old back roads
bridge
steven dale jonesamy powers
holding fast home at last
when it reaches the sea
i know how the river feels
now the time is right
you feel it too
i'll show you
i thought i'd seen everything
i thought i'd seen everything baby i thought i knew
i've been around the world seen a lot of girls
something passed between them
it must be more than just a dream come true
there was nothing left to chance
take me to the mountain
i've walked the mean streets
as sure as the sun keeps rising on me
i will start all over againover again
i wont be of any help
darlin you can find right here
i could pretend you dont already know that
this is something that i've never done
she said i'm not pointing fingers
and i need you to hold on to
believe what's held you has freed you
that i need
not a day goes by that i
when lovers cant believe
the way it ought to be
imagine that a love that lasts forever
imagine that for all the world to see
i would have been ready
sailed away just me and you
in a week or two
a long long string of pearls and
i vow my head each night and roll up my sleeves
am i over the line
i'm not the only one with hungry eyes
am i way out of touch
when i step on the gas gas gas
a weekend hanging out with my best friends
i've tasted her kisses sweet as wine
the life but
tony martinvan stephensonreese wilson
dont ever trust what the government say
in a parking lot preaching the truth
it's all interpretation
stronger than daddy's faith
work out your own salvation
you used to brush my mind with tender thoughts
but like the wind i guess it just moved on
skip ewingtim johnson
for you to shuffle around
when your diamonds turn to teardrops
i cant take anymore
i dont want to be just another heart in your hand
like the tears were never cried
it never ends and if i'm right
there are more than angels watching over me
but friday rolls the stone away
daddy says listen to me
oh there's no escape
it's stuff stuff spreading like weeds
parading 'round in caravans
help me off your back i found it's so futile to attack so what else you got you wont tell the truth until you're caught i'll be in your room you'll be comin soon i'll be gone all day grab it that's your way i wish i could pretend but you'll fire one off at me again revenge me now dont it seem like you're a little sweet in your room
alone
now wont you tell me
re tell the story
i buckle when my judge clutches
teeth scrape on the last remaining fossil
bulbs of passion
cant we get it on wrong
your even stand
your love me but i can barely even stand
this is my story still i'm still there
on my way to heaven to heaven
why dont you like me
it seemed immediate you stuck me and you walked away it upsets me either way i do anything if anything wont come too late not the best way to set things straight no discussion could improve this gonna be a pain to lose this even you could not excuse this
hey it's good to be back home again
oh the time that i can lay this tired old body down
yes 'n hey it's good to be back home again
the shell is crumbling fix my frown
i guess the waiting wished i would
but it's not too late brother i'll still say you were mine
forget the swan
seen enough to eye you
how could it work just cant conceive it
could it ever have been that good
it's just up to hope that all in amour
emptiness became my house
blow through my soul
the golden touch my heart becomes whole
set my soul afire
now i touch golden
and when ants so feast upon my flesh
the fable of time no longer blinds
my heart becomes whole
tide it over
i'm ready now
r you i need nothin i can do people tell me that you miss me and i guess i'm doin fine
it's a special place
at that point that point my whole life froze

you and i
dont you want
dont you want my love
dont you want my love

because you are my child and you know me
blessings that will fill your heart

but herself

and when she loves you
there goes the passion we'll talk about
jane's got soul
cause you're breathless ready to burn

and the moon makes you blue
but with the truth in my heart
and i'll be there for you baby
the things that i've said sometimes
you might see someone you dont know
flying away int the clouds
just like the way you've always been
you'll feel it
dont hide in doorways
i am master
cause they'll only bring you down
dont break my heart
dont break my heart
i've been strong and brave
yet she let me down
when the bars where closing down
not to overstep the line

electric eyes that never let you
promises and passion

i got two hands to hold you
helter skelter
two hands to help you
one night looking pretty
are you poor are you sure are you holy are you pure
changing hands
one silver dollar
changing hearts
reaching out became a spider's touch
on another victim of
and come the dawn
and pain you can do without
but they will be there by the break of day
me lo paga pap
me lo paga pap
for the first time just dont think about it
give me a choice between power and pain
all my life i struggled to be free
and you soothe me there
i'm in heaven
and you kiss me there
reflecting on my leather coat
but i suddenly realised
do you still remember my name
and i'm walking in the rain x 2
es la prensa manipulacin
obedientes a lo que dicta algn poder
en un mundo de ignorantes
son corps sa voix qui t'ensorcellent
elle se dhanche s'avance se penche
when there's lightning it always bring me down
when you've tried do they hide deep inside
who's lost and never found
he spends his nights doing what
they know he is able
meet up with this stranger
she was meant to be wild
alone again
just like somebody slammed the door
and a year becomes a day
staring through the glass
somewhere bleeding in the night
i opens the door
before it turns to black attack
there's a sky full of stars
dont i pray hard enough
and make him wanna cry
for places i've been
now you know the reason why
oh shame on the night
no confusion
hey someone
shoot shoot
shoot shoot
so long ago
they belong to the past
the things we had together
maybe too long ago
i mistook hell for heaven
say i'm no fun
and i got to tell you right now
i sure feel strange but i sure feel good
i got a feeling i feel so strange
i never felt like this before
yeah he walks like love
they never let you fly
you only seem to crawl
so never hide again
this word's on fire the crooks and the liars
they're so afraid to lead a lonely life
and we dont know what all the suffering is for
he's still a man
he may have lost his faith
he may have lost his dreams
a nothing or a zero
living in a world of make believe
oh here it comes again
here it comes again
i i good for nothing
we do things our way here
on strange highways
and now i know i will
oh we've got no answers
whe the winds of fame have let you down
when it's over
will it take you long too long for me
will you find your journey's homeward bound
sunny days are over
sunset superman
trying to hide his burning heart
the night tells a thousand lies
sunset superman
hot nights summer in the city
they want to see it everywhere
and you've got control
the cold without the warm
the throw before the toss
we're the last in line
repeat chorus
no dimes in your pocket
dont tell me it's because
just a no good guy
when i take my leave
i dont know why
tease me from inside
that can buy you peace of mind
put a quarter in that thing again
all your troubles little darling
hold me closer
'cause he was twisted you could see it
so twisted
they told me i was guilty
they're twisted
he almost lost his way
till they strapped him to the wheel
and there is an end to summer
you cant walk on water
the cloud that's left behind
if we listen they will say
but only we can see
cause we rock we rock see how we rock
we're the fools
cried out with one heart
to find a way to break our chains somehow
what's a woman when a man
dont go by the rule
faded so fast
in the dark
they're shakin all the earth
it's stronger than a smile
oh rain falls
shakin all the earth
he was ready to rock and roll
why are they watching me
the eyes are what you see
are you ready for rock and roll
nothing's really safe around here
one in the hand
man in the moon
they bend you over
get me where you want me and i'll ask for more
each time we touch i'm purring like a tiger
going down
never get washed away
going down and never higher
what he's leaving you behind
of a lady with no heart
he'll be over the horizon
burning candles in your room
darling now
to perform all the rites
you strut like a lion
well i'll just make believe
you're all dead
crackle crackle
you know she'll excuse you
there's nothing she wouldnt do
and the dangerous games
you wont try to escape
left alone in the cold
if i only knew you better
every night i pray
aint nobody gonna take me away x 2
just to say i love you
momma sold her soul
simply unforgivable destruction of the heart
is it all beginning again tonight
'cause it goes round and round and round
when i heard the voice
and need to have a little sin
so i'm ridin
there's that look in his eye
chorus
then why dont he say it now
here's to you
look what we found
a change you've never saw
raise the dead here's to freedom
waiting to taste your next tomorrow
how do you feel right now
in between real and dream
hollywood black
back in the jungle
hollywood black
'cause hollywood is black
like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
holy diver
the music they make
spirits haunting my dreams
sailors waved goodbye
the tears have gone by
but still you want it all
but you need a little hell
so just hold on
i'm blind yeah
i cant fly why
feel like i'm never coming back
cause dreams are what we are
dreamer
where and how
or take the blow
where and how
he'll come back to me in the end
no vision i only see to hear
if your circle stays unbroken
she was a photograph just ripped in half
and that was when he ran

faces in the window
cause a tear that never dies

to be brothers in arm
so many different suns
on our brothers in arms
calling elvis is anybody home
let me leave my number heartbreak hotel
he's incommunicado no comment to make
maybe he could talk about himself
and now the rumors are flying
but in the communique you know he's gonna come clean
and we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline
she can feel him in the places where the sailors go
she got me walking where the wildlife goes
and i get trouble with my breathing
and i close one eye now
it's just another one just like the other one
i see a darkened room somewhere
fade to black
all day long
yes and the song in my bones
rain come down and give this dirty town
oh here i am baby i'm coming back for more
sky is crying see the streets are full of tears
if you wanna run cool you got to run
the things she'll do to turn me on
on heavy heavy fuel
my love is strong how long
some people have got to paint and draw
while the dealers they get together
warning lights are flashing down at quality control
the watchdog's got rabies the foremans got fleas
on itv and bbc they talk about the curse
come back and see me later next patient please
they're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
the rank and file and the navy blue
oh the iron will and the iron hand
the bigger they are babe
and now they've taken the chains and the gears
yes and it never rains around here
see we could have been major contenders
and all you've got to give him
you never gave a damn about who you pick up
reminded me of you
she had all the brains and the beauty
just the way that her hair fell down around her face
and the lady writer on the tv
les boys got leather straps
to a disco bar in old munchen
and the posters on the wall that say
nobody cares to depend upon the chime it plays
but there's hope later for capricorns
your footsteps are forbidden
you've thrown your love to all the strangers
that aint workin that's the way you do it
see the little faggot with the earring and the makeup
look at that mama she got it stickin in the camera
now that aint workin that's the way you do it
portable hammok baby who needs trees
it plays america the beautiful and tie a yellow ribbon
now dont talk to me about the polar bear
at my parties
you know it may be a game
i'm your wife
yes she's saying listen baby
he sticks to his guns
the sacred and profane
and the fireworks over liberty expode in the heat
some people get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit
even the hero gets a bullet in the chest
her breasts upon the off beat
he's seen enough and he knows
just a corner serenader
and a parakeet is squawking
or your button hole
and when i find the reason i still cant get used to it
says something like you and me babe how about it
both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong
you said i love you like the stars above i'll love you till i die
you're pulling out before you get burned
you think i care about your reaction
when you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin
your six blade knife do anything for you
in her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud
and a rock n roll dream
i swear she let a big truck grease her hip
she dont know what it means
she's going sining shala shalay hey hey
a mother and her baby and the college of war
two in the morning but there is one green light
here i am again in this mean old town
i'm tired of making out on the telephone
so far away from me
i wanna live on solid rock
well a house of cards
when you point your finger cos your plan fell through
southbound again got no money i've got no place to go
it's been raining in the park but meantime
mind he's strictly rhythm he doesnt want to make it cry or sing
they dont give a damn about any trumpet playing band
and he put down his load where he thought it was the best
then came the mines then came the ore
i got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
now you act a little colder like you dont seem to care
well it's a strange old game you learn it slow
sometimes you're the ball
sometimes you're the windshield
everything can change in the blink of an eye
sometimes you're the windshield
i'm tryin to place a tune under a louisiana moonbeam
the planet of new orleans
behind the gates and the granite of the planet of new orleans
the planet of new orleans
i got a ride all the way to paradise
i got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
come on and take a low ride with me girl
she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
yeah we're gonna be so neat
yeah we're gonna be so cool
yeah we're gonna be so neat
down in the tunnels trying to make it pay
here come johnny with the power and the glory
be bop a lula baby what i say
high and dry in the long hot day
some day baby when the river runs free
if we cant get along we oughta be apart
honey when it comes to you
how come i always get a hard time
sayin things that you didnt have to
dont you care about my pride
you know i like you to be free
dont you care about my pride
excuse me for talking i wanna marry you
made me feel nineteen for a while
but she's paid to do that stuff
let me know one way or the other
all the late night bargains have been struck
but all i can do is hand it to you
i dont know how it happened
like a bowery bum when he finally understands
let me be your healing star
you know i'd be happier inside
the sun will come and warm your soul
the sun will come and warm your soul
this perfect world is clear
come along every one gather round hurry up
and how the pain ran deep
still it's all its all
but fighting all the demons will take time
that i'm ever gonna give in tonight
the devils they burn inside of us
i'm always gonna worry about the things that could make us cold
is there no place safe and nothing sacred for the living
now that i am bleeding out
and you think you know what life's about
at needs never ending you wear the crown
take me over make me strong
take me over when i'm gone
i cant hear what you're saying
stuffed his mouth with indecision
talking to charlie browns parents
why he's a lonely man without a vision
now i've come back to destroy
when we collide
when we collide we break in two
and as we push and we shove and we hurt the ones we love
made it like i didnt care
hey dont let the sun go down
must of been mid afternoon
on our way the sun broke free of the clouds
cause i am on my way to see her
'cause i would really like to meet her
and i cant live another life among these streets of you
pushed out over the rail
this feeling inside
and its all drawn out
blasted out silent mind and quiet pain
they just fade away
to the sky keep it in reach
just fade away
just fade away
all the time
but i get the strangest feeling
dont give me up
and i was ready
sentences broken
and it keeps returning to remind me
and how it keeps returning to remind me
you tease me and tell me to stay
cause i've gone upside down
i've gone upside down
hate and she wants to die
she wants
get me back from this haze
you give yourself away you give
forever days
lead me to your door
to get myself in shape
i'll learn how to bend
after all the tears we've spent
i'll learn how to bend
hold me up
hold me up
its a mad life that we know
can i see only beauty all around
after you there is no other
before he blacks out
a star search spokes model starlet
for miss emma peel
why did you take
i am dry i sigh
how you said the sand would burn my feet again
you yourself are free
you yourself are free
when you close your eyes
just wait you might change your mind
check that you're still featured in my mind
tell me if you want me near
and i'll play along
without you i cant believe
and now you're not satisfied
it's too late to change events
and tell what you have to tell
you'll see the saints are all a step below the masters
and so are all the prostitutes and dealers
why the need
are the lost things are the silver spoons
and why the need to eroticize our children
i know that you know
too much is enough for us to burn
i hope you understand
and i was waving as you were passing
and i saw you so we had a fight
when i drink i want you more and more and more
staring at the wall because you know it understands
sift your hands through broken glass
gotta stay awake
lay with me so far away
surrender give to the crown
i've got to
i give you all a boy can give you
the love we shared
dont touch me please
baby baby
so hard to see
where did our love go
touch me
so much harder to believe
meeting strangers
come on down
and you will thank me
with the feeder
to the overflow
gonna slide
the thrill is gone
someday i know i'll be over it all
waiting for the perfect match
waiting how long can you stand
and i'm just standing here while you're down
they always say the truth will find a way
you're saying things i cant explain
dont want to wake up
feel it here the silence
there's so much life here
i could hear you fall
still i hear you cry terrified for the first time first time
aint no way to understand the stupid words of pride
oh yeah
he's been trying to tell me so
you'll have bad times and he'll have good times
stand by your man
stand by your man
not a night goes by
oh but that couldnt hurt anymore than never knowing
four walls a roof a door some windows
in a house that might have been
am i the only one who's ever felt this way
i see a shadow in the mirror

with a tear in our eye
who would have known
will you forgive me when i see you again
oh there you are
so i'm flying down to houston
temptation and a seat

and a hostess takes our order
forgetting her the nature of my flight
on this cold day in july

all night long how i've pleaded and cried
i said i wanna touch the earth
into the wild blue
except for maybe you
i said i wanna touch the earth
closer to you
i've got nothin to lose and nothin to gain
whoa this bird cant sing when you've tied its wings
and everyone is running

children lose their youth too soon
and the peaceful quiet you create for me
all the things i cant erase from my life
consumed with my surroundings

but what the wind would bring to us
it's so hard when it doesnt come fast
if life wasnt how we pictured it
i can live for the moment
it's so hard
live it up when you get the chance
but the words just wouldnt come
'cause when the world doesnt make no sense
if i had closed my mouth and opened my eyes

too young for him they told her
he said when it's getting kinda rough over here
was a piccolo player in the marching band

and i found myself laying flat i wondered
and i'll bring you
why must we be so afraid
when i said goodbye to you
am i better off this way
i've got a husband and a child
what would it be like with you around
you want me to take you back once more
loneliness moves in as you move on
you finally took my hand
and mama dont approve
who's never left home who's never struck out
she needs new faces
she says it didnt seem like that long ago
when you lose the love you gave someone
without you
and without you
i've lost my way
i cant hurry love no you'll just have to wait
she said love dont come easy
she said love dont come easy
for some tender arms to hold me tight
i cant find a reason to let go
when for so long you were mine
he's two and she's four and you know they adore you
there's nothing left to say
we'll be forever yearning
still i know how it feels i'm alone again
still i know how it feels i'm alone again
when i wake in the morning
just leave me alone
well i cant stay out of trouble
just leave me alone
now i'm back in the streets
dont call me no more
dont build your world with bitter regret
chorus
and that last train rides
feelin scared
take a good look around you
she'll be upset
take a good look around me
i'm alone

but the promise that you want the most
i cant change the world

april in paris this is a feeling
i'm not alone
and maybe tonight
we're the dream warriors
break the spell of illusion
maybe tonight you'll be gone
of lies and bitterness horizon out of reach
as the world sleeps i contemplate all that's been done
slip beneath the waves and drown
it's a matter of time the sand will run out
erase the slate
and start again

wide awake
on a sleepless night

if your wanna believe in fantasies say we're through
living a lie
of someone's path
then why does it feel

his mother's checkered past
fate begets sorrow the trail of doom
handed down to newborn generations to be cast

barely gettin by
and you dream that i would daunt you
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
though i thought i had closed it
with the edges all brown
i'll clean off that shelf
saying something about a king
with the full moon in my eyes
in the yellow haze of the sun
i wasnt looking for love when i found you
'cause i had big plans for a bright shining future
and it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you
just poor appalachian farm folk
i know he'll love and guide and lead us
dont i wonder how the old folks are back home
i knew he must be the one
i was born again
that's growin deep inside of me
repeat 1st chorus
but i dont know how to say goodbye
let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
or clingin to each other in the soft mornin light singin
ooo baby can you come out tonight
oooooo
i cannot resist you
this red hot emotion
baby i'm burning
though it hurts to let you go
and i'll be there
my baby makes me proud
then we let out hair hang down
he brings out the tiger in me
but heaven is what we both want
this soap opera play that we're in
so may the best woman win
so at fifteen she took to the highway
when she comes to town crowds flock around
blue dress blue shoes a blue cadillac
when the mornin sun
oh i love you
you know that i love you
live on dreams alone
you know that i love you
but you know that i love you
he said fourty five dollars
i had a good hardy jailor
no credit line
the driver caught my arm
and when i think i'm able to
i guess i'll die a bit each day
to change
no real love
a place to start
but i dont want to see
there were rags of many colors
about a coat of many colors
but i wore it so proudly
and making fun of me
was worth more than all their clothes
saw you turnin down main street in your big black fancy car
just plain ole calico
you seem to know your way around
repeat chorus
a more unlikely pair you'll never see
as different as can be
he was chablis fifty nine
it must have its time to mend
fragile as a sparrow's feather
if my love is true and i'm satisfied
you're like a part of me that's missing
i cross my heart
that's 'cause i was crazy over him and i couldnt stand to set him free
so young and do fine
his whole life away
where the sun never shines
a diggin my bones
where the sun never shines
all they will call you will be deportee
they took all the money he made in his life
all they will call you will be deportee
the loving heart you slighted then
to where the skies are always clears
i'd be walkin on the avenue findin you
if you've been wonderin what i'm gonna do
like a tree shedding its leaves
the bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
the nights get cold and lonely
mama say a special prayer for me
and we're gonna go to town
cause i aint a'marryin her
have a pretty little made for three
so he's gotta marry me
standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
giddy up trotty horse going to the mill
god knew little andy would be lonesome with her gone
they aint got nothin on me
and just when you think i cant love you any better
i wanna be the one you love and honor
well i have just begun
and just when you think i cant love you any better
i wanna be that i wanna be that
from down old tennessee way
if you dont like your job
hey hey and i'm sick of it
the men i meet aint warm and friendly
lights were out when the sun went down
as i cry for my blue ridge mountain boy
and let not your song fall upon my ear
for the only one that i have ever loved has gone away
i wish i were a swallow flying
i will go down to the cold waters
life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
and when the folks aint lookin you might steal a kiss or two
i knew that someday in my own special i'd repay all their nickels and dimes
a sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that i held in my mind
but loving you still
it's the hardest thing
when i'll want to die
the silent stars go by
proclaim the holy birth
the dear christ enters in
descend to us we pray
with a word or a touch i could have rekindled that fire
old flames cant hold a candle to you
and i had the gift of imagination
on paradise road
paradise is a state of mind
the wolf didnt even hang 'round our door
oh i've been smiling lately
and i believe it could be
come on peace train
now i've been crying lately
peace train is sounding louder
or i couldnt make it when you're gone
or i couldnt make it alone
dont stop loving me
whose arms have grown cold
dont let me walk in
have a look around
just a place to watch our children grow
so come on down have a look around
that's one thing that we've got a plenty of
potential new boyfriend
and i know that all of you women would love to steal him away
comin on so strong
it's a welcome turn to try
they keep crowdin in on me
and the world will be a better place
and the world will be a better place
and the world will be a better place
put a little love in your heart
you've hurt me enough today
put it off until tomorrow
mountains are level
and into that realm of insanitive bliss
and my tears are dry
down in the vieux carr'e
they call the rising sun
and oh god you know i'm one
didnt mean to be unkind
didnt mean to be unkind
didnt mean to be unkind
i dont know why i trust him i just know his heart is true
and you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind
he is worn and weary from life
the moon is my witness
and where are the feelings i thought that we shared
but it's hard to believe
the stars and me
what happens when we die
only god can know and man must not see
but i never understand
tomorrow forever
straight from the heart love is the key
i just know that you'll be there
now i know you and me belong
i turned my family and good friends against me
you promised to love me forever
you aint worth you aint worth the salt in my tears
i am a seeker
'cause i am a seeker
i am a seeker
'cause i am a seeker
wont you show me the way
or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
i can give you more than you'll ever need
repeat chorus
until the day they lay me down
repeat chorus
time and tears have washed it away
time and tears got me over you
been up and down for you
i believe it's time for me to fly
i thought we were really in love
time for me to fly
that's just how it's got to be
if she did she never did say so to daddy
if she did she never did say so to daddy
and left to daddy
if she did she never did say so to daddy
is to love love love him
how blind can he be
with only these few million tears i've cried
an it's the same with me
let me know let me know everything's alright
you know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied
he's leavin here
i'll find myself another man
things gonna be alright with me
hey lord make sure the ground he's sleepin on
and if you ever find the time
the man i loved ran a salesman route
mama didnt know 'cause i didnt told her
to meet down there with that traveling man
you just like my daddy
two doors down
this lonely room and cry forever
i ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin
oh oh oh oh
repeat chorus
wait 'til i get you home
tonight by candlelight behind closed doors
each time we discover
wait 'til i get you home sweet baby
you're coming to town
just a waiting for you
and it's time to feel good
yes we used to
oh we used to
memories of those sweet yesterdays
i thought i saw the promise of forever in your eyes
and i was warm and willing anytime
it just goes to show that you never can tell
what a heartache ooo what a heartache
you're selfish and stubborn and proud
i have a hunger you know how to feed
and there's something about me
what is it what is it my love
just when i'm about to make it work without you
you're messin up my mind
is smile that smile
that all i really know
an here i go
i heard something at the wall
as she told me where she'd been
was just an empty shell
then i saw him die
with a strange and sweet perfume
like sunlight from the skies
heavens gates are open wide
he is high and mighty
god loves you did you know that
he will guide and lead you
he is life everlasting
oh mighty is his power mighty is his love
higher and higher each day
the way i feel cant explain
darlin you're the highlight of my life
you're the one that taught me how to smile
darlin you're the highlight of my life
any boxcars in which we might hide
the years have shown no kindness
we're holding on with nothing left to hold onto
and make sure i get home if you see that i cant
so why dont more women sing honky tonk songs
there's a whole lotta women i know would sing along
back when we were hungry that way
lets love like we're hungry again
not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
and she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
hush a bye baby
dont cry no more
i'll be with my lord
i am ready to go
singing me on through heavens door
or touch a leaf or see the sky
but something has happened
i feel your love has faded into darkness
repeat chorus
the thrill and the touch of her fingertips
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
i felt it from the moment we met you didnt ask me my sign
i really got the feeling got the feeling
you want to fan the flames of love stir up passions fire
what we had then we dont have now and i would just compare
but i find a darkened corner
guess there's someone for me somewhere
oh i wanna go back there
i know in my heart what we had at the start
doop do do do doop do do do do
bitter sweet memories
oh i do wish you joy
and i dreamed about those cotton fields and home
oh if only they's just read between the lines
if you need a love that's true
my world is such an empty place
oh here i am oh here i am here i am
and though you're love was even colder
it still lingers in my heart tonight
love is like a butterfly a rare and gentle thing
it flutters like soft wings in flight
the multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
i know they say that it's a fine line
i love you
we've had our share of fights
fade
and i've lived my life like a love sick clown
oh the stars got in my eyes long time ago
noel noel noel noel
to seek for a king was their intent
then entered in those wise men three
angry words and spiteful actions
what will baby do if baby dont know what's right or wrong
so many lessons we dont teach
what will baby be
repeat chorus
and i'll fulfill all you fantasies
until the end there'll be no other
and i'll stand by you thru our rockin years
but not as bad as me
romeo romeo romeo come dance with me
chorus
so dont step out on me
so dont step out on me
resting on a marble stand
dearest sister do not weep
all of the other reindeer
rudolf the red nosed reindeer
chorus
i thought i'd been in love before
you better not cry
he knows when you've been bad or good
santa claus is coming to town
satin pillows to cry on
repeat chorus twice
and in who's arms you're gonna be
oh i love you so much
and dont forget who's takin you home
and you're no different from the others
that i love you please dont let her ruin our lives
by one bright word or smile
he meant for it to shine
the greatest gift the gift of life
he said i love you so much
he said you cant change this old world
for that day i changed
tag
love and lies
for i've been warned so i decided
and hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin game
the pain you go through
he builds what others plan
he sheds tear after tear
for a man they wont remember
mmm what's that perfume that you're wearing
and it's gettin near to closing
life could get a whole lot better
it might be today it might be tomorrow maybe one day next week
wherever i am whatever i'm a doing some sweet day i'll see
when he comes calling for me
as bad as you want them to stay
when someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay
is the love that we shared
when glory bells chime my love will ring true
whenever forever comes whenever forever comes
fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
she wants to have a white limozeen
dreamin of a white limozeen
she's a woman of the world
now she's a livin her dreams
she goes struttin down the boulevard
a big white limozeen
a big white limozeen
skin shades of ivory red yellow and dark
they were playing together and there was peace in the land
all decked out like a cowgirls dream
chorus
to see him on the town
why's you come in here lookin like that
let's drink a toast to what might have been
you go chase your rainbows go on reach for the sky
the hills were alive with wildflowers
they were common and close i had no room for growth
hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
never should'a gone
he will be waiting for me
wonder if he wants me
the spirit grows numb
and when it was done
what does life hold for me anymore
will i ever forget you or will i forget
maybelline and rubinstein and avons best perfume
and she's a working girl
repeat chorus
though we'd only met
and for no good reason to
my bright yellow rose buds
chorus
the color of sunshine
and you got me over a heartache tonight
2nd chorus
although they burn so bright
you will be the light
and i dont want to break your heart
nights i lay in bed
can we make it now
you're the only one
the only one
fade
chorus
and the love we shared when you were with me tell me darling
you know i'm a lifetime gaurantee
they've never seen a fire this hot
go ahead and tell 'em baby
'cause that aint enough
oh oh oh
chorus
tag
and so i said a little prayer
and it was love all night
tag
but she's an eagle when she flies
strong as steel her faith and pride
oh bless her lord
chorus
a rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
the tears like rain keep on falling down
i never thought i'd live to see this day
drowning in this endless endless
but not a one is turned away when it's family
good or bad or indifferent it's still family
while there are others living about us
faithful 'til death said our loving master
if you knew how lonely my life has been
feels like i'm all the way back where i belong
dont look so sad i know it's over
for the good times
we've cried in the darkness we've laughed in the sun
and we've sailed troubled waters we've soared on the wind
we've come full circle and we've just begun
wakinup i wish that i could sleep and dream again
wonderinif god loves us when we're cheatin
a wrong that feels so right
my cheatinheart will tell on me tomorrow
i saw a golden ray of sunlight
the more i realize that i am viewing
and the more i look around me
and each new day is but a new page
'cause my bible tells the story
golden streets of glory i walk on
and if i'm worthy to go in
i flew off to the wild blue yonder
but he had me just anytime
i fantasized me was james dean
do you think about me
the closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
now there's no more gypsy there's just joe and me
the face of joe and gypsy lookin back at me
chorus
but he lets me ride when the lights turns low
sweet little love maker takin my heart and leave me behind
just a little more kind to me
if teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
the bed's still warm where you just left
gone like the dew from the buttercup
and leave this message on the code a phone
if you need me i'll be gone
i'll love you to sleep at night wake you with a kiss
show you a magic life that few have dreamed of
forever and always i will prove what i said
de de da de de dum de de oh
i'll never say goodbye
the door's always open i leave on a light
so i'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
and i understand that's where you spend your time
it just dont work that way
on a cold and gray chicago mornin
take a look at you and me
and he learns how to steal
in the ghetto
in the good old days when times were bad
anything at all was more than we had
in the good old days when times were bad
so when you find yourself alone
must be you by my side the whole way through
it's all wrong but it's all right
it's all wrong but it's all right
love you dont see
i've tried and tried to put aside
she'd hold out her arms then she'd climb in beside us
she said when i die please dont bury me
but on jeannie's grave we placed an eternal flame
with flaming locks of auburn hair
but you dont know what he means to me jolene
and whatever you decide to do jolene
and you better not set foot on his land
and he was the biggest man i'd ever seen
joshua joshua
so i said yeah when he asked if i'd stay
you aint gonna be lonesome anymore
and heaven and nature sing
no more let sins and sorrows grow
and wonders of his love
so when you look at me
but when he wants to marry
yes i've made my mistakes
just someone i used to spend some time with
pretend that you dont hear me it's alright
and i might smile when other folks would frown
and even though you may not understand me
i didnt stand in your way
i think about where you might be
you packed in the morning
you left me
there's a place on the hill
when god sees her comin
let her fly
that's been all wrong
'cause i am strong and i can prove it
i can see the light of a brand new day
it's gonna be okay
love is a hidden treasure
let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
and once again i felt the lonely comin down
still a prisoner of hurt
but when the spirit is broken
'cause i still remember those cutting remarks
than a slow healing heart
when i'm around you
you're the wind 'neath my wings
yes you are something special yes indeed
listen can you not hear our young heart's beating
we lie in love so close together
something's burning and i think it's love
a way to keep my head a swimmin
he is drivin me wild
burning with passion and desire
daddy sold the house
starting over again
of left over memories
facing fifty years old
never any end
fall on my window pane
and my tears keep falling down
raindrops just keep falling down
tears that just wont wash away the pain
mirror mirror dont you tell a soul
i'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song
you touched my soul with your beautiful song
sing your song sweet music man
but you'll keep on lookin for one last fan to sing to
there's just too many people around
where the stars at night
i'm sick of the clock sick of the phone
where the eagles fly
maybe because it's too good to be true
chorus
'cause i watch you flirt
tell me what i need to hear
they say a womans a fool for weeping
telling me lies
you dont know what a chance is
for a country girl with a friendly face
since the big apple took a bite out of me
just as soon as i can i'm gonna head
good lord have mercy on a country girl
why you take for instance this old broken heart
i'll trade them for a future i cant use them anymore
the bargain store is open come inside
over the miles yet to cover
falling from around my neck
i know you wonder why i'd leave like this
this aint the first time you have done me wrong
walter browning lost his life and for a time
cause she was well respected in the county too
and i took a sacred oath that i would never tell
six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
and turns the music down
coming outside
and memory flies out the window
i know all about the honor of god samples from the film the dead
my frail virgin mind
still i longed to search for more
viciousness and subtlety
the chill of november
gather ye rosebuds while ye may sample is james waterston from
alive from what i've learned
it's the most awful thing you'll various samples mainly john
instrumental
i was blinded by a paradise
holding me at bay
let's feed upon his misery
i realize there's no turning back
now that my life is done
in the unity of our five day sessions
a trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion
until everybody smiles
a place within your eyes
the angel you've been sending for
it's power in a look of fire
the answer to a prayer
one to one
but now you cant turn away
what's left behind
will dark be bright
hidden conclusion
will dark be bright
to steal from you the innocence that bleeds
dont wanna be alone
wounds that never heal
where do you belong
you dont wanna breathe the air you breathe
live another day
so die another day
and said maybe when it's right for you they'll fall
the beauty of the starlight
'grant me this request please
'i gave you my word now my love
bono u2 from the album the unforgettable fire
i'd leave this heart of clay
into the light
oh no no no
dislocation
and so fade away
headline murder young girl killed
but he'd turned the weapon on himself
but he had another plan
was the victim unaware
our deeds have traveled far
our deeds have traveled far
lyrics by james labrie
understand our fears
predictable
no sign of you around
and still life pushes on
i hope that you hear me
incredible
twisting turning
who can think for you instead
responsible thinkers
that gives you your life
burning my soul
i cant hold on any longer
the one you take
i bare all that i am
spinning the lies
you cant heal the wounds of my soul
spinning a cage
bloody but never cry submission
life aint for you and we're the cure
damage incorporated
chorus
a day like today
days disappear
i gave you my hand
a ghost of a mist was on the field
easter
what will you do
will you sleep at night
when i sleep at night
only memories remain
i started to find my way
without truth
friday evening
this feeling inside me
i'll break free of the miracle
then came a shot out of the night
as their bodies lie still
no longer torn in two
open your eyes nicholas
spend a vision with me
sleep with the devil and then you must pay
getting as good as you gave
the gates of babylon
to the gates of sweet hell
a taste of one's wealth
one last time
are these her memories
his words i cannot hear
fearing family ties legalies compromise
only to fall back in line
a father's benediction as his hopeful son departs
tonight the only consolation causing him to fight
instrumental
no big surprise
in your daddy's name
poor vanessa
battered and bruised
this world is spinning without me
this world is spinning around me
centuries cry
uncovered show at ronnie scott's jazz club london 13195
and heart of stone
glass is cut
see the lights go down
the chain undone
love slowly stripped away
music lyrics by john petrucci
i'm starting to feel
to eleven every night
that you didnt mean me no good
i said i've been crying
6th degree six degrees of inner turbulence 4204
this she knows is true
he'll be standing by
the perfect girl
she will fall out of the sky
she enjoyed the race
seeing shadows in the light of the day
seeing shadows in the light of the day
burning in the night
we honestly think that maybe
random urine testing
and put all this work to waste
are you lonely without mommy's love
i want you to know i'd die for one more moment
but never cared much to be held
in his solitary shell
fearful and sad most of the time
of his solitary shell
still it's hard to just get by
she dresses in black everyday
a lapse of perception
keeps us from saving those we love
the answers inside
i want to know you now
in a garden where the seeds were spilled
are you sanctified in your judgment of me
at the drop of a dime
nicholas
i've arrived vlinding sunshine beaming through
in her eyes i sense a story never told
i'm feeling like i'm going out of my head
i'd break through to the other side
today i am searching for it
but i dont mind i hope to find the truth
dreams are shaking
he's had awhile to hink it over
he stands before the window
but i had given all than i could take
take away my pain
staring at the message on their faces
i'm not frightened anymore
i was standing by the edge of the water
there's nothing left to hide
i've seen the mistakes
and craft new challenges with my eyes
close your eyes
supression that he feels must turn to hope
let my senses fall away
why i've felt this way
tears that fall from eyes
the truth
cunning baffling powerful
can no longer take it
desperate attempt
life here in my glass prison
a distant oasis before me
save me i'm drowning and i'm hopeless on my own
sorrow to burn
this new odyssey
you dug the hole but you cant bury your sole
the door wouldnt open replaced with but in this
and the key of my willingness
promise lies ahead
poised for conflict at ground zero
industries of death
justified in taking
to treatment of disease
poised for conflict at ground zero
harvesting existence
faced against each other
with steve hogarth from marillion on co lead vocals
lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
mother superior jump the gun
because happiness is a warm gun yes it is
can you feel me
sitting naked by the phone
the wall was too high as you can see
can you help me
he couldnt take another day
the noise that you'll hear
bury me in the sand
the noise that you'll hear
once the cloud that's raining
the crashing
music by dream theater lyrics by mike portnoy
the city's cold blood calls me home
it's calling me back to my home
living their other life
help he's my brother but i love her
i cant keep away from her touch
in the dead of night
animation
the mirror falls behind you
not intending to end
immune to openness
and turn off your mind
you can find all you need with your eyes
a daily dose of emptyv
calculated formulated
now they're dead and buried yeah
with some real thoughts
no energy for anger
so find me kindness
the way your heart beats makes all the difference
new solutions to be found
another chance to lift my life
in learning to live
though i'm weak like i cant believe
as far as i can throw you
mother mary quite contrary
she comes in apparently to fill the void
and you can tell your stepfather i said so
she can turn a drop of water
he takes a few steps away
and she listens openly
would you like to sit and talk to me
light fuse and get away
feelings of betrayal and the incidents
an attention addiction
and a dangerous heart
and a dangerous heart
swept away with the tide
sometimes your castles in the air
crown of thorns at my side
then sewn upon our sleeves
and crucify our instincts
through the holes in my hands
the lease of their lives has been spent
transcending mystic worlds and time
the lessons now learned
and i see the same old faces
images dream theater words petrucci
there's no more freedom
somewhere like a scene from a memory
there must be a third and last dance
lyrics by john petrucci
how can i bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
i turn from a thief to a beggar
i turn from surreal to seclusion
i have been
out with the old useless
living out a constant deja vu
what they want from me aint gotta clue
lies ten feet tall
temptation
hypocrite
what're you doing film falling in love
film damage
reflections of reality
it's time to make my amends
my eyes tried to hold their place
is locked behind your door
as my last step fell
the ones who help to set the sun
lways a moment too late
behind the stained glass
tonight i'm awake
on the winds of silence
but if they have to suffer
is anything certain in life
that after we're gone
what i know to be true
because i am no longer here
i finally feel
hypnotherapist
sacrificed without a fight
i saw the writing on her stone
i wept just like a baby
to grieve for her and say goodbye
all you've ever heard
reaching
cant you see it's only time
hearts combined can only climb
always beside me
beneath a blackened summer sky
bear this honor in my name
look straight ahead through the blackness
a wish of the past
reach within
the spider in the window
so i'll just wait inside my head
thought disorder
voices protecting me
only love is worth having only revolution
this is not reality
swear my skin is inside out
withdrawn and introverted
heard you speak but never listened
images words moore
she stares at the ceiling
or up with the smoke from the fire
lines in are the extra lyrics
wanted dead or alive yah this song sucks
i'm wanted yah dead or alive
yeah i bet you got something else on your back
i'm wanted wanted dead or alive dead or alive
oh man it's over already we'll miss you we'd like to
when i think about winter
cause things are gonna change so fast
say it again you're starting to lose me
it's all about you not me
it's all about you not me
but i'm not blind
something's been sent here
there are no prisons in our kingdom
the magic's in your heart
i should have stayed on the farm
back to the howling old owl in the woods
mongrels who aint got a penny
studio demo from 1988 with charlie dominici on vocals
a prayer of hope the weary world rejoices
sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
alternate ending acoustic dreams cd
oh night when christ was born
remembered is the sacrifice but
motionless by stiffening cold
walking amidst a frightening still
iv thorns
i've stopped the killing hand
what i have learned
now it wont go away
seems it's taken its' toll
of my mind and my body my will and my soul
kicking stones down the road to hell now
close my eyes for the chance of a better view
do you see me sitting here
i know i know the darkest side of the sun
28 years straight to hell
let the bodies hit the floor
now
but it seems there's no way around it
i will break you
i will break you
i will break you
and i fall back into that simple fool you always knew
and i dived that stake
you're bringing me down
be part of the scene and ride the big machine
i told you i know you as well as you think you do
what who where were when i needed you
and now you want to come along for the ride
set fire my page you close the book
it's duet it's duet
this duet let's do it
every time you speak to me
it's duet it's duet
it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet it's duet
never want to be your enemy
never want to be your enemy
change me rearrange me make me your enemy yeah
walk away walk away you made an enemy
realize through my eyes
i can see it your eyes
to this emptiness
you think it's over
when i dream
i've come to fall back down now
cried at doors
it's time to rise above you
rise above you
you want the world
obscene unclean unholy
all of us will bleed
i've never had to run and hide
my sickness keeps me in control
no control
from coming to life
the wreckage that we all try to keep
all is fair in love and war
its war
i can be consumed by you no so i dont need you
i know you'll take it take it
cant you see my world dont revolve around
i need to break free your heart strings strangle me
someday i will be a better man
you cannot hurt me no
you still stand still you wont promise me no
hey push a little more you said hey push a little more you bled
no more no more no no more
no more no more no no more
when it seems like tomorrow might not come
so why dont you just tell me
you ruin me
you keep me tied down you're stealing my crown
under everything something that you cant see
together forever slowly severed us apart
whatever happened to the lies that i believed
woah oh woah oh as you watch me fly away
watch me fly watch me fly watch me fly away
with a rebel yell she cried more more more more more
i walked the ward for you babe babe babe
in the midnight hour babe she cried more more more
as my halo i'm scarred by where i've been
crucified every time i tried
i cant forget i cant forget
and i've never thought i'd see the day
everything i've ever had has been taken away
where was god when i needed a friend
i'll tell you what you should see
my tongue rhymes one thing for eager ears to hold on to
you know i'll try again
i i've got no time for you and i will i will i will shame you shame you
is this everything you wanted find another dream
on your feet who's with me
there is no compromise your bringing forth your sacrifice
your pride inside of me your honor inside me respect inside of inside of me go
every time i see inside you i see myself within you ohh let that fade away
you better stop and think twice
you're gonna get knocked down knocked down
so take some good advice
if you wanna step up step up
you're gonna get knocked down
i'm tearing away
i dont care about anyone else but me
damn i love me
this is my time i make the rules
time to play the game
here comes the pain
you wont forget my name
here comes the pain
time to play the game
suddenly your rule the universe
she takes my hand
you cant bring me down
c'mon x4
before you're led off to the slaughter
all of this so pure
none of this will save you from yourself
in the sleet and snow
all the bullshit in my eyes
shut up
to crawl back inside of myself
little one what i need aint what you bleed
broken by your one sided compromise come on
you're not changing me you got me all wrong now
deep inside you've got me all wrong now
sitting back on the sissy bar
and i looked into the mirror last night
kneel down and bow to the princess
now that its time that
know that it's good
airplane is flyin up in the sky
'cause every day i'm here
if i could just remember what it was like
all in a day's work
a sight to see
keep me safe inside
but i love a few things
nevertheless
and you are one of them
i dont know how much more i can take
heavens awaiting those who dare
baby genius
guess i'm doing something wrong
but stick around long enough and you'll find out
and i was soaring down
but that problem lies only with them
i bet you are flying inside
and if one mans cage is another mans stage
then she'll be the one wiser than her age
dont look at me
i'm the man baby i am the man
well hee hee hee
and so do i
things wont get better
but it's the best dark i ever had
until they get much worse
well christmas is going to the dogs
wake up to a big surprise
so i'll just stay here and chew
got a sky that looks like heaven
they'll bring you by
soon we'll be far away
whatching the movie
i saw some photos of a happy family
and here i go looking for my new home
and watch it as it disappears
and the streets are jammed with cars
fade into
and hope our eyes keep telling lies
just walking by with some new guy
coming home from the school today
you tell me what it is to be a friend now
hang my hairy head in sorrow
i guess i would
i never want to be the same
where is my rain
a new day has begun
and who's gonna play with me
but i got something that i gotta do
and who's gonna play with me
i finally hear
and everything you need to know
her love it is not pure
she loves a puppet
and all that i can do is cry
i can shine it all on
how the winter wind chills me
had a face
all the flowers you bring
for every passerby
it crawled in your mouth
and think how you'll die
somebody loves you
there's no water in the well
or is this some bad dream
suckin fumes under the highway pass
no one has a thing to say
but that didnt stop me
well that could really wreck his day
33 years of tough luck
sisters brothers make better lovers
22 miles of hard road
souljacker cant get my soul
free for all free for all
free for all free for all
it's a free for all you and me
but we are standing at the gate
i wanna change myself around
and put them away
but i wont give up yet
but she'll be reading on the moon
but she'll always be strawberry blonde
i'd welcome her in my arms
that aint no reason to live
call up your best friend
that aint no reason to live
with a bullet in his forehead
here comes a girl with long brown hair who cant be more than seventeen
changes everything
she's my sweet li'l thing
she's got a glow around her
telling me
maybe i'm too much
where did you find such a rockin vest
little lizard legs and rubber lizard tails
heaven cant help a teenage witch
heaven cant help a teenage witch
you say a lot of funny things my little bunny
i know i'm not too much of a bargain
they're just happy it's another day
it's up to you and me
be it gun be it knife
was the only thing i had
hes a very bitter dude
in your blender and in my cup
birds
i've got a feeder for you to perch on
you just gotta let it go
you just gotta let it go
and look up at the squirrels in the trees
but that's all part of not doing what you're told
then see what's in front of you
then see what's in front of you
then see what's in front of you
but i'm going to stop pretending
years down the line
butterflies and blackbirds search for
and let the water wash away all lies
thinking 'bout the good times
the meaning that you need someone
chewed up then spat out
am i alright
it's just that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
but i love that
oh she's going to let me in
she could have anything she dreams
close the curtains and turn in for the night
the darker clouds are showing noon
and baby i got on that boat
walking along by the la river
poor river
poor river
my head may hit the ground
here tomorrow
the neighbours scream
to this town
yeah
that i could not hear
leaving you behind
i always was and will be
i am a lone wolf
i am a lone wolf
so i'm just one of them thinking all day long
was i wrong about the world
until i finally met her
my losing streak is done
something above
i got something that you need
buyer beware
love of the loveless
just a manchester girl
another scary dream
while slowly i am dying inside
like i am a child in love
eight lives left
and a heart that wants
sticking around for this shit
kitty licks my cheek once more
i have a heart but i can not feel anything
most of the time actually i am alone
and it feels like some one is smiling down on me
the tree is looking so inspired
everything's gonna be cool this christmas
better pray for sundown
but if you dont wanna wear a hospital gown
mister i keep my eyes down
flashing lights and sonic booms
and if it falls between the seats
and take me as i am
i know this is hard for you too
and i will never be afraid
now i've got friends that do love me
now i've got friends that do want me
fitting in with the misfitts
while the world passes me by
everyone is trying to bum me out
if they step on me tonight
dont think twice 'bout
spiders in the kitchen
that it is good
that fresh feeling
so pure and so free
giving all i can give
two times i thought i heard someone
got up and i opened up the door
looking for a simple life
that's coursing through me
i dont know if the stores will all be closed
i dont know if i can stand to stay here
you just lay down like you're gonna die
driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream
scrabby wounds that never heal
thinking about the days of hanging out behind the school
royal families dont have time
he doesnt have a thing to say
hey you with the walkie talkie
sometimes it feels like i'm made of eggshell
this birthday cake may be the last
she doesnt want to play the game
venus de milo grew an arm
hello cruel world
but she's like a dream
and in this life you've got yourself
but it's her that i'll miss in the end
cause you say that you must
marie on the run
what's that flaming ball in the sky
symphonic despair
wearing jesus's new snowshoes
it's really more than i can say
climbing up this tower
and there's no place i can go
would it be enough to say
then i can die
keep on tickin you're not lickin me
watch the day disintegrate
dont care if i'm cold
caught every episode on tv today
to the stink
another night another day
spray painted and dead firewood
if you think what happens next
and i dont care where the bus stops
seen a lot been through too much
people cheat and people lie
i go to bed real early
it's better for me to stay home
i'm learning how to say hello
it's not all good and it's not all bad
and the difference between the two
i think im on the brink
when i grow up ill be
to put you down all over town
trying to find new ways
i'm thinking they'd be better off
oh i'll go
i think it's time to make my getaway
clear to me now but i was never told
something with no beginning has an end
i'll be impressed if she does not run screaming
but it's real and it lasts a long long time
a knock on the door means
but i would rather take you
makes me feel
glowing off concrete
the day is coming when you'll have to think of it
woman driving man sleeping
chorus
woman driving man sleeping x2
devil lover time awaits you
dont take any wooden nickels
devil lover time awaits you
mama was a real good egg
the question is merely when
i admit he's not the dumbest angry young nitwit
someday he's gonna show us all i bet
well he'd better get out of my way
the one i adore
the one i adore
i'm doing my best
and then she finally gave birth
another tired old gag
never know who it might be at your doorbell
he's got that far away and vacant look in his eyes
they say im mental but im just confused
yes indeed
yes indeed
yes indeed
because i'm
she's never known the world
did she really name you mockingbird
it's kinda funny that it's her name
once i forget
it couldnt last
not as i am
making no sense at all
mother mary
i did not mean to let you go
come on
god damn right it's a beautiful day ahah
she will always be the only thing
la la la la la la la la
have a not so nice day
voices tell me im the shit
okay
i'm walking around
the sun is shining
the winner stands alone
now i know i'm really free
and my stone face cracks again
i'm not feeling up to it now
are coming back
novovaine for the soul
may wash away my pain
hold her hand in japan
when i get there
spinning my wheels
why you wanna ruin it
we can lie
packing blankets and dirty sheets
floating up into the sky
i've never known anyone
but then he blew it away
i've never found
i pray
there must be something that's folowing her
i dont know how
i dont know what we'll do
i dont know where we're going
and i cant stop staring back
now i go back whenever my tired head hits the pillow
how do you stand when you've been crushed
i feel like an old railroad man
things are faster now
just someone who knows he's in love
find another love like this
but i dont care about their rules
but no one's laughing
they dont know what they need to fear
the world is gonna end tomorrow
looking for a light with her head in the oven
this rotten world's gonna chew you up
intrigued by a ghostly light divine
why we had to sing the song we knew was wrong inside
have no fear now walk across the waves abd discover how how to be so brave
half a thought
i hear no surge
his whole life could be turned upside down
guilt nor shame her child must have a home
you cant walk away
by any rule he doesnt play
repeat chorus
can you remember the time life was worth
the future lies wide open
chorus
let it be history way back in time
he's longing for reality no more abnormality
you most certainly wont stand a chance of pulling through
seabreeze is worming through my hair
i'm standing face to face
is so false
to blame
cant take it anymore
close your eyes love will come your way
god dont hide your look
you took the step and slipped away
make a reason out of hollow words
a miracle about to show
light feeling of freedom
drops of rain are falling down from my facesoul is sliding
desolated remain
we still keep changing our lives stop look and listen
each wrong move that we make we're missing chances
his innocence her child must not be influenced
a living hell going crazy frenzy frenzy
repeat bridge chorus
cut by faith in god
i'm hidden under iron mask
i want to hear your voice
influental called themselves friends gifts they gave some kind of trend
the dealer always wins
chorus
where does it end
his abuse of people touches the very core
verse
chorus
bridge
music lyrics vocal melody ian parry
to feed a need let the adrenalin flow
secrets kept alive subconscious thoughts awake
the old dream of fear is back
hey hey turn your eyes to the fire to the fire
which creates them for you
i hear no surge
music henk van der laars dirk bruinenberg
his own portrayal the proud example to others
once they're of no importance
you could hear the churchbells ring hear the laughter
it shocked her system from within so she lies staring at the images inside
locked away he hopes to find peace of mind
no more day just tomorrow
close the door take the key try and throw it away far far away
your enemy's coming to take you away
i dont recall memories hard to focus hard to please
the knowledge guilt we all possess the strength of mind to now confess
suppression wont we bother suppression wont we show a little concern
it's to bad you're stuck in your stupidity
lies scream it's overover
chorus
and sleep cures fear of it
lyrics vocal melody ian parry
verse
chorus
behind shadows behind fingers
one of them is you
i'm a ghost from the dark
your lies are his eyes
grey shadows in the black mirror
this is the last place on my way
when i see the moon for the last time
i'm alone like pain in me
wizard indeed
strange eyes
finish what you've already started and one day you'll blessed with the
hidden with bloody hands
wait for hidden sign in ugly jewel
verse
the pressure lay on her shoulders
hide your tears
believing that life will bring him strength
that her husband took his own life
verse
and you've been left to face the guilt alone
dont analyze come to terms
nor does it see reality an existance in an endless masquerade
i lay alone wrapped in chains and lost in visions
where are you projecting the grief
she's daddies girl he loves her so he'd like to touch her
and the pretty thing he made desert you
but i'm gonna split us back in two
the both of you can just fade to black
you disappoint me you people raking in on the world
shine on me baby 'cause it's raining in my heart
it's just a fond farewell to a friend
vomiting in your kitchen sink
the cold comfort of the in between
a fond farewell to a friend
though i'm beyond belief
though i'm beyond belief
you know you know you know you know you know
you know you know you know you know you know
you walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
but the fix is in
if you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart
you say you dont want anyone around
but all you say is you dont want anyone around
i saw you with your make up running down
they paint you out in straight silhouette
black eyes always watch the clock
she probably wont say you're wrong
her hand on your arm
so let's go out
i'm ready to go
that fell down here to lay beside you
picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
and be forever with my poison arms around you
water pouring from her eyes
you wont be happy 'til the bottle's broken
revolver's been turned over
for someone half as smart you'd be a work of art
all spit and spite you're up all night and down every day
drink up baby stay up all night
it really made her sad
that's your fame
let's just forget all about it
and everybody's gone at last
couldnt figure out what made you so unhappy
oh well okay
you say it's just for kicks
see nothing wrong
hey hey hey hey
so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
they say that god makes problems
i never meant to hurt you
a placeholder till you take up mine
placeholder come and take up mine
keeps me away from you
with my dead imagination while you're with some other man
haleluja
waved me away
and i feel pretty pretty enough for you
i felt so ugly before
now they're gonna go say the words
they draw the curtain
like a drug in the water
sat down in jail with this friend of mine
there's a riot coming
hallucinating
i want to hurt him
people were shouting and pushing and saying
it's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
when they call it a lover's moon
i'd be around the morning after
i'm damaged bad at best
to keep your memory down
if i see you at all
just to find you with the
if i see you at all
just didnt care
using all your strength to keep the world at an arm's length
you have to help me patch things up
seen how things are hard
when it was me i was momentarily proud
i'm going to sleep now going back to find square one
so if i seem a little out of it sorry
dragged down into lowercase
i can do everything that your man does except for better
you're a first timer blaming everybody else
well at least so far
since i've seen your fallen smile
it's just not that much different from my own affair
three weeks ago you were all grace and charm
yeah well how am i supposed to feel
you live up in your head
someone's in the way
he waved hello silent like a mime
return to this abandoned place
i was off in some empty day dream
he walked over to her like before
if i wasnt such a zero
if i wasnt such a zero
what i look like
and a head that just takes up space
well it's just like being alone
i made up my mind and i dont mind sayin so
high times
wish i could call you today
when i didnt know you yet
had a dream as an army man with an order
i got a long way to go
trying to occupy space
i didnt understand
he kissed her quick
and every morning when he wakes
hanging around in the lost and found
everybody knows
independence day
and you tell me fool you tell it like it is
i wont take your medicine
better sell it while you can
and every wave is tidal if you hang around
and i get my check from the trash treasury
falling down like an omen a setting sun
dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
seemed suicidal before
look at me i'm talking to you
he was sick of it all
and that's all you do
when i already shed my best defense
you start to drink you just want to continue
like i was as good as she made me
here's the army that you mowed to the ground
i lived it out from hour to hour
i'm through trying now it's a big relief
to find some beautiful place to get lost
but i'll burn every bridge that i cross
dissolved in some dream
if it's good shit you wont know
needing cash
it's forty five past two
well cant you just leave me alone
you would say to keep confusion away
where you're dragged against your will from a basement on the hill
that advances every day
be careful or else
to a place where suffering is just a game
but its alright
cause its alright
when you talk to me
needle in the hay
you're pulling him through
down downstairs to the man
needle in the hay
keeping company with this disaster
blow through the coals
keeping company with this disaster
he's busy shaking hands with my monkey
anything is better than nothing
now you've gotta fill it with something
stuck inside my imagination
the mighty mother with her hundred arms
every thought a ricochet
leave alone 'cos you know you dont belong
concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
a strip of wet concrete
you're just fine
you dont need my help anymore
keeping a hold of what you just let go
son of sam son of a doctor's touch a nurse's love
that and give other people hell
aint nobody talking now
singing sweet high notes that echo back
they all know what's the matter
in st ides heaven
that i want those things you could never allow
but it wont come down for anyone
so then a shoulder
looking for a port of call
there's a kid a floor below me saying brother can you spare
waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
well i dont want you making mistakes
she can hear what you're thinking like you're saying it right out loud
one day she'll go i told you so
you spent everything you had
the biggest lie
i'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
wont you let me meet you at the pool
ooh ooh ooh
yourself another talk this time make it sound like someone the
there's nothing she could do until after
but i he that he'd never forget her
and all i want now is happiness for you and me
but i'm already somebody's baby
but how long will you stay with me baby
well i'm already somebody's baby
singing cathy's clown
i'm so glad that my memories remote
looking out on the substitute scene
they come here alone and they leave in twos
if you're all done like you said you'd be
as an emcee oh of the great pretender
cos we're almost there
like you say i can do
the promises you'll only make
drink up one more time and i'll make you mine
shoulder who keeps singing over everything
i turned off the light
watched the dying day
in our hearing
trying hard to become whatever they are
i believe you
until you talk out loud
god people wonder if you're sick
i wanna be you
and the doctor orders drinks all night to take away this curse
especially for me 'cos he knows i feel the same
bled white
thinking that you were about to come over
the hero killed the clown
spinning the world like a toy top
i've seen the boss blink on and off
the street's wet you can tell by the sound of the cars
anything to pass the time
nothing new nothing new for you to use
still you're keeping me around
would never be good enough for you
coast to coast
that i've already done for you
bruno s is a man to me
laying low again
and you're coming up roses everywhere you go
and you're coming up roses everywhere you go
a sick like you hear at the fairground
to take a little nap while the road is straight
i'm lying down
so now i'm leaving you alone
cupid's trick comes
so kick me cane me
and i said i'd find a better place we could spend eternity
dont go down
and her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
baby stay
said its okay i knew exactly what you meant
in an endless symbolic war
every time you win some petty score
yes everybody cares about you
you got a pretty vision in your head
just lovers we were oh what a lie
your 10000 promises
what about your
what about your
once we were lovers
and if you're that type of girl
yo brian stop lying
my love my love
yo my name is aj
my name is nick
my name is aj and i'm gonna always love you
but i'll be there to make you smile
without you i dont think i could live
i'm on my knees
but love is all i have to give
together we have seen
this world is not at ease
so tell me why we have to cry and not try
is it today is it tonight
far beyond the call of love
your love as far as i can see
couldnt live my life without you in it
people say i'm crazy and that i am blind
who you are
what you did
i dont care as long as you love me baby
where you're from
it's not that i cant live without you
the road to take
and made you feel the way i feel
and find a way back to your heart
but still i'm not complainin
chorus
every time i near
my beautiful woman
there's a spark of magic in your eyes
ladies sometimes a man cant find the words
back
it starts pumpin pumpin
boys will be boys hey hey
that you think that we should wait
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
my body's callin for you
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh yeah
and all my memories erase
something made me look at you

there's no use in trying
with a little bit of love
2 4 fam here to lend a helping hand

about this time of year
chorus
a smell of chesnuts in the air
chorus
that keeps us from each other now
take my hand take my life
and i dont wanna know

the reason why i
i didnt have too much no i wasnt rich
love is

to hold you in my arms after we make love
memories

baby i could walk through fire right back to you
what about you little darling what about you
what about you babe oh baby
i'm only livin half a life without you here with me
when we made love we belong together
chorus
chorus
so what does it mean when your mind starts to stray
brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay
but today
laden with reaction
phantasmal myriads of sane bucolic birth
the vortex of their minds ensconsed within the murky deep
on valium she's so ineffectual aint life a mystery i cant explain
on valium she's so ineffectual aint life a mystery i cant explain
maybe god is just a chemical fiction
and as the gawks and stares bombarded me
to some other school
and it was time to set the town on fire
i stuck out my chin when i should have ran
of somewhere else
i'm going for a walk
all alone i'll be an empire
call me monstrous reprobate
there's a sleeping resonance we hold
it's the surest way
but if we mute them they decay
melody is the key
restitution of pavement pomp and show i seek a thousand answers i
swept away against the grain there's a common consensus and a
all fantastic images they only are apparent
the sun climbs up to a razon
when the fighting starts who will
that was twenty one stories tall
with grave allegiances
content upon a rail of pain for just a little rain
and everything is dearly missed blood relations and bricks
and we'll try as we cry and our brothers pass us by
american dream's gonna swallow you whole it's bursting at the seam
american dream
but there's a power
'cuz so few
and the architect resides right here
he's the motive and conscience
everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery
like now is driving me to distraction
the morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan
to have more than the other have more than the other guy
and wishing upon distant stars
so you know how not to behave
imbeciles
and the world might cease
and relive the dark chapters of history
i see the hippies on an angry line
come out to play
like jelly in a pot
bang bang he's dead chalk up another triumph for our hero
so if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind
bad religion too good to take
your indecision is your
did you wander out your days lost and resigned
you'll never relive it think before you die
yeah think think before you die
out of step and out of place
a political defect
we're somewhere in the middle and we're all discontent too
and i'm sorry about the moon
i'm sorry about the world
i'll make sure we communicate just in case
better off dead yeah better than this
why dont you try pushing daisies instead
beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays
coming down a mountain eons have a human ring
a frozen amoral giant gazing heavenward forever
kneel down and pray here comes your judgment day
what comes around always goes around yeah
the sweetest lemonade the darkest game arcade
just like a fatal tie toward the other side
to light each passing day
we're all part of it as the day rolls on
and it cant include you
i dont ever need to prove myself to you
when emotion can be quantified
but we do what we want and we think what we please
but there's so many other fuckin insects out there
10 million dollars on a losing campaign
say your price tag on existence cant cover your double face quality
dont be classed out like some desolate redoubt
the promise of prosperity
a warm and septic breeze
of our bogus fate
raise the rebel from its grave
requiem
requiem
it doesnt really matter what i'm figuring out
i always end up living in this world of doubt
days go marching by
no one seems to hesitate or cast an earnest eye
is it possible to win this pointless mortal game
i think about
'cause i think about
free your little mi i mind your little
someone proclaimed creation people listened
and nothing absolutely can be cherished in the end
centuries wane
and jesuits
give us this day
to even the score
and climb so we can reach
like a spoiled little baby
we're all just slaves for the troop commanders x3
we're all just slaves for the troop commanders
slumber will come soon
sulking i would rather laugh than cry
well it's finally time to face my fears
just a patron on a ship of fools
but i'm sure it wont come from following you
tomorrow might be better but right now it feels like
and the tumbrel of your mind gets in the way
75838769 56 5965 65 423060 7534
it's the same for everybody to degrees
population wars setting our future course
resound like a cacophonous symphony
absorbent in their chorus of correctness
it sounds like heaven is falling
well nothing here looks new to me
is the human analogue of the suffering multitudes
that's when the entire world shall live in harmony
flack rounds and roiling blight
and get so mean i want to know what it means
hands so clean a sympathetic cold blooded killing machine
in the shadow of tentacled towers by the red light of america
i dont exactly want to apologize for anything and now
oh yeah i'm not respectable and never sensible
that quantity is known today as we blow ourselves away
all the angst corruption and the dishonesty
i give you me i give you nothing
i said i give you me i give you nothing
all i need to do is click on you
when i turn on you
i'm just a number
green pastures open spaces holy ways
and your intellect depends on your tv
regard quixoitic reveries of ownership
hey brother christian with your high and might errand
put an end to poverty uncleanliness and toil
put an end to poverty uncleanliness and toil
and depict the destiny of us all
catapulting you trough the haze
in the night in the night you see through jaded eyes
limbs are bound and tangled in a fatal net
i'm a hero i'm a zero
this madness shoots me
tell saint peter not to bet on me
with maggots cooking in the desert heat
and accept dichotomy
just talk about nothing let's talk about nothing
here's my confession
i want to take you i want to break you
if i pierce the complexity i wont find salvation
displaying pomp and discipline they mold their institution
but your routine is changeless through the decades of your life
and the food on your table is more plastic than protein
it's a long way to the promise land
it's a long way to the promise land
what are you going to do
everywhere i look i see
before it gets me
to watch it burn kerosene
and we're its hostages
kyoto now
exactly like the double edge of a cold familiar knife
kyoto now
southern california air feeds them
beware of number one see all the damage it has done there are so few of them
and if they yell for justice we'll hide them from the light
there's hate and opposition
i'm not blind and i'm not scared
and leave mine to me
it seems like such a long way to go
if you're living in the past
the fire continues to grow
they're america's working corps
are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts
before they reach for their checks
here comes another ration feed them death
is so rewarding and the ultimate prize
temptation revelation you decide
and it made me think
but i know now that
that you are also one of me
but down here in the city of the lime lights
and los angeles is burning
palm trees are candles in the murder wind
the cameras running
can make you see where you belong
so full of hurt and such a plomb
you just might be the last to know
why do you lie
holding less and less so what does it mean when we tell ourselves
elegance incisive our disease the swath endogenous of ourselves will
aree led som blind from the plastic protests and the hands of time
to come alive
is in the law that he reads
somehow you just cant see
nor shoddy merchandise
when it's needed from us in the end
for the 21st century
acid rain is a thing of the past too many possible causes too little
your social life such reclusive behaviour helps clear the roads and public
scratched like tartan into virgin soil
the streets of america
senior and child
a study of history reveals an unflagging appeal to mystery
but soon i'll be a catalogue number anyway
take me as i am judge me for my crimes
there's been the scent of unseasoned wood burning in the air
desperation forced without reprieve
no the world wont stop without you
the earth rotates and will revolve without you constantly
and shared it with the others
all it does is promote fear and constrenation
i heard him say
haves and have nots together at last
happy and content it cant happen to you
shut your eyes
fortified with the vitriol of strife
follow me to the future's distant shore
the brown and orange sky holds its breath
our long and sallow faces turn the other way
and our hearts palpitate anxiously as we soon will lay supine
as we outwardly deny that they have something to say
and you know that it's such a bitch
the search is bound to fail
that cares nothing for my happiness welfare or fate
so long ago so long agooh i set sail
asking how it pertains to tomorrow
try to build a master race
a deep inspiration on a warm summer day
ecological guilt
three cars for every family
i can see the walls closing in
my juice runs dry i'll construckt a rock of tempered beams and
turn on the light turn on a million blinding brilliant white
why you hide underneath the covers
so if you chance to see her
and i'll only ask you one thing
intertwining can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell
that's written everywhere
dispose when i'm shot
that no surplus can repay
just dont sell me short
striking at mental apparitions
when there's no above
to all that they interpret
eyes that look way beyond your years
with a hope that lies in a hidden master's call
this pilgrim lost his way
dont look at me no i aint one no prodigal son
dont look at me no i aint one no prodigal son
and all the sorrow in this world
yeah there will be sorrow
yeah there will be sorrow
half assed victim rhetoric
and fawn just waiting to die
you can chuck it all away
instead you're mute
billion unacceptable one part per million unacceptable this
i'll save your soul
everyone is a hydocrite come to me
i condemn you
everything you touch leaves a mark on your soul
everyone you touch leaves a mark on your soul
this aint no recess
so i'm prone to hear you out and refuse
i must confess at times i indulge it on the sneak
i aint no deist
look around the country an abundance you'll find of
dont act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
an enemy
mediocre minds
aptitude they'r griping about
then you can live outside inharmoniously
the only natural thing that i despise are
speed but the firmament still covers them with its malevolent seed
verify all your fears
they're the modern day catastrophists
maybe its time to make room
i've got this one big problem will i live forever
just a sample of carbon based wastage
if you had called that fucker by its name
say the name
he simply turns away
its my poor friend me
to see the solution
wake up the new america
victories dont mean a thing
wo oh
we only build ourselves a fleeting
wo oh
now come ye children one and all let's heed ezekiels call
so how do you sleep
it really makes you stop and think about the years to come
save life and earth and water there cant be any other need
'cause that old one's turning on you
time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes but they cant
we have no control we have no control
looking for directions
and they assume somebody else knows what it is
i dont belive in self important folks who preach
a diet of air a face on the net
and still water stales a soft summer breeze
you look for some meaning blank smiles are all that's there
is it any wonder
that we hoist on our own shoulders
are just for someone's personal gain
oligarchy oligarchy
they control two worlds
many our the people poor and suffering
only entertainment
a melancholy dream
but see it's only entertainment
and if it ever gets there
that sprouts into your picture of the world
they're here to right our fall they have heard a troubled call
sleeping on a time bomb staring into space
is there no redemption no common good
forging little plays of deception and pain
with opiates of silicon big brother schemes to rule the nation
with mighty high technology we're never second best
the final page is written in the books of history
we're dominant and prominent
and immortality's in our mastermind
and we're the only ones who can perceive it
my pessimistic lines
as one that deserves praise and ritual
and the modern age's lies wont absolve you
are you churned by emotion from voices in your head
tell me what you see tell me what you know
just eternal silence and dormancy
and we'll be worse off than we are now
we'll wipe out our own species and thus the world
i've tried to see these faces all around the way
we ignore the masses of the whole entire race
and nobody has the will to tear it down
and a plague across his land
its the merble statue standing over me
and oppressive intrusion
sometimes it's never a crime
dont ever dare to hope he said
and hearts bursting with national pride
i woefully conclude
listen to me
disillusion
she said
and incurable style
he was a troubled child
a little cracked
well now it's coming to you and i dont really care
but dad i'm not so nothing
lack of restraint is a complaint of those around me
cant stop
and i
spreading randomly
it has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud
what pretension everlasting peace
when we are scared we can hide in our reveries but
you have created an unhealthy monster
and you stitched up a horrible surprise
they multiply and give rise to thismonstrosrity
or are you just a mosaic of thoughts alone
all you need to do is close your eyes
full of codified arbitrary directives
we've got spite and dedication as a vehement brew
and you're scared shitless 'cuz evil abounds
come and join us
turn it into one of our own kind
come and join us
if their sins affected me i gotta be damned to be free
dying it's just your destiny
and stubbornly crept into every mad perception
dearly beloved dearly beloved dearly beloved
yeah i am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea
guidance and light
ignorance and fear
it's only destiny
the future isnt difficult to see
go to hell with superman and
see the fight old men crying deny their ruin
and go to sleep for generations
so all of kings horses
and mark david did it to john
and i dont remember hearing
heard a word suicide
no complaints and no doubts
and the moral to this story is old
and like fools we trust the delivery
weak and sick dying in the sand no such thing as a promised land
in the end you'll return once more to die again
empty causes
a war for the body an army in the mind
empty causes
temporary fixtures for which we strive something in our synapses
of no return my brothers
the fallacy
we could be
why do revelations fade to cold blue untruths
of epiphany
conspirator so fine
cuz next time
when the house is burning
time because our tender isnt valid if your soul needs love you can
but when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
so you'll always have god
they'll tell you you cant have your own way
dont let your emotions mask your sight
and we're all in this tigether dont you know
and the fertile crescent is haunting us today
seeking a purpose and the meaning of kin
war is god
will never love any less
below are picking up sticks and the man in the gallows lies
no destination lie lie lie ad inifinitum
but soon enters dusk as the last surrey rusts and a new day upon us results
frogger with my life with my life x3
in the end the good will go to heaven up above
like a fucking atom bomb
like the blood on the door
there's a knife on the floor
delegate facilitate investigate and obviate
clip the wings of progress turn the direction
realizing we are on a runaway machine angular the momentum that does
your soul and have they told you how to think cleansed your mind of
but dont forget
but dont forget
victory
remembering how he helped to save this sacred land
neighbors no one loves you like he loves you
no longer will young christian americans hedonistically indulge
voice of god is government the voice of god is government
build a million dollar church with money spent on god's research
fantastic the panic that showed in his eyes he shrugged when i asked
it4s been around for a long long time
on a plunging flight and we4re sitting
early man walked away as modern man took control
and although the world rotates itself the only thing you twist is your mind
you see the world's falling apart at the rifts
and surprisingly the leaders cant make any sense of it
i accept them but they exclude
i've seen a lot of things in five years
when when will you try
all those stories that my dad told me
they are just a whisper in time
broken homes from which they come beer stained dad compliant mom
white trash 2nd generation don your crown and cleanse the nation
too much money got the cash
i'll make us have another war
the end is almost here
yesterday the good old days
yesterday
you are the government
we were different
is there something worth belonging to
mary she kept her purity
and i confess it could be prejudice
drop a card or letter to my side of town
so please try not to be impatient
contestants in disguise
is the curse of castaways
they dont discriminate
you're talking in the stratosphere
dont you believe what the
and you sit there adn watch the world go around
yeah the means are verified
shed a tear for the criminal give him something to believe
you can fake another cry and compromise your dream
substance was restrained
promising salvation
weighted as a murder trial
rythmic as change
tonight the windows are watching
my morning papers got the scores
and a pack of wild desperados scornful of living
holding a candy cane
you can never get out
introverted
a collision in the dark
he see's a note in the obituary
like a barren winter day
but i'm thinking altruistcally
i try to close my eyes
they just betray impoverished accomplishments
and hawk ultimatums so their weakness wont show
expectation indoctrination
door leading to the gift of hope renewed eternity for you
it'll never go away it's in the cards that way
just to stay in the human race
how does it feel to be outstripped by the pace of cultural change
i wont lie
tell me does life exist beyond it
crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution
i prefer my big brother he's so gentle and understanding
ten billion people all suffering
10 in 2010
and he complelled people to follow along
but as they were scutinized
searching for a modern day savior from another place
but stealthily in the land of the free he's lurking there
it's not there on the blackboard it's what they dont tell you
and my high speed connections monitored daily by the pentagon
i wont resign before the struggle ends
we trace the mortal edge with no defense
and your mother's in the kitchen
i must conceal myself and steal myself and break away
dont wanna give
we stumbled once in 'nam
e m p i r e
couldnt reverse
if i could only get the tools the stimuli and
i can see the edifice crumbling in foggy mist
turning true emotion
turning raw compassion
and that's our dilemma
you gotta overcome the obstacles of history
every time you shake someone's hand
the hippy killers
the next miserable generation
a message to you ru deee
a message to you ru deee that's right that's right
a message to you ru deee
a is for argument a is for apparent
a is for adversary a is for affection
a is for acting a is for abhorrently
you're an abacus
there's still a long way to go
i discovered alcohol
for while i cannot love myself
i love you more than i did the week before
alcohol my permanent accessory
my life never will
was a waste of precious booze
o alcohol would you please forgive me
i make sure the customers arent thieves
back to the dream i dream to leave
so we can get out of this town 'cause it makes me sick
aluminium to some
everything
am i the only one who asks you to go
am i the only one who needs you to go
is getting others involved
we are all phonies too
we're only trying to lend a hand
are trying hard not to care back off
oh until you're just like us
chorus x2
a goin fishin chimp a british chimp in the bath
i've got some shaved chimps that's chimps devoid of any hair
i've got depraved chimps dressed up in womens underwear
i dont know where to send it
sweet potato pie
i give the globe another spin
for auld lang syne my dear
we'll take a cup of kindness yet
my mother will start to worry
say what's in this drink
i really cant stay
so nice and warm
i've got to get home
at least there will be plenty implied
and all the selfless things you did with billy
he said you are the only one
40 days at sea
if you think growing up is tough
well i thought i was wide awake but my legs were still asleep
that my parachute failed
but they tell me that i'll never walk again
i get a good seat at a concert
i cant understand it we had it down pat
leave me alone
well i guess we panicked we all have taboos
inside the police car you tried to explain
we all did our best now
leave me alone
isnt it beautiful to see two people so much in love
but i dont like all these people
what if you were simply not so
beautiful
not much else going on
what if one day i wake up blind
beautiful
beautiful
if all else fails you can blame it on me
but it's alright now you can blame it on me
you say you think there's a traitor among us
deep into the woods into the woods
deep into the wood into the woods
if i had 1000000 if i had 1000000
if i had 1000000 maybe we could put a refrigerator in there
if i had 1000000 we'd take a limousine 'cause it costs more
if i had 1000000 if i had 1000000
if i had 1000000 i'd buy your love
if i had 1000000 if i had 1000000
we wouldnt have to eat kraft dinner
if i had 1000000 i'd buy your love
if i were the sun you would be in shadow
if i had a gun there'd be no tomorrow
with being beautiful and young
she fed me strawberries
we sat and read our books
in the car
unless she hears this song
not to be alone anymore
and want to drink your love
and the honey in the tea
dropping clouds fallin fast
inline bowline inline bowline
inline bowline inline bowline
this knot is tied to him
somewhere someone is dreaming of me
risk my hide
'cause if you cant see what i'm after
i met you before the fall of rome
you go your way i go mine
it's all been done
it's crunching in below my feet
they're opening their presents big and small
speaking as a guy who's really
who knows me half as well as me
i'm not asking a lot of me
but this is true
i'm not asking a lot of me
jane decided only cowards stay while traitors run
that life could be better by being together
on a one horse open sleigh
one horse open sleigh
jingle all the way
a sleighing song tonight
robin laid an egg
and there we got upsot
now the ground is white
o what fun it is to ride
what fun it is to love and sing
but now i'm just a toy
who needs you
i've informed you to leave
do do do do do do do do whoa
do do do do do do do do whoa
it's never enough it's never enough
my time is often decided for me
with no one there to catch me from falling
she's like a baby i'm like a cat
no way would she want it to change me
chorus
her life in a nutshell
late at night when the wires in the walls
a field full of tires that is always on fire
a hydro field cuts through my neighborhood
only you can make importancies into trivialities
as she's washing the dishes
only you can turn my eloquence to banality
hey i'm a cow i'm full of hate
chorus
chorus
the first time it's just me and you
lovers in a dangerous time
when you're lovers in a dangerous time
make my heart fly
stay and make my heart fly
stay and make my heart fly
now that i'm back with you again
everything under the sun
and everyone she questions never seems to know
words music by stephen duffy steven page
we sit and make lists
recycle reuse
everything old is new again
i'm so brave too bad i'm a baby
what if i lost my direction what if i lost sense of time
maybe i lost my direction what if our love is the cost
yeah i'm a farmboy homeboy
i gotta see you in a speedo
on time cause he busta rhymes a hard rhymer
brothers and sisters hey
we got to fight the powers that be
we've got to fight the powers that be
no we're not the same
fight the power
simple and plain
get it lets get this party started right
i wasnt walking hand in hand beside you
snow erasing how i came to be here
for i received a happy ever after
in a locked and guarded vault
an enigma wrapped in a mystery
she took all the love that a poor boy could give her
and left me to die like the fox on the run boy
like the fox like the fox like the fox on the run
because i get stupid i mean outrageous
we sent in the army
and they were blown in half
because you bought our little joke en masse
put a smile on
a new salute is genuflected
did i say that out loud
in the line up you're the one i'm admirin
everywhere i go someone's
everybody everybody
i gotta go see my doctor about this itchy pentagram shaped rash
ahh ahh ahh
i try to take three deep breaths
ahh ahh ahh
everything will be alright if you just lay off
to make you feel so good then tear you apart
go home
before you give it all to her
if you're lucky to be one of the few
to save us all from satans power when we were gone astray
westward leading still proceeding
glorious now behold him arise
govatsos
well andrew govatsos he's our man
he's a fan of barenaked ladies govatsos
i found my locker and i found my classes
this is me in grade nine baby this is me in grade nine
they called me eddie
i owe you my whole life nothing more
where does the time go when it's not around here
at least it's only once a year
making angels on the lawn makin angels on the lawn
carolers are at my door fa la la la etc
happy haunts materialize
come out to socialize
grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
anyone with a half a heart would help me out
anyone with half a heart would help me out
anyone with half a heart would let me fall
until the end of hanukkah of hanukkah
we remember how maccabees
come light the menorah
to remind us of days long ago
to bring the world a daughter or maybe a son
'cause i dont know just who the father is
you wont believe you just wouldnt believe
buried in the din of rotor noise and close explosions
we were back in the jet
an entertaining scandel broke today but i cant move on
another night at the palace
and my mock turtleneck just reeks
the sun didnt shine on barrington street
shoot them down to the ground
and she held me and then she showed me the
picked up the pieces of your car
but it was the consolation prize
end of the road i'm running
friend this shouldnt be the way things end
all right i skim then just to be polite
if good intentions paved the road that gets me through
you dont think i can love you love you love you
then dreidel i will play
it loves to dance and spin
i have a match your face
please go on the paper and fetch me my slippers
perhaps one day a chimp might say
but i read in a book somewhere that his name is jack
our yesterdays are on a loop
everyone falls through time and the funnel it makes
the guests i wont receive
you dont believe me you say all i think about's myself
you've given me a start i aint no doctor
so let's make a family tree
when we go shopping
until we drop
when the going gets rough
way to go even though
ever cold love untold
made of snow i dont know
then i'll market an elixir
your lips to mine if you were here
'cause you were the greatest friend of all
some day i will find the secret
but none as much as my want to be with you
to show you've been blind
and someday you might
i know you're angry
set up my options
thinking they're full of vitamin c
oh could you be the one who will find it
i hope each day you'll find peace and forgiveness
oh how i miss waking up to the sound
there's a spider in my room
it said try pickin on your own damn size
but where does a guy find some room
they repeat on you
and i always forget sometimes y
beat in bodies likes hers and mine
i tend the wheat field that makes your bread
i put you up upon a pedestal so high
i guess you've got better things
in through my veins without brains
and i turn back to blue
i've got so much love to give give me a break
that's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart
i work in the fields all day
all of this corn i grow i grow it all for you
i'm the farmer
if i said something to make you mad
long lines and warning signs
and if i said something to make you mad
any other guy would wanna stir it up some
chorus x2
better than the first time
would i be in the clear
with a bunch of really fast rhymes
chorus
testing 123
when i dared you
god that's dumb
here's a token of my love
there was darkness there was light
they're calling me the man from mars
i see the guy who sails the sky but i think i'd like to live here
it dont matter if you're black or white
you should know that by now
leading complicated lives
there goes a cop car and there goes an eagle
in the momentary lull before the band begins to play
i said where i was but you doubt it because
have you heard the one about the boy
as i walked out i thought about all i had left behind me
you know he's not the kind of man who likes to see the world around him
that i followed you into this shop
well he opens up the curtains at the crack of dawn
everybody knows that happy is the new sad
everything must go and you will have to let her
goodbye
why did you plaster over the hole i punched in the door
this is where we used to live
she loves me and her body keeps me warm
who's in his cups which one of us recovering
and all because i lacked conviction
it takes one to know one
said if that spider were made dead
in its bedroom home got a chance to eat
there's a spider in my room
maybe it's a lack of inspiration that makes me stoop
some other label bought 'em
but some stupid number one hit single has go me in this mess
so they had to use a special computer as my replacement
and now i'm wondering where my friends are in this time of need
everything had changed everything was strange
i hate it now hated it then
everything had changed everything was strange
on christmas day on christmas day
what's so maybe about katie
if you've got a shred of doubt then it's not worth it
chorus x4
chorus
when talk turns to single malts or stilton or
i can tell you i'm sorry but i cant tell you the truth dear
a friend brought me flowers she said they were lilacs
as a matter of fact they are she said
chorus
i have faith in medication
where's my pride where's my self esteem
'cause i cant be bothered
i didnt tell you which way to go
or i never will
it's time to let it go
and now i've paid for you
driving home to be with you
the worst part was hitting the ground
cause tonight is the night i fell asleep at the wheel
in all the confusion there's something serene
you say why does everything i do confound you
but i'm gaining pounds at the precipice of too late
going to be good and i would
she's upset and i want to lick the honey from her navel
she never seems to do what she is told
to herself only
she never seems to do what she is told
i was amazed at just how matter of fact you were
trust me
to let you down
i need you to need me
i dont know where i'm going
my uncle elwyn is tall
change some thingsi change their meanings
i left a tip but it was never a donation
spanning all the ages
i admit the fact i was distracted and outsmarted
and i will not turn my whole life upside down
i make my mind up and i'll never be
deep down in the ground
i've made my mind up
wishing he had the power to make you reappear
and you're the one vanishing
you are vanishing
the music falls
in the dream i refuse to have
always thought we're supposed to feel
but what good is that when you live in hell on earth
hard to admit i fought the war on drugs
we've got these chains that hang around our necks
i go to school i write exams
i couldnt tell you that i was wrong
what a good boy what a smart boy what a strong boy
chorus
i'd gladly swap places if they care to dive
chorus
when you dream
and when it is closed he already knows
yiddish or english
when you dream
so while she's three hundred degrees
tell me what's that for
i count heartbeats
there's a guy who's been awake
there's so much joy in life
the only thing that counts is
there's a guy who's been awake
had it up to here
wind it up
had it up to here
i'm falling in love with you
the blood races through my veins
a wishing well of butterfly tears
a wishing well of butterfly tears
and i cant see
i can kiss your eyes your hair your neck
you say you cant believe how i dont understand
and now we air our laundry on national tv
always tell me things i dont know
pretty soon you will be needing me
we'll find our way to what we're looking for
and we can argue 'till our throats are sore
maybe we should divvy up the things we bought
shall i take back everything i've ever said
shall i take back everything i've ever said
shall i take back all my attacks all of my accusations
maybe you're right
i turn the corner at the traffic light
she doesnt try to impress anyone
she has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
good bye good bye
i am in love with a mcdonald's girl
that i can do anything
i'll give you a hint
got a big chip you want a fat lip
when i'm old and grey
i can be that
i could mow your back yard
i never had to spend a summer planting trees
i think never is enough yeah never is enough
i think never is enough yeah never is enough
so we may not write the songs we sing
well i got up to the counter and the lady there just laughed
and 'though i may not be johann sebastian back
comfort in community obliterated
oh well
in photo one a flower
each frame captures the various subtleties of black
in photo three is my dog in the backyard
but he was only wanting you to
make him eat his words right off the hook
eat his words cause
hey pass the ball
i need to think
only one
see i know i'm lost and lonely see i know i'm lost and lonely
yesterday you'd forgiven me
bert kaempfert's got the mad hits
trying hard not to smile though i feel bad
it's been three days since the afternoon
like snickers guaranteed to satisfy
how can i help it if i think you're funny when you're mad
three days since the living room
peterborough and the kawarthas
peterborough and the kawarthas
let my leaving leave like rain
it's the perfect time of year
t this is tyler stewart
to throw all your cares away
t hello hi h hello if you just would you could could you please leave a m ah if you'd just let me leave a at the sound of the uh ah thanks
on an evening such as this
try to see the world beyond your front door
with every word i choose
your senses sacked
i couldnt love you more
i couldnt love you more
run run run run run away
qu'est ce que c'est
je me lance vers la gloire okay
run run run run run away
for me
i hung with the stars there
my quality biology
rubbing my cow there
is studied in theology
who is this holding my umbrella
why cant i call you on the phone
take off to the great white north
did you say my name with a sigh
roadrunner if he catches you you're through
if he catches you you're through
in love with love
i need to love you 'til you dont exist
how could it happen when we couldnt lose
one for all is fair in love and war
i wished that it was me
and listen for a while
perhaps a bit surprised
you used to tell me things
give a guy a break
do i
i filled a plastic bag
i'm running out of ink
what does it mean to wake out of a dream and be
must've been the same thing
must've been the same
my weathered veins
second best several times
second best several times
and in the mist our hero stands
an offer and a pilot drew him west
the casting agent called to say
and vaguely celtic music fills the air
distracts us while the actor takes the stand
with money from mowing lawns
good for you
making room for something new
good for me serendipity
rolled over got a kiss on the ear
she's on time
we cant stop when all our systems are go
one day i might look like a fool
she's on time she's on time
but not this time not this time
that's because it's true yes it's true
curl up and die just because of you
got what i want and that's rid of you
drove downtown in the rain nine thirty on a tuesday night
chorus
wondering where the hell all the love has gone
somebody help me because i'm
and everything you cant afford to be
i'm the shadow of every doubt
and see my face for the horns
i've been burned and with both feet on the ground
now i'm finding out that it's so confusing
and if you call i will answer
and if you call i will answer
and if you fall i'll pick you up
you and i were meant to be
when all you have to do is calmly
if it isnt one thing then
i wont judge and i wont tell
it's not just fashion oh really
i couldnt care less why was fonzie cool
i couldnt care less do zoodles need a trained zookeeper
i'm gonna be a hero
i wont look out the window
lay down your art
all that's left of me is my celebrity
and hold that smile
ahhhh
the angels got together
close to you
there comes a time there comes a time
standing next to you i feel hopeless and you know this
and we have to or we'll end up in the bath
have a nice day
see this white band around my neck it's nice
and all night fred was yakking up red wine
cause guys with nicknames always get the gals
i couldnt care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
i am crazy just like you
i've lost my marbles
i am crazy just like you
young crosby stills nash and young crosby
and lose the makeup
mix it all up you're the all purpose flour
when there's no one else above you
when you dont know what it's worth
i just end up feeling bad for you
you've forgotten what you're hiding for
easy to obey
you make it easy easy
there's no union
absurd though it may seem you know i've heard there's even been illegal doping
you look at yourself
it may be tough to swallow but our threats are far from hollow
enid
maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
enid i remember you
and it's not fair to say that it's 'cause
but i dont want to
to make crazy things out of play doh
looking for my place
duck dont look now company missiles
hell yes
perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
hell yes
self conscious and a little bit moody
oh oh oh oh oh oh
she's got tofu the size of texas
corrupted files from galactical planets
hits you with its rhythm
one thousand beats per minute
gasoline on fire
go to chain store victims
one thousand beats per minute
coming down
choking like a one man dustbowl
winos throwing frisbees at the sun
oh yeah
winos throwing frisbees at the sun

into a void we filled with death
i'm making my move
like you did it before
put the elevator music on
gutbucket and a bottle of paint
in the washin machine
forgettin what's on their mind
the fly on the wall
got my hand like a mirror
now hold your hand onto the plow
round your bed
me for my farewell ride some may say this might be
your last farewell ride
hey hey hey hey
fuckin with my head
oooh
no no no no
round the roses
take her where her soul belongs
white noise her ears are ringing
i'm comin over
with a ring and a question
down where your daddy was workin
we're out of patience
no complaints
we feel painless
keep on talking like a novacane hurricane
test tube still born and dazed
lightblue robot making a sandbox
tonight the city is full of morgues
as he's dancing upon your paycheck
the insects are huge
i pay no mind
qu onda guero
soccer ball instant replays mango ladies
ay wey qu onda tj cowboys hang around
andelay joto your popsicles melting
you've been so long
flypaper towns
nowhere we know
you're suiting yourself
where the lowest low is calling to me
empty boxes in a pawn shop brain
in the next life
clappin along
pick me up
with the burnin waves
i'll be home
i'm walkin to the other side
all alone by a barren well
crows are pullin at my clothes
if i said to you that i was looking for a place to get to
matchsticks strike when i'm riding my bike to the depot
ahhhowwww
taking heart out of the shell
throw it away
i got lost downtown
should have burnt my uniform
i'm gonna take it all back
whistlin dixie with the dixie cup filled
black cat wrapped in the road map to hell
and i aint gonna work
and the women all runnin around
the trees are fake the air is dead
now she kisses her own hand
all the riches and the ruins
strange apparition
did you think that you were lucky
pocket full of blood
and i found it on a screamin
i wanna climb up on the rug
dancin on the mound
like a break in the clouds and the first ray of sun
till the moment arrives
only then do you know you're in love
highrise eyes see for you
a wife of a poisonous tongue
pink eyes looking to the food of the ages
she's alone in the new pollution
she doesnt know what happens when she's around
i think i'm in love
take a little picture in a photobooth
whisperin her love through a smoke ring smile
i'm totally confusedby you
screamin in my face whisper in my ear
you're a fucking drunk
backwards creep
truck drivin neighbours downstairs
oh my goodness
bring it down one more time
desert terrain and the wayward plain
doo doo doo doo doo doo
crashed
darker
thought i saw a ghost
darker
two turntables and a microphone
take me home in my elevator bones
i got two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone
a place we saw the lights turn low
one more time
comin back from the convalescent home
lay it on to the dawn
saying everything is groovy
anything you want is yours now
high 5 high 5
'round and round with the speed of sound
beers and chairs no frontiers
turn that shit off man what's wrong with you
ok now do like designer jeans
they know it's
she's ridin a landslide down to me
it takes a backwash man to sing a backwash song
translation i'm a broken record i have bubblegum in my brain
jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease
and you got the hotwax residues
translation i'm a broken record i have bubblegum in my brain
when i wake up someone will sweep up my lazy bones
i dont want no cryin
when i get my money
i dont want no cryin
your senses are gone so dont you hesitate
throwing your two bit cares down the drain
with the plastic eyeballs spray paint the vegetables
so shave your face with some mace in the dark
'cuz one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
soy un perdedor
soy un perdedor
i'm a loser baby so why dont you kill me
doin the latenight run
there was a warrant out on me
called up some girls
and we stopped into the 7 11 to try our luck
and three big macs to go
the last survivor of a boiled crap
when the cup is filled you can run and be killed
it's a sensation
down a dirt road to find you
and wash me down the gutter
current turns on a lifeboat floating
something always missing always
we're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
the lord will take his motorcade
telling me everything's gonna be ok
running on a plane
somebody's calling
i'm not scared
hey mr asshole
total paranoia
everyone's out to get you motherfucker
oh it's nausea oh nausea
who could see his own reflection
i eat alone in the desert
a chain link wind
and he swaggered off walked past the window and down the stairs and then at the bottom
night living there's a lot of squirrels and birds and stuart says he's seen about nine
he just got up and walked off into the mist and didnt say anything the first few times
thought he probably liked the fact that we were living there because he came round so
and you're filling your fat face with every different kind of cake
i'm sorry but i've got some things to do
and my face is scarred
another century of fakers
but what if i got there and it was light all civilised and populated and stuff
winter in springtime
is all i have to show for
seven weeks of river walkways
she couldnt tell if it was a man or woman
i wish that i could sing
her worries make everything else seem trivial
i'm in senior year
a demon at maths and science
i put on my headphones
'not today just the choir from the radio'
what would i do to believe'
we're playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
i heard the eskimos remove obstructions with tongues dear
she lay in bed all night watching the colours change into green and gold
beautiful only slightly mental
there'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
she mad herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
he wants to love and he wants to care
he would never be young again
for belle and the boy sebastian
belle was ok but oh sebastian
joseph was travelling with a heavy load
feeding our counsel and true comfort give
call my girl on the phone
met the indie cool queen
1 like the tone of her voice
are you talking to me
why is this happening to you you're not a child
dirty dream number two
written for you
on the river bridge to me a vision was shown
it's not all she said
let's hang about
i know you will forgive me for my honesty
you're made of card
we nearly signed it with our blood
they act so discreet they are hypocrites so fuck them too
i've got a boyfriend i've got a feeling that he's seeing someone else
and i will frame this moment in time
on a pale blue morning
for some small flicker of the truth
i could see the house where you gave
go outside where there's someone watching cars go by
you'll be known as the boy who's always dancing
tell your mum what to expect she says it's right out of the blue
while your cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt
tell veronica the secrets of the boy you never kissed
for somebody just like me
than be me in a cage
we do chemistry biology and maths
if my family tree goes back to napolean
11 there is too much love
can cause offence just by the way i look
that's not a fault of mine these days
she had several hours to find a place to stay
she just wants to be accepted in this place
pushed back her fringe see her birthmark
you're the one i'm talking to
but i dont get disapproving from my girl
i had a conversation with you at night
you are the cover of my magazine
think of it this way
after a while they always get it
has set my mind to wander
mission impossible
or just your boyfriend
you're not listening
not even christmas
it's to be alone
i fought in a war and i left my friends behind me
before i found out that the sickness there ahead of me
i can see hope i can see light
and your kitchen looks like hell
full of silicon chips
the denim hard riff of the irish troubadour
when they all leave you standing alone
are you talking to yourself
you ignore it and go softly to sleep
do you know what they are
and a fag in the morning with her special k
the things he says
now he's really happy yeah
i dont care wherever she came from
well if i remain passive and you just want to cuddle
you're kissing your elbow
we lay on the bed there
seymour stein i've been lonely
1 think she's going to stay
before he went electronic
i think that i could help her out
where the boys go with boys and the girls with girls
she knows she's losing it oh yeah she's losing it
subtle as the wind is grey
young boy sigh
read the letter you got from the memory girl
where you wanted to help it's a bit of a waste
in a back room
what i tell myself to do
listen johnny
i am a man filled with longing desire
wheel of fortune spins
i was waiting at the church door
with a quiver of your eyelid
but what about me
i'm not sure about her motives
but what about me
i was miles from tenderness
i'm going to need two lives
and she works all night
i had to leave them in the morning
and i call her string bean jean because the label on her jeans says
they said she hadnt done this she hadnt done that
she said 'be my photo bitch and i'll make you rich'
with the winter coming on and the attic cold
second to think what to do
you left us to rot
night after day after night i've been working
and observe the melee
shop lifting just drifting
if the malady dont go away we're in a little trouble
baby i love your face
here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
hang your head in shame and cry your life away
i would do it all the time
if somebody sings along i will be happy now
then i compare notes with your older sister
you were laid on your back
with his racist clientele
and sets off the smoke alarm
she'll give me a place
to take the test i'm feeling sick
a few were idiots they were a really good laugh
cause the word out on the street is you are starving
what do they know anyway
at least not anymore
second to dying to
nobody was really saying anything of interest she fell asleep
how and why and when and where to go
look at me i'm on tv
if you stayed and played with yourself
i think i'm waking up to us
the beauty of the world surrounding her
i helped the kid survive
i cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
skipping tickets making rhymes
even though you could be sick at any time
or is there someone else instead
she had a stroke at the age of 24
it could have been a brilliant career
well i like her too
i know you dont want it this way
i know she likes you
i want you to know
you and her in the local newspaper
she gave herself to being number one
we can kiss and whatever you want
walking the street from morning to night
putting a poster up
on the first bus out of town
you will have a boy tonight
about a dose of thrush you got while you were licking railings
you will have a boy tonight
reading judy blume
the heartless swine
i nearly went too far
l o v e love it's coming back it's coming back
l o v e love it's coming back it's coming back
lisa's kissing men like a long walk home
pure easy listening settle down
yeah you're worth the trouble and you're worth the pain
tenderly you turn the light off in your room
'cause here they come again
just take it in the guts it could get worse
why dont you realise it doesnt pay
you'll leave two fingers in the air
she spoke in dialect i could not understand
from the view i saw today
left alone with marx and engels for a while
mary jo living alone
well who could blame her if she's sleeping
it's someone else's turn to take a fall
a pity that it never seems to work the way you see it
keep me company till she comes again
keep me company till she comes around
you sent the boys and girls away
get on the same train and he wants to talk
we're the younger generation we grew up fast
along the pavement and comes back again oh yeah
he knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and i
i think of you
i love the exquisite array
came down between us lately
irrelevant fame
does that mean that i'm getting boring
in the mirror of my steamy bathroom
a spooky witch in a sexy dress has been bugging me
the girl smells of milk
the fall manfred mann
and maybe when we wake up in the morning
maybe when the darkness starts to fade
again
it's the wonder of the businessmans conspiracy to sell you wares no one cares
i like the stage i've seen it now
because you made me think about the times
because i didnt think about the message
because it's needing badly taken in
but it's a funny way for you to tell me
hey people looking out the window full of fun and sorrow
the rollercoaster ride
you're watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the class
they never know it
you liberated
and feel the city air
to get her into college
from my crippled friend
there was a pregnant pause before he said ok
now i'm feeling dangerous riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
the wrong hand to be holding
i feel like dancing on my own
there's too much love to go around these days
she tried to flag down an aeroplane
she walked out to the edge of town
i'm not as clever as mark twain
we're not terrific but we're competent
well my heart has fallen down
you could call it work if you count the band
all the way back home
if there's a place i want to go
keeping the sun out of my eyes
and streetlights stretch for miles
people look at us cause they see us all the time
over tea and gin we talked about the things we read
was she bored or pushed
on a bus stop in the town
you know the world is made for men
you were chained to a girl that would kill you with a look
you got spit in your chin
things were ok till you took out the copper'
she must be nearly freezing
who's that star i cast
i watch her wave to me
there's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here
she said she'd had enough of playing games
are you coming or are you not
when i woke up to you sleeping
he didnt care
will always pay a shitty wage
you're just a baby baby girl
so what's the score
and i wont be there to see you go off you're head
i love my car
i've got a tongue like a little slug
how will i get there
all that i want is a photograph of photo jenny
everyone thinks she's really ugly
i'll be fine
it's a crime
before i hang upon your shoulder and cry
but not the dog i was
now they'll sleep on lies
stand like you did when i was beauty marked in your eyes
to move the river
so now it goes by my house

try not to think about it alice childress
they give no fuck
just as long as there's enough for them
they give no
was it always the same
shadows pass her by and out of sight
the same
just the same as the last time
it was only fifteen grand spent in bed
and hung my head in shame
'cause my peers they criticize me
i think i see a fly fisher
you make me feel
you make me feel so
now i realize your just like a dog
so why you gotta act like you know when you dont know
they get nostalgic about the last ten years
the whiz man never fit him the whiz kid did
it sucks me in it sucks it works
that you would change
why dont we pitch it to the franklin fucking mint
of who could care less
to lose my southern accent
i've people to entertain
trying to be for you what you wanna see
yes it's uncanny to see
or even man no longer satisfactory lover
you lie in yours you lie you lie in yours
you would have thought i'd scorned them all
you would have thought i'd scorned them all
tighter than a mutharfuckin gangsta beats
bitches cant hang with the streets
so i figure niggas wouldnt trip with mine
some muthafuckin chin checkin
lick on these nuts and suck the dick
i didnt give a fuck where the bitch was at
bitches cant hang with the streets
lost the fight for my eyes
boxing's been good to me howard
the whole time we knew
couldnt you at least have written me a good one
'cuz you dont edit anything it just comes out
she's brainwashed you family
she is balled up on the couch
they call her name at 730
she's a brick and i'm drowning slowly
now i know it
you find something to lose
a box of candy
oh no
smoke in your hair
and i've
like i care
smoke in your hair
she worried it might come to life
and she's different when it's just me and her and i
you could have done anything
carrying a box through the rain
in a stooper from the drugs that didnt even
four three two one
if you read that story too
ohhhhh aah
saying shit that dont sound too cool
cool whip
there's a thing i could get off of my chest
cause i
so wont you brush my fears away
want to wear the path that's true
haha that's not normal way to answer your phone
sometimes i get the feeling
'cause there was nothing left
in fact
i'll see you on the other side
all i know is i've gotta be
deck my back with pins
i cant stop my mind
all my joints and bones
we've come to see ya
there you are with aunt louise
you sure had a hell of a time
you never had a son or a wife
and we may pack a little tight
remember all those trees behind the garden
it's just the whole thing shook her up
and our football team
or i could just keep on moving on moving on moving on moving on
please bury me in effington
i want to die there too
does she know what they're saying
dont wanna walk away from emaline
dont let me walk away from emaline
now i've heard enough i'll tell you what
god damn i look like a tool when he goes running around
just bring him here
feeling hung over and old
godwhat have i done
i poured my heart out
they think i've lost my mind
and the clouds came tumbling down
and in a way
so come pick me up
it's ok to call
i played a thousand times before
and some dirty basketball
things were looking up
but it's too late
i know that you're in there
like any day
i'm not saying the effort is a waste of time but i
sometimes
while the world is watching
she's my everything
she's sitting here beside me then she is gone
i am mesmerised
losing lisa
goodnight goodnight
the rain had me chilled to the bones
from the back of your big brown eyes
free from the life that you knew
smiled in my room
all the untested virtue
i have made the same mistakes
all alone as i've learned to be
she doesnt know he wasnt meant for this
i'm missing the war all night
i'm missing the war
and it's just like mitchell lane everything's the same
i know you dont
but something in me does i swear
i go to sleep
and after all your friends went home
to it
they come knocking at your door with this look in their eyes
inches high
check your papers and your tv
rather than kiss me you said
and check out the reflections in my eyes
keeps me walking when i'm falling down
and that's why my philosophy
and you forget the speech that moved the stone
talked and never spoke a word
and every time i turn to see it goes
so you dont think about the big things for a while
alone
i will protect myself from you
and i guess i will protect myself from you
and i guess i will protect myself from you
i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade
regrets regrets
but just for a day
they know they're safe with me
i got to stand here two more hours till i
yeah
how long must this day go on
let me tell y'all what it's like
just like michael jackson did
i dont know how much i can take
i pull up to the stop light
i just drove to the store
it gets me real pssed off it makes me wanna say
these days
we were in a park
is it your imagination
told me rocky was a runner
now it's rocky's day
now it's rocky's day
and sometimes i think
you remain selfless cold and
get out of my sight
you never cared
i used to be a sentimental guy
people talkin and i'm watching
she says everywhere i go damn there i am
wont you let me walk away this time
every one of you is oh oh oh oh
he's worked at the paper
you get off someone else can get on
he turns off the slides and it doesnt look right
squinted up at the sky
and when i was broke i needed it more
now they save me my place
you've broken the code
but you soiled my obsession
get your hands
than i love you
you'd settle for me yeah eventually
at least most of the time
give judy my notice
and i will consider you gone
since you've gone
yeah and i will consider you gone
gracie girl
and there will always be a part of me
broken bones and bruises daddy brought the ball this far
world war ii vietnam
oh oh oh
maybe it was the course of adrenaline
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
yesterday i got so old i felt like i could die
and i know it was wrong
no other way
in between
go on
and i wont be able to bring it home
messed up my brother's mind
and i got jackson cannery
he says stop the bus
jane be jane
anything at all inside
you've had it harder than anyone could know
out the gate you go and never stop
jesusland
and the sun goin down
a longer walk
being awake never felt so clear and
guess that i was innocent too
she gave me credit for the things that i've never been
there was a time almost forgot we had been drifting all the way to kalamazoo
up to the sky
oh ihave you got nothing to say
everyday she wars the same thing
she hands out the
i want my money back and dont forget
i want my money back
while i try to find words as light as the birds
destiny was calling
the girls dont understand it
i know you make me sick
just in case by tomorrow
everyone knows now
lost points with the ladies
and forgotten
it hurts to grow up
maybe we'll both sit down and have a few beers
let me tell you what
everybody knows
i must give the impression
and i only wanted to be me
do you read what they're saying about you
and you wonder why your father was so resigned
and now watch it all go down
tread slowly from the car to the spa
rock on rock on spread the love around
rock on rock on spread the love around
now we know who's been fucking the guru
i wouldnt have to be so mean
and the day is rising
he said well i hate that it's come to this
and i know
i see one pair that i recognize
and passed away
it's time for the ultimate sacrifice
it's too late it's too late
they're into something that is too big to be
to find the human inside
oh there's always someone cooler than you
hesitate
life is wonderful
hesitate
but there's always someone cooler than you
my lady
things i've said
band against the enemy
in time i will fade away
everybody here knows the story
and you could here a pin drop on the carpet floor
but i'm disappointed in you
picking up astral signals
she's pulled all the blankets over
didnt you know we're as close as we can be
before i got too old
the voice of 50 years experience
with uncle walter
he and his oldest boy blair
if he were president now
how could you leave me here so long
show me the mosh pit
she gave a smile but i was shy
did life bring you down here
you been kicked around
we can we can we can be
but as i'm growing older i'm bored
you'll pout in stereo
we dont think that way no more
we're counting the days down
they're asking where ya been like i know
they're holding hands
that we could be together for
you could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
yeah sure trace and memorize
if i'm the person that you think i am ah ah ahh
you dont know me
you dont know me
ah ah ah ah ah
kids piled high our moms and dads shook hands
and our moms and dads not a clue to be had
with our tattoos that looked like rings
roots
je suis american
on a peavea amp in 1984
la da da da la da da la da da
she saw the lights she saw the pale english face
and he stumbled through
but then
like you got rid of me
that he'd gotten all he'd
kylie is calling from connecticut
it says kylie is calling from connecticut
throw this book away
never really lived
here's the time we didnt speak
those who say the past is not dead
i play my music louder than you'd like me to
you say that maybe we should take some time apart
well i could be wrong i dont even know myself
let you get you in
aw yeah alright truth hurts inside
we sit around the house
everybody wants to be your friend
when you quit work
everybody loves a situation
graduation day
on the hood of the car
felt like a lifetime
and i know i wasnt right
and talking in rhymes
swear i could hear the sea
and three and a half minutes
all the way from south dakota
shame shame
devoured
gulf breeze on the porch
now when they held up a bank in mobile
me and my honey rocking back and forth
i want you to promise me
get a little closer
mississippi river running over me
smoking on your cigarette
all that wasted talent but uh
but least of all the answer
someone left the night before
and the parsons audit course
come up higher take a step higher
she was a midwestern prom queen
to go her way
now he's working at denny's
i'm a bit patriot
when everything was simple and free
anywhere but here
and count the headlights passing on the road
when you're far away
and here you are
we are your beautiful mistake
no dont say a word
back from the edge of time
come now running headlong
when you feel the world is crashing
so good to hear your laugh
breathless
to your embrace
only alive
and the moon lights the night
in time
you are planning your deception
i could give you one good reason
through the shadows in the hallway
closer than this life
even closer than this life
holding out for something less
closer than this life
all the way to tucumcari and santa fe seems
to chorus
and you held her so tight
and trace the moon
bridge
and this picture's old
you're a long walk in a rain storm
like a knife
with a lifeline
i need you finally i confess
and you're feeling old
where they turned out your lights
they say the worst is over
baby burst in the world
and falling a step behind
because i was born incomplete
someone said someone wrote
in a cynical time in you i find
but getting thinner by the hour
is stay till early in the morning
cumba lada vista
and all i've got to say yeah
is your love's extra ordinary
like a green leprachaun
i hit a new kind of low
i still remember you dressed in grey
you said we're burning out at both ends
dont mean a thing just lock your doors
in 3 5 you're on the streets again
i cant feel a thing
i am bending
life made rookies of us all
when your worlds on fire
in our finest year
dont look down
you were holding my hand when the car
saying wasnt it just like swimming
a movie star a poet at a nobel seminar
and what ever happened to the things you loved the songs we played
out on the lake
i feel strange
overcome
i feel strange
in a country fair or union square i implore you
particle
just the other day i felt we could be everything
do you even care
you come walking like someboby's lover
you wont be here if i were unwilling
we both want the same thing
the ugly one replied
then she smiled and said forgive me
we cant hear you're on the list now
i was horrified to find
you come a pleading but it's too late
digging in los cruces
stanton harry dean
so play it all over
turn it wide
now there is nothing but a
how'd you get so low
she said
to never mind the rent
how'd you get so low
and we're rolling
and we're rolling
you say no no no the fighting has left you tired
this one could be your last
and jealousy can turn a hand into a fist
big plans
the best that you can do
the best that we can do
we all did
i wrote a simple rhyme
the love you fake the heart you break
you always said you'd never go away
could you really be a bitch like that
the life you live
god knows i apologize
white light
well i want a southern girl
chorus
well i want a southern girl
you found this city has you on your back
sunlight through the trees
take back the night claim your desire
are you real or just a dream
i was lost and i found you
so regretful how could i ever be so blind
your light your heat
you're speeding up
if they call you out
you said we'd understand
you better best take care keep one hand to your ear
it's still life with cooley
where did she sleep when the morning came
listen to them fight
they dont see
because they know what you're going through
it comes down on you
and if it tastes fine drink
the lights go down
well there's a feeling in the air
you think about the good times
seems like it's always understood
just like a friday afternoon
and you live with all the bad
a hollywood flat where we'd laugh about our fortunes
restaurant from a taxi cab passing
a cold water flat
your dreams and your schemes
but i see you there
ceiling fan
as it starts to rain again fall away
find a place along the way
well maybe i'm just too sure
watching the sun trace shadows on the floor
aha it was good living with you
the bedroom is a mess
ah how wonderful you are
summering out on the cape
and though you will say i'm wrong
you're ready at last to begin
play on play on
and if you said i would go to heaven
now maybe i'll try
and if you said i would go to heaven
and the lives they made
sits inside
i was watching the days go by
left behind
but i dont think so
three different souls and the lives they made
shot out the stars
down way low
for everything i've done
make me a believer pick up the receiver
to hope you could agree
someone out there's
and tell me you feel just like i do
and that's the reason that i'm
too many lost
and that's the reason that i'm asking
you hide it but you never should
i'm only happy when you're down on me
dont fight it if it feels good
dont fight it girl
a quiet stream
just another scene in mona's dream
worn on the edges
worn out in juarez

people walked right by and said aloud
he's going down again
so set him up

she can move you
but you glow
hurt me
i didnt mean to worry you
i didnt mean to trouble you

and the sun is burning bright

blood to drink
it's all the same
through silent seas of sand
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face

vr hell h e r o i n forever
a black hole there where love was once the
chorus
it's a move to take you through
wow babe you know where i'll be when that
there's a hole in the wall
'cause when a long legged lovely walks by
dont be no fun dont forget you're young
i'm a walkin 'til my brain pops

in the crowded lonely night
and there's every type of girl
oh dancing with myself
'cause it'll give me time to think
if i had the chance
seem to pass me by
i'd ask the world to dance
what it takes
can almost hear her breath
i dont know why
play the guitar and sing the blues and cry
for lady do or die
so hard to be hip
dont go out tonight
till the end
to many sing marks on her hearts
she's shooting stars
i was scared to ask you out
sitting there our toes all muddy
but the best ones that i've has
thinking i could do this forever
man that was a good day
to give it to you and make you mine
now i'm a brand new man branded with the thought of you
that little tiny gage said it's that time
it's a pain in my gas
who's to blame for all my sorrow
there seems to be a real pain in my gas
they wont be reaching out for you no more
or tell your aunt louise tell anything you please
words dont come easy from a mans broken heart
i'm sick of fetchin and sleepin in the rain
the pack you found me with was bayin at the moon
i get off the interstate fifteen minutes late
all i'm thinkin bout is you
it's bumper to bumper and it's rainin buckets down
he said you see two old people but somethin down deep inside
and baby every kiss we kiss still feels like it's the first
you're like the sun in a clear morning sky
that saved a wretch like me
when we've been there
oh but now i'm found
to say i miss you more than ever and to promise you this
but they say this thing is finally coming to an end
next to his medal and a flag that she would gladly give back
i should be feelin like a king
i know just what i need
still dont fill the empty spaces
to southern is so sweet
and find my way back to you and me
and you my brown eyed girl
sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
with you my brown eyed girl
sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
burn down the trailer park
i've got a strong suspicion she's at it again
saying daddy could we play a little one on one
you got responsibilities
you got to go got to run
there's a call one day from the office
in that schedule that you keep
you were always there when i looked back
dont you worry hold on tight
butterfly fly away
and then he bowed his head to pray call me dad
another life has come and gone another baby's grown
he said the preacher asked for objections and he thought about standing up
well i know how it feels cause my eyes grow dim
nascar and earnhart still miss number three
i hear all this talk about time for a chance
i've been goo goo ga ga since the day we met
this aint your ordinary schoolboy crush
when the sun goes down and you're next to me
guitar
yeah get down on my knees
there's a world out there
have i been missin all the things
crops are bendin in the heat but still her dark skin shivers
she's just dreamin in color livin in black and white
he aint about to let the blues overcome him
dreamin in color livin in black and white
enough hurt has been hidden enough blood has been bled
guitar
your kisses send an arctic chill over me
there was no mothers open arms
father time stole her life away
nobody's nobody again
let's take one last drive just one last time
by then i'll be like a stranger baby
made music in tennessee
only god could stop me loving you
who gave me love strong enough to call my own
now it's time to make it clear do you still want me here
there's a land that i heard of once
that's where you'll find me
if happy little bluebirds fly
somebody's tryin to tell you they love you patsy come home
you see it's getting late
if you want the world to know
put a little love in your heart
put a little love in your heart
whatever they are
she's waitin on my blessings before she hits that
this is where i dont say what i want so bad to say
baby get ready
get set
when i see something that i dont like
everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
slow down you're gonna crash
but you cant say it 'round here
got my pedal to the metal got my hands in the air
and i dont know what to do
or is there just no use
the world needs rockin and i aint stoppin till it's done
we cranked it up till the wall came down
you dont ask i dont do
run run rudolph santas gotta make it to town
said santa to a girl child what would please you most to get
run run rudolph
well it was nothin like that rainy night
right then she turned and introduced me
she just smiled and didnt say the things
not only she dont love me
i guess she's really doin well now she's picked herself up off the ground
i was heartless and cold whatever i'd go i shot down every young girl i found
shot full of love shot full of love
and my heart says i should stay but my mind says i should go
and my heart still feels the same and will forever
take me away and turn back the years
few folks even knew his name
for the red white and blue
who stood the ground and took the fall
think of all your liberties and recall
i cant forget the look in his eyes or the tears he cried
to help their fellow man
has never ever loved the way that i have loved you
i hope you never find somebody new
somebody finally found someone who really cares
somebody said a prayer somebody had some faith
somebody somebody said a prayer
guitar
whistling through the willow trees
and the soft touch of your fingertips
the past and the love we found just will not let me go
man it's flying by
boys and phones and every change in moods
i know i know it seems so slow
you look in the mirror there's gray in your hair
it's a line of cars parked on a hill
enjoy the ride
wanderin ghosts you made my tribe and my bride
you trap her power and her glory in your company funds
unless you really wanna know dont ask geronimo
what good is a heart not loving
you see the little moments everywhere
what good is that smile you're smiling
what good is that smile you're smiling
i gave two teeth in a teenage brawl
and i gave my soul to jesus at the age of twenty two
i give all my money
is this broken heart
bridge
well the note said mrs johnson you're wearin your dresses way too high
and mrs taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
the day her mama socket it to the harper valley pta
and i know one does
you'd know he's mine yeah he is
for thinkin that cheap shot our little kicker
the best thing that ever happened to me
it just goes on and on and on
chorus
she grew up somehow
i left a message on your code a phone
hey elvis wontcha come back soon
nobody ever done it quite like you
but his mem'ry hasnt moved
and my love's not strong enough
'cause it feels like the sky is falling down
when the whole world's gone insane
chorus
to the way that i feel right now
there'll be another day we'll have another chance
this is just a business call it wont take no time at all
when you walked in and turned my world around
you wouldnt want me to miss my flight not out of mind but out of sight
and i aint even left and it already dont feel right
i am here now you were there then
i'm a fool but what the heck
i've been searching all my life
i cant live without your love
what i'm feeling in my soul
and be the change you wanna see
stand just reach deep inside you
are you ready to
stand
stand
stand
is there some secret you aint articulating
i'm gettin tired of this game of tom and jerry
down in the hills of old tenntucky
heard the call of a whippoorwill
every mother was supposed to look like donna reed
as long as there's a god above keep prayin we never wake up
my life story
chorus
would change our life
chorus
and i swear
the beginning
somethings just aint the same
hes thinks of all he'd done today
somethings just never change
oh i've heard about the streets of gold
the sun will shine forever
and the light surrounds your very soul
the pearly gates will open
where dreams are make believe and love can really last
one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
and what she knows you aint had time to learn
it's gotten crazy i dont understand how can love get so out of hand
you build me up just to tear me down
join the club you've paid your dues
cause what goes up must come down
but she's around that age her first memories are made
another day is winding down
feels like
i've been holding back words and waiting for time
now i know it's time for letting go
but i fall apart and then i walk away
but i dont know where to start
help me to just hold on
so i walk in grace 'cause i've seen your face
but i dont know where to start
oh i'm begging you please
sax
too many times you were left cold for oh so many years
and let them soar like eagles across the trail of tears
never thinkin bout thinkin like your fool again
truth is i lied
and see what's under the hood
you better look real good and see what's under the hood
more than life
i just wanna love you
let me be your joe
love you with all that i am
we the people move it we the people know
we the people move it
we've got a dream or two running through our heads
run around in circles
chorus
we'll get old and maybe go to bed by ten
what else is there
what'll you think about me when i'm gone
i knew our road was gettin kinda rocky
where'm i gonna live when i get home
sometimes i think of you and i dont know what to do
i hear your footsteps down the hall
it smelled like old leather as smooth as a child
how you said you still cared but that we were through
he's halfin his sandwich his chips and baby ruth
boy say's
finds a cell phone on the backseat
now he's layin in that hospital bed prayin a silent prayer
i know you've seen all your dreams turn to dust
you wont be lonely now
when you're down and troubled
and i'll be there yes i'll be there
winter spring summer or fall
i'll come running to see you again
that i'm willing to die for this angel at rest
when i see the world that we're in at it's worst
somebody's out there
maybe i'm not to certain on what i need
yeah baby i could be your number one
that'ya need to set you free
we need'a be
cause i'd built a wall around my heart that no one could get through
i never meant to hurt you girl i was afraid to fall in love
but the bible said
and pray for gods will
and when i'm at the crossroads
how much do you love me
broken hearted
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
i swear i could eat you up
baby i luv ya
just what you are
but i know you now
and i didnt see you catch peter's hand
crying as you prayed
and how i needed your forgiveness to be saved
i didnt mean what i said
bridge
i'll fight for you 'til the very end
i want my mullet back
back back
my ol camero an my eight track
i want my mullet back
please dont ask me to let go or make me give up
ask me i'll be there whenever you fall
all night long
you're such a rock star
god only knows where i might be
god only knows where i might be
i'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here
i turn on my radio they play your favorite song
one day i found a note beside the ring she left behind
say you love her strong and true
it's the first time i reach out for you but you're not there to find
there's a church on the corner in a harbor town
worst storm you ever did see
there's a church on the corner in a harbor town
love needs no space or time
best be foldin my hands for one more chance
is put your heart and soul into loving me
they only tighten this knot deep inside
why did you have to go
till times standing still
all my tomorrows are with you today
you are my everything
ever since you made me leave cant remember wrong or right
i'm gonna need a little help
the pain begins to eat your pride
but you're only looking for today
front page news but so abused
you feel you want to die
i found out what it means to be believed
belies the fate of those who never ran
and now it's your concern
and live for every breath
would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope do you think he's a fool
and say that you may as well worship the sun
she sits in silence in her midnight world
and now she dances only in her dreams
since he passed the motion they're building in the ocean
he's had enough of sticking to the rules alright
not tonight well i might oh alright yeah
if i dont sound very cheerful i think that i'm a schizo brain
playing my music sitting in my hotel room
'cause i'm a back street rocker and i will be till the day i die
feel your spirit rise with the breeze
precious cups within the flower
take your walk of remorse
what is this that stands before me
is it the end my friend
i feel unhappy
we shared the eve's
it took so long
revolution in their mind the children start to march
so you children of the world listen to what i say
illusion helps to keep them sane
they dont know what i hide
if i could find one then everything would be alright
gotta be good 'cause then everything will be ok
burning globe of oxy'n fire like electric funeral pyre
supernatural king takes earth under his wing
you want me to claim that child you bore
do you whish that you could see me dead
yeah i saw it i saw it i tell you no lies
fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
like the feeling you have
with eyes of fire that were burning my soul
so you wanna be a gypsy come on now
so you wanna be a gypsy come on now
oh you you know you must be blind
but that wont last
holes are in your skin caused by deadly pin
has it gone
carry your own load
nightime falling victim to the dawn
and look to the future `cause life goes together now
i'm living free because the rent's never due
window in time through it i fly
back on earth the flame of life burns low
through the empires of eternal void
leave the earth to satan and his slaves
we'll just pass him there
now the time is here
running as fast as they can
that's it's alright yes it's alright
he's the meanest guy around his town
one look and he will cut you down
and he aint gonna change it no way
who's fool are you
when it is time to say goodbye
when it is time to say goodbye
when it is time to say goodbye
it's a pity you dont understand
before that you know it i think
you're searching for your mind dont know where to start
lord of this world
in the fields the bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning
wait 'till their judgement day comes yeah
the silent symphonies were playing their game
obsessed with fantasy possessed with my schemes
why doesnt everybody leave me alone yeah
that i might just get away from you now
is there a way that i could pay
i simply try but he wants me to fail
searching for a reason looking for a rhyme
hold back `till it's ready taking it slow
children get together you can save us all
please believe me my love and i'll show you
i'm going to feel
you are the first to have this love of mine
my name is lucifer please take my hand
your love for me has just got to be real
follow me now and you will not regret
our love grows stronger now with every hour
over to you
feeding our children
over to you
over to you
i need someone to show me the things in life that i cant find
falls down in tears
as we travel the universe
gotta see my rock'nroll doctor
gotta see him see him today
but you dont want to know
could take your mind away
life is killing you
nothing more to do
love me every single night
lovely lady never do me wrong
and now it's hurting so much what can i do
the endless hours of heartache waiting for you
no dreaming time you cheat this master
look behind you
ghostly shadows from the other world
sleeping village cockerels cry
death would freeze my very soul
dont you think i know what i'm doing
my future is shrouded in dark wilderness
memories i have remind me of you
i look inside myself and see
in disquise
is showing me the way
and find a distant man a waving his spoon
wont you listen
oh yeah
i want you part of this sweet leaf
you took up all the vandals
there must be some way out of here
i wish you good luck
yeah
yeah
when you see this world we live in do you still believe in man
time to stop all your messing around
casting his shadow weaving his spell
just keeps walking
i wish i'd walked before i started to run to you
yeah with you
your folly finally got to spend with a gun
you've changed in life since it began
you are nonentity you have no destiny
i feel my world is out of time
catch the fastest train around nine
become reality to me
i dont even believe in peace
'cause no one else is true
it's the only way to fight in the end
well i dont want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
the ante is risen once a week
in the fields the bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning
wait 'till their judgment day comes yeah
i was looking in the sky
and i dont believe you can
'cause there's iron in my heart
lost in happiness i had no fears
eyes full of angered illusion
who worship you are blind
i dont think you're so smart
while people just across the sea are counting the dead
nobody will ever change my ways
still i wonder what it's like to be loved
'cause it may be that it's over for me
and i dont understand why i sleep all god damn day
dont you know it seems to be so unappealing
i'm talkin to myself more
if i was to smile and i held out my hand
another life's falling down onto it's knees
out back where they plant all the trees
even there my god will be
and all my ways to him are known
ten feet away my daddy buries me
though the gloom of night be round me
and his loving arms enfolds me
they're just afraid to change
and then they'll paint it
it's wings to fly away to better things
my new found faith will pay by check
grab my knee and look at me
when i heard a leaf of my life hit the ground
the sand blew in my eyes
he's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
will make you stop and wonder
would listen to me anyway
religiously they seem to sin
anything for anything and ending up with nothing
nothing's ever gonna come between
but i'm not appalled or afraid verbal pocket play
and you're leaving me
who today will be knocked off
i ate them off cause i was hungry as hell
is that what you're thinking that you are
i met a holyman that said that he knew the way
you've planted rotten seeds
i dont need your spells or the little
every day my living hell
where i can feel no pain just calm and sane
arms holding up my knees
in the stir for breathing air
he'd be free they'd let him be
bring him to his wife and kids
i walk around and it feels good to be movin
i'll bloody bleed on everything i'm seeing
so god why dont you come on over here
they'll stick straight through you
but its alright to smile back at me
we can count on problems that we might not necessarily
see everything on the inside out
laughin from the inside out
how i'm desperately in need
i write a letter to a friend of mine
from the inside
and a faithful father i am to be
'cause now she's telling me she'll have my baby
all i can say is that my life is pretty plain
and i start to complain that there's no rain
now i'm scroungy as can be
so he rambles through the weeds
pull you down now
when you or you or you feel the need to feel
with a candle comes emotions that
never had a problem till i stood face to face with me
high time i washed it all away
hey it isnt mine
oh because you know i cant hide
the time that all feels is the right time
i sure as hell dont feel like
these ones are getting lose
jump in the river and let the
gonna sell
we dont have to
outside i cursed the birds and the sugar sky
but i never no i never got the chance to say good bye
cause he's no longer living here
big stretch and not much sleep
one porch one dog one cockroach only way to be
twenty stories below
maybe sleeps gonna get me in the shade
but if i could buy the sky that's hangin
over this bed of mine
i dont think that i can find easier way
but you should have been in my shoes yesterday
that's why we'll crawl to walk for running
because they're just killing my time
sunny so funny not funny to me because
if i'm hungry at 430 in the morning
and i said god damn god damn that bible pushin man
the sun warms my body as i'm
mean you can feel that it's time to go
where you cant see me
now tell me why am i to lie
so i can start sitting so pretty
if i stood up and i walked away
the land of milk and honey
saying i eye god i gotta go
gotta have your own space to play in
pickles never opened since 1983
around and over and in between the seas
my feet are so cold
as its feeding on me
and he's breathing on me
and i take off his pants
what i said it is always my esteem that i sure lose
i'm all shook up as i get all nervous inside
any more than this
that hides away
yesterday
but i let the dream go
and make believe we never needed
i can really do
princess leia where are you tonight
i was hanging out in the cantina
and i wake up alone
16 just held such better days
you'll never step foot in my room again
the tour was over we'd survived
to pass the time in my room alone
up all night long and there's something very wrong
dark and scary ordinary explanation and information
again i wait for this to change instead
it all just seems to be how
she's all i need
another night with her

corporate leaders politicians

kids cant vote adults elect them
teenage rules they're fucked and boring
we never wanted to be abused
cause she laid me
and mom and dad possess the key o instant slavery
cause she laid me
the good intentions that you had
and she said it could never survive
show up right on time
i'll take what you're willing to give
where are you coming from
this place is void of all passion
my head is made up of memories
i feel alone and tired
i hope i wont forget you
what the hell was he to expect
he finished with a great big fart and
'cause now i know that your my dad because you use ben wah balls

dead mans curve

cause i am i'm lost without you
cause i am i'm lost without you

see her pretty face
screams
we'll let ya know hey
just about done with your butt
screams
it's fucking with me it's fucking with you
when we were young and innocent
is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time
maybe it's time you looked at yourself
my love life was getting so bland
is this going to be the end
you're out of line and rarely sober
left you in the bar to try and save face
time keeps moving on and on and on
of a thousand billboards
it's called the spiral slam dance fever
the marlboro man understands
the marlboro man can spit into the wind
fuckin and suckin and touchin
fuckin and suckin and touchin
she has her curlers set her credit cards are paying the funds
he wants to bone this i know she is ready to blow
been starved for attention before
and he thinks of me the way i think of you
i am in his demand
it's useless my name has made the list
i think you used me again
it's obvious
how do we fix this if we never have vision
you're my source of most frustration
you'd leave it out for me
i wish that this would end
please dont remind me
there's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
i think it's disgusting believing and trusting
dont pull me down this is where i belong
so hold in all your aggresions
give more than you take
walk barefoot down the street
it's not easy or so damn pleasing
now it happens again
try hard when things fall apart
please take me home
i'm so jaded i calculated wrong
i bet you're sad
buy hope hope that it lasts
why did we have to go date
i bet you're sad this is the best time we ever had
you cannot see things that are different to me
on and on reckless abandon
memory thats full of fun
eyes are red and my movements slow
and break the truth with more bad news
on and on reckless abandon
change for the better
you cant hide while i'm running
help another you want for someday
i cannot be bought
i was brought up without a silver cup
and there i stay
all i remember's the way her bedroom smelled
another blade next to you from the ground
i can see that girls are a waste of time
there's a black shadow on my wall
walking through the grass
but as i look into my mind
what have you said reach out your hand
my broken dreams of you
i'll never ask permission from you
i'll run away
i think it's time for me to leave
'round yon virgin
just when i think that they are gonna stay
but how the fuck am i supposed to make you understand that
so here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away
it`s not right
i'm so lost
the last contagious victim of this plague between us
why is this hard do you recognize me
i fell behind
i fell behind
what scares me so bad
dont want to live my life alone
take off your pants dad
with your brother in her bed
your mom is not the only one
when you fuck your family i guess that's
and every day's the same
she drowned in the lake last night
it would be nice if things could turn out right
i am the one johnny carcinogen
i must be wrong this cant be right
do you want to come to a party
this place is so lame all these girls look the same
maybe we'd watch the sun rise
how she's down with the iwise well constructed disguise
some girls try too hard
she's the one she'll always be there
17 without a purpose or direction
and if i ever got another chance i'd still ask her to dance
i'll never forget tonight
six years long
it never worked at all
it stained and tasted so sick
she was stronger
time to wake up
when the clock strikes two
the difference between east and west
do you wanna know what i think of you
is that what you call your brain
but now i'm a man who's just living small
dont talk to me as i tune you out of my mind
those girls down on there knees
just look where he's at 'cause
he has fun fun fun and you
now she is so damned masculine
when my friends come over
i gotta see who's winning on the price is right oh
i need my tv
but what do i get 'cause i just seem to lose
didnt mean to hurt you then
when i needed you most
your breath in this cool room chill
one drink and the pain goes down
like violence you kill me
i've read you're letter through at least 4 times
this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone i guess
and i wish
i wish she'd be more kind now
i've been here two days and i'll sure be here tomorrow
he kicks my ass so much that filthy white inbred
i think you need some time alone i think you need some time alone
you say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost
i'm wasting time thinking about a girl
maybe if i act real tough
when i made fun of that guy
maybe if i act real tough
am i just wasting my time
and i'd play with a nuclear device
and i'd play with a nuclear device
i wish it didnt have to be so bad
and never answer the phone
i cant forgive
we started makin out and she took off my pants
i said i was the cops and your husband's in jail
and you still act like you're in freshman year
when you fucked grandpa did he tell you that he loved you
greasy finger in his ass he
have sex with my mom tonight this is stupid
it's christmas time again
you people scare me
it's christmas time again
i wont be home for christmas please postmark it
why do you say what you dont mean
how have you known what you decide
i'm saying what i've said all along
cause that's where i'm going to blend in go
i want to speak my mind start my own african tribe i'm alone
just like last time but a little worse
i hear the phone it rings so violently
most girls most do mean trouble because they are rarely honest
i think these things are too hopeful even with my expert knowledge
i'm not used to this temptation
did he hold you til the sun did rise
grandfather
there was a time long ago
cause i can see the truth that's hidden
the glow inside burns light upon her
your vows of silence fall all over
down down down down x4
she's a dove she's a fucken nightmare
on the go and it's way too late to play
what a nice creation
so all you little ladies
all along you wish that she would stay
fuck this place i lost the war
what a nice creation
you'll come back to me maybe
he's a player diarrhea giver tried to grow his hair out
want to make a deal
there's plenty more girls are such a drag
the girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
she's a landslide with a city beneath her that's what she wanted
take a photograph as the last train is leaving
and he'll never try to give you more
it's okay to just want more
she's better off sleeping on the floor because she fell right off her bed
why am i the one who gets fucked up and confused
but this answer begs that question
beg forgiveness round the corner
the point home send more letters
in spite of everything in spite of everything
shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart terd and twat
mark you know what's the best part of falling in love is
show me the way you move i'm feeling this
smiling from ear to ear i'm feeling this
to anyone standing alone
i'll always be dreaming of you
you're out of luck you've gone way too far
writing songs about all the people he thinks are gay
is it wrong if i think it's lame to dance
i'm not worthy for a minute of your time
forever and ever let's make this last forever
dig too much to fry you
why cant it be cool and free us
i want to fuck a dog in the ass
we wanna fuck a dog in the ass
ahh that was no pirate man that was thine own sister
fuck you
take a look at the young boy and his naked asshole
why we need to be like them
dont want to and dont fit in
i dont wanna know
cant you see that i'm in a world of shit
i dont wanna know
to fall in love or break it off
this world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful to me
and i'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
any time you meet a payment
easy credit rip offs
two fucken presents
i'll never talk to you again
ejaculate into a sock
i dont know what i'm feeling
what about that situation
please wont you buy in
and i hate hate hate your guts
it's labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin hot dogs
i'll never talk to you again
what have you said reach out your hand
but that's alright
my broken dreams of you
no it wont mean a thing in a hundred years
could it be you were ignored by every passerby
another lost little boy in a big old town
the tendency to hurry
dont move
be worthwhile
but like i said before it's all in the groove
that any son or daughter
all in the groove
soon we'd say nothing
i tried patience
beauty and the beast
i'm alone
now i dont care how i look and dont care how i act
and maybe then
i'm alone
i'm alone
i'm free free in all i see and that makes me free to roam
you may remain here in the jungle and hunt with the free people
dont give a damn if you're close
yes i am nothing
for i am everything
the equation the reason for my being here
perhaps you'll love me too
and i aint sure why
when all is said and done
we've already won
get myself together
well what a day and what's for breakfast
please wont you hear me
and it's hard to be believed what can be achieved
the things that hurt just wont go away
if you feel like weeping
please wont you hear me
wont you rise and shine
then all the sins they came
their investment should do well
when will it all be done
music brendan hill and chan kinchla
where it's ripe and i can pluck it
and it's survival of the healthy
business as usual
if i can let it be then i'm free
let it be deceased
everybody's constitutional
i really dont care right now but anyway
it's my life he's trying to save but anyway
be real confusing if not but anyway
lyrics john popper
all aboard
where we used to grow up
now i know you guys have that here around boston
so here we go
shoot everybody with a mutt this side of the town
or even short and surly
or you or you or you or you
anybody
while your uncle rolls his joints with his fifty dollar bill
hail to you my mountain climber busy at your task
when all is in harmony it can be such a lonely place
whoever she is now and whoever she'll become
i'm gonna ride you
no matter how hard
crash
i hope some day i can befriend it
and when the moment tends to savor
please please wont you take me away
life that's there
the only forms that are portrayed
music bobby sheehan
with defense desire
gonna run the show someday
come with me and take my hand
we're not too fast and we're not too slow
but you dont have the time you cannot think or hesitate
trytryplease trytry
please dont crydont cry
lyrics john popper
yeah they're fallible
was never the intent
that's centered in your hand
and we hate what we see
well perhaps it wont apply
to expose as many lies
in that girl across the way
it takes a thousand of his best spies
one day she quit flapping her arms at last
that it takes the strength of samsons hair
she works for nasa exploring space
it takes a thousand of his best spies
perhaps in time i could surpass my coy facade of vast indifference
and when she looks away i tap my feet
the momentary soaring of an eagle would be me
i can almost hear me speak the words as i gain resolve
to smile at her and say
you know you move so beautifully
come on and dance with me felicia
i want to dance with you come on and dance with me felicia
and fix upon
spread your wings and simply
that frightening fall has become a friend
soar through heaven
flyfree
gives me a reason to go get more
hope you wont mind if i control my fate
take a look out your back door
turn my damnation into chapter ten
gina gina
there was a rock'nroll queen
dont you cry
so why should i bother with the rise and the fall
someday we'll go outside drive
you know i think i need a prison
music brendan hill
'cause it's a great big world calling you to take a ride
'cause it take debt and obligation
seasons coming slowly
sweet talking hippie
and if you aint got a dime
little bit little bit little bit little bit
music lyrics john popper
i aint tellin you no lie
what made the pan refuse to grow
what you're doing to me this mtv is not for free
and only then shall i abide this tide
that's really all this was
coupled with the things i've told
from the likes of peter pan
yeah we're in shark infested waters
gonna ride off in the sunrise
and a dream can be as one
imagine all the people living life in peace you hoo
i hope that you will join us
dont try to play catch me if you can
but keep hearing voices singing comes a change
you aint out to die boy
you might just prefer to pray
but keep hearing voices singing comes a change
if you realize your wildest dreams can hurt you
if you think i've given up on you you're crazy
just wait
i hope for you and cannot stop at hoping
just wait
carelessly with matches play
sing a song of sixty pence
who'd be stupid enough to say it doesnt have to be that way
and who am i to say i dont understand it
it's the part of the dream that leaves me wanting for the darkness
i know that in the end you were waiting on the other side
i dreamed about you last night
about what i want or what i get
but more important you should know
you'll have to dig beneath the ground
buyer beware
or have i lost enough
you're gonna have to look around
'cause you wouldnt be the first to fall to love greed
you saw how some of it was real and some was lies
'cause you wouldnt be the first to fall to love greed
love of my life our first night together
she said
you know she realized she must learn for
love of my life your arms were never shy
oh yes she realized and for once so did i
take a little trip with me
by that passed along pay back
as i make my way
as my lungs will allow
but so we dont feel so lonely
and if it's a sing
music lyrics john popper
please understand and hear what i'm saying
all eyes upon you no net below
as she turns from me and walks away
doesnt it seem most precarious
the factory wails to make mountain time
keep it all inside dont show how much she rocked ya
i guess from now on i'll be careful what i share
can you feel the same
so much so fast
i said i'm mulling it mulling it
or couldnt you tell
lyrics r popper john popper
for the sky is much too high
who do you think will ease their pain
dont you listen to them scream
do you want to live or die
lyrics john popper
and if you think the point i'm driving at absurd
no telling where the wind will blow
and you might notice no one was ever really free
who would conquer spain
the poor noble egyptians
life just a game we play
cause if you look around you might just feel like me
ah but could it be that maybe
but now i see clearly
and from time to time he turns around
there's a multitude of story
please forgive if i replace you
but now i see clearly
it's an old one about a little dirt farm girl
came when the circus had come to town
she was gonna go wherever he went
was when he locked the door behind him like she'd always been
you and i
no one knows what became of her
that there's a price to pay
i guess
i was lucky
the last thing he screamed out aloud
i couldnt escape the memory
but not without a certain degree of fear
like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
what's yours and mine the fishing's fine
oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
well all right okay
is it a sure fire way to speed things up
yes humor me and tell me lies
when all it does is slow me down
hey baby let's keep in touch
when all it does is slow me down
oh i like coffee
why you wanna give me a run around
stripped down like a frightened child
thinking about his hometown
can make your soul want to run
i dont wanna hear about the progress that they made
squashed flatpretty gory
dont mean nothing to me
in the end
they'll all heal in time
the answers are getting harder and harder
scat solo
again denied the beast her hand
cant you plainly see
sad how some friendships never ever seem to end
all i hear is their silent prayer
so we can establish that the pain is real
and you know every wisdom has its price
but it never conquered me
you know it keeps you here on earth
you know i need your love
closer now closer now it's all rightit's all right
you know that's all i am that's all i am
no sudden movements
c'mon and get me you twist of fate
he draws faster than i can see and knocks me to the ground
and the lights are getting dim
then i'll make my best guess and i wont care why
i pick up my smile put it in my pocket
dreams we dreamed at night were never meant to come to life
someday i will find love again will blow my mind
lyrics john popper
it told her if you really love this believe because
sad disfigured child with two humps on his back
made him clearly understand
soon lack could walk and talk and hide his humps
it takes the guiltiest of eyes
and it takes everything you have
from time to time they meet up in the sky to celebrate
i remember hearing a story
left a lesson
and as i
pretending they're not guessing
and only time is there
we're gonna get fed well
we each get a turn
set your sights on my corner of time
or you could trust yourself and trust others too
you can run where you wanna run when you wanna hide
not me i'm into warmer days
i am into
when you were young you walked to school
i'm into warmer days
i'm gonna dust me off
what a day and what's for breakfast
collectively they compose all you see including your eye
and this along and nothing less
in this corner
you know there used to be bison
look i'm shrugging and so are you
that paradise was once the world and it wasnt just a dream
and find no need to cringe
finger on the key
i can only understand
and the softest skin is
i've fallen down and i cant seem to come to
all i am is
every prize i win is yours
from those early days with the fresh new start
so we can survive
it's getting hard lately to concentrate
and keep on believing
is buried there no so i step very rarely
things could still turn out alright
so we can survive
he'd drown a puppy
strap him in the chair
and now he's in the cold cold ground
and so we gather round psycho joe
men of infamy and fame
and so we gather round psycho joe
joe and his electrical chair
the price of your piece of mind
again and again you find it's yet another
again and again you find it's yet another
ad lib from the shopping channel
if you stare too long you loose your appetite
anything to be scared of
i want to tell you this
no aint got
to know
she dont know how
to know
'cos i'm numb
so what's the worth
to the hard of hearing
they've dropping like flies
as suffering believers
so far i've not really stayed in touch
because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
waiting for an underground train
everybody's doing it so do it too
in and out of one ear
i dont need anyone
then there's sticky fingers
john is down the fun pub
days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers
i've broken every bone
you can be with me
battle battle battle battle battle
battle battle battle battle battle
and when she lets me slip away
she'll suck your thumb she'll make you come
he's on he's on he's on it
all on their own down soho
in his drink he's been talking
other people break into a cold sweat
watch the sky day
baby when you hold me
baby when you hold me
give me my soul x7

she's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
and then you

'though the words are wrong

well nothing that's new
and just look whose laughing
oh shame it's over
there are so feel days left to grasp
i dont want to think at all
there's no other way
there's no other way
around the bay of biscay and back for tea
there's a low in the high forties
when you are alone it will be there with you
not to be cautious
when everybodies asleep at home
and softs dropped in a summer term
futures futures futures repeat the fade
collapsed in love
en plein amour
you and i
there's a lot of it about
topman
and on a magic carpet
shooting guns on the high street of love
he's naughty by nature
shooting guns on the high street of loveto fade
he knew in his heart he was over
tracy jacks and escorted back home
tracy jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in
freestyle
dont sleep at night the worlds growing old
i'm a country boy i got no soul
i'm a country boy i got no soul
i've got trimm trabb
just the way it is
room to room an operator
no calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear
you're past your sell by date
local and direct
no calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear
a new type face and new day in so much trouble
sometimes you do too much sometimes it all gets too much
but wearing boots can prevent the leeches in the long grass
so tasty
like no one ever will
then it's easy to forget
we got a on you
you get fed and watered
you could be the first man on your street to get it right
wake up with purpose and polite efficiency
not feeling so great
tea tea and coffee
we work together
i cant sleep without drinking
i love you forever
i never see you
we're together
jelly mixed with margarine
smoking makes you holy
sugar from the day you are born
procaine stops you screaming
she needs a little sparkle
sex on the tv
dont want to be alone
'cos we feel the same
end of the century oh it's nothing special
they've come to save us
there's panic at london heathrow
where to fly to
there was no one
if we go and blow it up then we will disappear
you meet an old soldier and talk of the past
oh the sunday sleep
i'll watch myself hang on
you go hang around around
i've gotta get over
oh lord give me magic
yeah i've been a clown
la la la la la la la
away from it
educated the expensive way

and from this charmless man i just had to hide
but no one's listening
for you to listen
what a shame she was just getting comfy
just stick together so they never get lonely
but they're putting the holes in yes yes
he makes an inner arm block
chairmans junk
where justice is done
it's the chinese way
and if that is the fact then in actual fact it's not where it's at
do you feel like a chain store
i've seen so much
there's people there who will hurt you
and i'm braindead virtually
and i'm braindead virtually
do you feel like a chain store

feeling like a stranger nobody sees
stayed in mississippi a day too long
not as tight as the corner that i painted myself in
the dusky light the day is losing

and fall in love just me and you
and when it's time for leaving mozambique
i met him in a cell in new orleans i was down and out

hey mr tambourine man play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
let me forget about today until tomorrow
proud 'neath heated brow
i'm younger than that now
too serious to fool
in the instant that i preach
quite clear no doubt somehow
he's not supposed to fight back he's supposed to have thick skin
then he destroyed a bomb factory nobody was glad
he buys obsolete weapons and he wont be denied
he's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
blues this morning falling down like hail
oh i miss you nettie moore
i've gone where the southern crosses the yellow dog
winter's gone the river's on the rise

but there's no one left here to tell
today i'll stand in faith and raise
that i was warm for you and then
every time i see ya
come on baby
a north wind about to break
from the heavens to the ground
rabbit running down across the road
underneath the sky of blue
on this new morning new morning
'till i come into new york town
i swung on to my old guitar
we want folksingers here
even joined the union and paid my dues
pulled my cap down over my eyes
they're dreams and they're only in your head
wondering who turned the lights on
a shortgun fired and away i ran
i took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin
so i turned on my conelrad
so i called up the operator of time
i didnt see you around
corrina corrina
i got a bird that sings
i was laying in bed
lord knows i've paid some dues getting through
she turned around to look at me
where i happened to be employed
i just kept looking at her side of her face
tangled up in blue
pouring off of every page
and froze up inside
some are mathematicians
on independence day
we're so alone
tears of rage tears of grief
as if it was a purse
all i would like you to do
so darlin you better come through
how come you dont send me no regards
like a poor fool in his prime
honey but you're so hard
they were the best of friends
his head began to spin
i'm gonna start my pickin right now
all right said judas priest
and they say his name is priest
he dropped ev'rythimg and ran
while the mission bells did toll
but on the seventeenth he burst
nothing is revealed
about a brave young indian you should remember well
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
he was wined and speeched and honored everybody shook his hand
two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for ira hayes
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
in the company of strangers
i do declare
and he carries the reminders
west of the jordan east of the rock of gibraltar
curtain rising on a new age
put your hand on my head baby do i have a temperature
what can i say about claudette aint seen her since january
i worked on the levee mama both night and day
riches and salvation can be waiting behind the next bend in the road
when i'm with you i forget i was ever blue
if it keep on raining the levee's gonna break
dont be a stranger with no brain or heart
now aint the time for your tears
now aint the time for your tears
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
and that ladder of law has no top and no bottom
as for compensation there's a little he will ask
from my toes up to my ears
you'll not see nothing like the mighty quinn
come all without come all within
come gather 'round people
for the times they are a changin
will be later to win
it'll soon shake your windows
rapidly agin

he answered with his thumb
and the people that confronted him were many

this englishman said fab

this foot came through the line
and i got a coin to flip
they believed me but
sheriff of the jail
and an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
she'll be flying over my home in about three hours time
come baby teach me come baby reach me let the music start
but i will always be emotionally yours
like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
aint no use joking
broken cutters broken saws
broken pipes broken tools
father of day father of night
father of minutes father of days
sure seems lonesome lord when the sun goes down
and tell jesus make up my dying bed
through the back alleys through the blinds
a summer breeze is blowin
sometimes comes to call
if you dont believe it you can follow your nose
if you wanna learn anything
if you ever try to interfere with me
to go along with all the ring dancing
may you always do for others
and see the lights surrounding you
may your heart always be joyful
albert said i'm leaving you

a little piece of cornbread layin on a shelf
well she dont make me nervous she dont talk too much
upon four legged forest clouds
with a crashing but meaningless blow
alladin and his lamp
and i will try to harmonize with songs
the kingdoms of experience
from their fates try to resign
and there are no truths outside the gates of eden
if it curls and flows all down her breast
she once was a true love of mine
if it rolls and flows all down her breast
she once was a true love of mine
but its so strong for so long
god knows the secrets of your heart
god knows we can get all the way from here today

and somebody else says where what is
and says how does it feel
when someone attacks your imagination
f scott fitzgerald's books
and without further notice
and he says how
you put your eyes in your pocket
while i'm sittin on my watch so i can be on time
i'm tellin myself i've found true happiness
the birdies were flying from tree to tree
but the next time i looked there was light in the room
yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody

well the judge he cast his robe aside
the trial was bad enough
but you're gonna have to serve somebody yes indeed
well it may be the devil or it may be the lord

but you're gonna have to serve somebody yes indeed

i pity the poor immigrant
who fills his mouth with laughing
knock knock knockin on heavens door
knock knock knockin on heavens door
through this open world i'm about to trouble
she broke a leg and needed shooting
everybody say you're using voodoo your feet walk by themselves
laugh at him behind his back just like the others do
he's the property of jesus
you got something better
you can laugh at salvation you can play olympic games
i came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
and the one eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
white lilies never grow on stalks of clover
you're trying to reshape me in a mould love
my god they killed him
he healed the lame and fed the hungry
just the holy son of man we'll never understand
when she's near me she's so hard to recognize
all you got to do is wait 'till i'll tell you when
dont forsake me baby dont sell me out
well i've walked two hundred miles look me over
with disaster you somehow managed to escape
i never asked you for nothing that you couldnt deliver
it was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line
well i sent you my feelings in a letter
when the night comes falling from the sky
26 27 28 29 i'm gonna make your face look just like mine
i want ev'rybody to be free
i sat with my high heeled sneakers on
now i gotta friend who spends his life
hope i dont blow it
it's nothing
'cause i got my little lady right by my side
it's president kennedy callin me up
she's a man eater
eyes were closed i was half asleep
tellin me he loves all kinds a people
what do you do about willy mays
i just walk along and stroll and sing
once i had mountains in the palm of my hand
so if you find someone that gives you all of her love
but it's not that way
me drinkin from my broken cup
well i return to the queen of spades
honey i want you
honey i want you
sweet lady
after losing every battle
it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
i waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the
down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy
idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves
if dogs run free
must be and that is all
if not for you baby i'd lay awake all night
oh what would i do if not for you
we had a falling out like lovers often will
and i've never gotten used to it i've just learned to turn it off
you dont have to be afraid
i'll remember you
i'll remember you
i'll remember you
that i done it the way
jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up
lord in my time of dying dont want nobody to cry
with a forty four smokeless under my head
i murdered little sadie in first degree
forty one days forty one nights forty one years
did they hear when he told peter peter put up your sword
when he healed the blind and crippled did they see
did they speak out against him did they dare
by that soft and shining sea
that set everybody free
with the glory that is to be
so you wont hear me complain
i've been in and out of happiness
do you understand my pain
went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down
i was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
it was then that i knew what he had on his mind
threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover
she said you gonna stay i said if you want me to yeah
who's never weak but always strong
you say you're lookin for someone
there's nothing in here moving
so run here baby put your little hands in mine
now when you go home you dont have to get along
when things go wrong so wrong with you
leanin on the window sill
goin down over the sea
when your train gets lost
is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
forget the dead you've left they will not follow you
there is no sense in trying
watch waterfalls of pity roar
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
is really sacred
and it's alright ma i can make it
when a trembling distant voice unclear
although the masters make the rules
while some on principles baptized
but rather get you down in the hole
propaganda all is phony
at pettiness which plays so rough
oh the truth to you i'll tell
now jackie's gone a sailing with trouble on his mind
your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball
oh to quickly heal his wounds
oh for life jim jones i'm sending you
and our ship was high upon the sea
i'd rather have drowned in misery
and it's by and by i'll slip my chains
they'll yet regret they've sent jim jones
joey joey
till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
the police department hounded him they called him mr smith
he tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
one day they blew him down in a clam bar in new york
then i saw the old mans limousine head back towards the grave
john wesley harding
he took a stand
who could track or chain him down
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well the book of leviticus and deuteronomy
preacherman seeks the same who'll get there first is uncertain
he'll put the priest in his pocket put the blade to the heat
ev'rybody knows
nobody has to guess
so i came in here
please dont let on that you knew me when
dont put on any airs
and my best friend my doctor
up on housing project hill
how they blackmailed the sergeant at arms
but the joke was on me
and the smell of their roses does not remain
at your feet to convince you of your pain
broke and hungry ragged and dirty too
well that woman i got man she do just what she feels
then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone
they'll stone ya when you are young and able
everybody must get stoned
i found they were all rank strangers to me
no mother or dad not a friend could i see
and the corner sign
and point away from the past
i'd only have to stay
it aint quite the end
and remain as i am
so the people will know
ring them bells for all of us who are left
i rolled and i tumbled i cried the whole night long
well i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
aint nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine
let's put our heads together now let's put all old matters to an end
but i can get another one
at night i dream of bells in the village steeple
soon the desert will be gone
the way is long but the end is near
was that the thunder that i heard
soon the horse will take us to durango
and your flesh like silk and you face like glass
who among them can think he could outguess you
the kings of tyrus with their convict list
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
how could they ever ever persuade you
now you stand with your thief you're on his parole
aint nobody but sally sue brown
bake in a hot tub down the line
i'd rather see you ruin this a heart of mine
sara sara
sara sara
i can still hear the sounds of those methodist bells
you were there in the winter moonlight on the snow
sara sara
and rock about my saro jane
saro jane
and rock about my saro jane
stone cold dead
saved
by his strength i do endure
by the blood of the lamb
nobody to rescue me
saved
thank you lord
wherever i am welcome is where i'll be
by the saving grace that's over me
did you ever hear that coffin sound
and i believe what the father told
aint going nowhere fast
to be seeing the real you at last
you didnt show no visible scars
i got troubles i think maybe you got troubles
is there any truth in that senor
smell the tail of the dragon
i'm ready when you are senor
and paint the daytime black
she's got no place to fall
salute her when her birthday comes
like she did not now how
of canadee i o
well he too fell in rage
who called her his dear
well the captain he might prove true
for i cant help falling in love with you
well your loveliness has wounded me
that's how it is when things disintegrate
i left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
the world's been slaughtered it's such a bloody disgrace
the drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
i stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
she was torn between jupiter and apollo
where dog soldiers are reflected
i've moved your mountains and marked your cards
as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
tolling for the rebel tolling for the rake
an the poet an the painter far behind his rightful time
even though a clouds's white curtain in a far off corner flashed
as we listened one last time an we watched with one last look
that's what they did
that's what they did
he bought the american dream but it put him in doubt
he could've been an accountant or a tennis star
they took his head and turned it inside out
which nobody really wanted to touch
seein if the clothes were dry
then she asked me if the clothes was still wet
i went back in the house and mama met me
cant see over to the other side
i found my world found my world in you
i'm twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound
fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
watch them just a filling in the pale moonlight
what do i care
i wont throw it up in anybody's face
i do intend
and i know he will do it 'cause he's faithful and he's true
i will forever be
for making your prayers known
you can bust your feet
and salt for salt
now it's king for king
well i cried for you now it's your turn to cry awhile
it must have been don pasquale makin a 2 am booty call
yes i cried for you now it's your turn you can cry awhile
some mother's child has gone astray she cant find him anywhere
a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes
trust yourself
and you wont be disappointed when vain people let you down
every day your memory grows dimmer
tryin to get to heaven before they close the door
but i dont know what all right even means
i've been to sugar town i shook the sugar down
i moved in closer got up on my toes
it will destroy you family your happy home is gone
the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
they pass by so silently
tweedle dee and tweedle dum
brains in a pot they're beginning to boil
they're lyin low and they're makin hay
i've had too much of your company
how many paths did he try and fail
how many more without any reward
five by five cant stay alive
her fond face pale with woe
and guarded them as they fell
the words that her lover had said
i go half crazy when she calls my name
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
i dont know why i love her but i just cant stop
it's indescribable it can drive you to drink
all the sweethearts that you can hold
he stood beneath the silver skies
it's unbelievable it go down this way
there was an old man
let the wind blow low
let the bird sing
if you ever want to reach me you know where to look
baby they ring in my head like a bell
well my shoes they comes from singapore
sure was a good idea
well it's sundown on the union
when it costs too much to build it at home
they used to grow food in kansas
this world is ruled by violence
aint it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin to be so quiet
and the all night girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train
he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously
but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
but like louise always says
the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
you dont want a love that's pure
i think we better talk this over
i feel displaced i got a low down feeling
i guess i'll be leaving tomorrow
why should we got on watching each other through a telescope
ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete
my thoughts of you dont ever rest they'd kill me if i lie
oh cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
he smiled when he saw me coming
go on back to see the gypsy
i went back to see the gypsy
you have given me eyes to see
what can i do for you
i know all about poison i know all about fiery darts
if i see and dont say if i look right through you
who tied them and why and where must i have been
could you say it again
when you were kissing my cheek
slipped out of my mind
that was here before
is it easy to say
are you talking to me
can you get back in
when he returns
how long can you falsily and deny what is real
tomorrow keeps turning around
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
i followed the winding stream
look away we're bound away
look away we're bound away
look away we're bound away
i come home last night you wouldnt even let me in
you're that kind of woman drives me insane
seen a shooting star tonight
it's the last temptation the last account
dont need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
dont show me no picture show or give me no book to read
there's a man that hates me and he's swift smooth and near
sign on the window says lonely
looks like a nothing but rain
aint complaining about what i got
i can snap my fingers and require the rain
you know i love you and further more
silvio silver and gold
a little confused i remember well
he didnt see her anywhere
to know and feel too much within
lord i'm sittin on top of the world
can get me a woman
an i dont worry
they have gone by
there's slow slow train coming up around the bend
and there's slow slow train coming up around the bend
and there's slow there's slow train coming up around the bend
there's slow slow train coming up around the bend
made before the foundation of the world
and i cant let go wont let go and i cant let go no more
i'm so hard pressed my mind tied up in knots
you're going down the road baby and you cant come back
or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
something there is about you that moves with style and grace
what's your position baby what's going on
we've reached the edge of the road baby where the pasture begins
answer me baby a casual look will do
i'm out here a thousand miles from my home
i'm singing you the song but i cant you sing enough
gypsy gal the hands of harlem
your pearly eyes so fast an slashing
you've slayed me you have made me
well i dont look much like a lover
broke her heart lost my own
i'm traveling by land
i'm wild about you girl

i've got no choice
i've been in a brawl
i cant go to paradise no more
turned around to billy lyons said what you doin here
all about that john b stetson hat
high police walked on to stack a lee he was lying fast asleep
the jukebox playing low
the light in this place is so bad
maybe they'll get me and maybe they wont
when the last rays of daylight go down
i'll eat when i'm hungry
got a little girl little and low
gotta step it up and go yeah go
tell my woman i'll see her at home
i'd ask him what the matter was
with his pointed shoes and his bells
mona tried to tell me
with the memphis blues again
to be stuck inside of mobile
oh mama can this really be the end

and now people just get uglier
you know you know about my debutante

i say you cant what do you mean you cant
my dogs are barking there must be someone around
standin by god's river my souls beginning to shake
they say that vanity got the best of him

way up in the border country far from the towns

over the hills and far away
folks lose their possessions the folks are leaving town

just like the time before and the time before that
so they took him to the infirmary
put in a prison cell but one time he could a been
dont forget that you are white
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
the trial was a pig circus he never had a chance
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
an innocent man in a living hell
i have tried my hand at bribery
which led me to my fatal doom
been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
besides if she wakes up now she'll just want me to talk
i and i
i and i
they ask me how i feel
and i i walk out on my own
dont let me drift too far
oh though the earth may shake me
i cant understand
she acts like we never have met
her voice once and talk
but now something has changed
i remember her whispering yet
and if anybody asks me is it easy to forget
searching for the very souls
i dreamed i saw st augustine
the thrill and the touch of her fingertips
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her

at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
the festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall
backstage the girls were playing five card stud by the stairs
rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
lily was a princess she was fair skinned and precious as a child
rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts
she was with big jim but she was leaning to the jack of hearts
the only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts
i courted lovely flora some pleasure for to find
seing mad by desperation i pierced him to the breast
how can i ever stand it

big furry paws and he liked to howl

in the beginning in the beginning
in the beginning long time ago
slithering his way through the grass
he looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
there are no mistakes in life some people say
i took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
it's too late to listen to that warning voice
disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet
unknown as you slowly sink
judges will haunt you the country priestess will want you
i'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
equality liberty humility simplicity
that is leading your onto the brink
the bridge that you travel on goes to the babylon
stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
but the cardboard filled windows
as the years passed the door
to marry john thomas a miner
'til a man come to speak
and the red iron rotted
and i's left alone with three children
i've still got the scars that the sun didnt heal
i've followed the river and i got to the sea

my so called friends have fallen under a spell
shine you light shine your light on me
on the way out of egypt through etopoia to the judgement hall of christ
precious memories how they linger
in the stillness of the midnight

a cold coyote calls
that you're holdin in your hand
on a south dakota farm
bloomin bright star of bright isle
and go through all my hardship and toil

pardon monsieur the desk clerk says
a soldier sits beneath the fan
as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
where a handwritten sign read do not disturb
and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
you'll spend it in the tomb

without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
when i thought i spied some land

and a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed
oh where are you tonight
there's a million dreams gone there's a landscape being raped
i bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg
but without you it just doesnt seem right
we banged the drum slowly
by rivers of blindness
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a gypsy queen
wiggle till it opens wiggle till it shuts
wiggle wiggle wiggle like satin and silk

winterlude winterlude my little daisy
the country i come from
the cavalries charged
with guns on their hands
when the second world war
if another war comes
one push of the button
whether judas iscariot
there's an evening haze settling over town
you are dearer to me than myself

in the days of old in the days of gold
there was poker bill one of the boys who was always in a game
and in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49
when we dug up the gold in the days of '49
satan got you by the heel there's bird's nest in your hair
the ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in
the tuxedo that you're wearing the flower in your lapel
my dreams are beyond control
to have it too fast and too much
i wont underestimate you
that you cannot comprehend
and there's nowhere there to comfort you
when the burning flesh of men
delia's dear ol mother took a trip out west
looking for them rounders looking out for me
all the friends i ever had are gone
they're selling postcards of the hanging
as lady and i look out tonight
and the only sound that's left
everybody is making love
to her death is quite romantic
passed this way an hour ago
dr filth he keeps his world
if you lean your head out far enough
and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
is strapped across their shoulders
and ezra pound and t s eliot
when you asked me how i was doing
now there's a man you'll hear about
he gave a string of horses
and the tellin of his story
give my blankets to my buddies
heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
we stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break
if i cant find my baby

the disease of conceit
turn you into a piece of meat
dont wanna judge nobody dont wanna be judged
dont wanna bury nobody dont wanna be buried
but if you do right to me baby

you know the streets are filled with vipers
come over here from over there girl

my throat start to tickle and my nose itches
with their humorless smiles so easy to see through
no more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe

i'm a thinking and a wond'rin walking down the road

i spied my true love comin my way
we walked together hand in hand
she's in some far of land
lord i aint got much more to lose
my baby stole my heart from me
all the way to the statue of liberty
rolling down the road
if your mem'ry serves you well
and there was nothing more to tell
they're been there since christmas morn
where the angels stand high on their poles
well there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere i go
going to sleep over there that's where the music is coming from
everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today
she aint no angel and neither am i
i've already confessed no need to confess again
and we havent even started yet
you go inside and stay warm
i must be guilty of something
but i cant figure out whether i'm too good for you
and they're beating the devil out of a guy
i never could learn to hold you love
nothing can heal me now but your touch
girls like birds flyin away
i was all right 'til i fell in love with you
time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream
we stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
gonna shake that thing
tell 'em all
now he's king of the drunks
go on out
three legged man
now wont you tell me the true

when only you are near
the flowers of the city
but it grieves my heart love
back to the south

for deep in my heart
the reincarnation of paul revere's horse
i'm in the kitchen
mama's in the fact'ry
the commander in chief answers him while chasing a fly
the king of the philistines his soldiers to save
daddy's in the alley
then send out for some pillars and cecil b demille
and the national bank at a profit sells road maps or the soul
i'm in the kitchen
your lips are so tender your heart is beating fast
but it was more than i could do
if there's a poor boy on the street
one mans temper might rise
when there's too much of nothing
give them all my salary
say hello to vivian
dark beauty
jack the cowboy went up north he's buried in your past
it must be time to carve another notch
but they cant help you none when there's trouble
drought and starvation packaging of the soul

her mother feels so shocked

with the problems and the how's and why's
and he could see no reasons
i want to shoot the whole day down
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
all we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me
sometimes i think that you're the only reason
she dont like wearing shoes in december
a five year old princess to me to me

i wanna thank you thank you thank you
now thank you for paying for my cold beer
who do you want me to be
i wanna be loved
i wanna dream
but i got so much left unsaid inside of me
but i could see a tear roll
all i'm trying to say
and built a fortress for your heart to keep
i may have built for you a dreamhouse
i might not say i'm sorry
i'd cry for you
and i'll never be a king
into the fire we cry
big jobs small jobs baby
i'm in the service business
tough jobs rough jobs say where and when
i can make a living out of lovin you
big jobs small jobs baby
that's my middle name
if i could make a living out of lovin you
if i could make a living out of lovin you
could i teach you what's right
of the night
if i was yours

mother mother
but i'd bet my life on a roll of the dice for you
and it's hard for broken hearts to just forget
i'll be there to talk to you down
if that's what it takes that's what i'd do
now i'm praying to god you'll give me one more chance girl
how they have their own hiding place
i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you
got no use for sunday
baby i dont need a bed
'cause i was built for speed
gonna live while i'm alive
is all that i need
i'll sleep when i'm dead
and they lay my bones to rest
then drive you down to your knees
running wild
in and out of love
in and out of love
to have you in these arms tonight
i'd get down on my knees for you
a promise this world would never blind us
i'd get down on my knees for you
this old place still smells like
and make everything alright
would all just call in sick
to some organ grinder's lullaby
it's hard letting you go
the ones with the hole in the toe you wont lose
there's just one thing that you should keep in your book of dreams
it's just me baby it's just me baby
what's it gonna take to make you see
you're gonna hear my voice
i did it my way
and it's now or never
dont bend dont break baby dont back down
i just want to live while i'm alive
i just want to live while i'm alive
baby set it free
you're gonna make me feel oh so right
mama can you hear me try to understand
when the world gets in my face
ohhh if there's one thing i hang onto
ohhh if there's one thing i hang onto

i'm not fool enough to think you couldnt live life without me
let your heart call up the cops read me my rights
someone to give it to you straight
janie dont you take your love to town
what i'll forget to say tomorrow i'll say now
janie dont you take your love to town
there's no denying that i almost lost it
love me back to life
yeah i need you
make me come alive
love me back to life
in the corner booth of a downtown bar with your head on my shoulder
save me a seat next to you
trying to keep myself out of the rain
no one wants to be themselves these days
and i guess i'd rather die than fade away
these days the stars seem out of reach
there aint nobody left but us these days
what you gonna do with your life
tell me who you're gonna be
chorus
news gets around in this fading neighborhood
hey joey
a little wild a little green
this skin i'm in it's alright with me
i'm not old enough to sing the blues
if you see coach t tell him i've cut my hair
i'm just looking for tomorrow
i been broke and i've been hungry
when you live and die by the life we breathe
the barrel of a loaded gun
i am laying down my guns
and it's hard to hold on
tell me baby when i hurt you
well it's hard to be strong
keep the faith
mother father
try to hold on trying to hold on
i'm the king of the hill
listen people cant you hear the voices that are crying out
we had our fun i used to light your flame
the smoke's the ghost that keeps you close when i cant sleep
one last cigarette last cigarette
come see a living breathing spectacle
you better hold on to your honey
come and see hear feel the real thing
hey patrick hit the lights
you're mine and i'm yours for the taking
i've been to school and baby i've been the teacher
solo
damn the fool who begs for more
i was standing in the light
i was flying through the clouds
the weekend comes to this town
to break on through to the other side
and blast that radio
when i look in your eyes i can feel the fire
let's make it baby
let's make it baby
baby baby baby
if you'd only made me cry
for me that's one thing i know that wont change
but it's hard letting you go
when this cold world comes between us
not the one that's gonna pull us through
it's a bitch but life's a roller coaster ride
baby i can take it
and a cold empty spot
havent found the drug
little bit of soul
so much time in the hole
whoa oh little bit o soul
in my rear view mirror i see someone else's hairline
shalalalalala shalalalalala shalalalalala oh
yeah i'm never alone
for love for love
livin on a prayer
we've got each other and that's a lot
i dont need no diamonds
but i only need one answer
or wear that ring of diamonds
is it you and me or just this world we live in
i dont know where we fit in
hey hey i finally found my way
and waiting there to great us
i finally found my way
i picked up the phone i called everyone i could
i'm hoping that she's looking like a penthouse pet
love for sale love for sale
you're just a number of the love lies
scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet
tonight i need you
there are days my feeling's gone
take me touch me hold me like you mean it
rescue me
i've been cried to you been mistreated
i'm making my move i'm looking for you
you can run but you cant hide
he rides the greyhound from his hometown
captain crash and the beauty queen from mars
at least they're gonna try to fly
bacall and bogie
is killing me
you play with words play with love
another night is falling
lo di todo por ti
tantas noches de intimidad
y por eso sigo esperando
como yo como yo nadie te ha amado x2
right or wrong love or hate it
i'm smart enough to know what i dont know
chorus
crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
it's all that i can stand
a door slams like a shotgun you jump up to your feet
damned damned
the more that i resist it my temptation turns to fate
i'm getting out
i've got my coat and my keys
it's our big chance i'm calling you now
it's gonna tell the world i'm your only man
there's nothing that i wouldnt do for you
diamond ring diamond ring
for me it helps me to forget
you cant help but prosper
and the jobs are gone
and no one's getting out of here alive
i begged the clouds for rain
still we're hangin on
night after night after night
across the border they turn
to find my piece of easy street
i packed up on my wife and kid
praying for some holy water
and i hoped that he knew
all my dreams went up in ashes
here in dry county
make it by the gun or knife
and no one's getting out of here alive
to sing an outlaw's serenade
but it taught me how to fight
dyin aint much of a livin for the young
na
bleedin sweatin dyin
life learning how to live my life
and i spread these wings and fly
i'm gonna touch the sky
or did you laugh so hard that you cried
'cause i know i can never escape you
maybe i've lost my guts
but know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now
little lines and cracks
make yourself at home
it's ok to feel a little broken
it's ok to feel a little broken
yeah
bleedin sweatin dyin
life learning how to live my life
and i spread these wings and fly
i'm gonna touch the sky
but baby there aint no luck down there
and yeah i know them
a partner in crime
i'll let nothing slow us down
still that's what you call living
through the years one thing hasnt changed
this boy becoming a man
that's right
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i would run
i like 'em down and dirty so hold on tight
you want to take me all the way tonight
baby aint it funny how you never ever learn to fall
like we got away with the perfect crime but
then i'm wrong yes i'm wrong this aint a love song
if the pain that i'm feeling so strong
but its harder to be friends
some things we havent said
to live your life
to spend your whole damn life
we're not strangers anymore
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
'cause all we had was our innocence
dont let me fall i dont wanna fall
i dont wanna fall i dont wanna fall
but i felt like a hired hand
in a bar breathing smoke
and with a smile she got so close to me
a part that just wont die
working hard for a pass
chorus
chorus
and call me the tumblin dice
playin the field ev'ry night
the subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
in a two story town
the ghosts are calling me out
never going down down down down down
put it in a frame for you to see
and that's ugly ugly
that was my brother lost in the rubble
i found spirit they couldnt ruin it
we stand as one undivided
undivided
i'd drive all night just to get back home
chorus
is there anybody out there looking for a party yeah
'cause tonight you got the right to let your head down
how old in the back and now a public service announcement
we got it goin on
ah ha ha ah ha ha hey yeah ah ha
welcome to wherever you are
remember everybody's different
i was running away from the only thing i've ever known
just a hometown boy born a rolling stone who says you cant go home
who says you cant go home
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright its alright
whose searching for our pot of gold
i close my eyes and picture youre hand in mine
where i need find a reason to be strong
while the old men recite their story lines
they werent looking for trouble
wild wild in the streets
i tried to make you happy
that takes me away from you
somebody to be there night and day
cold is the night without your love
maybe a better man
that tears us apart
she'll draw a crowd then try to hide
well she'll tell you she's an only child until you meet her brothers
yesterday's a memory
she wasnt young but still a child
nothing else feels right without love
and nothing would mean nothing without love
and nothing would mean nothing without love
woman in love
like a woman in love
barking up your tree
and i looked up on the screen
and give them the world
you think that you can
got everything i wanted
when the seas get rough
but there aint no woman
the damage is done
a school boy's dream you act so shy
to me you look so beautiful when you cant make up your mind
you had me from hello
you had me from hello
well you're dancing with the shadow
but they dont recognize you
and you're shouting that i'm dead
but you really put me through it
if you dont know if you should stay
you wanna make a memory
you could sing a melody to me
the way of those the way of mine
i summon the motion the presence of time
the wind i my passion utterly you weep
witness yourself here alone yet bold
count the shores of the utter coast
the magma here under makes fire seems cold
where the river starts roaring i roam
an eruption of evil takes form it is i
moonlight show me the mysteries of life
the stream of mortality flows uncontrolled
the pendulum upholds the carnal deceit
to breed to grow to peak to be reborn
nature's own artful methodology
which compose water's construction
the day's crescendo dusk adorn
genesis torn
utopia found
flame my desire
the amend course
condone the cosmic hibernation
the silence was utter the sleep was long
softly covered by snow
the lightning strikes even deep in the snow
rise into a liquid dream
the parade of the quaternary symbiosis
inherit the earth
past present and future
incorporation
i grew as one with the elements
i turned grey in the storm shadows
the narrow view of what we are
as questions multiply with every solution
lies far from any genuine liberation
seeking a detailed explanation
of the fact that the stars never sensed his presence
the fringos of the canvas always stir
opening doors closing windows
as a razor sharp straw
on the thread of life
yet so completed and clear
between dimensions asunder
spilt the blood upon existence
revoke the reviavl of revolt
the solar solace within the hideous
tracing trails a furious tail
i climbed to behold
at the edge of the horizon
i climbed to behold
granted as the imious impetus
inhaling circulations of the soul
i have walked through fields of grievance
conservation of the solar fuse
reflection of a souls tear
a modest exuberance so intense
the boundary is bathing in a blur
recalling the thorn so long gone
the dream that faces everyone
mountains highest hills
the fields down there and the ravine below
wich remain on the open plains
he beholds a kingdom of grace savage yet fair
thousand senses of virtual faction
as the salt in the sea burns in me
horizons of history re erodent
acknowledged beneath the sky
declaring war beneath the sky
concealed by the essence the profane
the cries that torches swept by
the eyes that burns by sight
swallowing dimensions
all the ways that i have been
all the ways that i have been
thrice the bait dive with faith
forever its rage carries on
spawning the orbs of furious light
weaving the web of solar cast
by mountains which darken the day
to be walked by all men of might
i have seen the chaos in every course
where the moon comes glaring
i am the spine of the reversal nature
seen the children of the cold
at the end which i found
past the shores towards the mountain tops
obscure scenery changes
i am shown the way
