which fortified her visage from sun
often reading what contents bears
her hair nor loose nor tied formal plat
upon whose weeping margent she was set
enswathed seald curious secrecy
court city had let go by
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
youthful suit was gain grace
each eye saw him did enchant mind
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
came additions yet their purposed trim
young old sexes both enchanted
lands mansions theirs thought assignd
'yet did not as some equals did
put by past perils her way
though reason weep cry 'it thy last'
have suffering youth some feeling pity
so much less shame remains
paled pearls rubies red as blood
annexions fair gems enrich'd
''lo all these trophies affections hot
hallow'd sighs burning lungs did raise
spend her living eternal love
upon moment did her force subdue
must victory us all congest
stale example when thou wilt inflame
leave battery make 'gainst mine
flame through water which their hue encloses
there white stole chastity daff'd
blush at speeches rank weep at woes
naked concealed fiend he cover'd
o all borrow'd motion seeming owed
whiles both his youth virtue did intend
even hearts memories men
one superlative above rest
not he was above spleenful sense
what they do special work
which harvest did yield again crop
not fruitlessly prodigal expense
shuns glad sleights ensnaring vice
if his fate heaven had decreed
affecting fashions nor addicted wholly
seemed rather answers which wise embrace
so his mind body made an inn
clean tempered moderation steady trust
as much glory good
justice by wrong sifted embane
by fair demeanor he had won repute
how such man was sadly overthrown
th' unsteady change his fantastic forms
here shall reckoned up constant faith
when all shall turn dust from whence came
pities not thy sad sudden wrong
confess love was too remiss
t' enlarge thoughts was hindered at first
but here trust have discharged now
whereby if thou live posterity
measure thy course life false pretenses
presuming still sees even night
true 'tis this man whiles yet he was man
ready way commendation
he was not so but serious awe
his observation discreet discerning
wherein not any one thing comprehends
most true presage he discharged same
hence sprung deadly fuel revived
robbed virtue follower so true
whiles not doubting whereinto enters
according tenor saw
might manner reproved guilt
second brother who was next begot
washed white blood from earth hence have not gone
rebound gross arguments upon their heart
which being crossed gives matter bewailing
grave his ever empty womb
shall not abridge commendable thank
which underneath roof safe content
does think most safety doth remain above
birth blood ancestors are none ours
remembrance their worth may preserve
look hither then enjoy youth
his flourishing fair long lived deserts
leading by his example path
hath most share loss hers
such was separation here constrained
includes all excellence can displayed
undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now
now if have leveled mine account
who if were plenty still would want
but whether doth stream mischance
lordship's all duty
girdle embracing flames waist
unlock'd treasure his happy state
an expired date cancelld ere well begun
perchance his boast lucrece' sovereignty
neglected all swift intent he goes
virtue would stain o'er silver white
either's colour was other queen
those two armies would let him go
little suspecteth false worshipper
which having all all could not satisfy
he stories her ears her husband's fame
doth yet his fair welkin once appear
save thieves cares troubled minds wake
they scatter unloose from their bond
honour wealth oft wealth doth cost
pawning his honour obtain his lust
now serves season they may surprise
his falchion flint he softly smiteth
what following sorrow may this arise
spots stains love's modest snow white weed
some loathsome dash herald will contrive
or what fond beggar but touch crown
when thou shalt charge so black deed
as revenge or quittal such strife
thus graceless holds he disputation
where her beloved collatinus lies
self love had never drownd him flood
heart shall never countermand mine eye
so cross him their opposite persuasion
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
threshold grates door have him heard
being lighted by light he spies
he takes accidental things trial
merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
eye heaven out misty night
gazeth her yet unstained bed
whether she reflects so bright
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
pearly sweat resembling dew night
but life lived death death life
what he beheld he firmly doted
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
his eye commends leading his hand
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'd up eyes
wrapp'd confounded thousand fears
wounding itself death rise up fall
under what colour he commits this ill
where thou patience must will abide
only he hath an eye gaze beauty
which falcon towering skies
kill thine honour thy life's decay
'but if thou yield rest thy secret friend
blemish will never forgot
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
midst sentence so her accent breaks
such black payment as thou hast pretended
sighs whirlwinds labour hence heave thee
'in tarquins likeness did entertain thee
what darest thou not when once thou art king
where subjects' eyes do learn do read do look
draw not thy sword guard iniquity
o how are they wrapp'd infamies
turns not but swells higher by this let
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
'so let thy thoughts low vassals thy state'
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
her tears should drop them perpetually
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
living death pain perpetual
he thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she prays she never may behold day
upon cheeks what helpless shame feel'
black stage tragedies murders fell
his wonted height yet ere he go bed
silver shining queen he would distain
seasoning earth showers silver brine
'make not object tell tale day
will couple reproach tarquins shame
as ere this was pure collatine
honour lost drone bee
talk'd virtue o unlook'd evil
plagued cramps gouts painful fits
hold their cursed blessed fortune long
'o opportunity thy guilt great
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
being so bad such numbers seek thee
justice feasting while widow weeps
collatine would else have come
swift subtle post carrier grisly care
time's office fine hate foes
'to fill worm holes stately monuments
tame unicorn lion wild
could prevent this storm shun thy wrack
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
time see one by alms doth live
teach curse him thou taught'st this ill
greatest scandal waits greatest state
'out idle words servants shallow fools
vain spurn at confirm'd despite
kill both thyself her yielding so'
fear'd by tarquins falchion slain
poor helpless help treasure stoln away
nor laugh his companions at thy state
tongue shall utter all mine eyes sluices
revealing day through every cranny spies
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
sometime 'tis mad too much talk affords
see salve doth make wound ache more
relish nimble notes pleasing ears
keep thy sharp woes waking wretched
will find out there will unfold
'to kill myself' quoth she 'alack what were
when both were kept heaven collatine
through which may convey this troubled soul
'tis honour deprive dishonour'd life
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
how was overseen thou shalt see
fleet wing'd duty thought's feathers flies
but as earth doth weep sun being set
no cause but company her drops spilling
wherein stamp'd semblance devil
not devour'd but which doth devour
dying fear through all her body spread
'but tell girl when went' there she stay'd
repetition cannot make less
cause craves haste will soon writ'
health thy person next vouchsafe t' afford
lest he should hold her own gross abuse
then eye interprets ear
as lagging fowls before northern blast
when silly groom god wot was defect
blushing him wistly him gazed
pausing means mourn some newer way
many dry drop seem'd weeping tear
such sweet observance this work was had
face either cipher'd either's heart
wagg'd up down from his lips did fly
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
griped an armed hand himself behind
through their light joy seemed appear
find face where all distress stelld
her blue blood changed black every vein
'poor instrument' quoth she'without sound
this load wrath burning troy doth bear
plague private sin general
once set ringing his own weight goes
onward troy blunt swains he goes
he entertaind show so seeming just
rich built ilion skies were sorry
'it cannot be' quoth she'that so much guile'
came tarquin armed so beguiled
are balls quenchless fire burn thy city
she tears senseless sinon her nails
though woe heavy yet seldom sleeps
brings home his lord other company
he hath no power ask her how she fares
three times sighs she gives her sorrow fire
where no excuse can give fault amending
from alas thy lucrece not free
i'll murder straight then i'll slaughter thee
never forgot mighty rome
or at least this refuge let find
grief away stops his answer so
which speechless woe his poor she attendeth
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies' harms'
may pure mind foul act dispense
'no no' quoth she 'no dame hereafter living
harmful knife thence her soul unsheathed
from purple fountain brutus drew
about mourning congealed face
where shall live now lucrece unlived
no more can see what once was
then key cold lucrece' bleeding stream
weak words so thick come his poor heart's aid
yet neither may possess claim they lay
'my daughter' 'my wife' clamours filld
but now he throws shallow habit by
his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
kiss'd fatal knife end his vow
which being done speedy diligence
mind thy worst all best exceeds
lest guilty faults thy sweet self prove
her love whose dear love rise fall
oaths thy love thy truth thy constancy
dateless lively heat still endure
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
men discased but mistress' thrall
much liker than painted counterfeit
which hides life shows not half parts
should live twice rhyme
nor lose possession fair thou ow'st
do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time
dig deep trenches thy beauty's field
proving his beauty by succession thine
which steals mens eyes womens souls amazeth
every fair his fair doth rehearse
will not praise purpose not sell
as not self but thee will
perfect ceremony love's rite
thy beauty's form table heart
delights peep gaze therein thee
at frown they their glory die
witness duty not show wit
till then not show head where thou mayst prove
presents thy shadow sightless view
do consent shake hands torture
all alone beweep outcast state
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
his self love stop posterity
old woes new wail dear time's waste
all losses are restored sorrows end
'had friend's muse grown this growing age
ugly rack his celestial face
make travel forth without cloak
him bears strong offence's cross
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
without thy help by borne alone
as thou being mine mine thy good report
whilst this shadow doth such substance give
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
when thou art all better part
which time thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
so great sum sums yet canst not live
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
kill spites yet must not foes
chide thy beauty thy straying youth
thou dost love her because thou know'st love her
all day they view things unrespected
through heavy sleep sightless eyes doth stay
as soon as think place where he would
these present absent swift motion slide
send them back again straight grow sad
quest thoughts all tenants heart
painted banquet bids heart
when shall see thee frown defects
guard lawful reasons thy part
beauty o'er snowed bareness every where
'thus far miles are measured from thy friend'
grief lies onward joy behind
therefore desire perfect'st love being made
since seldom coming long year set
millions strange shadows tend
every blessed shape know
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
than unswept stone besmeared sluttish time
live this dwell lovers' eyes
which parts shore where two contracted new
whilst sovereign watch clock
should thought control times pleasure
self pardon self doing crime
since mind at first character was done
beauty's treasure ere self killed
death's conquest make worms thine heir
delves parallels beauty's brow
so far from home into deeds pry
all soul all every part
self so self loving were iniquity
stealing away treasure his spring
but thou none lov'st most evident
beauty still may live thine or thee
within his bending sickle's compass come
better becomes grey cheeks east
holds perfection but little moment
change day youth sullied night
but things removed hidden thee lie
from hands falsehood sure wards trust
truth proves thievish prize so dear
or state self confounded decay
though once gone all world must die
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
or who his spoil beauty can forbid
strength by limping sway disabled
lace self his society
days long since before these last so bad
without all ornament self true
but those same tongues give thee so thine own
lifts up his burning head each under eye
from his low tract look another way
thou present'st pure unstained prime
from this vile world vilest worms dwell
mock after am gone
love speak well untrue
as after sunset fadeth west
without all bail shall carry away
too base thee remembered
then bettered world may see pleasure
new found methods compounds strange
so love still telling what told
commit these waste blanks thou shalt find
heavy ignorance aloft fly
verse alone had all thy gentle grace
no praise thee but what thee doth live
singleness parts thou shouldst bear
make tongue tied speaking fame
worst was this love was decay
only herald gaudy spring
finding thy worth limit past praise
therefore fair no painting set
when others would give life bring tomb
are so dignifies his story
precious phrase by all muses filed
dumb thoughts speaking effect
which nightly gulls him intelligence
riches where deserving
place merit eye scorn
doing thee vantage double vantage
will acquaintance strangle look strange
world will wail thee makeless wife
himself such murd'rous shame commits
when other petty griefs have done their spite
wherein finds joy above rest
term life thou art assured mine
happy have thy love happy die
writ moods frowns wrinkles strange
unmoved cold temptation slow
lilies fester smell far worse than weeds
which their habitation chose out thee
basest jewel will well esteemed
from thee pleasure fleeting year
thou away very birds are mute
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
which thy soft check complexion dwells
more flowers noted yet none could see
honour's all duty
stain all nymphs more lovely than man
'and yet not cloy thy lips loathed satiety
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
steed stalled up even now
he burns bashful shame she her tears
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
pure shame awed resistance made him fret
look how he can she cannot choose but love
but when her lips were ready his pay
whose sinewy neck battle ne'er did bow
'thus he overruled oversway'd
look mine eye balls there thy beauty lies
make use time let not advantage slip
'thou canst not see one wrinkle brow
love spirit all compact fire
then woo thyself thyself rejected
'upon earth's increase why shouldst thou feed
wishing adonis had his team guide
i'll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
'art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
give one kiss i'll give thee again
red cheeks fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
'fondling' she saith 'since have hemm'd thee here
then deer since am such park
being mad before how doth she now wits
but lo from forth copse neighbors by
iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth
anon he rears upright curvets leaps
look when painter would surpass life
look what horse should have he did not lack
being proud as females are see him woo her
his testy master goeth about take him
lovers say heart hath treble wrong
his bonnet hides his angry brow
now was she just before him as he sat
all this dumb play had his acts made plain
would thou wert as am man
'for shame' he cries 'let go let go
sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
know not love' quoth he 'nor will not know
colt that's back'd burdend being young
thy mermaid's voice hath done double wrong
'say sense feeling were bereft
bid suspicion double lock door
even as wind hush'd before raineth
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes red
mend hurt his unkindness marr'd
as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine
but now died death was lively joy
drive infection from dangerous year
pay them at thy leisure one by one
or being early pluck'd sour taste
honey fee parting tender'd
glutton she feeds yet never filleth
forgetting shame's pure blush honour's wrack
chiefly love whose leave exceeds commission
poor fool prays her he may depart
hunt boar certain his friends
he will not manage her although he mount her
she hath assay'd as much as may proved
mortal butcher bent kill
being ireful lion he will venture
beauty hath nought do such foul fiends
but an earthquake shakes thee breast
sometime true news sometime false doth bring
tremble at imagination
thy well breath'd horse keep thy
sometime where earth delving conies keep
'by this poor wat far off upon hill
misery trodden by many
night spent' 'why what that' quoth she
'now this dark night perceive reason
making subject tyranny
both favour savour hue qualities
'what thy body but swallowing grave
foul cankering rust hidden treasure frets
bewitching wanton mermaid's songs
'what have urged cannot reprove
which hot tyrant stains soon bereaves
therefore sadness now will away
which after him she darts as one shore
even so confounded dark she lay
how love makes young men thrall old men dote
who hath she spend night withal
who doth world so gloriously behold
yet she hears no tidings her love
by this she hears hounds are at bay
finding their enemy so curst
she tells them 'tis causeless fantasy
thousand spleens bear her thousand ways
here she meets another sadly scowling
whereon fearful eyes they long have gazed
'if he dead o no cannot
love's golden arrow at him should have fled
crystal tide from her two cheeks fair
variable passions throng her constant woe
now reviving joy bids her rejoice
thy weal woe are both them extremes
'no no' quoth she 'sweet death did but jest
grief hath two tongues never woman yet
wail his death who lives must not die
as falcon lure away she flies
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
struggling passage earth's foundation shakes
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
his face seems twain each several limb doubled
whose tongue music now what canst thou boast
'and therefore would he put his bonnet
if he had spoke wolf would leave his prey
ne'er saw beauteous livery he wore
'had been tooth'd him must confess
she lifts coffer lids close his eyes
shall waited jealousy
'it shall sparing too full riot
perverse shall where shows most toward
his blood ground lay spilld
'poor flower' quoth she 'this was thy fathers guise
there shall not one minute an hour
spend'st thou thy fury some worthless song
give love fame faster than time wastes life
because he needs no praise wilt thou dumb
our love was new then but spring
alack what poverty muse brings forth
no other pass verses tend
three april perfumes three hot junes burned
since all alike songs praises
fair kind true have often lived alone
so all their praises are but prophecies
mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
what's brain ink may character
nor gives necessary wrinkles place
just time not time exchanged
fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
she carved thee her seal meant thereby
now all done have what shall have no end
thence comes name receives brand
love pity doth th' impression fill
critic flatterer stopped are
his quick objects hath mind no part
or whether shall say mine eye saith true
if poisoned 'tis lesser sin
alas why fearing time's tyranny
have frequent been unknown minds
as make our appetite more keen
brought medicine healthful state
how have mine eyes out their spheres been fitted
when behold violet past prime
nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
o our night woe might have remembered
why should others' false adulterate eyes
thy gift thy tables are within brain
therefore give them from was bold
rather make them born our desire
as subject time's love or time's hate
this witness call fools time
no let obsequious thy heart
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
but now black beauty's successive heir
yet so they mourn becoming their woe
so tickled they would change their state
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
o were self but love are
against stormy gusts winter's day
some perfumes there more delight
well thou know'st dear doting heart
nothing art thou black save thy deeds
prison heart thy steel bosom's ward
but thou wilt not nor he will not free
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
so thou being rich will add thy will
things great receipt case prove
they know what beauty see where lies
things right true heart eyes have erred
but wherefore says she not she unjust
tell thou lov'st elsewhere but sight
not from stars do judgement pluck
as truth beauty shall together thrive
as testy sick men when their deaths near
but 'tis heart loves what they despise
only plague thus far count gain
lawful love thee as thou lov'st those
whilst her neglected child holds her chase
two loves have comfort despair
but being both from both each friend
was used giving gentle doom
why dost thou pine within suffer dearth
so shall thou feed death feeds men
past cure am now reason past care
if fair whereon false eyes dote
canst thou o cruel say love thee not
when all best doth worship thy defect
