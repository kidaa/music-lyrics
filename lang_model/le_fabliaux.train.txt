adam created by our lord who afterward defied his word turning against him as a rebel by taking a bite of the apple if we can trust what scriptures say 5 god formed man from a lump of clay and then he took one of the ribs he'd placed in his side and with this nor more nor less with his own two hands he created woman too 10 to suffer blows is woman fated because from bone she was created get your wife used to thrashings say two or three or four times a day on the first of the week or ten 15 or twelve times every fortnight then whether she's fasting or is not she'll grow in value quite a lot the woman had a lovely neck and face but god forgot to make 20 a cunt so little care he took the devil came and had a look leaned down a bit on an incline and at the third bump on her spine saw there was only just one hole 25 he went to speak to god and told him sire you made an awful gaffe the womans incomplete by half so get to work make haste go back to 'er and install in her hinder sector 30 the thing that is most necessary because a woman isnt very valuable when there's no burrow placed close by her posterior furrow eh what said god i cant see to it 35 you'll have to go yourself and do it the devil answered i and how i'm telling you to do it now and i mean what i say eschew putting in something made by you 40 and remove nothing that i've made i'll do just that the devil said the devil gathered hammers adzes chisels mattocks sharpened axes cutting tools with double blades 45 pruning hooks and trenchant spades and gave the tools a close inspection in order to make his selection to do the job he undertook saying that no one will rebuke 50 him if he makes a spacious trough an ample suit from other's cloth he looked at every implement one by one not much time he spent and when he'd taken time to view 55 them all he was convinced he knew that with the sharp edge of the spade a great deep crevice could be made in scarcely any time at all he said that there's no better tool on earth and takes the spade and pushes it all in till the handle touches thus with a spade he made the cunt he squatted down a bit in front of her and farted on her tongue 65 that's why all women old and young must chatter on and talk such drivel faced with the fart laid by the devil she tried to push it from her mouth but still today their bodies house 70 the fart the devil left inside when he crouched by the womans side it's something we have to accept she wont give up talking except to be nice or to wheedle gifts 75 i pray that god never forgives whoever seeks to vilify them or their cunts no matter why for there's fine workmanship in them but they've destroyed many good men 80 who've come to grief and been disgraced and lost what wealth they once possessed
10brother denise by rutebeuf the monk is not made by his habit whatever cloister he inhabit however poor the clothes he wore i wouldnt give even a straw for his habit or for his dress 5 if he led a life any less pure than his vestments ought to show but many people make a show and great pretense of virtue rare who resemble those trees that bear 10 no fruit but that were fair of flower a wretched shameful death devour all people who behave this way hear what the proverb has to say not everything that shines is gold 15 for this reason ere i grow old and die i'd pen a fabliau about the fairest creature though you searched from england far as paris you wouldnt find a maiden fair as 20 she i'll tell what came to pass no less than twenty men had asked wellborn and noble for her hand but she neither wished for nor planned a life of conjugality 25 for she'd pledged her virginity to god and the virgin as well she was a noble demoiselle her sire had been a knight her mother still lived she'd no sister or brother 30 mother and child it seems to me treasured each other tenderly franciscans would quite often come by and find shelter in their home some twist of destiny once led 35 a friar there who turned her head i'll tell how he beguiled the virgin she begged him to get with much urging her mother's blessing for her daughter's desire to enter holy orders 40 most sweet and precious child he answers if you sought to follow saint francis and live his life the way we do it only stands to reason you could not fail to become a saint 45 the girl taken in by his feint convinced won over and ensnared already as soon as she heard the counsel of the friar minor replied as god may give me honor if i could be one of your order i cannot think what would afford a profounder joy to me on earth the lord blessed the hour of my birth if i could be a novice there 55 no sooner did the friar hear the answer that the maiden gave he said to her so may god save and grant me his love if i knew most noble damsel it was true 60 that it was your desire to serve our order and you could preserve without guile your virginity then know it for a certainty i'd place you in our order now 65 the maiden gives her solemn vow that she will guard her maidenhead and stay a virgin till she's dead and forthwith the friar received her his cunning subterfuge deceived her 70 from whom his artfulness was hidden upon her soul she was forbidden by him to tell what they'd agreed and likewise he explained she'd need in secret to cut her blond hair 75 careful that no one be aware of it and tonsured find a suit of clothes tailored and cut to suit a young man and disguised that way to come to him without delay 80 in a place where he's overseer that second herod of judaea arranged when they would meet then left many a tear the maiden wept to see him go though in his preaching 85 he should have glossed the text he's teaching with moral precepts and prescription he's filled her head with contradiction death cast him in the fiery pit the girl accepts as holy writ 90 the sermon that he would impart to god has she given her heart the one he's offered his up to will give him the reward he's due how very different is his thinking 95 from the high thoughts that she is thinking their two minds are contrary for it's her intention to withdraw and hide from the world's pridefulness while he hemmed in by wickedness 100 and burning with the fires of lust has set his mind and efforts just on making her accompany him to bathe in a bath where he will burn up saving god's protection 105 for she'll never raise an objection nor contradict in any way whatever he may wish to say while he is thus preoccupied the confrere walking at his side 110 seeing that he says not a word asks this question of him disturbed what are you thinking brother simon he says i'm thinking of a sermon more excellent than any other 115 i've made he answers think on brother brother simon cannot dispel or purge these thoughts his heart will dwell on the girl who remains behind and she has nothing on her mind 120 except the hour when she will gird a friar's belt his every word engraved in her heart and her soul when three days had gone by she stole away from the mother who bore 125 her leaving her heart grieved and sore anguished and sorrowful becauseshe knew not where her daughter was she suffers great distress and fright for days on end without respite 130 missing her daughter bathed in tears but the girl neither thinks nor cares about all that only of flight she's cut her lovely hair short quite like a boy's and tonsured her crown 135 put a good pair of leggings on and likewise a tunic and robe an like a mans the front stayed open with stitching in back and in front and dressed in this manner she went 140 to the location he'd advised the friar whom the antichrist holds fast to and bends to his will glad she has come announces she'll be one of their community 145 duping his confreres skillfully he dresses her in their apparel and has her come into the chapel and clerical estate confers on her seemly her conduct was 150 in cloister and before the altar she knew from end to end her psalter her voice melodious and fair joined in the brothers' songs at prayer for she'd learned to sing beautifully 155 she behaved with great probity everything miss denise has wanted to have has now been fully granted they didnt give her a new name brother denise the girl became 160 what more is there to tell you friar simon indeed did so well by her she was converted to his pleasure and learned an unfamiliar leisure activity and none perceived it his demeanor quite deceived all their confreres brother denise was gracious and eager to please brother denise was held most dear by all the brothers living there 170 but no one surpassed simons fondness who never wearied of the harness between the wagon shafts he'd pull and no office pleased him as well he was an excellent draft horse 175 and led a life debauched and coarse and strayed from the apostles' way and tutored her on how to say which she learned gladly his lord's prayer he took her with him everywhere 180 nor wished for other company until it happened he and she were put up at a knight's abode who had his cellar stocked with good wines which he was most happy sharing 185 with them his lady took to staring at the figure brother denise cuts mulling over what she sees the lady readily detects brother denise's rightful sex 190 she'll find out if it's truth or fable when they had risen from the table the lady with well mannered ease took by the hand brother denise and said giving a gracious smile 195 to her lord go outside awhile my lord and take your pleasure thus and let's pair off the four of us let brother simon go with you brother denise i've chosen to 200 hear the confession i would make these friars minor do not take it as a laughing matter they'd sooner be in pontoise it weighed heavy on them what she proposed 205 nor did it please them for it caused them fear of possible exposure brother simon moves himself closer to her and tells her urgently lady confess your sins to me 210 for this man has no competence in aught concerning penitence the lady answers him good brother i'll make confession to no other this man alone shall know my sin 215 she leads her to her chamber then closes the door and turns the keys and locked in with brother denise my dear young friend the lady said whatever put it in your head 220 to serve the church in such a fashion may the lord pardon my transgression when your soul takes leave of this earth in no way will it be the worse for you if you now tell me truly 225 i swear to you upon the holy spirit that you can trust in me the girl shaken confusedly attempts to offer explanation but no the lady's refutation 230 and arguments make such good sense they sweep away the girls defense she cries for mercy on her knees and with hands clasped she begs and pleads that she not bring her to disgrace 235 from beginning to end she says how he lured her away from home and mother and she then made known her name and laid bare the entire story the lady called the friar 240 and in her husband's presence loosed the most injurious reproof that has been heaped on any man you hypocrite you charlatan what a false filthy life you lead 245 oh it would be a blessèd deed to use the cord that binds your habit to hang you from the nearest gibbet people like you take for a ride the whole world virtuous outside 250 but inside rotten through and through the nurse who gave suckle to you did very wickedly to nurture a man who such a lovely creature would lead astray so shamefully 255 saint dennis this community is neither noble fair nor good you tell us that young people should not be allowed dancing and balls citterns and tabors and violes 260 and all delights of minstrelsy you've brought on yourself infamy you tell me mr tonsured head is this the life saint francis led you're a deceitful liar clearly 265 but here's someone who'll make you dearly pay and make sure you get your due to lock the friar up she threw a large storage box open wide brother simon fell at her side 270 facedown with both his arms stretched out the knight takes pity on the lout— his noble heart's compassionate— to see him form the cross prostrate with his right hand he lifts the friar 275 and says brother do you desire to save your hide in these dire straits procure four hundred pounds posthaste so the young lady can be wed the friar hearing what he's said felt more joy than he'd ever known and to the knight he gave his sworn word that he would pay it in full no need to post collateral where he'll get it there's plenty more 285 he takes leave and walks out the door possessed of noble qualities the lady kept young miss denise with her took care not to alarm her but adjured her with much charm 290 that she should reassure herself that besides them nobody else would ever know or have a basis to guess she'd known a mans embraces but she'd be married nobly and 295 could choose whomever in the land she most desired provided he like her had a high pedigree the lady's treatment of denise set her unquiet mind at peace 300 nothing she told her was dishonest she brought one of her very finest dresses and placed it on her bed and best as she could comforted her like someone free from deceit 305 and gently said to her my sweet child these are the clothes you will wear tomorrow she herself took care before bedtime to try them on nor would she allow anyone 310 to touch her for she wished to do it modestly and nobly too for she's a well bred noblewoman she sent her courier to summon her mother in strict confidence 315 whose heart overflowed with intense joy as soon as she laid eyes on her for she'd thought she'd lost her for sure but the lady convinced her to believe and take it to be true 320 that she'd been living with the order of the filles dieu one of whom brought her there that night and to her dismay the lady'd taken her away but why should i go on and on 325 and tell all that was said and done again and pointlessly again for a time denise stayed with them until all her dowry was paid it wasnt much longer till they'd 330 had her with her consent betrothed and married to a knight who'd loved and been her suitor in the past she was madame denise at last with more honor accorded her 335 than when she'd been a cordelier
7 the crucified priest a short exemplum about roger the suave enfranchised master carver i now propose to undertake he had the skill one needs to make statues and crucifixes he 5 no mere apprentice artfully carved sculptures in the finest fashion his wife carried away by passion had taken a priest as her lover her husband told her as a cover 10 he had to go to market so he'd bring a statuette in tow to drop off for a tidy profit and she agreed promptly enough—it elated her to see him leave 15 and he was not slow to perceive her joyful look by which he knew she had in mind to be untrue which was for her by now tradition then he lifts up into position 20 a crucifix as a pretext and steps out of the house and next goes into town and cools his heels and waits around until he feels that it's time for their tête à tête 25 shaking from spite and all irate he hurries home when he got back he looked in on them through a crack and saw them sitting down to dine he called out but it took some time 30 before someone let him inside the priest had no place he could hide he said lord what shall i do now the lady said i'll tell you how go in the shop take off your clothes 35 and standing still assume a pose among my husband's holy carvings right willingly or with misgivings the priest obeyed her then and there without his clothes completely bare 40 among the images he stood as if he'd been carved out of wood seeing he isnt in the room the good man is led to assume he's hidden with his sculpted figures 45 being intelligent he figures that first he'll drink and have a bite as if he thinks things are all right after his dinner when he'd done he went and got a whetting stone 50 and started sharpening a knife the sturdy carver told his wife now lady light a candle quickly and come into the workshop with me where i've some business to prepare 55 no word of protest did she dare but with her husband made her way directly to his atelier holding a candle to give light the master carver soon caught sight 60 of the priest with his arms stretched out whom he could spot beyond a doubt seeing his hanging balls and cock lady he says i've made a shock ing image here by not omitting 65 those virile members how unfitting i must have had too much to drink some light i'll fix it in a wink the terrified priest never stirred the husband you can take my word 70 cut off the prelate's genitalia and left him nothing without failure to warrant further amputation the priest feeling the laceration took to his heels and ran away 75 the worthy man without delay cried after him with piercing shrieks good people catch my crucifix which is escaping down the street the priest had the bad luck to meet 80 two fellows carrying a barrel he'd have been better off in arles because one rascal in that band who had a crowbar in his hand swung at his neck with it and struck 85 him down into a pile of muck when he'd been beaten to the ground just then the good man came around and dragged him home where he was forced to buy his freedom and it cost him fifteen pounds he made him pay it right then every last denier this parable has demonstrated no matter who is implicated in no case should a clergyman 95 mess with the wife of any man or hang around her i allege he'll leave his balls there as a pledge just as the priest father coustenz left his three hanging ornaments 100
6 the priest and alison by guillaume le normand with all the minstrels found today by saint eustace i cannot say exactly what kind i may be william who labors tirelessly at putting stories into rhyme 5 has made one which is really fine about a merchant womans daughter who lives by the oise near the water madame mahauld as she was called from her window for long had sold 10 garlic and onions also hats made out of well woven reeds that did not come from swampy terrain marian was her daughter's name a virgin girl and beautiful a 15 day there was when with berula in her arms from the stream and cress she walked home in her linen dress all wet to the top of her thighs upon my soul i'll not tell lies 20 she wasnt born to noble parents no lady's daughter nor a barons— a merchant woman was her mother but fair and well bred as no other who's ever come before my eyes 25 the nature of her merchandise was beeswax and pepper and cumin the chaplain of saint cyr would come in to their abode for ginger very often and to buy zedoary 30 cinnamon licorice and spice she kept in stock as merchandise and also for an herb that came from alexandria his name was alexander a rich man 35 who kept his eye on marian— he liked the way her tunic fit— so he'd go walking for a bit to take the gentle morning air and couldnt come soon enough where 40 the girls house was located—he 'd no need of a guide certainly he'll teach her everything you bet before she's said the alphabet if he can he'll have her converted 45 unless all his strength is exerted to this end his soul wont see god it's summer and the weather's hot he put a light cloth on his head he'd been to the womans homestead 50 quite a few other times before who made her living from her store where she sold neither wool nor flax the chaplain wasnt at all lax in giving the woman his greeting 55 and she rose to her feet on meeting him and said hearty welcome sir do stay on awhile with us here for dinner we'll have joy and mirth see the fat goose there on the hearth 60 she says no evil she intends while toward the girl the chaplain bends a lecherous face to regard her the chaplain had been born in ardres between calais and saint omer 65 sitting on a plank for a chair and lost in thought he's not a ninny he swears that ten pounds of his money he'd give up sooner than not do with the girl what he wishes to 70 face to face with her who was fair and comely still in her twelfth year her whose behavior was so right tenderly cared for with her white throat lovely unaffected sweet 75 they had the table set to eat in the good womans dwelling place they didnt make a meal on dace at that time or have fish at all but bittern pheasant waterfowl 80 and all there were well satisfied and the contented chaplain eyed the virgin child let his glance rest upon her newly budding breast growing on her chest like an apple at last they take away the table and have eaten all they desire within the chaplains heart a fire had been set blazing by his passion in an ingratiating fashion 90 he turns to mahauld the girls mother and says lady hear how i suffer i have been vexed for a long time but now i mean to speak my mind surely no more can i refrain 95 but am compelled to tell you plain your daughter marian the lovely has gone and wrenched the heart out of me broken inside my breast i've wealth in plenty tell me if that helps 100 i'm hoping you'll take this aright had i your daughter for one night of shiny coins i have a stack what sir the woman answers back then do you think your money can 105 buy you my daughter marian i've always tenderly cared for by both the two saints of gisors i'd say that a sour apple's worth more than the contents of your purse 110 your treasure doesnt interest me and that's a fact undoubtedly put your hands somewhere else instead dear good woman the chaplain said have pity on me for god's sake 115 i'll bring the money here you take whatever you want of my riches madame mahauld who more than itches to get at the wealth in his coffers for the priest's use and pleasure offers 120 to let him have her blond haired daughter a king or a count would have thought her a fit companion for his bed and lovemaking let it be said because her beauty was so great 125 the priest sits back down by the grate together with madame mahauld who had so often bought and sold garlic pepper and caraway the chaplains set out on his way 130 having taken his leave for home of all the men who've been tricked none ever fared worse than this priest fared a bath that she ordered prepared before you knew it was made ready 135 and upon saint eustace's body and by god she begins to swear she'll catch the chaplain in her snare in the same way you'd catch a fish then she has someone go and fetch 140 a wanton woman alison whose shapely body anyone who paid for her could take to bed now hear what madame mahauld said when she saw the loose girl come by 145 quietly laughing on the sly as someone clever might have done now by saint dennis alison i've found a husband for you dear between the river thames and here 150 no woman will be better wed for that you had me come here said alison how unkind of you to make fun of a poor girl who supports herself walking the streets 155 i'm not my dear so may it please the lord to grant me to be wise you'll have no harm from me replies mahauld you've a white fur to gain a good coat also—with a train— 160 i know of from douai and green i've poured a fresh bath do get in i'll soon pass you off as a virgin alison needed no more urging she sits down and her clothes she peels 165 off and down by the bathtub kneels and with a joyful carefree air takes off her shoes unbinds her hair and like a fish jumps in the water so that's the merchant womans daughter 170 the chaplain thinks he will possess back home the priest saw to his dress with gusto and to what he'd take with him he asked for a fur cape worth forty shillings a provins 175 based merchant who was from milan had sold to him and a coat too a word about the coat it's new bloodred and made of fine dark cloth many capons and pullets both 180 he had delivered to the house that night he wishes to carouse just as soon as the night has come do you not find when it drags on that you cannot abide the day 185 the chaplain could brook no delay but went and opened up a chest in which as william tells us next in french on parchment was a leather purse where he's sewn up altogether 190 fifteen pounds sterling currency lord how bamboozled he will be for just a penny from senlis he could well have taken his ease with her with whom he will cavort 195 when he arrives there in a short time all night long or just about he took a batch of small change out and stuffed it in his purse he did for tips to be distributed around as the case might demand madame menhould has a command for hercelot the girl who helps around the house here's something else for alexander the priest go 205 at once and say i'd have him know he shouldnt wait it's time to start out hercelot replies her heart beating for the fun of this union lady i'll bring your message to him 210 so help me god just as you please then going down the stone steps she's out of the house for by the lord and saint peter a good reward from this she swears will come to her 215 i wish a good day to you sir from her who sends greeting to you and is your friend and lover too the fair and shapely marian a sturdy silver belt the man 220 gave hercelot as her reward take this my friend but not a word about all this there's more to come hercelot answers i'll keep mum better that i were torn apart 225 than subvert your love for my part why i arranged the whole affair the chaplain gave a laugh to hear hercelot say it's all her work and has her given by his clerk 230 two fresh and new pieces of linen happy with all the gifts she's winning hercelot takes her leave and goes the chaplain then gets ready who's expecting that that night will bring 235 much joy his cock is stiffening by god more than a rutting steed he swears to god in no time he'd assail the maiden who was fair and beautiful beyond compare 240 magnificent from head to feet the priest was totally in heat for the child of madame menhould he used a long top shift to fold up the fur cape and coat he carried 245 and then off to their house he hurried fifteen pounds sterling tied up tight of which he'll be relieved all right if madame menhould has her way he enters and acts just as they 250 do who expect to have a grand old time the woman takes his hand and sits by him close to the fire as the occasion did require she had a lavish banquet laid 255 two capons a fat goose she'd made and there were also ducks and loons they drank quantities of soissons white wine and went on to devour crusty cakes baked of sifted flour 260 of which there were plenty for each then madame menhould makes a speech and asks him when their dinner's through say if you've brought the gifts with you for my daughter as you have promised 265 i came here meaning to be honest i brought all of the finery i have it here look and you'll see what stylish and well made attire you wont consider me a liar 270 when it comes time for me to leave indeed by saint simon believe me i hate selling people short he tossed down on a gaming board the fifteen pounds he's brought with him 275 the money belt he'd put it in was large and costly
hercelot now it's time that all of us got to bed menhould says light a fire there in the room where they'll retire 280 make up a bed fit for a king hercelot who does everything she can to help the priest's affairs had gone to the top of the stairs seeing to all the details and 285 she took alison by the hand where in a secret place she stood the table full of drink and food was in front of him alison get yourself ready quickly come 290 you'll be sharing the prelate's bed in the credo and alphabet he'll give you a fine education no noise now and no protestation when he takes your virginity 295 it will be harrowing for me to me this thing's completely new upon my word i promise you i've never known a man be sure that i am like rome chaste and pure 300 where no pilgrim has penetrated or night dogs bark unviolated and virginal and innocent with alison hercelot went into a very lovely room 305 through a secret door in the home she knew like the palm of her hand then returned to the chaplain and took marians hand speedily and led her so the priest could see 310 to the room by god he cant wait until it's bedtime and he'll sate himself with the joy he expects to a loft hercelot directs and slyly hurries marian— henceforth tonight the chaplain can go get it on with alison— and then hercelot comes back down and close beside him takes a seat she's given him barley for wheat 320 in place of corn she's sold him straws hercelot tells him by saint george i've put the girl to bed behind bed curtains flapping in the wind weeping and grieved beyond endurance 325 i've given her what reassurance i could and urged her that she try her utmost to fulfill your desire and you should likewise promise she will get dresses and jewelry 330 in plenty i have served you well whatever she asks for i will give her hercelot the priest says of all that i own and possess that's spoken well says hercelot 335 i also told her she must not say a word when you lie with her now dont be too rough with her sir behave yourself and be polite your sweetheart's one of the elite 340 who's lying in the curtained bower whiter than any hawthorn flower precious as any girl on earth here hercelot accept this purse the chaplain tells her and its contents— 345 a pound if not more by saint lawrence— and buy a good cloak of lamb's fleece i'm going now to take my ease with her i've so been yearning for he's pushed open the chamber door 350 without a light without a taper he has soon felt his hand brush the drapery the curtains which were hung and spread where she lay stretched out on the bed ready and waiting for the priest 355 who doesnt linger or desist he lifted the sheets and asked of her say marian are you my lover you sweet girl with no opposition then without the slightest transition 360 he quickly threw his arms around her her sighs make the room resound feigning great martyrdom for she's much professional expertise she curled up close to him and drew her 365 self on top and the chaplain knew her he fucks her even quicker than did it take him to get a prayer chanted as long as it took me to tell say you sweet girl the priest says well 370 what do you think of what we've done my heart and everything i own i mean to give you certainly if you conceive a child by me be sure it will be well looked after 375 alison kept her stifled laughter between her teeth with modesty the priest believed that the one he held in his arms was marian it wasnt—it was alison 380 the worm had turned before he knew the priest was glad and happy too till it was day and night had gone nine times he screwed and pounded on the girl truly i kid you not 385 now a word about hercelot who'd made her bed up in the chamber in which he'd exercised his member the priest insisted she sleep there hercelot who does not much care 390 to dawdle she's sly and conniving without her clothes on yet arising gets down to work kindling a flame inside a mattress on a frame made out of pea straw that they'd bundled 395 up hercelot her fire kindled then cries fire fire raise the alarm the people living in the town which was large came running and tore apart and battered down the door 400 behind which glowed the conflagration and where the priest indulged his passion the head butcher of the locality burst in without the least formality knew who the priest was when he spied 405 him and quickly dragged him aside there in the chamber close up to him may god have no part in you neither in you nor in your mistress the butcher knew about this business 410 because someone had made him wise to it the chaplain turned his eyes on her he had in hand unclad why it was alison he'd had he'd thought that it was marian 415 with the stick he was carrying the master butcher struck him in the ribs and everyone 'round him goes pounding on him with their feet 'n fists he was cruelly bruised and beaten 420 they ripped his cloak off god our sire the priest exclaims out of the fire and back into the frying pan then he jumps as fast as he can through a hatchway onto the road 425 seen ass backwards a little goat he looked like having no clothes on the townspeople were looking on and saw him naked as a buck he would not have scorned to be so lucky to have a shred of clothes on his bones the blows of those heavy sticks left marks you could see on his back and ribs and flanks they beat him black and blue and put him through the mill 435 he took off for home running still trembling like a leaf on a tree this fable clearly lets you see which william from normandy wrote and tells us the man who goes out 440 from home at night to rob or thieve or do anything else to grieve his neighbor isnt very wise whereas wherever he resides an honest man deserves praise thus 445 as the chaplain was lecherous so he was beaten and lambasted and all the money he spent wasted on fucking alison whom any one could have had for just a penny 450 whenever in her brothel though there's no more to this fabliau
5 the priest and the wolf a priest who lived in the chartrain loved the wife of another man a peasant but he caught on to't and dug a pit along the route the priest took when he came their way 5 that night a wolf happened to stray by in the dark and tumbled in and the priest likewise for his sin as was his wont he came a calling before he knew it in he'd fallen 10 the wife annoyed she had to wait for her priest who was running late called for her maid whom she directed to go find out when he's expected on her way the maid passed the pit 15 and she as well fell into it the peasant waking early thought he'd go and see what had been caught he found his pit full and he swore that he'd give all of them what for 20 he killed the wolf gelded the priest and told the maid she was dismissed on those three grave misfortune fell but for the peasant things went well the wolf who feasted on his flock 25 along with the prelate who took his wife's virtue paid in full measure one for his meal one for his pleasure
8 the priest who had a mother foisted on him this fabliau i tell you true tells us a tale of a priest who had an old beldame for a mother a bitter woman and a bother dark ugly hunchbacked and averse 5 to all the good things on this earth all looked upon her with abhorrence the priest found her beyond endurance since all she did was carp and grouse he wouldnt let her in his house 10 she was so loathsome and so dour now this priest had a paramour whom he kept clothed in fine apparel two fine fur wraps the first of squirrel the other sheepskin a good cape 15 a good overcoat and to drape her body in rich silver fabric the parish thinks it's a hot topic but the old woman carries on about her more than anyone 20 and she says to the priest himself that he does not love her a twelfth as much as his wench that is clear why he'll give her nothing to wear neither a mantle nor a coat 25 shut up he says you silly goat what right have you to aggravate me when you have bread on your plate and i give you my peas and pottage with bad grace yes for in your dotage 30 you speak to me with such ill will the old woman tells him big deal from this day forward i require that you treat me as i desire as your mother with deference 35 by saint peter the priest says hence forth she'll not get another bite from him who cares what harm she might do to him no he'll not permit it oh yes i will and you'll regret it 40 she says for i'll go straightaway to see the bishop and i'll lay bare your behavior and your life the way you treat your so called wife who gets plenty of food and clothing 45 while i have to live on your loathing although you're wealthy i am poor the old woman storms out the door hysterical and overwrought and goes straight to the bishop's court 50 falls at his feet and states her case her sons behavior's a disgrace she gets no more love or respect than a stray mongrel might expect his girlfriend's everything to him 55 he loves her more than kith or kin that one gets dresses by the score once the old womans set before the bishop her long accusation he says upon consideration 60 he'll have her son appear before him and till then he'll say no more he must come when he's summoned though the old woman left bowing low having been promised satisfaction 65 and the bishop went and took action subpoenaed her son to appear intending to make him pay dear if he wont do right by his parent he's in for trouble that's apparent 70 the day came which the bishop set to hear the cases to be pled two hundred folk assemble then both commoners and clergymen the old woman has not stayed home 75 before the bishop she has come reminding him of her appeal the bishop says to wait he'd deal with him when he came he intended to have his benefice suspended 80 and priestly privilege cut off the foolish womans simple thoughts fancied he meant hanging and tortures in punishment for his debauches ah woe is me why did i press 85 these charges she thought in distress by devils was my birth accursed when the dear child i bore and nursed is to be hanged on my account she flushed her heart began to pound 90 and she was mortally afraid the poor wretch got it in her head to fool the bishop by a con and call a different priest her son another priest arrives at court 95 just then a round potbellied sort of cleric with a double chin and the old woman raised a din and told the bishop on the spot your holiness so help me god my son is that fat priest you see he summoned him immediately and said to him renegade priest tell me why you've been such a beast to your old mother who stands there 105 as i trust my soul to god's care i'm ready to have you suspended this righteous woman who depended on your care you have left to fend for herself while your lady friend 110 has costly clothes in which to strut to what a worthy use you put the stipend that i have endowed you with the baffled priest is cowed hearing the bishop's words and says 115 so help me god your holiness my mother's been dead for some time and i do not believe that i'm acquainted with this one at all if she were i'd not have the gall 120 believe me to lie to your face by saint peter the bishop says when was there ever such a hateful deceitful priest and so ungrateful your own mother and you deny her 125 you'll be suspended do right by her or you'll be excommunicated the priest was so intimidated to hear him threatening suspension his face flushed a dark purple gentian 130 he begged the bishop to relent and gave assurance that he meant to do as he was told agreed the bishop says now take your steed and put your mother on its back 135 and make sure i hear no more flak not one complaint or accusation but give her the consideration a mother's owed and openly the priest sets out immediately 140 as soon as he's been given leave— in fact he cannot wait to leave he bears the old woman in front across the withers of his mount against his will some way or other 145 he must support her as his mother no more than a league had they gone when they met the old womans son as they were riding through a cwm he turned aside and went up to 'im 150 and questioned him on what was doing and he replied that he was going to court at the bishop's subpoena he spied his mother once he'd seen her she winked at him to ride on by 155 without inquiring how or why and he continued on his way the other priest had much to say when you come to the bishop's court may god reward you with the sort 160 of gift i got this morning brother our bishop's given me a mother and rightfully or wrongfully i'm taking the hag home with me where i must see to her support 165 the old womans son nearly roared with laughter upon hearing this good brother why take it amiss if it's your mother you maintain you have no just cause to complain 170 whose mine the devil the priest said you mean the devils dam instead this womans no mother of mine the other said now that's a fine and wondrous marvel by the savior 175 if someone would do you the favor of feeding this mother of yours and till she died from his own stores supplied her every earthly need assuming the old girl agreed 180 what would you pay him brother dear the priest replies now by saint cyr whom i serve most devotedly i'd not be cheap or niggardly whoever takes her off my hands 185 unless the old girl countermands it gets sixty pounds for his trouble let's have the money on the double he says for that i'll set you free dont go back on our deal says he 190 and the old girl must give permission i'll go along with your decision she tells them as god is my witness the two priests finalize the business and arrange an installment plan 195 now the old womans real son can spend lavishly and neednt fret because the one who's in his debt will pay off everything he owes i've told you enough fabliaux 200
4 how the priest read the passion story i've something wonderful to tell a rarity a nonpareil about a priest and none too smart it was good friday at the start of god's service and the priest had 5 put on his vestments and was clad and all the people were in church he'd lost his straws and had to search for his place he began to look through all the pages in his book 10 but he'd have hunted in this fashion till doomsday and not found the passion the peasants were all in a hurry and starting in on grumbling for he was making them prolong their fast 15 it would be dinnertime at last when the divine service was done but why should i go on and on they all sat there and fidgeted and so here's what the prelate did 20 he launched into a reading now at first quite loud then very low dixit dominus domino meo as for a rhyme in o i cant find any nor make head 25 or tail of all this if i said it as best i can i'd do better the priest went following the letter of his text as blind fortune led till sunday vespers had been said 30 he wanted i need hardly state to have a full donation plate so he cried barrabam aloud no town crier has ever crowed a ban with such a booming yell 35 and everyone who heard him fell to beating his breast in contrition he had them in a good position honest to god in whom no guile is found the priest who all the while 40 went reading straight on through his psalter again starts crying helter skelter this time with crucifige eum the church resounded with his mayhem and every man and every woman 45 heard him and prayed to god in common to save them from eternal torments but his clerk is fed up and comments to him fac finis make an end the priest replies i wont my friend 50 until i reach the miracles the clerk immediately tells him lengthy passions do not sit well and he will not benefit by overtaxing his flock's patience 55 so when they'd given their donations he quickly polished off the passion my fabliau shows in this fashion that by the faith i owe saint paul talking nonsense and folderol 60 equally well exemplifies a fool just as someone who's wise will speak sense when he goes about it and no one but a fool would doubt it
9 the cunt blessed by a bishop a bishop lived in days gone by who very readily would lie with women married and unmarried of lovely ones he found his share he'd give gifts to them generously 5 and so they'd do whatever he asked for all women long for wealth and he who's nothing but himself to give will never win their favors that's one of womens learned behaviors 10 close to the city of bayeux i think it was a league or two away the bishop had somewhere to stay a fine house he'd built there i dont know the name of the town 15 but when he wanted to have fun the bishop often went to stay there since it was a ways away in that same town a priest lived who was clever and was tricky too 20 a woman lived with him as wife the greatest love he had in life and worthy and well bred was she this irked the bishop mightily who as he very often said 25 to him disapproved and forbade him to keep her under his roof in fair words the priest said in truth he could not bear the separation the bishop says no hesitation 30 will i allow you must comply with our will or otherwise i forbid you to drink wine again the priest says i'd sooner abstain from drinking wine for my entire 35 life i swear by saint martin sire the priest goes back to where he lives thereupon and openly grieves of this to his wife who awaits him by god auberée he states 40 now i've been struck by a great mishap i may not drink wine for the bishop forbids me to so he's decreed sir by god's holy saints indeed if he wont let you drink wine he 45 must be a hardened enemy of yours who drink it with such gusto since he commands it though you must so you'll drink it no more by my head but have to gulp it down instead gulp it down henceforth as commanded now that your drinking days are ended as i advise and tell you plain the priest did not at all disdain to act upon her way of thinking 55 he took up gulping gave up drinking and when he felt like it he'd do it and went on till the bishop knew it who turned him in i've not the least idea but he summoned the priest 60 and orders him that he must choose either never to dine on goose again or give the woman up he says sir it's a bitter cup i have to drink what you ordain 65 certainly goes against the grain but it wont do you any good though i leave in a sorry mood the priest then left no longer waited went back to his wife and related 70 how he has lost the taste of goose the bishop forbids him its use lady he says to her i swore that i would dine on goose no more indeed she says can this be true 75 he has dealt wickedly with you that cheap black hearted churl she answers in faith you'll just have to eat ganders galore whomever it may hurt we have here as you know more than thirty 80 in the name of god says he i'm game so he did for a long time until someone again disclosed it to the bishop who imposed a sanction against feather beds 85 in faith what you've come up with says the priest is lunatic and reckless am i a hermit or a recluse but since it is your pleasure i am now forbidden thus to lie 90 me down then that's what i must do thereupon he went back home to his wife laid out what had occurred and she says have you ever heard such madness and insanity 95 the bishop feels no amity nor cares much for you i'll allow you but it wont help him there's more value in two cents minted in anjou i'll lay some cushions out for you 100 and make a soft and comfy bed as i trust saint paul what you've said is right and proper says the priest since you've advised this not the least will he perturb me anymore 105 it wasnt all that long before the bishop made a trip and went off to the town and there he spent an entire week and only then did he return back home again 110 there in the town a woman dwelt for whom the am'rous bishop felt great love without fail every night he went to lie down by her side for she'd not go to him whatever 115 pledges he'd make or gifts he'd give her she was so very proud and vain and acted toward him with disdain at length one night it seems to me they had agreed that she and he 120 would bed down and lie with each other but the priest was quick to discover all the details of what they'd plotted and being sad and heavyhearted because the bishop had said to him 125 that he may not live with a woman the memory is with him still he affirms not anything will prevent him from going to speak with the woman he went to seek 130 her out and straightaway he said lady may god come to my aid your assistance would much avail me be careful that you do not fail me or i'll no longer be your friend 135 sir she says let me understand how i can be of help to you and what i can i'll gladly do what service do you want provided lady i've no intent to hide it 140 the priest says i mean no offense by this the bishop who intends to lie in bed tonight with you and have his pleasure of you too as i have heard it said he would 145 do let me if you'll be so good in friendship and neighborliness hide and conceal myself someplace close to your bed behind the curtain i'll make it worth your while i'm certain 150 if you will do that much for me in faith she answers i agree i'm very glad to do it so without further delay now go get out of sight and remain hidden 155 gladly since that is what you've bidden he hides himself concealed behind the bed curtains which make a blind for him and stays till day has set when the bishop did not forget 160 where it was he's supposed to go he left with four servants in tow and went straight without hesitating to see the woman who was waiting unobtrusively with her maid i cant think what more needs be said except the bedding was turned down with all the curtains tightly drawn and two glowing candles alight filling the bedroom with their light 170 the lady was the first to climb into the bed and with no time wasted the bishop got in with her his penis starting to grow stiffer with her unclothed and him beside her 175 he cannot wait to mount and ride her but she will not allow him to do anything he wants to do father she tells him not so fast if you want to do what you asked 180 of me before you turn to messing with my body and cunt a blessing you must pronounce and make as well the sign of the cross for i tell you it's never been consecrated 185 now raise your right hand high she stated and give your blessing right away exactly as another day you would proceed if it were done on the head of a peasant's son 190 if he were taking holy orders the bishop takes in what she orders that lay a hand on her he wont unless he first has blessed her cunt he said ma'am by the faith i owe 195 you what you want i will bestow you ask for it and i agree the deed entails no loss for me over her cunt the bishop made the sign of the cross and then said 200 benedico per omnia in seculorum secula as for the priest in hiding when he heard him he chimed in amen and as soon as the bishop heard 205 him—you can be sure he was scared by the rejoinder the priest made— he raised his voice a bit and said who is it who made that reply your grace he said that wretch am i 210 whose wife you'd take away from him only because that is your whim also the one whom you forbade to drink wine and i have obeyed today i heard the information 215 that you'd perform an ordination i'd like to witness that i thought the bishop heartily guffawed and said you laid a trap for me and caught me by your trickery 220 i henceforth give you my permission to drink wine and eat peppered chicken and dine on goose as much as you would like and keep your woman too just you keep well out of my sight 225 off goes the priest in great delight
2 trollops and troupers when god first made and filled the earth with people and throughout its girth all creatures that belong there then he set up three orders of men to live on earth by his decree 5 the clergy knights and peasantry each has his place he gave the rights to own and govern to the knights and to the clergy tithes and alms and last of all he gave the farms 10 to peasants to be sown and tilled and thereupon his task fulfilled he left his creatures and withdrew as he was leaving into view there came the profligates in hordes 15 the entertainers and the bawds he'd not gone far when they approached him began to cry out and reproached him where are you going lord do say a word to us dont leave us stay 20 we're given nothing and are slighted though for the others you've provided hearing them our heavenly sire looked on them and deigned to inquire of saint peter who's standing near 25 about those people over there he answered they're a surly race also created through your grace like those who place their trust in you they're clamoring that for them too 30 you see fit to make some provision our lord corrected the omission but spoke no word to them instead he went straight to the knights and said you lords to whom i gave all lands 35 to rule i now place in your hands the entertainers as your charge to live among your entourage be generous and openhanded with them for i your god command it 40 and do not treat them with disdain and you my clergy shall maintain the harlots under your protection in accordance with my direction in keeping with the lord's decree 45 the clergy supports harlotry holding these women in esteem and making sure they get the cream of all of mother church's riches contrariwise my fable teaches 50 if you have understood it well as for the knights they'll go to hell they look with scorn on the performers who must live poorer than a dormouse and go about without a pair 55 of shoes while whores get furs to wear and well lined cloaks and fine attire the entertainers for their hire get little enough of their lords for all their fine and noble words 60 they give them only worn out garments and toss them as they would to varmints of their fine dinners scraps and messes while harlots often change their dresses sleep with their priests and what they're fed 65 is counted in the overhead the priests do this for their souls' sake whereas the stingy knights forsake the entertainers and are damned for violating god's command 70 not so the priestly class because they're generous and serve their whores their actions are my evidence they lay out the inheritance and the wealth of christ crucified 75 keeping their mistresses supplied out of their rents tithes and donations and merit our congratulations above all others for this act if what my fable tells is fact 80 the clergy is assured salvation and the knights will go to damnation
