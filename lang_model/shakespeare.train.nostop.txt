empty
sonnets
by william shakespeare
empty
from fairest creatures desire increase
thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted thine own bright eyes
making famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe thy sweet self too cruel
thou art now world's fresh ornament
only herald gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
tender churl mak'st waste niggarding
pity world or else this glutton
eat world's due by grave thee
empty
dig deep trenches thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed now
will tattered weed small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all treasure thy lusty days
say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer 'this fair child mine
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were new made when thou art old
see thy blood warm when thou feelst cold
empty
look thy glass tell face thou viewest
now time face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile world unbless some mother
where she so fair whose uneared womb
or who he so fond will tomb
his self love stop posterity
thou art thy mother's glass she thee
calls back lovely april her prime
so thou through windows thine age shalt see
despite wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not
die single thine image dies thee
empty
upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
being frank she lends those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
bounteous largess given thee give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great sum sums yet canst not live
having traffic thy self alone
thou thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must tombed thee
which used lives th' executor
empty
those hours gentle work did frame
lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play tyrants very same
unfair which fairly doth excel
never resting time leads summer
sap checked frost lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'er snowed bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
liquid prisoner pent walls glass
beauty's effect beauty were bereft
nor nor no remembrance what was
but flowers distilled though they winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
empty
thee thy summer ere thou distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
beauty's treasure ere self killed
use not forbidden usury
which happies those pay willing loan
that's thy self breed another thee
or ten times happier ten one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten thine ten times refigured thee
leaving thee living posterity
not self willed thou art much too fair
death's conquest make worms thine heir
empty
lo orient when gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage his new appearing sight
serving looks his sacred majesty
having climbed steep up heavenly hill
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch weary car
feeble age he reeleth from day
eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract look another way
so thou thy self out going thy noon
unlooked diest unless thou get son
empty
sweets sweets war not joy delights joy
why lov'st thou which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st pleasure thine annoy
if true concord well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
singleness parts thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband another
strikes each each by mutual ordering
who all one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
empty
fear wet widow's eye
thou consum'st thy self single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap die
world will wail thee makeless wife
world will thy widow still weep
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husband's shape mind
look what an unthrift world doth spend
shifts but his place still world enjoys
but beauty's waste hath world an end
kept unused user so destroys
no love toward others bosom sits
himself such murd'rous shame commits
empty
who thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved many
but thou none lov'st most evident
thou art so possessed murd'rous hate
'gainst thy self thou stick'st not conspire
seeking beauteous roof ruinate
which repair should thy chief desire
o change thy thought may change mind
shall hate fairer lodged than gentle love
or thy self at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self love
beauty still may live thine or thee
empty
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
one thine from which thou departest
fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty increase
if all were minded so times should cease
threescore year would make world away
let those whom nature hath not made store
harsh featureless rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst bounty cherish
she carved thee her seal meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let copy die
empty
see brave day sunk hideous night
when behold violet past prime
sable curls all silvered o'er white
when lofty trees see barren leaves
which erst from heat did canopy herd
summer's green all girded up sheaves
borne bier white bristly beard
then thy beauty do question make
thou among wastes time must go
die as fast as they see others grow
nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
save breed brave him when he takes thee hence
empty
o were self but love are
no longer yours than self here live
against this coming end should prepare
sweet semblance some other give
so should beauty which hold lease
self again after self's decease
when sweet issue sweet form should bear
who lets so fair house fall decay
which husbandry honour might uphold
against stormy gusts winter's day
barren rage death's eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear love know
had father let son say so
empty
yet methinks have astronomy
but not tell good or evil luck
plagues dearths or seasons' quality
nor can fortune brief minutes tell
pointing each his thunder rain wind
or say princes if shall go well
by oft predict heaven find
but from thine eyes knowledge derive
constant stars them read such art
if from thy self store thou wouldst convert
or else thee this prognosticate
thy end truth's beauty's doom date
empty
when consider every thing grows
holds perfection but little moment
this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon stars secret influence comment
when perceive men as plants increase
vaunt their youthful sap at height decrease
wear their brave state out memory
then conceit this inconstant stay
sets most rich youth before sight
where wasteful time debateth decay
change day youth sullied night
all war time love
as he takes from engraft new
empty
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
fortify self decay
means more blessed than barren rhyme
now stand top happy hours
many maiden gardens yet unset
virtuous wish would bear living flowers
much liker than painted counterfeit
so should lines life life repair
which this time's pencil or pupil pen
can make live self eyes men
give away self keeps self still
must live drawn by own sweet skill
empty
who will believe verse time come
if were filled most high deserts
though yet heaven knows but as tomb
which hides life shows not half parts
if could write beauty eyes
age come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
so should papers yellowed their age
scorned old men less truth than tongue
true rights termed poet's rage
stretched metre an antique song
but were some child yours alive time
should live twice rhyme
empty
thou art more lovely more temperate
rough winds do shake darling buds may
summer's lease hath all too short date
sometime too hot eye heaven shines
often his gold complexion dimmed
every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession fair thou ow'st
when eternal lines time thou grow'st
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this this gives life thee
empty
devouring time blunt thou lions paws
make earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck keen teeth from fierce tiger's jaws
burn long lived phoenix her blood
make glad sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
wide world all her fading sweets
but forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not thy hours love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there thine antique pen
him thy course untainted do allow
beauty's pattern succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
love shall verse ever live young
empty
hast thou master mistress passion
womans gentle heart but not acquainted
shifting change as false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false rolling
gilding object whereupon gazeth
man hue all hues his controlling
which steals mens eyes womens souls amazeth
woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell doting
by adding one thing purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out womens pleasure
mine thy love thy love's use their treasure
empty
so not as muse
stirred by painted beauty his verse
who heaven self ornament doth use
every fair his fair doth rehearse
making couplement proud compare
aprils first born flowers all things rare
heavens air this huge rondure hems
o let true love but truly write
then believe love as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed heavens air
let them say more hearsay well
will not praise purpose not sell
empty
so long as youth thou are one date
but when thee time's furrows behold
then look death days should expiate
all beauty doth cover thee
but seemly raiment heart
which thy breast doth live as thine
how can then elder than thou art
o therefore love thyself so wary
as not self but thee will
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not thy heart when mine slain
thou gav'st thine not give back again
empty
as an unperfect actor stage
who his fear put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so fear trust forget say
mine own love's strength seem decay
o'ercharged burthen mine own love's might
o let looks then eloquence
dumb presagers speaking breast
who plead love look recompense
more than tongue more hath more expressed
o learn read what silent love hath writ
hear eyes belongs love's fine wit
empty
thy beauty's form table heart
body frame wherein 'tis held
perspective best painter's art
through painter must see his skill
find where true image pictured lies
which bosom's shop hanging still
hath his windows glazed thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape thine
delights peep gaze therein thee
yet eyes this cunning want grace their art
they draw but what they see know not heart
empty
let those who are favour their stars
public honour proud titles boast
whilst whom fortune such triumph bars
unlooked joy honour most
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
themselves their pride lies buried
at frown they their glory die
painful warrior famoused fight
after thousand victories once foiled
from book honour razed quite
all rest forgot which he toiled
then happy love am beloved
where may not remove nor removed
empty
thy merit hath duty strongly knit
thee send this written embassage
witness duty not show wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare wanting words show
but hope some good conceit thine
thy souls thought all naked will bestow
till whatsoever star guides moving
points graciously fair aspect
show worthy thy sweet respect
then may dare boast how do love thee
till then not show head where thou mayst prove
empty
weary toil haste bed
dear respose limbs travel tired
but then begins journey head
work mind when body's work's expired
then thoughts from far where abide
keep drooping eyelids open wide
looking darkness which blind do see
save souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow sightless view
which jewel hung ghastly night
makes black night beauteous her old face new
lo thus by day limbs by night mind
thee self no quiet find
empty
am debarred benefit rest
when day's oppression not eased by night
but day by night night by day oppressed
each though enemies either's reign
do consent shake hands torture
one by toil other complain
how far toil still farther off from thee
tell day please him thou art bright
dost him grace when clouds do blot heaven
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st even
but day doth daily draw sorrows longer
night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
empty
when disgrace fortune mens eyes
all alone beweep outcast state
trouble deaf heaven bootless cries
look upon self curse fate
wishing one more rich hope
desiring this mans art mans scope
what most enjoy contented least
yet these thoughts self almost despising
haply think thee then state
lark at break day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
then scorn change state kings
empty
summon up remembrance things past
sigh lack many thing sought
old woes new wail dear time's waste
then can drown an eye unused flow
precious friends hid death's dateless night
weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
moan th' expense many vanished sight
then can grieve at grievances foregone
heavily from woe woe tell o'er
which new pay as if not paid before
but if while think thee dear friend
all losses are restored sorrows end
empty
thy bosom endeared all hearts
which by lacking have supposed dead
there reigns love all love's loving parts
all those friends which thought buried
how many holy obsequious tear
as interest dead which now appear
but things removed hidden thee lie
thou art grave where buried love doth live
hung trophies lovers gone
who all their parts thee did give
due many now thine alone
their images loved view thee
thou all they hast all all
empty
when churl death bones dust shall cover
shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines thy deceased lover
compare them bett'ring time
though they outstripped by every pen
reserve them love not their rhyme
exceeded by height happier men
o then vouchsafe but this loving thought
'had friend's muse grown this growing age
march ranks better equipage
but since he died poets better prove
theirs their style i'll read his his love'
empty
full many glorious morning have seen
flatter mountain tops sovereign eye
kissing golden face meadows green
gilding pale streams heavenly alchemy
anon permit basest clouds ride
from forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen west this disgrace
even so sun one early morn did shine
all triumphant splendour brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
region cloud hath masked him from now
yet him this love no whit disdaineth
suns world may stain when heavens sun staineth
empty
make travel forth without cloak
let base clouds o'ertake way
hiding thy brav'ry their rotten smoke
'tis not enough through cloud thou break
dry rain storm beaten face
no man well such salve can speak
heals wound cures not disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic grief
though thou repent yet have still loss
him bears strong offence's cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
they are rich ransom all ill deeds
empty
no more grieved at which thou hast done
roses have thorns silver fountains mud
clouds eclipses stain both moon sun
loathsome canker lives sweetest bud
all men make faults even this
self corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
thy sensual fault bring sense
thy adverse party thy advocate
'gainst self lawful plea commence
such civil war love hate
an accessary needs must
sweet thief which sourly robs from
empty
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots do remain
without thy help by borne alone
our two loves there but one respect
though our lives separable spite
which though alter not love's sole effect
yet doth steal sweet hours from love's delight
may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest bewailed guilt should do thee shame
unless thou take honour from thy name
but do not so love thee such sort
as thou being mine mine thy good report
empty
as decrepit father takes delight
see his active child do deeds youth
so made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all comfort thy worth truth
whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
entitled thy parts do crowned sit
make love engrafted this store
so then am not lame poor nor despised
whilst this shadow doth such substance give
thy abundance am sufficed
by part all thy glory live
look what best best wish thee
this wish have then ten times happy
empty
while thou dost breathe pour'st into verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
every vulgar paper rehearse
o give thy self thanks if aught
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
who's so dumb cannot write thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
thou tenth muse ten times more worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
eternal numbers outlive long date
if slight muse do please these curious days
pain mine but thine shall praise
empty
o how thy worth manners may sing
when thou art all better part
what can mine own praise mine own self bring
what is't but mine own when praise thee
even this let us divided live
by this separation may give
due thee which thou deserv'st alone
o absence what torment wouldst thou prove
were not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
entertain time thoughts love
which time thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
thou teachest how make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain
empty
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love love thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if love thou love receivest
cannot blame thee love thou usest
but yet blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste what thy self refusest
do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all poverty
bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
lascivious grace whom all ill well shows
kill spites yet must not foes
empty
those pretty wrongs liberty commits
when am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty thy years full well befits
still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art therefore won
when woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay but yet thou mightst seat forbear
chide thy beauty thy straying youth
who lead thee their riot even there
where thou art forced break twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her thee
thine by thy beauty being false
empty
yet may said loved her dearly
she hath thee wailing chief
loss love touches more nearly
loving offenders thus will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou know'st love her
sake even so doth she abuse
suff'ring friend sake approve her
if lose thee loss love's gain
losing her friend hath found loss
both sake lay this cross
but here's joy friend are one
sweet flattery then she loves but alone
empty
when most wink then do mine eyes best see
all day they view things unrespected
but when sleep dreams they look thee
darkly bright are bright dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
clear day thy much clearer light
when unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would say mine eyes blessed made
by looking thee living day
when dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights see till see thee
nights bright days when dreams do show thee
empty
injurious distance should not stop way
then despite space would brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although foot did stand
upon farthest earth removed from thee
nimble thought can jump both sea land
as soon as think place where he would
but ah thought kills am not thought
leap large lengths miles when thou art gone
must attend time's leisure moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges either's woe
empty
other two slight air purging fire
are both thee wherever abide
first thought other desire
these present absent swift motion slide
when these quicker elements are gone
life being made four two alone
sinks down death oppressed melancholy
until life's composition recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
thy fair health recounting
this told joy but then no longer glad
send them back again straight grow sad
empty
how divide conquest thy sight
mine eye heart thy picture's sight would bar
heart mine eye freedom right
heart doth plead thou him dost lie
closet never pierced crystal eyes
but defendant doth plea deny
says him thy fair appearance lies
side this title impanelled
quest thoughts all tenants heart
clear eye's moiety dear heart's part
as thus mine eye's due thy outward part
heart's right thy inward love heart
empty
betwixt mine eye heart league took
each doth good turns now unto other
when mine eye famished look
or heart love sighs himself doth smother
love's picture then eye doth feast
another time mine eye heart's guest
his thoughts love doth share part
so either by thy picture or love
thy self away art present still
thou not farther than thoughts canst move
am still them they thee
or if they sleep thy picture sight
awakes heart heart's eye's delight
empty
each trifle under truest bars thrust
use might unused stay
from hands falsehood sure wards trust
but thou whom jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now greatest grief
thou best dearest mine only care
art left prey every vulgar thief
thee have not locked up any chest
save where thou art not though feel thou art
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come part
even thence thou wilt stoln fear
truth proves thievish prize so dear
empty
against time if ever time come
when shall see thee frown defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called audit by advised respects
against time when thou shalt strangely pass
when love converted from thing was
shall reasons find settled gravity
against time do ensconce here
within knowledge mine own desert
this hand against self uprear
guard lawful reasons thy part
leave poor thou hast strength laws
since why love can allege no cause
empty
when what seek weary travels end
doth teach case repose say
'thus far miles are measured from thy friend'
beast bears tired woe
plods dully bear weight
as if by some instinct wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
bloody spur cannot provoke him
sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
more sharp than spurring his side
same groan doth put this mind
grief lies onward joy behind
empty
thus can love excuse slow offence
dull bearer when from thee speed
from where thou art why should haste thence
till return posting no need
o what excuse will poor beast then find
then should spur though mounted wind
winged speed no motion shall know
then can no horse desire keep pace
therefore desire perfect'st love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh his fiery race
but love love thus shall excuse jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee i'll run give him leave go
empty
can bring him his sweet up locked treasure
which he will not every hour survey
blunting fine point seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn so rare
since seldom coming long year set
stones worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels carcanet
so time keeps as chest
or as wardrobe which robe doth hide
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are whose worthiness gives scope
being had triumph being lacked hope
empty
what substance whereof are made
millions strange shadows tend
since every one hath every one one shade
but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis counterfeit
helens cheek all art beauty set
grecian tires are painted new
speak spring foison year
one doth shadow beauty show
other as bounty doth appear
every blessed shape know
all external grace have some part
but none none constant heart
empty
by sweet ornament which truth doth give
rose looks fair but fairer deem
sweet odour which doth live
canker blooms have full as deep dye
as perfumed tincture roses
hang such thorns play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but their virtue only their show
they live unwooed unrespected fade
their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
so beauteous lovely youth
when shall fade verse distills truth
empty
not marble nor gilded monuments
princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but shall shine more bright these contents
than unswept stone besmeared sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
living record memory
'gainst death all oblivious enmity
shall pace forth praise shall still find room
even eyes all posterity
wear this world out ending doom
so till judgment self arise
live this dwell lovers' eyes
empty
thy edge should blunter than appetite
which but day by feeding allayed
morrow sharpened his former might
so love thou although day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink fulness
morrow see again do not kill
spirit love perpetual dulness
let this sad interim ocean
which parts shore where two contracted new
return love more blest may view
or call winter which being full care
makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
empty
being slave what should do but tend
upon hours times desire
have no precious time at all spend
nor services do till require
nor dare chide world without end hour
nor think bitterness absence sour
when have bid servant once adieu
nor dare question jealous thought
where may or affairs suppose
but sad slave stay think nought
save where are how happy make those
so true fool love will
though do any thing he thinks no ill
empty
should thought control times pleasure
or at hand th' account hours crave
being vassal bound stay leisure
o let suffer being at beck
th' imprisoned absence liberty
patience tame sufferance bide each check
without accusing injury
where list charter so strong
self may privilage time
self pardon self doing crime
am wait though waiting so hell
not blame pleasure ill or well
empty
if there nothing new but which
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring invention bear amis
second burthen former child
o record could backward look
show image some antique book
since mind at first character was done
might see what old world could say
this composed wonder frame
whether are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution same
o sure am wits former days
subjects worse have given admiring praise
empty
so do our minutes hasten their end
each changing place which goes before
sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once main light
crawls maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
time gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix flourish set youth
delves parallels beauty's brow
nothing stands but his scythe mow
yet times hope verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
empty
thy will thy image should keep open
heavy eyelids weary night
dost thou desire slumbers should broken
while shadows thee do mock sight
thy spirit thou send'st from thee
find out shames idle hours
scope tenure thy jealousy
o no thy love though much not so great
love keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love doth rest defeat
play watchman ever thy sake
thee watch whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from far off others all too near
empty
all soul all every part
this sin there no remedy
so grounded inward heart
methinks no face so gracious as mine
no shape so true no truth such account
self mine own worth do define
as all other all worths surmount
but when glass shows self indeed
beated chopt tanned antiquity
self so self loving were iniquity
'tis thee self self praise
painting age beauty thy days
empty
against love shall as am now
time's injurious hand crushed o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood filled his brow
lines wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled age's steepy night
are vanishing or vanished out sight
stealing away treasure his spring
such time do now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
he shall never cut from memory
sweet love's beauty though lover's life
his beauty shall these black lines seen
they shall live he them still green
empty
rich proud cost outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers see down rased
brass eternal slave mortal rage
when have seen hungry ocean gain
advantage kingdom shore
firm soil win watery main
increasing store loss loss store
when have seen such interchange state
or state self confounded decay
time will come take love away
this thought as death which cannot choose
but weep have which fears lose
empty
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how this rage shall beauty hold plea
whose action no stronger than flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
black ink love may still shine bright
empty
as behold desert beggar born
needy nothing trimmed jollity
purest faith unhappily forsworn
gilded honour shamefully misplaced
maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
right perfection wrongfully disgraced
strength by limping sway disabled
art made tongue tied by authority
folly doctor controlling skill
captive good attending captain ill
tired all these from these would gone
save die leave love alone
empty
ah wherefore infection should he live
his presence grace impiety
sin by him advantage should achieve
lace self his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses shadow since his rose true
why should he live now nature bankrupt
beggared blood blush through lively veins
she hath no exchequer now but his
proud many lives upon his gains
o him she stores show what wealth she had
days long since before these last so bad
empty
when beauty lived died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs fair were born
or durst inhabit living brow
before golden tresses dead
right sepulchres were shorn away
live second life second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament self true
robbing no old dress his beauty new
him as map doth nature store
show false art what beauty was yore
empty
those parts thee world's eye doth view
want nothing thought hearts can mend
all tongues voice souls give thee due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus outward praise crowned
other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than eye hath shown
they look into beauty thy mind
guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
thy fair flower add rank smell weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
soil this thou dost common grow
empty
slander's mark was ever yet fair
ornament beauty suspect
crow flies heavens sweetest air
so thou good slander doth but approve
thy worth greater being wooed time
canker vice sweetest buds doth love
thou present'st pure unstained prime
thou hast passed by ambush young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms hearts shouldst owe
empty
no longer mourn when am dead
than shall hear surly sullen bell
give warning world am fled
from this vile world vilest worms dwell
nay if read this line remember not
sweet thoughts would forgot
if thinking then should make woe
o if say look upon this verse
when perhaps compounded am clay
do not so much as poor name rehearse
but let love even life decay
lest wise world should look into moan
mock after am gone
empty
what merit lived should love
after death dear love forget quite
can nothing worthy prove
unless would devise some virtuous lie
do more than mine own desert
hang more praise upon deceased
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest true love may seem false this
love speak well untrue
live no more shame nor nor
am shamed by which bring forth
so should love things nothing worth
empty
time year thou mayst behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against cold
bare ruined choirs where late sweet birds sang
thou seest twilight such day
which by by black night doth take away
death's second self seals up all rest
thou seest glowing such fire
ashes his youth doth lie
as death bed whereon must expire
consumed which was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
love well which thou must leave ere long
empty
without all bail shall carry away
life hath this line some interest
which memorial still thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
very part was consecrate thee
earth can have but earth which his due
spirit thine better part
so then thou hast but lost dregs life
prey worms body being dead
too base thee remembered
worth which contains
this this thee remains
empty
so are thoughts as food life
or as sweet seasoned showers are ground
peace hold such strife
as 'twixt miser his wealth found
now proud as an enjoyer anon
now counting best alone
then bettered world may see pleasure
sometime all full feasting sight
by by clean starved look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what had or must from took
thus do pine surfeit day by day
or gluttoning all or all away
empty
so far from variation or quick change
why time do not glance aside
new found methods compounds strange
why write still all one ever same
keep invention noted weed
every word doth almost tell name
showing their birth where they did proceed
o know sweet love always write
love are still argument
spending again what already spent
as sun daily new old
so love still telling what told
empty
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
this book this learning mayst thou taste
wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
commit these waste blanks thou shalt find
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
take new acquaintance thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee much enrich thy book
empty
found such fair assistance verse
as every alien pen hath got use
under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes taught dumb high sing
heavy ignorance aloft fly
have added feathers learned's wing
given grace double majesty
yet most proud which compile
whose influence thine born thee
arts thy sweet graces graced
but thou art all art dost advance
as high as learning rude ignorance
empty
whilst alone did call upon thy aid
verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now gracious numbers are decayed
sick muse doth give an other place
grant sweet love thy lovely argument
yet what thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee pays thee again
he lends thee virtue he stole word
from thy behaviour beauty doth he give
found thy cheek he can afford
no praise thee but what thee doth live
then thank him not which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
empty
knowing better spirit doth use name
praise thereof spends all his might
make tongue tied speaking fame
but since worth wide as ocean
humble as proudest sail doth bear
saucy bark inferior far his
broad main doth wilfully appear
shallowest help will hold up afloat
whilst he upon soundless deep doth ride
he tall building goodly pride
then if he thrive cast away
worst was this love was decay
empty
or shall live epitaph make
or survive when earth am rotten
from hence memory death cannot take
although each part will forgotten
name from hence immortal life shall have
earth can yield but common grave
when entombed mens eyes shall lie
monument shall gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'er read
tongues being shall rehearse
when all breathers this world are dead
still shall live such virtue hath pen
where breath most breathes even mouths men
empty
therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
dedicated words which writers use
their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair knowledge as hue
finding thy worth limit past praise
therefore art enforced seek anew
some fresher stamp time bettering days
do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
true plain words by thy true telling friend
their gross painting might better used
where cheeks need blood thee abused
empty
never saw did painting need
therefore fair no painting set
found or thought found did exceed
barren tender poet's debt
therefore have slept report
how far modern quill doth come too short
speaking worth what worth doth grow
this silence sin did impute
which shall most glory being dumb
impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life bring tomb
there lives more life one fair eyes
than both poets can praise devise
empty
than this rich praise alone are
whose confine immured store
which should example where equal grew
lean penury within pen doth dwell
his subject lends not some small glory
but he writes if he can tell
are so dignifies his story
let him but copy what writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
making his style admired every where
beauteous blessings add curse
being fond praise which makes praises worse
empty
tongue tied muse manners holds her still
while comments praise richly compiled
reserve their character golden quill
precious phrase by all muses filed
think good thoughts whilst other write good words
every hymn able spirit affords
polished form well refined pen
hearing praised say 'tis so 'tis true
most praise add something more
but thought whose love
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others breath words respect
dumb thoughts speaking effect
empty
bound prize all too precious
did ripe thoughts brain inhearse
making their tomb womb wherein they grew
was his spirit by spirits taught write
above mortal pitch struck dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid verse astonished
he nor affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him intelligence
was not sick any fear from thence
but when countenance filled up his line
then lacked matter enfeebled mine
empty
farewell thou art too dear possessing
enough thou know'st thy estimate
charter thy worth gives thee releasing
bonds thee are all determinate
how do hold thee but by thy granting
cause this fair gift wanting
so patent back again swerving
thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
or whom thou gav'st else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again better judgement making
thus have had thee as dream doth flatter
sleep king but waking no such matter
empty
place merit eye scorn
upon thy side against self i'll fight
prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part can set down story
faults concealed wherein am attainted
thou losing shalt win much glory
by this will gainer too
bending all loving thoughts thee
doing thee vantage double vantage
such love thee so belong
thy right self will bear all wrong
empty
say thou didst forsake some fault
will comment upon offence
speak lameness straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace half so ill
as i'll self disgrace knowing thy will
will acquaintance strangle look strange
absent from thy walks tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest too much profane should do wronk
haply our old acquaintance tell
thee against self i'll vow debate
must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
empty
now while world bent deeds cross
join spite fortune make bow
do not drop an after loss
ah do not when heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
come rearward conquered woe
give not windy night rainy morrow
linger out purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave do not leave last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
at first very worst fortune's might
other strains woe which now seem woe
compared loss thee will not seem so
empty
some glory their birth some their skill
some their wealth some their body's force
some their garments though new fangled ill
some their hawks hounds some their horse
every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
but these particulars are not measure
all these better one general best
thy love better than high birth
richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
more delight than hawks horses
having thee all mens pride boast
wretched this alone thou mayst take
all this away most wretchcd make
empty
term life thou art assured mine
life no longer than thy love will stay
depends upon love thine
then need not fear worst wrongs
when least them life hath end
see better state belongs
than which thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex inconstant mind
since life thy revolt doth lie
happy have thy love happy die
but what's so blessed fair fears no blot
thou mayst false yet know not
empty
so shall live supposing thou art true
deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love though altered new
thy looks thy heart other place
there can live no hatred thine eye
many's looks false heart's history
writ moods frowns wrinkles strange
but heaven thy creation did decree
thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
empty
do not do thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
husband nature's riches from expense
tibey are lords owners their faces
others but stewards their excellence
summer's flower summer sweet
though self only live die
basest weed outbraves his dignity
sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies fester smell far worse than weeds
empty
how sweet lovely dost thou make shame
which canker fragrant rose
doth spot beauty thy budding name
o what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
tongue tells story thy days
cannot dispraise but kind praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what mansion have those vices got
which their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
all things turns fair eyes can see
take heed dear heart this large privilege
hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
empty
some say thy grace youth gentle sport
both grace faults are loved more less
thou mak'st faults graces thee resort
as finger throned queen
basest jewel will well esteemed
so are those errors thee are seen
truths translated true things deemed
how many lambs might stern wolf betray
if lamb he could his looks translate
if thou wouldst use strength all thy state
but do not so love thee such sort
as thou being mine mine thy good report
empty
how winter hath absence been
from thee pleasure fleeting year
what freezings have felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness everywhere
yet this time removed was summer's time
bearing wanton burden prime
widowed wombs after their lords' decease
yet this abundant issue seemed
but hope orphans unfathered fruit
summer his pleasures wait thee
thou away very birds are mute
or if they sing 'tis so dull cheer
leaves look pale dreading winter's near
empty
when proud pied april dressed all his trim
hath put spirit youth every thing
heavy saturn laughed leaped him
yet nor lays birds nor sweet smell
different flowers odour hue
could make any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did wonder at lily's white
nor praise deep vermilion rose
drawn after pattern all those
yet seemed winter still away
as shadow these did play
empty
forward violet thus did chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet smells
if not from love's breath purple pride
which thy soft check complexion dwells
love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
buds marjoram had stoln thy hair
roses fearfully thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
third nor red nor white had stoln both
his robbery had annexed thy breath
but his theft pride all his growth
vengeful canker eat him up death
more flowers noted yet none could see
but sweet or colour had stoln from thee
where art thou muse thou forget'st so long
speak which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury some worthless song
darkening thy power lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse straight redeem
gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing ear doth thy lays esteem
gives thy pen both skill argument
rise resty muse love's sweet face survey
if any satire decay
make time's spoils despised everywhere
give love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou prevent'st his scythe crooked knife
empty
o truant muse what shall thy amends
thy neglect truth beauty dyed
both truth beauty love depends
so dost thou too therein dignified
'truth needs no colour his colour fixed
beauty no pencil beauty's truth lay
but best best if never intermixed'
because he needs no praise wilt thou dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies thee
make him much outlive gilded tomb
praised ages yet
then do thy office muse teach thee how
make him seem long hence as he shows now
love strengthened though more weak seeming
love not less though less show appear
love merchandized whose rich esteeming
owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new then but spring
when was wont greet lays
as philomel summer's front doth sing
stops her pipe growth riper days
not summer less pleasant now
but wild music burthens every bough
sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore her sometime hold tongue
because would not dull song
empty
alack what poverty muse brings forth
having such scope show her pride
argument all bare more worth
than when hath added praise beside
look glass there appears face
over goes blunt invention quite
dulling lines doing disgrace
were not sinful then striving mend
mar subject before was well
no other pass verses tend
than graces gifts tell
more much more than verse can sit
own glass shows when look
fair friend never can old
as were when first eye eyed
such seems beauty still three winters cold
have from forests shook three summers' pride
three beauteous springs yellow autumn turned
process seasons have seen
three april perfumes three hot junes burned
since first saw fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty dial hand
so sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion mine eye may deceived
fear which hear this thou age unbred
ere were born was beauty's summer dead
empty
let not love called idolatry
nor beloved as an idol show
since all alike songs praises
one one still such ever so
still constant wondrous excellence
therefore verse constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind true all argument
fair kind true varying other words
this change invention spent
three themes one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat one
when chronicle wasted time
see descriptions fairest wights
beauty making beautiful old rhyme
praise ladies dead lovely knights
then blazon sweet beauty's best
hand foot lip eye brow
see their antique pen would have expressed
even such beauty as master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
they looked but divining eyes
they had not skill enough worth sing
which now behold these present days
have eyes wonder but lack tongues praise
empty
not mine own fears nor prophetic soul
wide world dreaming things come
can yet lease true love control
supposed as forfeit confined doom
sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
peace proclaims olives endless age
now drops this most balmy time
love looks fresh death subscribes
since spite him i'll live this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull speechless tribes
thou this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants' crests tombs brass are spent
what's brain ink may character
which hath not figured thee true spirit
what's new speak what now register
may express love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet prayers divine
must each day say o'er very same
counting no old thing old thou mine thine
even as when first hallowed thy fair name
so eternal love love's fresh case
nor gives necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity aye his page
finding first conceit love there bred
where time outward form would show dead
empty
o never say was false heart
though absence seemed flame qualify
as easy might from self depart
as from soul which thy breast doth lie
him travels return again
just time not time exchanged
so self bring water stain
never believe though nature reigned
all frailties besiege all kinds blood
could so preposterously stained
leave nothing all thy sum good
nothing this wide universe call
save thou rose thou art all
alas 'tis true have gone here there
made self motley view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what most dear
made old offences affections new
most true have looked truth
askance strangely but by all above
these blenches gave heart another youth
worse essays proved thee best love
now all done have what shall have no end
newer proof try an older friend
god love whom am confined
then give welcome next heaven best
even thy pure most most loving breast
empty
o sake do fortune chide
guilty goddess harmful deeds
did not better life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
almost thence nature subdued
what works dyer's hand
pity then wish were renewed
whilst willing patient will drink
potions eisel 'gainst strong infection
no bitterness will bitter think
nor double penance correct correction
pity then dear friend assure ye
even pity enough cure
love pity doth th' impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamped upon brow
what care who calls well or ill
so o'er green bad good allow
are all world must strive
know shames praises from tongue
none else nor none alive
steeled sense or changes right or wrong
so profound abysm throw all care
critic flatterer stopped are
mark how neglect do dispense
are so strongly purpose bred
all world besides methinks are dead
empty
since left mine eye mind
which governs go about
doth part his function partly blind
seems seeing but effectually out
bird flower or shape which doth latch
his quick objects hath mind no part
nor his own vision holds what doth catch
if see rud'st or gentlest sight
most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
mountain or sea day or night
crow or dove shapes them feature
incapable more replete
most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
or whether doth mind being crowned
drink up monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall say mine eye saith true
love taught this alchemy
make monsters things indigest
such cherubins as sweet self resemble
creating every bad perfect best
as fast as objects his beams assemble
o 'tis first 'tis flattery seeing
mine eye well knows what his gust 'greeing
his palate doth prepare cup
if poisoned 'tis lesser sin
mine eye loves doth first begin
empty
those lines before have writ do lie
even those said could not love dearer
yet then judgment knew no reason why
most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
creep 'twixt vows change decrees kings
tan sacred beauty blunt sharp'st intents
divert strong minds course alt'ring things
alas why fearing time's tyranny
might not then say 'now love best'
when was certain o'er incertainty
crowning present doubting rest
love babe then might not say so
give full growth which still doth grow
let not marriage true minds
admit impediments love not love
which alters when alteration finds
or bends remover remove
o no an ever fixed mark
looks tempests never shaken
star every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips cheeks
love alters not his brief hours weeks
but bears out even edge doom
if this error upon proved
never writ nor no man ever loved
empty
accuse thus have scanted all
wherein should great deserts repay
forgot upon dearest love call
whereto all bonds do tie day by day
given time own dear purchased right
have hoisted sail all winds
which should transport farthest from sight
book both wilfulness errors down
just proof surmise accumulate
bring within level frown
but shoot not at wakened hate
since appeal says did strive prove
constancy virtue love
as make our appetite more keen
eager compounds our palate urge
as prevent our maladies unseen
sicken shun sickness when purge
even so being full ne'er cloying sweetness
bitter sauces did frame feeding
sick welfare found kind meetness
diseased ere there was true needing
thus policy love t' anticipate
brought medicine healthful state
which rank goodness would by ill cured
but thence learn find lesson true
drugs poison him so feil sick
empty
what potions have drunk siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears hopes hopes fears
still losing when saw self win
whilst hath thought self so blessed never
how have mine eyes out their spheres been fitted
distraction this madding fever
o benefit ill now find true
better by evil still made better
ruined love when built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so return rebuked content
gain by ills thrice more than have spent
were once unkind befriends now
sorrow which then did feel
needs must under transgression bow
unless nerves were brass or hammered steel
if were by unkindness shaken
as by yours y'have passed hell time
tyrant have no leisure taken
weigh how once suffered crime
o our night woe might have remembered
soon as then tendered
humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but trespass now becomes fee
mine ransoms yours yours must ransom
empty
'tis better vile than vile esteemed
when not receives reproach being
just pleasure lost which so deemed
not by our feeling but by others' seeing
give salutation sportive blood
or frailties why are frailer spies
which their wills count bad what think good
no am am they level
at abuses reckon up their own
may straight though they themselves bevel
by their rank thoughts deeds must not shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad their badness reign
thy gift thy tables are within brain
full charactered lasting memory
which shall above idle rank remain
beyond all date even eternity
or at least so long as brain heart
have faculty by nature subsist
till each razed oblivion yield his part
thee thy record never can missed
poor retention could not so much hold
therefore give them from was bold
trust those tables receive thee more
keep an adjunct remember thee
were import forgetfulness
empty
no time thou shalt not boast do change
thy pyramids built up newer might
are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings former sight
what thou dost foist upon us old
rather make them born our desire
than think before have heard them told
thy registers thee both defy
not wond'ring at present nor past
thy records what see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this do vow this shall ever
will true despite thy scythe thee
if dear love were but child state
might fortune's bastard unfathered
as subject time's love or time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers flowers gathered
no was builded far from accident
suffers not smiling pomp nor falls
under blow thralled discontent
whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
fears not policy heretic
but all alone stands hugely politic
nor grows heat nor drowns showers
this witness call fools time
which die goodness who have lived crime
empty
were't aught bore canopy
extern outward honouring
or laid great bases eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
lose all more by paying too much rent
compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers their gazing spent
no let obsequious thy heart
take thou oblation poor but free
which not mixed seconds knows no art
but mutual render only thee
hence thou suborned informer true soul
when most impeached stands least thy control
o thou lovely boy who thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee this purpose her skill
may time disgrace wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion her pleasure
her audit though delayed answered must
her quietus render thee
empty
old age black was not counted fair
or if were bore not beauty's name
but now black beauty's successive heir
beauty slandered bastard shame
since each hand hath put nature's power
fairing foul art's false borrowed face
but profaned if not lives disgrace
therefore mistress' eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming their woe
every tongue says beauty should look so
empty
how oft when thou music music play'st
thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
wiry concord mine ear confounds
do envy those jacks nimble leap
kiss tender inward thy hand
whilst poor lips which should harvest reap
at wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
so tickled they would change their state
situation those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk gentle gait
since saucy jacks so happy are this
give them thy fingers thy lips kiss
empty
th' expense spirit waste shame
lust action till action lust
perjured murd'rous bloody full blame
savage extreme rude cruel not trust
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted no sooner had
purpose laid make taker mad
mad pursuit possession so
had having quest have extreme
bliss proof proved very woe
before joy proposed behind dream
all this world well knows yet none knows well
shun heaven leads men this hell
empty
mistress' eyes are nothing sun
if snow white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs wires black wires grow her head
have seen roses damasked red white
but no such roses see her cheeks
some perfumes there more delight
than breath from mistress reeks
love hear her speak yet well know
music hath far more pleasing sound
grant never saw goddess go
yet by heaven think love as rare
as any she belied false compare
empty
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
well thou know'st dear doting heart
thou art fairest most precious jewel
yet good faith some say thee behold
thy face hath not power make love groan
although swear self alone
sure not false swear
thousand groans but thinking thy face
one another's neck do witness bear
thy black fairest judgment's place
nothing art thou black save thy deeds
thence this slander as think proceeds
empty
thine eyes love they as pitying
have put black loving mourners
looking pretty ruth upon pain
truly not morning sun heaven
better becomes grey cheeks east
nor full star ushers even
doth half glory sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let then as well beseem thy heart
mourn since mourning doth thee grace
then will swear beauty herself black
all they foul thy complexion lack
empty
beshrew heart makes heart groan
deep wound gives friend
is't not enough torture alone
but slave slavery sweet'st friend must
from self thy cruel eye hath taken
next self thou harder hast engrossed
torment thrice three fold thus crossed
prison heart thy steel bosom's ward
but then friend's heart let poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps let heart his guard
thou canst not then use rigour gaol
yet thou wilt being pent thee
perforce am thine all
empty
so now have confessed he thine
self i'll forfeit so other mine
thou wilt restore comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not free
thou art covetous he kind
he learned but surety write
under bond him as fist doth bind
statute thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer put'st forth all use
sue friend came debtor sake
him have lost thou hast both him
he pays whole yet am not free
empty
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
'will boot 'will over plus
more than enough am vex thee still
thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will large spacious
not once vouchsafe hide will thine
will no fair acceptance shine
sea all water yet receives rain still
abundance addeth his store
so thou being rich will add thy will
one will mine make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one one 'will'
empty
if thy soul check thee come so near
will thy soul knows admitted there
thus far love love suit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil treasure thy love
ay fill full wills will one
things great receipt case prove
among number one reckoned none
then number let pass untold
though thy store's account one must
nothing hold so please thee hold
make but name thy love love still
then thou lov'st name will
empty
thou blind fool love what dost thou mine eyes
they behold see not what they see
they know what beauty see where lies
yet what best take worst
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
anchored bay where all men ride
whereto judgment heart tied
why should heart think several plot
which heart knows wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this not
put fair truth upon so foul face
things right true heart eyes have erred
this false plague are they now transferred
empty
when love swears she made truth
she might think some untutored youth
unlearned world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking she thinks young
although she knows days are past best
simply credit her false speaking tongue
both sides thus simple truth suppressed
but wherefore says she not she unjust
wherefore say not am old
o love's best habit seeming trust
therefore lie her she
our faults by lies flattered
empty
o call not justify wrong
thy unkindness lays upon heart
wound not thine eye but thy tongue
use power power slay not by art
tell thou lov'st elsewhere but sight
dear heart forbear glance thine eye aside
more than o'erpressed defence can bide
let excuse thee ah love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
therefore from face she turns foes
they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since am near slain
kill outright looks rid pain
empty
wise as thou art cruel do not press
lest sorrow lend words words express
manner pity wanting pain
if might teach thee wit better were
though not love yet love tell so
as testy sick men when their deaths near
no news but health from their physicians know
if should despair should grow mad
madness might speak ill thee
now this ill wresting world grown so bad
may not so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
empty
faith do not love thee mine eyes
they thee thousand errors note
but 'tis heart loves what they despise
who despite view pleased dote
nor are mine cars thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling base touches prone
any sensual feast thee alone
but five wits nor five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed likeness man
thy proud heart's slave vassal wretch
only plague thus far count gain
she makes sin awards pain
empty
love sin thy dear virtue hate
o but mine compare thou thine own state
thou shalt find merits not reproving
or if do not from those lips thine
have profaned their scarlet ornaments
sealed false bonds love as oft as mine
robbed others' beds' revenues their rents
lawful love thee as thou lov'st those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity thy heart when grows
if thou dost seek have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou denied
empty
lo as careful huswife runs catch
one her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe makes all swift dispatch
pursuit thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her chase
cries catch her whose busy care bent
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runst thou after which flies from thee
whilst thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back
play mother's part kiss kind
so will pray thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back loud crying still
empty
two loves have comfort despair
better angel man right fair
worser spirit woman coloured ill
win soon hell female evil
tempteth better angel from side
would corrupt saint devil
wooing his purity her foul pride
whether angel turned fiend
suspect may yet not directly tell
but being both from both each friend
yet this shall ne'er know but live doubt
till bad angel fire good one out
empty
those lips love's own hand did make
breathed forth sound said 'i hate'
languished her sake
but when she saw woeful state
straight her heart did mercy come
chiding tongue ever sweet
taught thus anew greet
'i hate' she altered an end
followed as gentle day
doth follow night who fiend
from heaven hell flown away
'i hate' from hate away she threw
saved life saying 'not you'
empty
poor soul centre sinful earth
why dost thou pine within suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors this excess
eat up thy charge this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
let pine aggravate thy store
buy terms divine selling hours dross
so shall thou feed death feeds men
death once dead there's no more dying then
empty
love as fever longing still
which longer nurseth disease
feeding which doth preserve ill
th' uncertain sickly appetite please
reason physician love
angry his prescriptions are not kept
desire death which physic did except
past cure am now reason past care
frantic mad evermore unrest
thoughts discourse as mad mens are
at random from truth vainly expressed
have sworn thee fair thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night
empty
o what eyes hath love put head
or if they have where judgment fled
censures falsely what they see aright
if fair whereon false eyes dote
what means world say not so
if not then love doth well denote
love's eye not so true as all mens no
how can o how can love's eye true
so vexed watching tears
no marvel then though mistake view
o cunning love tears thou keep'st blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
empty
canst thou o cruel say love thee not
when against self thee partake
do not think thee when forgot
am self all tyrant thy sake
who hateth thee do call friend
whom frownst thou do fawn upon
revenge upon self present moan
what merit do self respect
so proud thy service despise
when all best doth worship thy defect
commanded by motion thine eyes
but love hate now know thy mind
those can see thou lov'st am blind
empty
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
make give lie true sight
swear brightness doth not grace day
whence hast thou this becoming things ill
very refuse thy deeds
there such strength warrantise skill
mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how make love thee more
more hear see just cause hate
o though love what others do abhor
if thy unworthiness raised love
more worthy beloved thee
empty
love too young know what conscience
yet who knows not conscience born love
then gentle cheater urge not amiss
lest guilty faults thy sweet self prove
thou betraying do betray
nobler part gross body's treason
triumph love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud this pride
he contented thy poor drudge
stand thy affairs fall by thy side
no want conscience hold call
her love whose dear love rise fall
empty
loving thee thou know'st am forsworn
act thy bed vow broke new faith torn
vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why two oaths' breach do accuse thee
when break twenty am perjured most
all vows are oaths but misuse thee
all honest faith thee lost
have sworn deep oaths thy deep kindness
oaths thy love thy truth thy constancy
enlighten thee gave eyes blindness
have sworn thee fair more perjured
swear against truth so foul
empty
cupid laid by his brand fell asleep

his love kindling fire did quickly steep
cold valley fountain ground

which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing bath healthful remedy

lepidus must not think there are
evils enow darken all his goodness
his faults him seem as spots heaven
more fiery by night's blackness hereditary
rather than purchas'd what he cannot change
than what he chooses
caesar are too indulgent let's grant not
amiss tumble bed ptolemy
keep turn tippling slave
reel streets at noon stand buffet
knaves smell sweat say this becomes him
as his composure must rare indeed
whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony
no way excuse his foils when do bear
so great weight his lightness if he filld
his vacancy his voluptuousness
full surfeits dryness his bones
drums him from his sport speaks as loud
as his own state ours 'tis chid

pawn their experience their present pleasure

caesar antony
leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once
was beaten from modena where thou slew'st
hirtius pansa consuls at thy heel
did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
though daintily brought up patience more
than savages could suffer thou didst drink
stale horses gilded puddle
roughest berry rudest hedge
yea stag when snow pasture sheets
barks trees thou brows'd alps
reported thou didst eat strange flesh
which some did die look all this
wounds thine honour speak now
was borne so soldier thy cheek
so much as lank'd not
lepidus 'tis pity him
drive him rome 'tis time twain
did show ourselves i' th' field end
assemble immediate council pompey

caesar welcome rome
antony thank
caesar sit
antony sit sir
caesar nay then they sit

chiefly i' world more laugh'd at should
once name derogately when sound name
not concernd
antony being egypt caesar
what was't
might egypt yet if there
did practise state being egypt
might question
antony how intend practis'd
caesar may pleas'd catch at mine intent
by what did here befall wife brother
made wars upon their contestation
was theme were word war
antony do mistake business brother never
have learning from some true reports
drew their swords did he not rather
discredit authority yours
make wars alike against stomach
having alike cause this letters
before did satisfy if you'll patch quarrel
as matter whole have not make
must not this
caesar praise yourself
patch'd up excuses
antony not so not so
know could not lack am certain ont
very necessity this thought
partner cause 'gainst which he fought
could not graceful eyes attend those wars
which fronted mine own peace as wife
would had her spirit such another
third o' th' world yours which snaffle
enobarbus would had all such wives men might go
wars women
antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar
made out her impatience which not wanted
shrewdness policy too grieving grant
did too much disquiet must
but say could not help
caesar wrote
when rioting alexandria
did gibe missive out audience
antony sir
he fell upon ere admitted then
three kings had newly feasted did want
what was i' th' morning but next day
told him myself which was as much
as have ask'd him pardon let this fellow
nothing our strife if contend
out our question wipe him
article oath which shall never
have tongue charge
lepidus soft caesar
antony no
lepidus let him speak
honour sacred which he talks now
supposing lack'd but caesar
article oath
caesar lend arms aid when requir'd them
antony neglected rather
then when poisoned hours had bound up
from mine own knowledge as nearly as may
i'll play penitent but mine honesty
shall not make poor greatness nor power
work without truth fulvia
have out egypt made wars here
which myself ignorant motive do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
lepidus 'tis noble spoken
maecenas if might please enforce no further
griefs between ye forget them quite
were remember present need
speaks atone
lepidus worthily spoken maecenas
enobarbus or if borrow one another's love instant
may when hear no more words pompey return again
shall have time wrangle when have nothing else
antony thou art soldier only speak no more
enobarbus truth should silent had almost forgot
antony wrong this presence therefore speak no more
enobarbus go then considerate stone
caesar do not much dislike matter but
manner his speech for't cannot
shall remain friendship our conditions
so diff'ring their acts yet if knew
what hoop should hold us stanch from edge edge
agrippa give leave caesar
caesar speak agrippa
agrippa thou hast sister by mother's side
admir'd octavia great mark antony
now widower
caesar say not so agrippa
if cleopatra heard reproof
were well deserv'd rashness
antony am not married caesar let hear
agrippa hold perpetual amity
make brothers knit hearts
an unslipping knot take antony
octavia his wife whose beauty claims
no worse husband than best men
whose virtue whose general graces speak
which none else can utter by this marriage
all little jealousies which now seem great
all great fears which now import their dangers
where now half tales truths her love both
would each other all loves both
draw after her pardon what have spoke
'tis studied not present thought
by duty ruminated
antony will caesar speak
caesar not till he hears how antony touch'd
what spoke already
antony what power agrippa
make this good
caesar power caesar
his power unto octavia
antony may never
this good purpose so fairly shows
dream impediment let have thy hand
further this act grace from this hour
heart brothers govern our loves
sway our great designs
sister bequeath whom no brother
did ever love so dearly let her live
join our kingdoms our hearts never
fly off our loves again
lepidus happily amen
antony did not think draw sword 'gainst pompey
he hath laid strange courtesies great
late upon must thank him only
lest remembrance suffer ill report
lepidus time calls upons

maecenas welcome from egypt sir
enobarbus half heart caesar worthy maecenas honourable
friend agrippa
agrippa good enobarbus
maecenas have cause glad matters are so well
digested stay'd well by't egypt
enobarbus ay sir did sleep day out countenance made
night light drinking
maecenas eight wild boars roasted whole at breakfast but
enobarbus this was but as fly by an eagle had much more
monstrous matter feast which worthily deserved noting
maecenas she's most triumphant lady if report square her
enobarbus when she first met mark antony she purs'd up his heart
upon river cydnus
agrippa there she appear'd indeed or reporter devis'd well
empty
enobarbus will tell
barge she sat burnish'd throne
purple sails so perfumed
winds were love sick them oars were silver
which tune flutes kept stroke made
water which they beat follow faster
as amorous their strokes her own person
beggar'd all description she did lie
her pavilion cloth gold tissue
o'erpicturing venus where see
fancy out work nature each side her
divers colour'd fans whose wind did seem
glow delicate cheeks which they did cool
what they undid did
agrippa o rare antony
enobarbus her gentlewomen nereides
so many mermaids tended her i' th' eyes
made their bends adornings at helm

mewling puking nurse's arms

shining morning face creeping snail
unwillingly school then lover
sighing furnace woeful ballad
full strange oaths bearded pard
jealous honour sudden quick quarrel
seeking bubble reputation
even cannons mouth then justice
fair round belly good capon lind
eyes severe beard formal cut
full wise saws modern instances
so he plays his part sixth age shifts
into lean slipper'd pantaloon
his youthful hose well sav'd world too wide
his shrunk shank his big manly voice
turning again toward childish treble pipes
whistles his sound last scene all
ends this strange eventful history

empty
orlando prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind marry he trots hard young maid between

other lives merrily because he feels no pain one
lacking burden lean wasteful learning other
knowing no burden heavy tedious penury these time ambles
empty

rosalind have been told so many but indeed an old religious
man one knew courtship too well there he fell love
have heard him read many lectures against thank god

hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal
orlando can remember any principal evils he laid
charge women

beard neglected which have not but pardon
simply having beard younger brother's revenue
then hose should ungarter'd bonnet unbanded
sleeve unbuttond shoe untied every thing about

than seeming lover any other
orlando fair youth would could make thee believe love
rosalind believe may as soon make her love
believe which warrant she apter do than confess
she does one points which women still give
lie their consciences but good sooth are he
hangs verses trees wherein rosalind so admired
orlando swear thee youth by white hand rosalind
rosalind but are so much love as rhymes speak
orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind love merely madness tell deserves as
well dark house whip as madmen do reason why
they are not so punish'd cured lunacy so
ordinary whippers are love too yet profess curing
by counsel
orlando did ever cure any so
rosalind yes one this manner he was imagine his
time would being but moonish youth grieve effeminate
changeable longing liking proud fantastical apish
shallow inconstant full tears full smiles every
passion something no passion truly anything as boys
women are most part cattle this colour would now

weep him then spit at him drave suitor from his
mad humour love living humour madness which was
forswear full stream world live nook

'whiles eye man did woo

'if scorn bright eyne
have power raise such love mine
alack what strange effect

he left promise return again
within an hour pacing through forest
chewing food sweet bitter fancy
lo what befell he threw his eye aside
mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were moss'd age
high top bald dry antiquity
wretched ragged man o'ergrown hair
lay sleeping his back about his neck
who her head nimble threats approach'd
opening his mouth but suddenly
seeing orlando unlink'd itself
indented glides did slip away
into bush under which bush's shade
lioness udders all drawn dry
lay couching head ground catlike watch
when sleeping man should stir 'tis
royal disposition beast
this seen orlando did approach man
found was his brother his elder brother
celia o have heard him speak same brother
he did render him most unnatural
liv'd amongst men
oliver well he might so do
well know he was unnatural
rosalind but orlando did he leave him there
food suck'd hungry lioness
but kindness nobler ever than revenge
nature stronger than his just occasion
made him give battle lioness
who quickly fell before him which hurtling
from miserable slumber awak'd
celia are his brother
rosalind was't he rescu'd
celia was't did so oft contrive kill him
oliver 'twas but 'tis not do not shame

tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd
as how came into desert place
brief he led gentle duke
who gave fresh array entertainment
committing unto brother's love
there stripp'd himself here upon his arm
lioness had torn some flesh away
which all this while had bled now he fainted
cried fainting upon rosalind
brief recover'd him bound up his wound
after some small space being strong at heart
he sent hither stranger as am
tell this story might excuse
his broken promise give this napkin
he sport doth call his rosalind
rosalind swoons
celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede
oliver many will swoon when they do look blood
celia there more cousin ganymede
oliver look he recovers

lack mans heart
rosalind do so confess ah sirrah body would think

oliver well then take good heart counterfeit man

her liv'd joy our wealth increas'd
epidamnum till factor's death
great care goods at random left
drew from kind embracements spouse
from whom absence was not six months old
before herself almost at fainting under
pleasing punishment women bear
had made provision her following
soon safe arrived where was
there had she not been long but she became
which was strange one so other
as could not disdnguish'd but by names
very hour self same inn
mean woman was delivered
such burden male twins both alike
those their parents were exceeding poor
bought brought up attend sons
wife not meanly proud two such boys
made daily motions our home return
came aboard
league from epidamnum had saild
before always wind obeying deep
gave any tragic instance our harm
but longer did not retain much hope
what obscured light heavens did grant
did but convey unto our fearful minds
doubtful warrant immediate death
which though myself would gladly have embrac'd
weeping before what she saw must come
piteous plainings pretty babes
mournd fashion ignorant what fear
forc'd seek delays them
this was other means was none
sailors sought safety by our boat
left ship then sinking ripe us
wife more careful latter born
had fast'ned him unto small spare mast
him one other twins was bound
whilst had been heedful other
children thus dispos'd wife
fixing our eyes whom our care was fix'd
fast'ned ourselves at either end mast
floating straight obedient stream
was carried towards corinth as thought
at length sun gazing upon earth
dispers'd those vapours offended us
seas wax'd calm discovered
two ships from far making amain us
corinth epidaurus this
but ere they came o let say no more
gather sequel by went before
duke nay forward old man do not break off so
may pity though not pardon thee
aegeon o had gods done so had not now
worthily term'd them merciless us
were encount'red by mighty rock
which being violently borne upon
our helpful ship was splitted midst
so this unjust divorce us
fortune had left both us alike
what delight what sorrow
her part poor soul seeming as burdened
lesser weight but not lesser woe
was carried more speed before wind
by fishermen corinth as thought
at length another ship had seiz'd us
knowing whom was their hap save
gave healthful welcome their ship wreck'd guests
would have reft fishers their prey
had not their bark been very slow sail
therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have heard sever'd from bliss
by misfortunes was life prolong'd
duke sake them thou sorrowest
do favour dilate at full
what have befalln them thee till now
aegeon youngest boy yet eldest care
at eighteen years became inquisitive
after his brother importund

reft his brother but retaind his name

hazarded loss whom lov'd
five summers have spent farthest greece
roaming clean through bounds asia
coasting homeward came ephesus
hopeless find yet loath leave unsought

happy were timely death
could all travels warrant they live
bear extremity dire mishap
now trust were not against our laws
against crown oath dignity
which princes would they may not disannul
soul should sue as advocate thee
but though thou art adjudged death
passed sentence may not recalld

man more divine master all these

adriana this servitude makes keep unwed
luciana not this but troubles marriage bed
adriana but were wedded would bear some sway
luciana ere learn love i'll practise obey
adriana how if husband start some other where
luciana till he come home again would forbear
adriana patience unmov'd no marvel though she pause
they can meek have no other cause
bid quiet when hear cry

as much or more should ourselves complain
so thou hast no unkind mate grieve thee
urging helpless patience would relieve
but if thou live see right bereft
this fool begg'd patience thee will left

dromio ephesus ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand scarce could understand
luciana spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning
dromio ephesus nay he struck so plainly could
well feel his blows withal so doubtfully could
adriana but say prithee he coming home
seems he hath great care please his wife
dromio ephesus why mistress sure master horn mad

adriana his company must do his minions grace
whilst at home starve merry look
hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
from poor cheek then he hath wasted
are discourses dull barren wit
unkindness blunts more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that's not fault he's master state
what ruins are can found
by him not ruind then he ground
defeatures decayed fair
sunny look his would soon repair
but too unruly deer he breaks pale
feeds from home poor am but his stale
adriana unfeeling fools can such wrongs dispense
know his eye doth homage otherwhere
or else what lets but he would here
sister know he promis'd chain
would alone love he would detain
so he would keep fair quarter his bed
see jewel best enamelled
will lose his beauty yet gold bides still
others touch often touching will
by falsehood corruption doth shame
since beauty cannot please his eye
i'll weep what's left away weeping die

retire win our purpose
marcius how lies their battle know which side
they have plac'd their men trust
their bands i' th' vaward are antiates

marcius do beseech
by all battles wherein have fought
by th' blood have shed together by th' vows
have made endure friends directly
set against aufidius his antiates
not delay present but
prove this very hour
cominius though could wish
were conducted gentle bath
balms applied yet dare never
deny asking take choice those
best can aid action
marcius those are they
most are willing if any such here
as were sin doubt love this painting
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
his country's dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus express his disposition
follow marcius they all shout wave their
swords take him up their arms cast up their caps
o alone make sword
if these shows not outward which
able bear against great aufidius
shield as hard as his certain number
though thanks all must select from all rest

sicinius he cannot temp'rately transport his honours
from where he should begin end but will
lose those he hath won
brutus there's comfort
sicinius doubt not
commoners whom stand but they
least cause these his new honours which
he will give them make as little question
as he proud do't
brutus heard him swear
were he stand consul never would he
appear i' th' market place nor him put
napless vesture humility
nor showing as manner his wounds

brutus was his word o he would miss rather

than have him hold purpose put
execution
brutus 'tis most he will
sicinius shall him then as our good wills

have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders
dispropertied their freedoms holding them

loves not common people
second officer faith there have been many great men have
flatter'd people who ne'er loved them there many
they have loved they know not wherefore so if they
love they know not why they hate upon no better ground
therefore coriolanus neither care whether they love or
hate him manifests true knowledge he has their
disposition out his noble carelessness lets them plainly
empty
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm
but he seeks their hate greater devotion than they can
render him leaves nothing undone may fully discover
him their opposite now seem affect malice
displeasure people as bad as which he dislikes
flatter them their love
second officer he hath deserved worthily his country his
ascent not by such easy degrees as those who having been
supple courteous people bonneted without any further
he hath so planted his honours their eyes his actions
their hearts their tongues silent not confess
so much were kind ingrateful injury report otherwise
were malice giving itself lie would pluck reproof

brutus which rather
shall bless'd do if he remember
kinder value people than
he hath hereto priz'd them at
would rather had been silent please
hear cominius speak

than rebuke give
menenius he loves people
but tie him not their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
coriolanus rises offers go away
first senator sit coriolanus never shame hear

coriolanus i'll straight do knowing myself again
menenius i'll keep company will along
brutus stay here people
sicinius fare well
exeunt coriolanus menenius
he has now by his looks methinks
'tis warm at's heart
brutus proud heart he wore
his humble weeds will dismiss people
re enter citizens
first citizen he has our voices sir
brutus pray gods he may deserve loves
second citizen amen sir poor unworthy notice
he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices
third citizen certainly
he flouted us downright
first citizen no 'tis his kind speech he did not mock us
second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says
he us'd us scornfully he should have show'd us
sicinius why so he did am sure
all no no no man saw 'em
third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show
empty
his hat thus waving scorn
'i would consul' says he 'aged custom
but by voices will not so permit
voices therefore' when granted
here was 'i thank voices thank
have no further you' was not this mockery
sicinius why either were ignorant see't
or seeing such childish friendliness
yield voices
brutus could not have told him
as were lessond when he had no power
but was petty servant state
he was enemy ever spake against
liberties charters bear
place potency sway o' th' state
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe th' plebeii voices might
curses yourselves should have said
as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood so his gracious nature
would think upon voices
translate his malice towards into love
standing friendly lord
as were fore advis'd had touch'd his spirit
tried his inclination from him pluck'd
either his gracious promise which might
as cause had calld up have held him
or else would have galld his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him aught so putting him rage
should have ta'en th' advantage his choler
pass'd him unelected
he did solicit free contempt
when he did need loves do think
his contempt shall not bruising
when he hath power crush why had bodies
no heart among or had tongues cry
against rectorship judgment
sicinius have
ere now denied asker now again
him did not ask but mock bestow
third citizen he's not confirm'd may deny him yet
second citizens will deny him
i'll have five hundred voices sound
first citizen twice five hundred their friends piece
empty
brutus get hence instantly tell those friends
they have chose consul will from them take
their liberties make them no more voice
than dogs are as often beat barking
sicinius let them assemble
safer judgment all revoke
ignorant election enforce his pride
his old hate unto besides forget not
what contempt he wore humble weed
how his suit he scornd but loves
thinking upon his services took from
th' apprehension his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
brutus lay
fault us tribunes labour'd
no impediment between but must
cast election him
sicinius say chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by own true affections minds
pre occupied what rather must do
than what should made against grain
brutus ay spare us not say read lectures
how youngly he began serve his country
how long continued what stock he springs
noble house o' th' marcians from whence came
ancus marcius numa's daughter's son
who after great hostilius here was king
same house publius quintus were
our best water brought by conduits hither
censorinus nobly named so
was his great ancestor
sicinius one thus descended
hath beside well his person wrought
set high place did commend
remembrances but have found
scaling his present bearing his past
he's fixed enemy revoke
sudden approbation
brutus say ne'er had done't
presently when have drawn number
repair th' capitol
citizens will will so almost all
repent their election exeunt plebeians
brutus let them go
this mutiny were better put hazard
than stay past doubt greater
if as his nature he fall rage
their refusal both observe answer
sicinius th' capitol come

this shall seem as partly 'tis their own

menenius not now not now
coriolanus now as live will
nobler friends crave their pardons
mutable rank scented meiny let them
regard as do not flatter
therein behold themselves say again
soothing them nourish 'gainst our senate
cockle rebellion insolence sedition
which ourselves have plough'd sow'd scatter'd
by mingling them us honour'd number
which they have given beggars
menenius well no more
first senator no more words beseech
coriolanus how no more
as country have shed blood
not fearing outward force so shall lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles
which disdain should tetter us yet sought
very way catch them
as if were god punish not

menenius what what his choler
coriolanus choler

sicinius mind
not poison any further
coriolanus shall remain
hear this triton minnows mark

cominius 'twas from canon
coriolanus 'shall
o good but most unwise patricians why
grave but reckless senators have thus
given hydra here choose an officer
horn noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit

make channel his if he have power
then vail ignorance if none awake
dangerous lenity if are learnd
not as common fools if are not
let them have cushions by are plebeians
if they senators they are no less
when both voices blended great'st taste
such one as he who puts his 'shall'
his popular 'shall' against graver bench
than ever frownd greece by jove himself
makes consuls base soul aches
know when two authorities are up
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter 'twixt gap both take
one by th' other
cominius well th' market place

sometime greece
menenius well well no more
coriolanus though there people had more absolute pow'r
say they nourish'd disobedience fed
ruin state
brutus why shall people give
one speaks thus their voice
coriolanus i'll give reasons
was not our recompense resting well assur'd
they ne'er did service for't being press'd th' war
even when navel state was touch'd
they would not thread gates this kind service
did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war
their mutinies revolts wherein they show'd
most valour spoke not them th' accusation
which they have often made against senate
all cause unborn could never native
how shall this bosom multiplied digest
senate's courtesy let deeds express
what's their words 'we did request
are greater poll true fear
they gave us our demands' thus debase
nature our seats make rabble
call our cares fears which will time
break ope locks o' th' senate bring
crows peck eagles
brutus enough over measure
coriolanus no take more
what may sworn by both divine human
seal what end withal this double worship
where one part does disdain cause other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by yea no
general ignorance must omit
real necessities give way while
nothing done purpose therefore beseech
will less fearful than discreet
love fundamental part state
more than doubt change ont prefer
noble life before long wish
jump body dangerous physic
that's sure death without at once pluck out
multitudinous tongue let them not lick
sweet which their poison dishonour
integrity which should become't
not having power do good would

brutus has said enough
sicinius has spoken traitor shall answer
as traitors do
coriolanus thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
what should people do these bald tribunes
whom depending their obedience fails
when what's not meet but what must was law
then were they chosen better hour
let what meet said must meet
throw their power i' th' dust
brutus manifest treason
sicinius this consul no

coriolanus fair ground
could beat forty them
menenius could myself
take up brace o' th' best them yea two tribunes

sicinius where this viper

killing our enemies blood he hath lost

enter volumnia

why did wish milder would have
false nature rather say play
man am
volumnia o sir sir sir
would have had put power well
before had worn out
coriolanus let go

thwartings dispositions if

ere they lack'd power cross
coriolanus let them hang
volumnia ay burn too
enter menenius senators
menenius come come have been too rough something too rough
must return mend
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave midst perish
volumnia pray counselld

menenius well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop th' herd but
violent fit o' th' time craves as physic
which can scarcely bear
coriolanus what must do
menenius return th' tribunes
coriolanus well what then what then
menenius repent what have spoke
coriolanus them cannot do gods

volumnia are too absolute
though therein can never too noble
honour policy unsever'd friends
i' th' war do grow together grant tell
peace what each them by th' other lose
they combine not there
coriolanus tush tush
menenius good demand
volumnia if honour wars seem
same are not which best ends
adopt policy how less or worse
honour as war since both
stands request
coriolanus why force this
volumnia because now lies speak
th' people not by own instruction
nor by th' matter which heart prompts
but such words are but roted
tongue though but bastards syllables
no allowance bosom's truth
than take town gentle words
which else would put fortune
hazard much blood
would dissemble nature where
fortunes friends at stake requir'd
should do so honour am this
wife son these senators nobles
will rather show our general louts
how can frown than spend fawn upon 'em
what want might ruin
menenius noble lady
come go us speak fair may salve so
not what dangerous present but los
what past
volumnia prithee now son
go them this bonnet thy hand
thus far having stretch'd here them
thy knee bussing stones such busines
more learned than ears waving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as ripest mulberry
will not hold handling or say them
thou art their soldier being bred broils
hast not soft way which thou dost confess
were fit thee use as they claim
asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
menenius this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
they have pardons being ask'd as free
as words little purpose
volumnia prithee now
go ruld although know thou hadst rather
follow thine enemy fiery gulf
than flatter him bower
enter cominius
cominius have been i' th' market place sir 'tis fit
make strong party or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence alls anger
menenius only fair speech
cominius think 'twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit
volumnia he must will
prithee now say will go about
coriolanus must go show them unbarb'd sconce must
lie must bear well will do't
yet were there but this single plot lose
this mould marcius they dust should grind
throw't against wind th' market place
have put now such part which never
shall discharge th' life
cominius come come we'll prompt
volumnia prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
praises made thee first soldier so
thou hast not done before
coriolanus well must do't
away disposition possess
some harlot's spirit throat war turnd
which quier'd drum into pipe
small as an eunuch or virgin voice
babies lulls asleep smiles knaves
tent cheeks schoolboys' tears take up
glasses sight beggar's tongue
who bow'd but stirrup bend his
hath receiv'd an alms will not do't
lest surcease honour mine own truth
by body's action teach mind
most inherent baseness
volumnia at thy choice then
beg thee more dishonour
than thou them come all ruin let
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
as big heart as thou do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst from
but owe thy pride thyself
coriolanus pray content
mother am going market place
chide no more i'll mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them come home belov'd
all trades rome look am going
commend wife i'll return consul
i' th' way flattery further
volumnia do will exit
cominius away tribunes do attend arm yourself
answer mildly they are prepar'd
accusations as hear more strong
than are upon yet
coriolanus word 'mildly' pray let us go
let them accuse by invention

scene vii
camp at short distance from rome
enter aufidius his lieutenant
aufidius do they still fly th' roman
lieutenant do not know what witchcraft's him but
their talk at table their thanks at end
are dark'ned this action sir
even by own
aufidius cannot help now
unless by using means lame foot
our design he bears himself more proudlier
even person than thought he would
when first did embrace him yet his nature
that's no changeling must excuse
lieutenant yet wish sir
mean particular had not
joind commission him but either
had borne action yourself or else
him had left solely
aufidius understand thee well thou sure
when he shall come his account he knows not
what can urge against him although seems
so he thinks no less apparent
shows good husbandry volscian state
fights dragon does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
which shall break his neck or hazard mine
whene'er come our account
lieutenant sir beseech think he'll carry rome
aufidius all places yield him ere he sits down
nobility rome are his
senators patricians love him too
will as rash repeal as hasty
expel him thence think he'll rome
as osprey fish who takes
by sovereignty nature first he was
noble servant them but he could not
carry his honours even whether 'twas pride
which out daily fortune ever taints
happy man whether defect judgment
fail disposing those chances
not other than one thing not moving
from th' casque th' cushion but commanding peace
even same austerity garb
as he controlld war but one these
as he hath spices them all not all
dare so far free him made him fear'd
so hated so banish'd but he has merit
choke utt'rance so our virtues
lie th' interpretation time
hath not tomb so evident as chair
t' extol what hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come let's away when caius rome thine
thou art poor'st all then shortly art thou mine
empty
act v scene
rome public place
menenius no i'll not go hear what he hath said
which was sometime his general who lov'd him
most dear particular he calld father
but what o' go banish'd him
mile before his tent fall down knee
way into his mercy nay if he coy'd
hear cominius speak i'll keep at home
cominius he would not seem know
menenius do hear
urg'd our old acquaintance drops
have bled together 'coriolanus'
he would not answer forbid all names
he was kind nothing titleless
till he had forg'd himself name i' th' fire
burning rome
menenius why so have made good work
pair tribunes have wrack'd rome
make coals cheap noble memory
when was less expected he replied
was bare petition state
one whom they had punish'd
menenius very well
could he say less
cominius offer'd awaken his regard
for's private friends his answer was
he could not stay pick them pile
noisome musty chaff he said 'twas folly
still nose th' offence
menenius one poor grain or two
am one those his mother wife his child
this brave fellow too are grains
are musty chaff are smelt
above moon must burnt
sicinius nay pray patient if refuse aid
this so never needed help yet do not
upbraid's our distress but sure if
more than instant army can make
might stop our countryman
menenius no i'll not meddle
sicinius pray go him
menenius what should do
brutus only make trial what love can do
rome towards marcius
menenius well say marcius
return as cominius returnd
but as discontented friend grief shot
his unkindness say't so
sicinius yet good will
must have thanks from rome after measure
as intended well
menenius i'll undertake't
think he'll hear yet bite his lip
hum at good cominius much unhearts
he was not taken well he had not dind
pout upon morning are unapt
give or forgive but when have stuff'd
these pipes these conveyances our blood
wine feeding have suppler souls
than our priest fasts therefore i'll watch him
till he dieted request
then i'll set upon him
brutus know very road into his kindness
cannot lose way
speed how will shall ere long have knowledge
success exit
cominius he'll never hear him
sicinius not
cominius tell he does sit gold his eye
red as 'twould burn rome his injury
gaoler his pity kneeld before him
'twas very faintly he said 'rise' dismiss'd
thus his speechless hand what he would do
bound an oath yield his conditions
so all hope vain
unless his noble mother his wife
who as hear mean solicit him
mercy his country therefore let's hence
our fair entreaties haste them exeunt

must report th' volscian lords how plainly
have borne this business
aufidius only their ends
have respected stopp'd ears against

private whisper no not such friends
thought them sure
coriolanus this last old man
lov'd above measure father
nay godded indeed their latest refuge
was send him whose old love have
though show'd sourly him once more offer'd
first conditions which they did refuse
cannot now accept grace him only
thought he could do more very little
have yielded fresh embassies suits
nor from state nor private friends hereafter
shall tempted infringe vow
same time 'tis made will not
enter mourning habits virgilia volumnia valeria

wife comes foremost then honour'd mould
wherein this trunk was fram'd her hand
grandchild her blood but out affection
all bond privilege nature break

virgilia lord husband
coriolanus these eyes are not same wore rome
virgilia sorrow delivers us thus chang'd

coriolanus dull actor now
have forgot part am out

forgive tyranny but do not say
'forgive our romans' o kiss

carried from thee dear true lip

wherein seem unnatural desire not
t'allay rages revenges

volumnia o no more no more
have said will not grant us any thing
which deny already yet will ask
if fail our request blame
may hang upon hardness therefore hear us
coriolanus aufidius volsces mark we'll
hear nought from rome private request
volumnia should silent not speak our raiment
state bodies would bewray what life
have led since thy exile think thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
make our eyes flow joy hearts dance comforts
constrains them weep shake fear sorrow
making mother wife child see
son husband father tearing
his country's bowels out poor
thine enmity's most capital thou bar'st us
our prayers gods which comfort
all but enjoy how can
alas how can our country pray
whereto are bound alack or must lose
country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort country must find
an evident calamity though had
our wish which side should win either thou
must as foreign recreant led
manacles through our streets or else
triumphantly tread thy country's ruin
bear palm having bravely shed
purpose not wait fortune till
these wars determine if can not persuade thee
rather show noble grace both parts
than seek end one thou shalt no sooner
march assault thy country than tread
trust to't thou shalt not thy mother's womb
brought thee this world
virgilia ay mine
brought forth this boy keep name
boy 'a shall not tread
i'll run away till am bigger but then i'll fight
coriolanus not womans tenderness
requires nor child nor womans face see

volumnia nay go not from us thus
if were so our request did tend
save romans thereby destroy
volsces whom serve might condemn us
reconcile them while volsces
may say 'this mercy have show'd' romans
'this receiv'd' each either side
give all hail thee cry 'be blest
making up this peace' thou know'st great son
end war's uncertain but this certain
if thou conquer rome benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap such name
whose repetition will dogg'd curses
but his last attempt he wip'd out
destroy'd his country his name remains
th' ensuing age abhorr'd' speak son
thou hast affected fine strains honour
imitate graces gods
tear thunder wide cheeks o' th' air
yet charge thy sulphur bolt
should but rive an oak why dost not speak
think'st thou honourable noble man
he cares not weeping speak thou boy
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons there's no man world
more bound to's mother yet here he lets prate
one i' th' stocks thou hast never thy life
show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond no second brood
has cluck'd thee wars safely home
loaden honour say request's unjust
thou art not honest gods will plague thee
thou restrainst from duty which
mother's part belongs he turns away

philario speak him when he was less furnish'd than now he
frenchman have seen him france had very many there could

doubt not great deal from matter
frenchman then his banishment
iachimo ay approbation those weep this lamentable
divorce under her colours are wonderfully extend him
but fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay
he sojourn how creeps acquaintance
philario his father were soldiers together whom have
been often bound no less than life
enter posthumus
here comes briton let him so entertained amongst as
suits gentlemen knowing stranger his
quality beseech all better known this gentleman
whom commend as noble friend mine how worthy he
will leave appear hereafter rather than story him his
frenchman sir have known together orleans
posthumus since when have been debtor courtesies
which will ever pay yet pay still
frenchman sir o'errate poor kindness was glad did
atone countryman had been pity should have
been put together so mortal purpose as then each bore
upon importance so slight trivial nature
posthumus by pardon sir was then young traveller
rather shunnd go even what heard than every
judgment if offend not say mended quarrel was not
altogether slight
frenchman faith yes put arbitrement swords
by such two would by all likelihood have confounded one
other or have falln both
iachimo can manners ask what was difference
frenchman safely think 'twas contention public which
may without contradiction suffer report was much
an argument fell out last night where each us fell
vouching upon warrant bloody affirmation his more
fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified less
attemptable than any rarest our ladies france
iachimo lady not now living or this gentlemans opinion
by this worn out
posthumus she holds her virtue still mind
iachimo must not so far prefer her fore ours italy
posthumus being so far provok'd as was france would abate
her nothing though profess myself her adorer not her friend
had been something too fair too good any lady britain
if she went before others have seen as diamond yours
outlustres many have beheld could not but believe she
excelled many but have not seen most precious diamond
nor lady
posthumus prais'd her as rated her so do stone
iachimo what do esteem at
posthumus more than world enjoys
iachimo either unparagond mistress dead or she's
posthumus are mistaken one may sold or given if there
were wealth enough purchase or merit gift
other not thing sale only gift gods
iachimo which gods have given
posthumus which by their graces will keep
iachimo may wear her title yours but know strange fowl
light upon neighbouring ponds ring may stoln too so
brace unprizable estimations one but frail
other casual cunning thief or way accomplish'd
posthumus italy contains none so accomplish'd courtier
convince honour mistress if holding or loss
term her frail do nothing doubt have store
thieves notwithstanding fear not ring
philario let us leave here gentlemen
posthumus sir all heart this worthy signior thank
him makes no stranger are familiar at first
iachimo five times so much conversation should get ground
fair mistress make her go back even yielding had
posthumus no no
iachimo dare thereupon pawn moiety estate
ring which opinion o'ervalues something but make
wager rather against confidence than her reputation
bar offence herein too durst attempt against any
lady world
posthumus are great deal abus'd too bold persuasion
doubt not sustain what y'are worthy by attempt
iachimo what's
more punishment too
philario gentlemen enough this came too suddenly let
die as was born pray better acquainted
iachimo would had put estate neighbour's th'
approbation what have spoke
posthumus what lady would choose assail
iachimo yours whom constancy think stands so safe will
lay ten thousand ducats ring commend
court where lady no more advantage than
honour hers which imagine so reserv'd
posthumus will wage against gold gold ring
hold dear as finger 'tis part
iachimo are friend therein wiser if buy
ladies' flesh at million dram cannot preserve from
tainting but see have some religion fear
posthumus this but custom tongue bear graver
purpose hope
iachimo am master speeches would undergo what's
posthumus will shall but lend diamond till return
let there covenants drawn betweens mistress exceeds
goodness hugeness unworthy thinking dare
this match here's ring
philario will have no lay
iachimo by gods one if bring no sufficient
testimony have enjoy'd dearest bodily part

provided have commendation more free entertainment
posthumus embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt

no further enemy she not worth our debate if she remain
unseduc'd not making appear otherwise ill

how parted brothers how first met them
why fled from court whither these
three motives battle
know not how much more should demanded
all other by dependences
from chance chance but nor time nor place
posthumus anchors upon imogen

now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
virtue his will but must fear
his greatness weigh'd his will not his own

he may not as unvalued persons do
carve himself his choice depends
therefore must his choice circumscrib'd
unto voice yielding body
whereof he head then if he says he loves
fits wisdom so far believe
as he his particular act place

then weigh what loss honour may sustain

chariest maid prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty moon
virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
canker galls infants spring
too oft before their buttons disclos'd
contagious blastments are most imminent
wary then best safety lies fear
youth itself rebels though none else near
oph shall th' effect this good lesson keep
as watchman heart but good brother

but do not dull thy palm entertainment
each new hatch'd unfledg'd comrade beware
entrance quarrel but being
bear't th' opposed may beware thee
give every man thine ear but few thy voice
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy

apparel oft proclaims man

neither borrower nor lender
loan oft loses both itself friend
borrowing dulls edge husbandry

farewell blessing season this thee

something scanter maiden presence
set entreatments at higher rate

believe so much him he young
larger tether may he walk

do not believe his vows they are brokers

out o' doors he went without their help

enter prologue
ham shall know by this fellow players cannot keep counsel
they'll tell all
oph will he tell us what this show meant
ham ay or any show you'll show him not asham'd
show he'll not shame tell what means
oph are naught are naught i'll mark play
here stooping clemency

ham this prologue or posy ring
oph 'tis brief lord
ham as womans love
enter two players as king queen
king full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
neptune's salt wash tellus' orbed ground
thirty dozed moons borrowed sheen
since love our hearts hymen did our hands
unite comutual most sacred bands
queen so many journeys may sun moon
make us again count o'er ere love done
but woe are so sick late
so far from cheer from former state
distrust yet though distrust
discomfort lord nothing must
womens fear love holds quantity
now what love proof hath made know
as love siz'd fear so
where love great littlest doubts are fear
where little fears grow great great love grows there
king faith must leave thee love shortly too
operant powers their functions leave do
thou shalt live this fair world behind
honour'd belov'd haply one as kind
husband shalt thou
such love must needs treason breast
when second husband let accurst
none wed second but who killed first
ham aside wormwood wormwood
queen instances second marriage move
are base respects thrift but none love
second time kill husband dead
when second husband kisses bed
king do believe think what now speak
purpose but slave memory
violent birth but poor validity
which now fruit unripe sticks tree
but fill unshaken when they mellow
most necessary 'tis forget
pay ourselves what ourselves debt
what ourselves passion propose
passion ending doth purpose lose
violence either grief or joy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament
grief joys joy grieves slender accident
this world not aye nor 'tis not strange
even our loves should our fortunes change
'tis question left us yet prove
whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
great man down mark his favourite flies
poor advanc'd makes friends enemies
hitherto doth love fortune tend
who want hollow friend doth try
directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly end where begun
our wills fates do so contrary run
our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord dead
queen nor earth give food nor heaven light
desperation turn trust hope
an anchor's cheer prison scope
each opposite blanks face joy
meet what would have well destroy
both here hence pursue lasting strife
if once widow ever wife
ham if she should break now
king 'tis deeply sworn sweet leave here awhile
spirits grow dull fain would beguile
queen sleep rock thy brain
he sleeps
never come mischance between us twain

north yea good lord
those prisoners highness' name demanded
which harry percy here at holmedon took
were as he says not such strength denied
either envy therefore or misprision
guilty this fault not son
hot liege did deny no prisoners
but remember when fight was done
when was dry rage extreme toll
breathless faint leaning upon sword
came there certain lord neat trimly dress'd
fresh as bridegroom his chin new reap'd
show'd stubble land at harvest home
'twixt his finger his thumb he held
pouncet box which ever anon
he gave his nose took't away again
who therewith angry when next came there
took snuff still he smild talk'd
as soldiers bore dead bodies by
he calld them untaught knaves unmannerly
bring slovenly unhandsome corse
betwixt wind his nobility
he questioned amongst rest demanded
prisoners majesty's behalf
then all smarting wounds being cold
so pest'red popingay
out grief impatience
answer'd neglectingly know not what
he should or he should not he made mad
see him shine so brisk smell so sweet
talk so waiting gentlewoman
telling sovereignest thing earth
was parmacity an inward bruise
was great pity so was
this villanous saltpetre should digg'd
out bowels harmless earth
which many good tall fellow had destroy'd
so cowardly but these vile 'guns
he would himself have been soldier
this bald unjointed chat his lord
beseech let not his report
come current an accusation
betwixt love high majesty
blunt circumstance considered good lord
whate'er lord harry percy then had said
such person such place
at such time all rest retold
may reasonably die never rise
do him wrong or any way impeach
king why yet he doth deny his prisoners
but proviso exception
at our own charge shall ransom straight
his brother law foolish mortimer
who soul hath wilfully betray'd
lives those he did lead fight
against great magician damnd glendower
whose daughter as hear earl march
hath lately married shall our coffers then
shall buy treason indent fears
when they have lost forfeited themselves
no barren mountains let him starve
shall never hold man friend
whose tongue shall ask one penny cost
ransom home revolted mortimer
hot revolted mortimer
he never did fall off sovereign liege
but by chance war prove true
those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
when gentle severns sedgy bank
single opposition hand hand
he did confound best part an hour
changing hardiment great glendower
three times they breath'd three times did they drink
upon agreement swift severns flood
who then affrighted their bloody looks
ran fearfully among trembling reeds
bloodstained these valiant cohabitants
never did base rotten policy
colour her working such deadly wounds
nor never could noble mortimer
receive so many all willingly
then let not him slandered revolt
king thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
he never did encounter glendower
tell thee
as owen glendower an enemy
art thou not asham'd but sirrah henceforth

wor who struck this heat up after was gone
hot he will forsooth have all prisoners
when urg'd ransom once again
wive's brother then his cheek look'd pale
trembling even at name mortimer
wor cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd
by richard dead next blood
north he was heard proclamation
then was when unhappy king
whose wrongs us god pardon did set forth
upon his irish expedition
from whence he intercepted did return
depos'd shortly murdered

hot but soft pray did king richard then
proclaim brother edmund mortimer

north he did myself did hear
hot nay then cannot blame his cousin king
wish'd him barren mountains starve
but shall set crown

wherein range under this subtile king

put down richard sweet lovely rose
plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
shall more shame further spoken
are foold discarded shook off
by him whom these shames ye underwent
no yet time serves wherein may redeem
banish'd honours restore yourselves
revenge jeering disdaind contempt
this proud king who studies day night
answer all debt he owes
even bloody payment deaths
therefore say
wor peace cousin say no more
now will unclasp secret book
quick conceiving discontents
i'll read matter deep dangerous
as o'erwalk current roaring loud
unsteadfast footing spear
hot if he fall good night or sink or swim

so honour cross from north south
let them grapple o blood more stirs
rouse lion than start hare
north imagination some great exploit
drives him beyond bounds patience
pluck bright honour from pale fac'd moon
or dive into bottom deep
where fadom line could never touch ground
pluck up drowned honour by locks
so he doth redeem her thence might wear
without corrival all her dignities
but out upon this half fac'd fellowship
wor he apprehends world figures here
but not form what he should attend
hot cry mercy
wor those same noble scots
are prisoners
hot i'll keep them all
by god he shall not have scot them
no if scot would save his soul he shall not
i'll keep them by this hand
wor start away

forbade tongue speak mortimer
but will find him when he lies asleep
his ear i'll holloa 'mortimer'
empty
i'll have starling shall taught speak
nothing but 'mortimer' give him
keep his anger still motion
hot all studies here solemnly defy

king lords give us leave prince wales
must have some private conference but near at hand
shall presently have need
know not whether god will have so
some displeasing service have done
his secret doom out blood
he'll breed revengement scourge
but thou dost thy passages life
make believe thou art only mark'd
hot vengeance rod heaven
punish mistreadings tell else
could such inordinate low desires
such barren pleasures rude society
as thou art match'd withal grafted
accompany greatness thy blood
hold their level thy princely heart
prince so please majesty would could
quit all offences as clear excuse
as well as am doubtless can purge
myself many am charged withal
yet such extenuation let beg
which oft ear greatness needs must bear
by smiling pickthanks base newsmongers
may some things true wherein youth
hath faulty wand'red irregular
pardon lily true submission
king god pardon thee yet let wonder harry
at thy affections which do hold wing
quite from flight all thy ancestors
thy place council thou hast rudely lost
art almost an alien hearts
all court princes blood
hope expectation thy time
ruind soul every man
prophetically do forethink thy fall
had so lavish presence been
so common hackney'd eyes men
so stale cheap vulgar company
opinion did help crown
left reputeless banishment
fellow no mark nor likelihood
by being seldom seen could not stir
but comet was wond'red at
men would tell their children 'this he'
others would say 'where which bolingbroke'
then stole all courtesy from heaven
dress'd myself such humility
did pluck allegiance from mens hearts
even presence crowned king
thus did keep person fresh new
presence robe pontifical
ne'er seen but wond'red at so state
seldom but sumptuous show'd feast
won by rareness such solemnity
skipping king he ambled up down
shallow jesters rash bavin wits
soon kindled soon burnt carded his state
had his great name profaned their scorns
gave his countenance against his name
laugh at gibing boys stand push
every beardless vain comparative
grew companion common streets
enfeoff'd himself popularity
being dally swallowed by mens eyes
they surfeited honey began
loathe taste sweetness whereof little
so when he had occasion seen
he was but as cuckoo june
heard not regarded seen but such eyes
as sick blunted community
afford no extraordinary gaze
such as bent unlike majesty
when shines seldom admiring eyes
but rather drows'd hung their eyelids down
slept his face rend'red such aspect
being his presence glutted gorg'd full
very line harry standest thou
thou hast lost thy princely privilege
vile participation not an eye
but aweary thy common sight
save mine which hath desir'd see thee more
which now doth would not have do
make blind itself foolish tenderness
prince shall hereafter thrice gracious lord

bloody battles bruising arms
what never dying honour hath he got
against renowmed douglas whose high deeds
whose hot incursions great name arms
holds from all soldiers chief majority
military title capital
through all kingdoms acknowledge christ
this infant warrior his enterprises
discomfited great douglas ta'en him once
enlarged him made friend him

shames redoubled time will come

his glorious deeds indignities
percy but factor good lord
engross up glorious deeds behalf

he shall render every glory up
yea even slightest worship his time
this name god promise here
which if he pleas'd shall perform
do beseech majesty may salve
long grown wounds intemperance
if not end life cancels all bands

more than he haply may retail from
northumberland now travers what good tidings comes
travers lord sir john umfrevile turnd back
out rode after him came spurring hard
gentleman almost forspent speed
stopp'd by breathe his bloodied horse
he ask'd way chester him
did demand what news from shrewsbury
he told rebellion had bad luck
young harry percy's spur was cold
he gave his able horse head
bending forward struck his armed heels
up rowel head starting so

staying no longer question
northumberland ha again
said he young harry percy's spur was cold
hotspur coldspur rebellion
had met ill luck
lord bardolph lord i'll tell what
if young lord son have not day

lord bardolph who he
he was some hilding fellow had stoln
horse he rode upon life
spoke at venture look here comes more news
enter morton
northumberland yea this mans brow title leaf
so looks strand whereon imperious flood
hath left witness'd usurpation
say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
morton ran from shrewsbury noble lord
where hateful death put his ugliest mask
fright our party
northumberland how doth son brother
thou tremblest whiteness thy cheek
apter than thy tongue tell thy errand
so dull so dread look so woe begone
drew priam's curtain dead night
would have told him half his troy was burnt
but priam found fire ere he his tongue
percy's death ere thou report'st
this thou wouldst say 'your son did thus thus
brother thus so fought noble douglas'
stopping greedy ear their bold deeds
but end stop ear indeed
ending 'brother son all are dead'
morton douglas living brother yet
but lord son
northumberland why he dead
see what ready tongue suspicion hath
he but fears thing he would not know
hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
what he fear'd chanced yet speak morton
tell thou an earl his divination lies
make thee rich doing such wrong
morton are too great by gainsaid
spirit too true fears too certain
northumberland yet all this say not percy's dead
see strange confession thine eye
thou shak'st thy head hold'st fear or sin
speak truth if he slain say so
tongue offends not reports his death
he doth sin doth belie dead
yet first bringer unwelcome news
hath but losing office his tongue
sounds ever after as sullen bell
rememb'red tolling departing friend
lord bardolph cannot think lord son dead
morton am sorry should force believe
which would god had not seen
but these mine eyes saw him bloody state
rend'ring faint quittance wearied out breath'd
never daunted percy earth
from whence life he never more sprung up
few his death whose spirit lent fire
even dullest peasant his camp
being bruited once took fire heat away
from best temper'd courage his troops
from his metal was his party steeled
which once him abated an rest
turnd themselves dull heavy lead
upon enforcement flies greatest speed
so did our men heavy hotspur's loss
lend this weight such lightness their fear
arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
fly from field then was noble worcester
too soon ta'en prisoner furious scot
bloody douglas whose well labouring sword
had three times slain th' appearance king
those turnd their backs his flight
stumbling fear was took sum all
king hath won hath sent out
speedy power encounter lord
under conduct young lancaster
westmoreland this news at full
northumberland this shall have time enough mourn
poison there physic these news
having been well would have made sick
as wretch whose fever weak'ned joints
strengthless hinges buckle under life
impatient his fit breaks fire
out his keeper's arms even so limbs
weak'ned grief being now enrag'd grief
are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
scaly gauntlet now joints steel
must glove this hand hence thou sickly coif
thou art guard too wanton head
now bind brows iron approach
ragged'st hour time spite dare bring
frown upon th' enrag'd northumberland
let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
keep wild flood confind let order die
let this world no longer stage
feed contention ling'ring act
but let one spirit first born cain
reign all bosoms each heart being set
darkness burier dead
lord bardolph this strained passion doth wrong lord
morton sweet earl divorce not wisdom from honour
lives all loving complices
lean health which if give o'er
stormy passion must perforce decay
cast th' event war noble lord
summ'd account chance before said
'let us make head' was pre surmise
knew he walk'd o'er perils an edge
more likely fall than get o'er
were advis'd his flesh was capable
wounds scars his forward spirit
would lift him where most trade danger rang'd
yet did say 'go forth' none this
though strongly apprehended could restrain
stiff borne action what hath then befalln
or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
lord bardolph all are engaged this loss
knew ventured such dangerous seas
if wrought out life 'twas ten one
yet ventur'd gain propos'd
chok'd respect likely peril fear'd
since are o'erset venture again
come will put forth body goods
morton 'tis more than time most noble lord
hear certain dare speak truth
well appointed pow'rs he man
who double surety binds his followers
lord son had only but corpse
but shadows shows men fight
same word 'rebellion did divide
action their bodies from their souls
they did fight queasiness constraind
as men drink potions their weapons only
seem'd our side but their spirits souls
as fish are pond but now bishop
turns insurrection religion
suppos'd sincere holy his thoughts
he's follow'd both body mind
doth enlarge his rising blood
fair king richard scrap'd from pomfret stones
derives from heaven his quarrel his cause
tells them he doth bestride bleeding land
gasping life under great bolingbroke
northumberland knew this before but speak truth

most noble friends pray all
speak plainly opinions our hopes
first lord marshal what say
mowbray well allow occasion our amis
but gladly would better satisfied
look forehead bold big enough
upon power puissance king
hastings our present musters grow upon file
five twenty thousand men choice
our supplies live largely hope
great northumberland whose bosom burns
an incensed fire injuries
lord bardolph question then lord hastings standeth thus
whether our present five twenty thousand
hastings him may
lord bardolph yea marry there's point
but if without him thought too feeble
judgment should not step too far
till had his assistance by hand
theme so bloody fac'd as this
conjecture expectation surmise
aids incertain should not admitted
archbishop 'tis very true lord bardolph indeed
lord bardolph was lord who lind himself hope
eating air promise supply
flatt'ring himself project power
much smaller than smallest his thoughts
so great imagination
proper madmen led his powers death
winking leapt into destruction
hastings but by leave never yet did hurt
lay down likelihoods forms hope
indeed instant action cause foot
lives so hope as an early spring
see th' appearing buds which prove fruit
hope gives not so much warrant as despair
frosts will bite them when mean build
first survey plot then draw model
when see figure house
then must rate cost erection
which if find outweighs ability
fewer offices or at least desist
build at all much more this great work
which almost pluck kingdom down
set another up should survey
plot situation model
consent upon sure foundation
question surveyors know our own estate
how able such work undergo
weigh against his opposite or else
using names men instead men
one draws model house
beyond his power build who half through
gives o'er leaves his part created cost
naked subject weeping clouds
waste churlish winter's tyranny
hastings grant our hopes yet likely fair birth
should still born now possess'd
utmost man expectation
even as are equal king
lord bardolph what king but five twenty thousand
hastings us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
his divisions as times do brawl
are three heads one power against french
one against glendower perforce third
must take up us so unfirm king
three divided his coffers sound
hollow poverty emptiness
come against us full puissance
need not dreaded
hastings if he should do so
he leaves his back unarm'd french welsh
baying at his heels never fear
lord bardolph who should lead his forces hither
hastings duke lancaster westmoreland
against welsh himself harry monmouth
but who substituted against french
archbishop let us
publish occasion our arms
commonwealth sick their own choice
their over greedy love hath surfeited
an habitation giddy unsure
hath he buildeth vulgar heart
o thou fond many what loud applause
didst thou beat heaven blessing bolingbroke
before he was what thou wouldst have him
thou beastly feeder art so full him
thou provok'st thyself cast him up
so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
thy glutton bosom royal richard
now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
howlst find what trust these times
they when richard liv'd would have him die
are now become enamour'd his grave
thou threw'st dust upon his goodly head
after th' admired heels bolingbroke
criest now 'o earth yield us king again
take thou this' o thoughts men accurs'd

reverend father these noble lords
base bloody insurrection
fair honours lord archbishop
whose see by civil peace maintaind
whose beard silver hand peace hath touch'd
whose learning good letters peace hath tutor'd
whose white investments figure innocence
dove very blessed spirit peace
wherefore do so ill translate yourself
out speech peace bears such grace
turning books graves ink blood
pens lances tongue divine
loud trumpet point war
archbishop wherefore do this so question stands
briefly this end are all diseas'd
our surfeiting wanton hours
have brought ourselves into burning fever
must bleed which disease
our late king richard being infected died
take not here as physician
nor do as an enemy peace
troop throngs military men
but rather show awhile fearful war
diet rank minds sick happiness
purge th' obstructions which begin stop
our very veins life hear more plainly
have equal balance justly weigh'd
what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs suffer
see which way stream time doth run
are enforc'd from our most quiet there
by rough torrent occasion
have summary all our griefs
when time shall serve show articles
which long ere this offer'd king
might by no suit gain our audience
when are wrong'd would unfold our griefs
are denied access unto his person
dangers days but newly gone
whose memory written earth
yet appearing blood examples
every minute's instance present now
hath put us these ill beseeming arms
not break peace or any branch
but establish here peace indeed
concurring both name quality
westmoreland when ever yet was appeal denied
what peer hath been subornd grate
should seal this lawless bloody book
forg'd rebellion seal divine
consecrate commotions bitter edge
archbishop brother general commonwealth
brother horn an household cruelty
make quarrel particular
westmoreland there no need any such redress
or if there were not belongs
feel bruises days before
suffer condition these times
lay heavy unequal hand
upon our honours
westmoreland o good lord mowbray
construe times their necessities
shall say indeed time
not king doth injuries
yet part not appears
should have an inch any ground
build grief were not restor'd
all duke norfolk's signiories
noble right well rememb'red father's
mowbray what thing honour had father lost
need reviv'd breath'd
king lov'd him as state stood then
was force perforce compelld banish him
then henry bolingbroke he
their neighing coursers daring spur
their armed staves charge their beavers down
their eyes fire sparkling through sights steel
loud trumpet blowing them together
then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
father from breast bolingbroke
o when king did throw his warder down
his own life hung upon staff he threw
then threw he down himself all their lives
have since miscarried under bolingbroke
westmoreland speak lord mowbray now know not what
earl hereford was reputed then
england most valiant gentleman
who knows whom fortune would then have smild
but if father had been victor there
he ne'er had borne out coventry
all country general voice
cried hate upon him all their prayers love
bless'd grac'd indeed more than king
but this mere digression from purpose
here come from our princely general
know griefs tell from his grace
he will give audience wherein
shall appear demands are just
shall enjoy them everything set off
might so much as think enemies
mowbray but he hath forc'd us compel this offer
westmoreland mowbray overween take so
this offer comes from mercy not from fear
lo within ken our army lies
upon mine honour all too confident
give admittance thought fear
our battle more full names than yours
our men more perfect use arms
our armour all as strong our cause best
then reason will our hearts should as good
mowbray well by will shall admit no parley
westmoreland argues but shame offence
rotten case abides no handling
hastings hath prince john full commission
very ample virtue his father
hear absolutely determine
what conditions shall stand upon
westmoreland intended generals name
muse make so slight question
this contains our general grievances
each several article herein redress'd
all members our cause both here hence
are insinewed this action
acquitted by true substantial form
present execution our wills
us our purposes confind
come within our awful banks again
knit our powers arm peace
sight both our battles may meet
either end peace which god so frame
or place diff'rence call swords
which must decide
archbishop lord will do so exit westmoreland
mowbray there thing within bosom tells
no conditions our peace can stand
hastings fear not if can make our peace
upon such large terms so absolute
our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
mowbray yea but our valuation shall such
every slight false derived cause
yea every idle nice wanton reason
shall king taste this action
were our royal faiths martyrs love
shall winnow'd so rough wind
even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
good from bad find no partition
dainty such picking grievances
he hath found end one doubt by death
revives two greater heirs life
therefore will he wipe his tables clean
keep no tell tale his memory
may repeat history his los
new remembrance full well he knows
he cannot so precisely weed this land
as his misdoubts present occasion
plucking unfix an enemy
he doth unfasten so shake friend
so this land an offensive wife
hath enrag'd him offer strokes
as he striking holds his infant up
hangs resolv'd correction arm
was uprear'd execution
hastings besides king hath wasted all his rods
late offenders he now doth lack
so his power fangless lion
may offer but not hold
archbishop 'tis very true
therefore assur'd good lord marshal
if do now make our atonement well
our peace will broken limb united
grow stronger breaking

had forestalld this dear deep rebuke
ere grief had spoke had heard
course so far there crown
he wears crown immortally
long guard yours kneeling if affect more

which most inward true duteous spirit
teacheth this prostrate exterior bending
god witness when here came
found no course breath within majesty
how cold struck heart if do feign
o let present wildness die
never live show th' incredulous world
noble change have purposed
coming look thinking dead
spake unto this crown as having sense
thus upbraided 'the care thee depending
hath fed upon body father
therefore thou best gold art worst gold

hast eat thy bearer up' thus most royal liege
accusing put head

thou mightst win more thy father's love
pleading so wisely excuse
come hither harry sit thou by bed

thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
all friends which thou must make thy friends
have but their stings teeth newly ta'en out
by whose power well might lodge fear
again displac'd which avoid
cut them off had purpose now
lead out many holy land
lest rest lying still might make them look

canterbury lord i'll tell self bill urg'd
which th' eleventh year last king's reign
was had indeed against us pass'd
did push out farther question
ely but how lord shall resist now
canterbury must thought if pass against us
lose better half our possession
all temporal lands which men devout
by testament have given church
would they strip from us being valu'd thus
as much as would maintain king's honour
full fifteen earls fifteen hundred knights
relief lazars weak age
indigent faint souls past corporal toil
hundred alms houses right well supplied
coffers king beside
thousand pounds by th' year thus runs bill
ely this would drink deep
canterbury 't would drink cup all
ely but what prevention
canterbury king full grace fair regard
canterbury courses his youth promis'd not
breath no sooner left his father's body
but his wildness mortified him
seem'd die too yea at very moment
consideration an angel came
whipp'd th' offending adam out him
leaving his body as paradise
t'envelop contain celestial spirits
never was such sudden scholar made
such heady currance scouring faults
nor never hydra headed wilfulnes
so soon did lose his seat all at once
as this king
ely are blessed change
canterbury hear him but reason divinity
all admiring an inward wish
would desire king were made prelate
hear him debate commonwealth affairs
list his discourse war shall hear
fearful battle rend'red music
turn him any cause policy
gordian knot he will unloose
familiar as his garter when he speaks
air charter'd libertine still
mute wonder lurketh mens ears
steal his sweet honey'd sentences
so art practic part life
which wonder how his grace should glean
since his addiction was courses vain
his companies unletter'd rude shallow
his hours filld up riots banquets sports
never noted him any study
any retirement any sequestration
from open haunts popularity
ely strawberry grows underneath nettle
wholesome berries thrive ripen best
so prince obscur'd his contemplation
under veil wildness which no doubt
grew summer grass fastest by night
unseen yet crescive his faculty
canterbury must so miracles are ceas'd
therefore must needs admit means
how things are perfected
ely but good lord
how now mitigation this bill
incline or no
canterbury he seems indifferent
or rather swaying more upon our part
than cherishing th' exhibiters against us
have made an offer his majesty
upon our spiritual convocation
regard causes now hand
which have opend his grace at large
as touching france give greater sum
did his predecessors part withal

canterbury good acceptance his majesty

bishop ely
canterbury god his angels guard sacred throne

king henry sure thank
learned lord pray proceed
justly religiously unfold
why law salique they have france
or should or should not bar us our claim
god forbid dear faithful lord
or nicely charge understanding soul
opening titles miscreate whose right
suits not native colours truth
god doth know how many now health
shall drop their blood approbation
what reverence shall incite us
therefore take heed how impawn our person
how awake our sleeping sword war
charge name god take heed
without much fall blood whose guiltless drops
are every one woe sore complaint
'gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto swords
makes such waste brief mortality
under this conjuration speak lord
will hear note believe heart
what speak conscience wash'd
as pure as sin baptism
canterbury then hear gracious sovereign peers
this imperial throne there no bar
make against highness' claim france
but this which they produce from pharamond
'in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant'
'no woman shall succeed salique land'
which salique land french unjustly gloze
realm france pharamond
founder this law female bar
yet their own authors faithfully affirm
between floods sala elbe
where charles great having subdu'd saxons
there left behind settled certain french
who holding disdain german women
some dishonest manners their life
establish'd then this law wit no female
should inheritrix salique land
which salique as said 'twixt elbe sala
at this day germany calld meisen
was not devised realm france
nor did french possess salique land
until four hundred one twenty years
after defunction king pharamond
idly suppos'd founder this law
who died within year our redemption
four hundred twenty six charles great
subdu'd saxons did seat french
beyond river sala year
king pepin which deposed childeric
did as heir general being descended
blithild which was daughter king clothair
make claim title crown france
hugh capet also who usurp'd crown
charles duke lorraine sole heir male
true line stock charles great
find his title some shows truth
though pure truth was corrupt naught
daughter charlemain who was son
lewis emperor lewis son
charles great also king lewis tenth
who was sole heir usurper capet
could not keep quiet his conscience
wearing crown france till satisfied
fair queen isabel his grandmother
was lineal lady ermengare
daughter charles foresaid duke lorraine
was re united crown france
so as clear as summer's sun
king pepins title hugh capet's claim
king lewis his satisfaction all appear
hold right tide female
so do kings france unto this day
howbeit they would hold up this salique law
bar highness claiming from female
rather choose hide them net
usurp'd from progenitors
king henry may right conscience make this claim
canterbury sin upon head dread sovereign
book numbers writ
when man dies let inheritance
descend unto daughter gracious lord

look back into mighty ancestors

had nobles richer more loyal subjects
whose hearts have left their bodies here england

canterbury o let their bodies follow dear liege
blood sword fire win right
aid whereof spiritualty
will raise highness such mighty sum

king henry must not only arm t' invade french
but lay down our proportions defend
against scot who will make road upon us
all advantages
canterbury they those marches gracious sovereign
shall wall sufficient defend
our inland from pilfering borderers
king henry do not mean coursing snatchers only
who hath been still giddy neighbour us
shall read great grandfather
never went his forces into france
but scot his unfurnish'd kingdom
came pouring tide into breach
ample brim fulness his force
galling gleaned land hot assays
girdling grievous siege castles towns
england being empty defence
canterbury she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd liege
hear her but exampled by herself
when all her chivalry hath been france
she mourning widow her nobles
she hath herself not only well defended
but taken impounded as stray
king scots whom she did send france
fill king edward's fame prisoner kings
make her chronicle as rich praise
sunken wreck sumless treasuries
westmoreland but there's saying very old true
'if will france win
then scotland first begin'
once eagle england being prey
her unguarded nest weasel scot
comes sneaking so sucks her princely eggs
playing mouse absence cat
tear havoc more than she can eat
yet but crush'd necessity

yours noble sinews our power

tell him he hath made match such wrangler
all courts france will disturb'd
chaces understand him well
how he comes o'er us our wilder days
not measuring what use made them
therefore living hence did give ourself
barbarous licence as 'tis ever common
men are merriest when they are from home

king show sail greatness
when do rouse throne france
have laid by majesty
plodded man working days

yea strike dauphin blind look us
tell pleasant prince this mock his
hath turnd his balls gun stones his soul
shall stand sore charged wasteful vengeance
shall fly them many thousand widows
shall this his mock mock their dear husbands
mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
some are yet ungotten unborn
shall have cause curse dauphins scorn
whom do appeal whose name
tell dauphin am coming
venge as may put forth
rightful hand well hallow'd cause
so get hence peace tell dauphin
his jest will savour but shallow wit
when thousands weep more than did laugh at
convey them safe conduct fare well
exeunt ambassadors
king henry hope make sender blush at
therefore lords omit no happy hour
may give furth'rance our expedition
have now no thought us but france

patches colours forms being fetch'd
from glist'ring semblances piety

gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
unless dub thee name traitor
if same demon hath gulld thee thus
should his lion gait walk whole world
tell legions 'i can never win
soul so easy as englishmans'
o how hast thou jealousy infected
sweetness affiance show men dutiful
why so didst thou seem they grave learned
why so didst thou come they noble family
why so didst thou seem they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare diet
free from gross passion or mirth or anger
garnish'd deck'd modest complement
not working eye without ear
but purged judgment trusting neither
such so finely bolted didst thou seem
thus thy fall hath left kind blot
mark full fraught man best indued

at discovery most dangerous treason

touching our person seek no revenge

outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they

king's laws now king's quarrel where they feared
death they have borne life away where they would safe
they perish then if they die unprovided no more king
guilty their damnation than he was before guilty those
impieties which they are now visited every subject's
therefore should every soldier wars do as every sick man

death him advantage or not dying time was blessedly
lost wherein such preparation was gained him escapes

tenth august last this dreadful lord
retiring from siege orleans
by three twenty thousand french
was round encompassed set upon
no leisure had he enrank his men
he wanted pikes set before his archers
instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out hedges
they pitched ground confusedly
keep horsemen off from breaking
more than three hours fight continued
where valiant talbot above human thought
hundreds he sent hell none durst stand him
here there everywhere enrag'd he slew
french exclaim'd devil was arms
all whole army stood agaz'd him
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
'a talbot talbot' cried out amain
rush'd into bowels battle
here had conquest fully been seald up
if sir john fastolfe had not play'd coward
purpose relieve follow them
cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
hence grew general wreck massacre
enclosed were they their enemies
base walloon win dauphins grace

faintly besiege us one hour month
alencon they want their porridge their fat bull
either they must dieted mules
have their provender tied their mouths
or piteous they will look drowned mice
reignier let's raise siege why live idly here
talbot taken whom wont fear

hunger will enforce them more eager
old know them rather their teeth

will answer unpremeditated
courage try by combat if thou dar'st

plantagenet ay noble uncle thus ignobly us'd

plantagenet first lean thine aged back against mine arm

this day argument upon case
some words there grew 'twixt somerset
among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
did upbraid father's death

else had requited him
therefore good uncle father's sake
alliance sake declare cause
father earl cambridge lost his head

plantagenet discover more at large what cause was

mortimer true thou seest no issue have
fainting words do warrant death
thou art heir rest wish thee gather
but yet wary thy studious care
plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail
but yet methinks father's execution
was nothing less than bloody tyranny
mortimer silence nephew thou politic
mountain not remov'd
but now thy uncle removing hence
as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
long continuance settled place
plantagenet o uncle would some part young years
might but redeem passage age
mortimer thou dost then wrong as slaughterer
empty
which giveth many wounds when one will kill
only give order funeral
so farewell fair all thy hopes
prosperous thy life peace war dies
plantagenet peace no war befall thy parting soul
prison hast thou spent pilgrimage

well will lock his counsel breast

o think upon conquest father
tender years let us not forgo
trifle was bought blood

king henry wondrous rare description noble earl
her virtues graced external gifts
do breed love's settled passions heart
as rigour tempestuous gusts
provokes mightiest hulk against tide
so am driven by breath her renown
either suffer shipwreck or arrive
where may have fruition her love
suffolk tush good lord this superficial tale
but preface her worthy praise
had sufficient skill utter them
would make volume enticing lines
able ravish any dull conceit
which more she not so divine
so full replete choice all delights
but as humble lowliness mind
she content at command
command mean virtuous intents
love honour henry as her lord
therefore lord protector give consent
margaret may england's royal queen
gloucester so should give consent flatter sin
know lord highness betroth'd
unto another lady esteem
how shall then dispense contract
not deface honour reproach

her father no better than an earl
although glorious titles he excel
suffolk yes lord her father king
king naples jerusalem
as his alliance will confirm our peace
keep frenchmen allegiance

exeter beside his wealth doth warrant liberal dower
where reignier sooner will receive than give
suffolk dow'r lords disgrace not so king
he should so abject base poor
choose wealth not perfect love
not seek queen make him rich
so worthless peasants bargain their wives
as market men oxen sheep or horse
marriage matter more worth
than dealt by attorneyship
not whom will but whom his grace affects
must companion his nuptial bed
therefore lords since he affects her most
most all these reasons bindeth us
what wedlock forced but hell
an age discord continual strife
whereas contrary bringeth bliss
pattern celestial peace
whom should match henry being king
but margaret daughter king
her peerless feature joined her birth
approves her fit none but king
her valiant courage undaunted spirit
will answer our hope issue king
henry son unto conqueror
likely beget more conquerors
if lady so high resolve
as fair margaret he link'd love
then yield lords here conclude
margaret shall queen none but she
king henry whether through force report
noble lord suffolk or
any passion inflaming love
cannot tell but this am assur'd
feel such sharp dissension breast

take therefore shipping post lord france
agree any covenants procure
lady margaret do vouchsafe come

warwick father duke hath told truth
thus got house lancaster crown
york which now they hold by force not by right
richard first sons heir being dead

salisbury but william hatfield died without an heir
claim crown had issue philippe daughter

edmund had issue roger earl march
roger had issue edmund anne eleanor
salisbury this edmund reign bolingbroke
as have read laid claim unto crown
but owen glendower had been king

married richard earl cambridge who was
edmund langley edward third's fifth son son
by her claim kingdom she was heir
roger earl march who was son
edmund mortimer who married philippe
sole daughter unto lionel duke clarence

queen can not see or will ye not observe
what majesty he bears himself
how insolent late he become
how proud how peremptory unlike himself
know time since he was mild affable
if did but glance far off look
immediately he was upon his knee
all court admir'd him submission

passeth by stiff unbowed knee
disdaining duty us belongs
small curs are not regarded when they grin
but great men tremble when lion roars
humphrey no little man england
first note he near descent
should fall he next will mount
seemeth then no policy
respecting what rancorous mind he bears
he should come about royal person
or admitted highness' council
by flattery hath he won commons' hearts
when he please make commotion
'tis fear'd they all will follow him

levy great sums money through realm
soldiers' pay france never sent

buckingham tut these are petty faults faults unknown
king henry lords at once care have us
mow down thorns would annoy our foot
worthy praise but shall speak conscience
our kinsman gloucester as innocent
from meaning treason our royal person

duke virtuous mild too well given
dream evil or work downfall
queen ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
he's disposed as hateful raven

gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see blush
nor change countenance this arrest
heart unspotted not easily daunted
purest spring not so free from mud
as am clear from treason sovereign
york 'tis thought lord took bribes france
being protector stay'd soldiers' pay
by means whereof his highness hath lost france
gloucester but thought so what are they think
never robb'd soldiers their pay
nor ever had one penny bribe from france
so help god as have watch'd night
ay night by night studying good england
doit e'er wrested from king
brought against at trial day
no many pound mine own proper store
because would not tax needy commons
have dispursed garrisons
never ask'd restitution
cardinal serves well lord say so much
gloucester say no more than truth so help god
york protectorship did devise
strange tortures offenders never heard
gloucester why 'tis well known whiles was protector
pity was all fault was
should melt at an offender's tears
lowly words were ransom their fault
unless were bloody murderer
or foul felonious thief fleec'd poor passengers
never gave them condign punishment
murder indeed bloody sin tortur'd
above felon or what trespass else
but mightier crimes are laid unto charge
whereof cannot easily purge yourself
do arrest his highness' name
here commit lord cardinal
keep until further time trial
king henry lord gloucester 'tis special hope
will clear yourself from all suspense
conscience tells are innocent
gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand
foul subornation predominant
equity exild highness' land
know their complot have life
if death might make this island happy
prove period their tyranny
would expend all willingness
but mine made prologue their play
thousands more yet suspect no peril
beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
sharp buckingham unburdens his tongue
envious load lies upon his heart
dogged york reaches at moon
whose overweening arm have pluck'd back
by false accuse doth level at life
sovereign lady rest
causeless have laid disgraces head
liefest liege mine enemy
ay all have laid heads together
myself had notice conventicles
all make away guiltless life
shall not want false witness condemn
nor store treasons augment guilt
ancient proverb will well effected
'a staff quickly found beat dog'
cardinal liege his railing intolerable
from treasons secret knife traitor's rage
thus upbraided chid rated at
offender granted scope speech
'twill make them cool zeal unto grace
suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
as if she had suborned some swear
false allegations o'erthrow his state
queen but can give loser leave chide
beshrew winners they play'd false
well such losers may have leave speak
buckingham he'll wrest sense hold us here all day
lord cardinal he prisoner
cardinal sirs take away duke guard him sure
gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
before his legs firm bear his body
thus shepherd beaten from thy side
wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
good king henry thy decay fear exit guarded
king henry lords what wisdoms seemeth best
do or undo as if ourself were here
queen what will highness leave parliament
king henry ay margaret heart drownd grief
whose flood begins flow within mine eyes
body round engirt misery
what's more miserable than discontent
ah uncle humphrey thy face see
yet good humphrey hour come
e'er prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith
what louring star now envies thy estate
these great lords margaret our queen
do seek subversion thy harmless life
thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
as butcher takes away calf
binds wretch beats when strays
bearing bloody slaughter house
as dam runs lowing up down
looking way her harmless young one went
can do nought but wail her darling's loss
even so myself bewails good gloucester's case
sad unhelpful tears dimm'd eyes
look after him cannot do him good
so mighty are his vowed enemies
his fortunes will weep 'twixt each groan
say 'who's traitor gloucester he none' exit
henry lord cold great affairs
too full foolish pity gloucester's show
beguiles him as mournful crocodile
sorrow snares relenting passengers
or as snake rolld flow'ring bank
shining checker'd slough doth sting child
beauty thinks excellent
believe lords were none more wise than
yet herein judge mine own wit good
rid us from fear have him
cardinal he should die worthy policy
but yet want colour his death
'tis meet he condemnd by course law
suffolk but mind were no policy
king will labour still save his life
commons haply rise save his life
yet have but trivial argument
more than mistrust shows him worthy death
suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as
york 'tis york hath more reason his death
but lord cardinal lord suffolk
say as think speak from souls
were't not all one an empty eagle were set
guard chicken from hungry kite
as place duke humphrey king's protector
queen so poor chicken should sure death
suffolk madam 'tis true were't not madness then
who being accus'd crafty murderer
his guilt should but idly posted over
because his purpose not executed
no let him die he fox
by nature prov'd an enemy flock
before his chaps staind crimson blood
as humphrey prov'd by reasons liege
do not stand quillets how slay him
by gins by snares by subtlety
so he dead good deceit
which mates him first first intends deceit
queen thrice noble suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke
suffolk not resolute except so much were done
things are often spoke seldom meant
but heart accordeth tongue
seeing deed meritorious
preserve sovereign from his foe
say but word will his priest
ere can take due orders priest
say consent censure well deed
i'll provide his executioner
tender so safety liege
suffolk here hand deed worthy doing
queen so say
york now three have spoke
skills not greatly who impugns our doom
enter post
signify rebels there are up
put englishmen unto sword
send succours lords stop rage betime
before wound do grow uncurable
being green there great hope help
cardinal breach craves quick expedient stop
what counsel give this weighty cause
york somerset sent as regent thither
'tis meet lucky ruler employ'd
somerset if york all his far fet policy
had been regent there instead
he never would have stay'd france so long
york no not lose all as thou hast done
rather would have lost life betimes
than bring burden dishonour home
by staying there so long till all were lost
show one scar character'd thy skin
mens flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win
if wind fuel brought feed
no more good york sweet somerset still
thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
might happily have prov'd far worse than his
york what worse than nought nay then shame take all
somerset number thee wishest shame
cardinal lord york try what fortune
th' uncivil kerns ireland are arms
temper clay blood englishmen
collected choicely from each county some
try hap against irishmen
york will lord so please his majesty
suffolk why our authority his consent
what do establish he confirms
then noble york take thou this task hand
york am content provide soldiers lords
whiles take order mine own affairs
suffolk charge lord york will see perform'd
cardinal no more him will deal him
henceforth he shall trouble us no more
so break off day almost spent
lord suffolk must talk event
york lord suffolk within fourteen days
at bristol expect soldiers
there i'll ship them all ireland
suffolk i'll see truly done lord york
exeunt all but york
change misdoubt resolution
thou hop'st or what thou art
resign death not worth th' enjoying
let pale fac'd fear keep mean born man
find no harbour royal heart
faster than spring time show'rs comes thought thought
not thought but thinks dignity
brain more busy than labouring spider
weaves tedious snares trap mine enemies
send packing an host men
fear but warm starved snake
who cherish'd breasts will sting hearts
'twas men lack'd will give them
take kindly yet well assur'd
put sharp weapons madmans hands
whiles ireland nourish mighty band
will stir up england some black storm
shall blow ten thousand souls heaven or hell
until golden circuit head
glorious suns transparent beams
do calm fury this mad bred flaw
minister intent
have seduc'd headstrong kentishman
john cade ashford
make commotion as full well he can
under tide john mortimer
ireland have seen this stubborn cade
fought so long tiff his thighs darts
were almost sharp quilld porpentine
end being rescu'd have seen
him caper upright wild morisco
shaking bloody darts as he his bells
full often shag hair'd crafty kern
hath he conversed enemy
undiscover'd come again
given notice their villainies
john mortimer which now dead
face gait speech he doth resemble
by this shall perceive commons' mind
how they affect house claim york
say he taken rack'd tortured
know no pain they can inflict upon him
will make him say mov'd him those arms
say he thrive as 'tis great he will
why then from ireland come strength
humphrey being dead as he shall

how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou

queen how fares lord help lords king dead
somerset rear up his body wring him by nose
queen run go help help o henry ope thine eyes
suffolk he doth revive again madam patient
king o heavenly god
queen how fares gracious lord
king henry what doth lord suffolk comfort
came he right now sing ravens note
whose dismal tune bereft vital pow'rs
thinks he chirping wren
by crying comfort from hollow breast
can chase away first conceived sound
hide not thy poison such sug'red words
lay not thy hands forbear say
their touch affrights as serpent's sting
upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny
sits grim majesty fright world
look not upon thine eyes are wounding
yet do not go away come basilisk
kill innocent gazer thy sight
shade death shall find joy
life but double death'now gloucester's dead
queen why do rate lord suffolk thus
although duke was enemy him
myself foe as he was
might liquid tears or heart offending groans
or blood consuming sighs recall his life
would blind weeping sick groans
look pale as primrose blood drinking sighs
all have noble duke alive
what know how world may deem
known were but hollow friends
may judg'd made duke away
princes' courts filld reproach
this get by his death ay unhappy
queen crownd infamy
king henry ah woe gloucester wretched man
queen woe more wretched than he
what dost thou turn away hide thy face
am no loathsome leper look
what art thou adder waxen deaf
poisonous too kill thy forlorn queen
why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy
erect his statue worship
make image but an alehouse sign
was this nigh wreck'd upon sea
twice by awkward wind from england's bank
drove back again unto native clime
what boded this but well forewarning wind
did seem say 'seek not scorpions nest
nor set no footing this unkind shore'
he loos'd them forth their brazen caves
bid them blow towards england's blessed shore
or turn our stern upon dreadful rock
yet aeolus would not murderer
but left hateful office unto thee
pretty vaulting sea refus'd drown
knowing thou wouldst have drownd shore
tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
splitting rocks cow'r'd sinking sands
because thy flinty heart more hard than they
might thy palace perish margaret
as far as could ken thy chalky cliffs
when from thy shore tempest beat us back
stood upon hatches storm
when dusky sky began rob
earnest gaping sight thy land's view
took costly jewel from neck
heart was bound diamonds
so wish'd thy body might heart
even this lost fair england's view
bid mine eyes packing heart
calld them blind dusky spectacles
losing ken albions wished coast
how often have tempted suffolk's tongue
agent thy foul inconstancy
sit witch as ascanius did
when he madding dido would unfold
am not witch'd her or thou not false him
ay can no more die margaret
henry weeps thou dost live so long
noise within enter warwick salisbury
many commons
warwick reported mighty sovereign
good duke humphrey traitorously murd'red
by suffolk cardinal beaufort's means
commons an angry hive bees
care not who they sting his revenge
myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
until they hear order his death
king henry he dead good warwick 'tis too true
but how he died god knows not henry
enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
comment then upon his sudden death
warwick shall do liege stay salisbury
rude multitude till return exit
king henry o thou judgest all things stay thoughts
thoughts labour persuade soul
some violent hands were laid humphrey's life
if suspect false forgive god
judgment only doth belong thee
fain would go chafe his paly lips
twenty thousand kisses drain
upon his face an ocean salt tears
tell love unto his dumb deaf trunk
but all vain are these mean obsequies
survey his dead earthy image
what were but make sorrow greater
bed put forth body enter warwick
warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body
king henry see how deep grave made
his soul fled all worldly solace
seeing him see life death
warwick as surely as soul intends live
free us from his father's wrathful curse
do believe violent hands were laid
upon life this thrice famed duke
suffolk dreadful oath sworn solemn tongue
what instance gives lord warwick his vow
warwick see how blood settled his face
oft have seen timely parted ghost
ashy semblance meagre pale bloodless
being all descended labouring heart
attracts same aidance 'gainst enemy
which heart there cools ne'er returneth
blush beautify cheek again
but see his face black full blood
his eye balls further out than when he liv'd
staring full ghastly strangled man
his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd struggling
his hands abroad display'd as one grasp'd
tugg'd life was by strength subdu'd
his well proportiond beard made rough rugged
summer's corn by tempest lodged
cannot but he was murd'red here
least all these signs were probable
suffolk why warwick who should do duke death
myself beaufort had him protection
hope sir are no murderers
warwick but both were vow'd duke humphrey's foes
forsooth had good duke keep
'tis well seen he found an enemy
queen then belike suspect these noblemen
as guilty duke humphrey's timeless death
warwick who finds heifer dead bleeding fresh
sees fast by butcher an axe
but will suspect 'twas he made slaughter
who finds partridge puttock's nest
but may imagine how bird was dead
although kite soar unbloodied beak
queen are butcher suffolk where's knife
beaufort term'd kite where are his talons
suffolk wear no knife slaughter sleeping men
but here's vengeful sword rusted ease
shall scoured his rancorous heart
slanders murder's crimson badge
say if thou dar'st proud lord warwickshire
am faulty duke humphrey's death
exeunt cardinal somerset others
queen he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
nor cease an arrogant controller
though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
warwick madam still reverence may say
every word speak his behalf
slander royal dignity
suffolk blunt witted lord ignoble demeanour
if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
thy mother took into her blameful bed
was graft crab tree slip whose fruit thou art
never nevils' noble race
warwick but guilt murder bucklers thee
should rob deathsman his fee
quitting thee thereby ten thousand shames
sovereigns presence makes mild
would false murd'rous coward thy knee
make thee beg pardon thy passed speech
say was thy mother thou meant'st
after all this fearful homage done
give thee thy hire send thy soul hell
pernicious blood sucker sleeping men
suffolk thou shalt waking while shed thy blood
if from this presence thou dar'st go
warwick away even now or will drag thee hence
unworthy though thou art i'll cope thee
do some service duke humphrey's ghost
exeunt suffolk warwick
thrice he arm'd hath his quarrel just
he but naked though lock'd up steel
whose conscience injustice corrupted
noise within
queen what noise this
re enter suffolk warwick their weapons drawn
king why how now lords wrathful weapons drawn
here our presence dare so bold
why what tumultuous clamour have here
set all upon mighty sovereign
re enter salisbury
salisbury commons within sirs stand apart king
shall know mind
dread lord commons send word by
unless lord suffolk straight done death
or banished fair england's territories
they will by violence tear him from palace
torture him grievous ling'ring death
they say him they fear highness' death
mere instinct love loyalty
free from stubborn opposite intent
as being thought contradict liking
makes them thus forward his banishment
they say care most royal person
if highness should intend sleep
charge no man should disturb rest
pain dislike or pain death
were there serpent seen forked tongue
slily glided towards majesty
were but necessary were wak'd
lest being suffer'd harmful slumber
mortal worm might make sleep eternal
therefore do they cry though forbid
they will guard whe'er will or no
from such fell serpents as false suffolk
whose envenomed fatal sting
they say shamefully bereft life
commons within an answer from king lord salisbury
suffolk 'tis commons rude unpolish'd hinds
could send such message their sovereign
but lord were glad employ'd
show how quaint an orator are
but all honour salisbury hath won
he was lord ambassador
sent from sort tinkers king
king henry go salisbury tell them all from
thank them their tender loving care
had not been cited so by them
yet did purpose as they do entreat
sure thoughts do hourly prophesy
mischance unto state by suffolk's means
therefore by his majesty swear
whose far unworthy deputy am
he shall not breathe infection this air
exit salisbury
queen o henry let plead gentle suffolk
king henry ungentle queen call him gentle suffolk
no more say if thou dost plead him
thou wilt but add increase unto wrath
had but said would have kept word
but when swear irrevocable
if after three days' space thou here be'st found
any ground am ruler
come warwick come good warwick go
have great matters impart thee
exeunt all but queen suffolk
queen mischance sorrow go along
heart's discontent sour affliction
playfellows keep company
there's two devil make third
threefold vengeance tend upon steps
suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations
queen fie coward woman soft hearted wretch
has thou not spirit curse thine enemy
suffolk plague upon them wherefore should curse them
would curses kill as doth mandrake's groan
would invent as bitter searching terms
as curst as harsh horrible hear
deliver'd strongly through fixed teeth
full as many signs deadly hate
as lean fac'd envy her loathsome cave
mine eyes should sparkle beaten flint
mine hair fix'd an end as one distract
ay every joint should seem curse ban
even now burdend heart would break
should not curse them poison their drink
gall worse than gall daintiest they taste
their sweetest shade grove cypress trees
their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks
their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings
boding screech owls make consort full
all foul terrors dark seated hell
queen enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself
these dread curses sun 'gainst glass
or an overcharged gun recoil
turns force them upon thyself
suffolk bade ban will bid leave
now by ground am banish'd from
well could curse away winter's night
where biting cold would never let grass grow
think but minute spent sport
queen o let entreat thee cease give thy hand
may dew mournful tears
nor let rain heaven wet this place
wash away woeful monuments
o could this kiss printed thy hand
thou might'st think upon these by seal
through whom thousand sighs are breath'd thee
'tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by
as one surfeits thinking want
will repeal thee or well assur'd
adventure banished myself
banished am if but from thee
go speak not even now gone
o go not yet even thus two friends condemnd
embrace kiss take ten thousand leaves
loather hundred times part than die
suffolk thus poor suffolk ten times banished
once by king three times thrice by thee

wilderness populous enough
so suffolk had thy heavenly company
where thou art there world itself
every several pleasure world
where thou art not desolation
can no more live thou joy thy life
enter vaux
queen whither goes vaux so fast what news prithee
vaux signify unto his majesty
cardinal beaufort at point death
suddenly grievous sickness took him
makes him gasp stare catch air
blaspheming god cursing men earth
sometime he talks as if duke humphrey's ghost
were by his side sometime he calls king
secrets his overcharged soul
am sent tell his majesty
even now he cries aloud him
queen go tell this heavy message king exit vaux
ay what this world what news are these
but wherefore grieve at an hour's poor loss
omitting suffolk's exile souls treasure
why only suffolk mourn not thee
southern clouds contend tears
now get thee hence king thou know'st coming
if thou found by thou art but dead
suffolk if depart from thee cannot live
thy sight die what were else
but pleasant slumber thy lap
here could breathe soul into air
as mild gentle as cradle babe
dying mother's dug between its lips
where from thy sight should raging mad
have thee thy lips stop mouth
so shouldst thou either turn flying soul
or should breathe so into thy body
then liv'd sweet elysium
die by thee were but die jest
from thee die were torture more than death
o let stay befall what may befall
queen away though parting fretful corrosive
applied deathful wound
whereso'er thou art this world's globe
i'll have an iris shall find thee out
suffolk go

suffolk o were god shoot forth thunder

uncles both are slain rescuing
all followers eager foe
turn back fly ships before wind
or lambs pursu'd by hunger starved wolves
sons god knows what hath bechanced them
but this know they have demeand themselves
men born renown by life or death
three times did richard make lane
full as oft came edward side
purple falchion painted hilt
blood those had encount'red him
when hardiest warriors did retire
richard cried 'charge give no foot ground'
cried 'a crown or else glorious tomb
sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
this charg'd again but out alas
bodg'd again as have seen swan
spend her strength over matching waves

northumberland yield our mercy proud plantagenet
clifford ay such mercy as his ruthless arm
downright payment show'd unto father
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
made an evening at noontide prick
york ashes as phoenix may bring forth
bird will revenge upon all
scorning whate'er can afflict
why come not what multitudes fear
clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further
so doves do peck falcons piercing talons
so desperate thieves all hopeless their lives
breathe out invectives 'gainst officers
york o clifford but bethink thee once again
thy thought o'errun former time
if thou canst blushing view this face
whose frown hath made thee faint fly ere this
clifford will not bandy thee word word
but buckler thee blows twice two one
queen margaret hold valiant clifford thousand causes
would prolong awhile traitor's life
wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much
prick thy finger though wound his heart
what valour were when cur doth grin
when he might spurn him his foot away
war's prize take all vantages
ten one no impeach valour
they lay hands york who struggles
clifford ay ay so strives woodcock gin
northumberland so doth cony struggle net
york so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
so true men yield robbers so o'er match'd
northumberland what would grace have done unto him now
come make him stand upon this molehill here
raught at mountains outstretched arms
yet parted but shadow his hand
what was would england's king
was't revelld our parliament
made preachment high descent
where are mess sons back now
wanton edward lusty george
where's valiant crook back prodigy
was wont cheer his dad mutinies
or rest where darling rutland
look york staind this napkin blood
valiant clifford his rapier's point
made issue from bosom boy
if thine eyes can water his death
give thee this dry thy cheeks withal
alas poor york but hate thee deadly
should lament thy miserable state
what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
not tear can fall rutland's death
why art thou patient man thou shouldst mad
make thee mad do mock thee thus
stamp rave fret may sing dance
thou wouldst fee'd see make sport
york cannot speak unless he wear crown
crown york lords bow low him
hold his hands whilst do set
ay marry sir now looks he king
ay this he took king henry's chair
this he was his adopted heir
but how great plantagenet
crownd so soon broke his solemn oath
as bethink should not king
till our king henry had shook hands death
will pale head henry's glory
rob his temples diadem
o 'tis fault too too
off crown crown his head
whilst breathe take time do him dead
clifford office father's sake
queen margaret nay stay let's hear orisons he makes
york she wolf france but worse than wolves france
whose tongue more poisons than adder's tooth
how ill beseeming thy sex
triumph an amazonian trull
but thy face visard unchanging
made impudent use evil deeds
would assay proud queen make thee blush
tell thee whence thou cam'st whom deriv'd
were shame enough shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears type king naples
both sicils jerusalem
yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
hath poor monarch taught thee insult
unless adage must verified
beggars mounted run their horse death
'tis beauty doth oft make women proud
but god he knows thy share thereof small
'tis virtue doth make them most admir'd
contrary doth make thee wond'red at
'tis government makes them seem divine
want thereof makes thee abominable
thou art as opposite every good
or as south septentrion
o tiger's heart wrapp'd womans hide
how couldst thou drain life blood child
bid father wipe his eyes withal
yet seen bear womans face
women are soft mild pitiful flexible
thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
bid'st thou rage why now thou hast thy wish
wouldst have weep why now thou hast thy will
when rage allays rain begins
these tears are sweet rutland's obsequies
every drop cries vengeance his death
'gainst thee fell clifford thee false frenchwoman
northumberland beshrew but his passions move so
hardly can check eyes from tears
york face his hungry cannibals
would not have touch'd would not have staind blood
but are more inhuman more inexorable
see ruthless queen hapless father's tears
this cloth thou dipp'dst blood sweet boy
tears do wash blood away
keep thou napkin go boast this
if thou tellst heavy story right
upon soul hearers will shed tears
yea even foes will shed fast falling tears
say 'alas was piteous deed'
there take crown crown curse
as now reap at thy too cruel hand
hard hearted clifford take from world
soul heaven blood upon heads
northumberland had he been slaughter man all kin
should not life but weep him
see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
queen margaret what weeping ripe lord northumberland
think but upon wrong he did us all
will quickly dry thy melting tears
stabbing him
queen margaret here's right our gentle hearted king
stabbing him
york open thy gate mercy gracious god
soul flies through these wounds seek out thee
empty
queen margaret off his head set york gates
so york may overlook town york
flourish exeunt
plain near mortimer's cross herefordshire
march enter edward richard their power
edward wonder how our princely father scap'd
or whether he scap'd away or no
from clifford's northumberland's pursuit
had he been ta'en should have heard news
had he been slain should have heard news
or had he scap'd methinks should have heard
happy tidings his good escape
richard cannot joy until resolv'd
where our right valiant father become
saw him battle range about
watch'd him how he singled clifford forth
methought he bore him thickest troop
as doth lion herd neat
or as bear encompass'd round dogs
who having pinch'd few made them cry
rest stand all aloof bark at him
so fled his enemies warlike father
methinks 'tis prize enough his son
see how morning opes her golden gates
takes her farewell glorious sun
how well resembles prime youth
trimm'd younker prancing his love
edward dazzle mine eyes or do see three suns
richard three glorious suns each one perfect sun
not separated racking clouds
see see they join embrace seem kiss
as if they vow'd some league inviolable
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
this heaven figures some event
edward 'tis wondrous strange yet never heard
think cites us brother field
sons brave plantagenet
each one already blazing by our meeds
should notwithstanding join our lights together
whate'er bodes henceforward will bear
upon target three fair shining suns
richard nay bear three daughters by leave speak
love breeder better than male
enter messenger blowing
but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
some dreadful story hanging thy tongue
messenger ah one was woeful looker
when as noble duke york was slain
edward o speak no more have heard too much
richard say how he died will hear all
messenger environed he was many foes
stood against them as hope troy
against greeks would have ent'red troy
but hercules himself must yield odds
many strokes though little axe
hews down fells hardest timber'd oak
by many hands father was subdu'd
unrelenting clifford queen
who crownd gracious duke high despite
laugh'd his face when grief he wept
ruthless queen gave him dry his cheeks
napkin steeped harmless blood
sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
after many scorns many foul taunts
they took his head gates york
they set same there doth remain
edward sweet duke york our prop lean upon
now thou art gone have no staff no stay
o clifford boist'rous clifford thou hast slain
flow'r europe his chivalry
treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
hand hand he would have vanquish'd thee
now souls palace become prison
ah would she break from hence this body
might ground closed up rest
never o never shall see more joy
richard cannot weep all body's moisture
scarce serves quench furnace burning heart
nor can tongue unload heart's great burden
self same wind should speak withal
kindling coals fires all breast
burns up flames tears would quench
weep make less depth grief
tears then babes blows revenge
or die renowned by attempting
edward his name valiant duke hath left thee
his dukedom his chair left
richard nay if thou princely eagle's bird
show thy descent by gazing 'gainst sun
chair dukedom throne kingdom say
either thine or else thou wert not his
march enter warwick montague their army
warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
our baleful news at each word's deliverance
stab poinards our flesh till all were told
words would add more anguish than wounds
o valiant lord duke york slain
edward o warwick warwick plantagenet
which held thee dearly as his souls redemption
by stern lord clifford done death
warwick ten days ago drownd these news tears
now add more measure woes
after bloody fray at wakefield fought
where brave father breath'd his latest gasp
tidings as swiftly as posts could run
were brought loss his depart
then london keeper king
muster'd soldiers gathered flocks friends
very well appointed as thought
march'd toward saint albans intercept queen
bearing king behalf along
she was coming full intent
dash our late decree parliament
touching king henry's oath succession
short tale make at saint albans met
our battles joind both sides fiercely fought
but whether 'twas coldness king
who look'd full gently his warlike queen
robb'd soldiers their heated spleen
or whether 'twas report her success
who thunders his captives blood death
cannot judge but conclude truth
their weapons lightning came went
our soldiers' night owls lazy flight
or an idle thresher flail
fell gently down as if they struck their friends
cheer'd them up justice our cause
promise high pay great rewards
but all vain they had no heart fight
so fled king unto queen
lord george brother norfolk myself
haste post haste are come join
marches here heard were
making another head fight again
edward where duke norfolk gentle warwick
when came george from burgundy england
warwick some six miles off duke soldiers
brother he was lately sent
aid soldiers this needful war
richard 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
oft have heard his praises pursuit
but ne'er till now his scandal retire
warwick nor now scandal richard dost thou hear
thou shalt know this strong right hand mine
can pluck diadem from faint henry's head
wring awful sceptre from his fist
were he as famous as bold war
richard know well lord warwick blame not
'tis love bear thy glories makes speak
but this troublous time what's done
shall go throw away our coats steel
wrap our bodies black mourning gowns
numbering our ave maries our beads
or shall helmets our foes
tell our devotion revengeful arms
if last say 'ay' lords
therefore comes brother montague
attend lords proud insulting queen
clifford haught northumberland
their feather many moe proud birds
have wrought easy melting king wax
he swore consent succession
his oath enrolled parliament
now london all crew are gone
frustrate both his oath what beside
their power think thirty thousand strong
now if help norfolk myself
all friends thou brave earl march
amongst loving welshmen canst procure
will but amount five twenty thousand
why via london will march amain
once again bestride our foaming steeds
once again cry 'charge upon our foes'
but never once again turn back fly
ne'er may he live see sunshine day
cries 'retire' if warwick bid him stay
edward lord warwick thy shoulder will lean
when thou failst as god forbid hour
must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
warwick no longer earl march but duke york
next degree england's royal throne
king england shalt thou proclaim'd
every borough as pass along
shall fault make forfeit his head
king edward valiant richard montague
stay no longer dreaming renown
but sound trumpets about our task
richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
as thou hast shown flinty by thy deeds
come pierce or give thee mine
edward then strike up drums god saint george us
enter messenger
messenger duke norfolk sends word by
queen coming puissant host
craves company speedy counsel
warwick why then sorts brave warriors let's away

king henry ay as rocks cheer them fear their wreck
see this sight irks very soul
withhold revenge dear god 'tis not fault
nor wittingly have infring'd vow
clifford gracious liege this too much lenity
harmful pity must laid aside
not beast would usurp their den
whose hand forest bear doth lick
not his spoils her young before her face
who scapes lurking serpent's mortal sting
not he sets his foot upon her back
smallest worm will turn being trodden
doves will peck safeguard their brood
ambitious york did level at thy crown
thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
raise his issue loving sire
thou being king bless'd goodly son
didst yield consent disinherit him
which argued thee most unloving father
unreasonable creatures feed their young
though mans face fearful their eyes
yet protection their tender ones
who hath not seen them even those wings
which sometime they have us'd fearful flight
offering their own lives their young's defence
shame liege make them precedent
were not pity this goodly boy
should lose his birthright by his father's fault
long hereafter say unto his child
'what great grandfather grandsire got
careless father fondly gave away'
ah what shame were this look boy
let his manly face which promiseth
hold thine own leave thine own him
king henry full well hath clifford play'd orator
inferring arguments mighty force
but clifford tell didst thou never hear
things ill got had ever bad success
happy always was son
whose father his hoarding went hell
i'll leave son virtuous deeds behind
would father had left no more
as brings thousand fold more care keep
than possession any jot pleasure
ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
how doth grieve thy head here
queen margaret lord cheer up spirits our foes are nigh
this soft courage makes followers faint
promis'd knighthood our forward son

richard are there butcher o cannot speak
clifford ay crook back here stand answer thee

clifford ay old york yet not satisfied
richard god's sake lords give signal fight
warwick what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield crown
queen margaret why how now long tongu'd warwick dare speak
when met at saint albans last
legs did better service than hands
warwick then 'twas turn fly now 'tis thine
clifford said so much before yet fled
warwick 'twas not valour clifford drove thence
richard northumberland hold thee reverently
break off parley scarce can refrain
execution big swoln heart
upon clifford cruel child killer
clifford slew thy father callst thou him child
richard ay dastard treacherous coward
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
but ere sunset i'll make thee curse deed
king henry have done words lords hear speak
king henry prithee give no limits tongue
am king privileg'd speak
clifford liege wound bred this meeting here
cannot cur'd by words therefore still
richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword
by him made us all am resolv'd
clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
edward say henry shall have right or no
thousand men have broke their fasts day
warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head
york justice puts his armour
prince wales if right which warwick says right
there no wrong but every thing right
richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands
well wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
queen margaret but thou art neither thy sire nor dam
but foul misshapen stigmatic
mark'd by destinies avoided
richard iron naples hid english gilt
whose father bears title king
as if channel should calld sea
sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
let thy tongue detect thy base born heart
edward wisp straw were worth thousand crowns
make this shameless callet know herself
helen greece was fairer far than thou
although thy husband may menelaus
by false woman as this king by thee
his father revelld heart france
tam'd king made dauphin stoop
had he match'd according his state
he might have kept glory this day
but when he took beggar his bed
grac'd thy poor sire his bridal day
even then sunshine brew'd show'r him
wash'd his father's fortunes forth france
what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
pity gentle king
had slipp'd our claim until another age
george but when saw our sunshine made thy spring
thy summer bred us no increase

why stand soft hearted women here
wailing our losses whiles foe doth rage

or fortune given measure revenge
edward o warwick do bend knee thine
ere knee rise from earth's cold face

king henry this battle fares morning's war
when dying clouds contend growing light
what time shepherd blowing his nails
can neither call perfect day nor night
now sways this way mighty sea
forc'd by tide combat wind
now sways way selfsame sea
sometime flood prevails then wind
now one better then another best
both tugging victors breast breast
yet neither conqueror nor conquered
so equal poise this fell war
here this molehill will sit down
whom god will there victory
margaret queen clifford too
have chid from battle swearing both
would were dead if god's good will were so
what this world but grief woe
o god methinks were happy life
no better than homely swain
sit upon hill as do now
carve out dials quaintly point by point
thereby see minutes how they run
how many makes hour full complete
how many hours brings about day
how many years mortal man may live
when this known then divide times
so many hours must tend flock
so many hours must take rest
so many hours must contemplate
so many hours must sport myself
so many days ewes have been young
so many weeks ere poor fools will can
so many years ere shall shear fleece
pass'd over end they were created
would bring white hairs unto quiet grave
ah what life were this how sweet how lovely
gives not hawthorn bush sweeter shade
shepherds looking their silly sheep
than doth rich embroider'd canopy
kings fear their subjects' treachery
o yes doth thousand fold doth
conclude shepherd's homely curds
his wonted sleep under fresh tree's shade
all which secure sweetly he enjoys
far beyond prince's delicates
his viands sparkling golden cup
his body couched curious bed
when care mistrust treason waits him
alarum enter son hath killd his father at
one door father hath killd his son at
another door
this man whom hand hand slew fight
may possessed some store crowns
haply take them from him now
may yet ere night yield both life them

who's this o god father's face
whom this conflict unwares have killd
o heavy times begetting such events
from london by king was press'd forth
came part york press'd by his master
who at his hands receiv'd life
have by hands life bereaved him
pardon god knew not what did
pardon father knew not thee
tears shall wipe away these bloody marks

o pity god this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly
erroneous mutinous unnatural
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
hath bereft thee thy life too late
o death would stay these ruthful deeds
o pity pity gentle heaven pity
red rose white are his face
fatal colours our striving houses
one his purple blood right well resembles
other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
wither one rose let other flourish

impairing henry strength'ning misproud york
whither fly gnats but sun

o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
phaethon should check thy fiery steeds
thy burning car never had scorch'd earth
henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
or as thy father his father did
giving no ground unto house york
they never then had sprung summer flies
had left no mourning widows our death
thou this day hadst kept thy chair peace
what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints cureless are wounds
no way fly nor strength hold out flight
foe merciless will not pity
at their hands have deserv'd no pity
air hath got into deadly wounds

deadly groan life death's departing
edward now battle's ended

warwick think his understanding bereft
speak clifford dost thou know who speaks thee
dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams life
richard o would he did so perhaps he doth
'tis but his policy counterfeit
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which time death he gave our father
george if so thou think'st vex him eager words
richard clifford ask mercy obtain no grace
edward clifford repent bootless penitence
warwick clifford devise excuses thy faults
george while devise fell tortures thy faults

richard what not an oath nay then world goes hard

cross from golden time look
yet between souls desire
lustful edward's title buried
clarence henry his son young edward
all unlook'd issue their bodies
take their rooms ere can place myself
cold premeditation purpose
one stands upon promontory
spies far off shore where he would tread
wishing his foot were equal his eye
chides sea sunders him from thence
saying he'll lade dry have his way
so do wish crown being so far off
so chide means keeps from
so say i'll cut causes off
flattering impossibilities
unless hand strength could equal them
well say there no kingdom then richard
what other pleasure can world afford
i'll make heaven lady's lap
deck body gay ornaments
witch sweet ladies words looks
o miserable thought more unlikely
than accomplish twenty golden crowns
why love forswore mother's womb
she did corrupt frail nature some bribe
shrink mine arm up wither'd shrub
make an envious mountain back
where sits deformity mock body
shape legs an unequal size
disproportion every part
chaos or an unlick'd bear whelp
carries no impression dam
am then man belov'd
then since this earth affords no joy
but command check o'erbear such
as are better person than myself
i'll make heaven dream upon crown
whiles live t' account this world but hell
until misshap'd trunk bear this head
round impaled glorious crown
yet know not how get crown
many lives stand between home
rents thorns rent thorns
seeking way straying from way
not knowing how find open air
but toiling desperately find out
torment myself catch english crown
from torment will free myself
or hew way out bloody axe
why can smile murder whiles smile
cry 'content' which grieves heart
frame face all occasions
i'll drown more sailors than mermaid shall
i'll slay more gazers than basilisk
i'll play orator as well as nestor
deceive more slily than ulysses could
sinon take another troy
can add colours chameleon
change shapes protheus advantages
set murderous machiavel school
tut were farther off i'll pluck down exit
scene iii
france king's palace
flourish enter lewis french king his sister bona
his admiral calld bourbon prince edward queen margaret
earl oxford lewis sits riseth up again
lewis fair queen england worthy margaret
sit down us ill befits thy state
birth thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
must strike her sail learn while serve
where kings command was must confess
great albions queen former golden days
but now mischance hath trod title down
dishonour laid ground
where must take seat unto fortune
humble seat conform myself
lewis why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
queen margaret from such cause as fills mine eyes tears
lewis whate'er thou still thyself
sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck
fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
still ride triumph over all mischance
plain queen margaret tell thy grief
shall eas'd if france can yield relief
queen margaret those gracious words revive drooping thoughts
give tongue tied sorrows leave speak
now therefore known noble lewis
king become banish'd man
forc'd live scotland forlorn
while proud ambitious edward duke york
usurps regal title seat
england's true anointed lawful king
this cause poor margaret
this son prince edward henry's heir
am come crave thy just lawful aid
if thou fail us all our hope done
our people our peers are both misled
our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put flight
as thou seest ourselves heavy plight
lewis renowned queen patience calm storm
while bethink means break off
queen margaret more stay stronger grows our foe
lewis more stay more i'll succour thee
queen margaret o but impatience waiteth true sorrow
see where comes breeder sorrow
lewis what's he approacheth boldly our presence
queen margaret our earl warwick edward's greatest friend
lewis welcome brave warwick what brings thee france
he descends she ariseth
queen margaret ay now begins second storm rise
this he moves both wind tide
warwick from worthy edward king albion
lord sovereign thy vowed friend
come kindness unfeigned love
then crave league amity
lastly confirm amity
nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe grant
virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
england's king lawful marriage
queen margaret aside if go forward henry's hope done
warwick bona gracious madam our king's behalf
am commanded leave favour
humbly kiss hand tongue
where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears
hath plac'd thy beauty's image thy virtue
queen margaret king lewis lady bona hear speak
before answer warwick his demand
springs not from edward's well meant honest love
but from deceit bred by necessity
how can tyrants safely govern home
unless abroad they purchase great alliance
prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
yet here prince edward stands king henry's son
look therefore lewis by this league marriage
thou draw not thy danger dishonour
though usurpers sway rule while
yet heav'ns are just time suppresseth wrongs
warwick injurious margaret
prince wales why not queen
warwick because thy father henry did usurp
thou no more art prince than she queen
which did subdue greatest part spain
after john gaunt henry fourth
whose wisdom was mirror wisest
after wise prince henry fifth
who by his prowess conquered all france
from these our henry lineally descends
warwick oxford how haps this smooth discourse
told not how henry sixth hath lost
all which henry fifth had gotten
but rest tell pedigree
threescore two years silly time
make prescription kingdom's worth
oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
whom thou obeyed'st thirty six years
not betray thy treason blush
warwick can oxford did ever fence right
now buckler falsehood pedigree
shame leave henry call edward king
elder brother lord aubrey vere
was done death more than so father
even downfall his mellow'd years
when nature brought him door death
no warwick no while life upholds this arm
this arm upholds house lancaster
warwick house york
lewis queen margaret prince edward oxford
vouchsafe at our request stand aside
they stand aloof
queen margaret heavens grant warwick's words bewitch him not
lewis now warwick tell even upon thy conscience
edward true king were loath
link him were not lawful chosen
warwick thereon pawn credit mine honour
lewis but he gracious people's eye
warwick more henry was unfortunate
lewis then further all dissembling set aside
unto our sister bona
warwick such seems
as may beseem monarch himself
myself have often heard him say swear
this his love was an eternal plant
whereof root was fix'd virtue's ground
leaves fruit maintaind beauty's sun
exempt from envy but not from disdain
unless lady bona quit his pain
bona grant or denial shall mine
warwick yet confess often ere this day
when have heard king's desert recounted
mine ear hath tempted judgment desire
lewis then warwick thus our sister shall edward's
now forthwith shall articles drawn
touching jointure king must make
which her dowry shall counterpois'd
draw near queen margaret witness
prince wales edward but not english king
queen margaret deceitful warwick was thy device
by this alliance make void suit
before thy coming lewis was henry's friend
lewis still friend him margaret
but if title crown weak
as may appear by edward's good success
then 'tis but reason releas'd
from giving aid which late promised
estate requires mine can yield
warwick henry now lives scotland at his case
where having nothing nothing can he lose
as yourself our quondam queen
have father able maintain
better 'twere troubled him than france
queen margaret peace impudent shameless warwick
proud setter up puller down kings
will not hence till talk tears
thy sly conveyance thy lord's false love
both are birds self same feather
post blowing horn within
lewis warwick this some post us or thee
enter post

sent from brother marquis montague

king henry so flies reckless shepherd from wolf
so first harmless sheep doth yield his fleece

what scene death hath roscius now act
gloucester suspicion always haunts guilty mind
king henry bird hath been limed bush
trembling wings misdoubteth every bush

but wherefore dost thou come is't life
gloucester think'st thou am an executioner
king henry persecutor am sure thou art
why then thou are an executioner
gloucester thy son killd his presumption
king henry hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume
thou hadst not liv'd kill son mine

many an orphans water standing eye
men their sons wives their husbands
shall rue hour ever thou wast born
owl shriek'd at thy birth an evil sign
night crow cried aboding luckless time
dogs howld hideous tempest shook down trees
raven rook'd her chimney's top
chatt'ring pies dismal discords sung
thy mother felt more than mother's pain
yet brought forth less than mother's hope
wit an indigest deformed lump
teeth hadst thou thy head when thou wast born
signify thou cam'st bite world
if rest true which have heard

this amongst rest was ordaind

o god forgive sins pardon thee dies

o may such purple tears always shed
from those wish downfall our house
if any spark life yet remaining

have neither pity love nor fear
indeed 'tis true henry told
came into world legs forward
had not reason think ye make haste
seek their ruin usurp'd our right
midwife wonder'd women cried
'o jesus bless us he born teeth'
so was which plainly signified
should snarl bite play dog
then since heavens have shap'd body so
let hell make crook'd mind answer
this word 'love' which greybeards call divine
resident men one another

clarence beware thou keep'st from light
but will sort pitchy day thee

sad high working full state woe
such noble scenes as draw eye flow
now present those can pity here
may if they think well let fall tear
subject will deserve such as give
may here find truth too those come see

i'll undertake may see away their shilling

as they were living think see them great
thousand friends then moment see
how soon this mightiness meets misery
if can merry then i'll say

which had they what four thrond ones could have weigh'd

till this time pomp was single but now married
one above itself each following day
made former wonders its day french

not us'd toil did almost sweat bear
pride upon them their very labour
was them as painting now this masque
made fool beggar two kings
equal lustre were now best now worst
as presence did present them him eye
still him praise being present both
'twas said they saw but one no discerner
durst wag his tongue censure when these suns
so they phrase 'em by their heralds challeng'd
noble spirits arms they did perform
beyond thought's compass former fabulous story

chalks successors their way nor calld upon
high feats done th' crown neither allied

place next king
abergavenny cannot tell
what heaven hath given him let some graver eye
pierce into but can see his pride
peep through each part him whence has he
if not from hell devil niggard
or has given all before he begins
buckingham why devil
upon this french going out took he upon him
without privity o' th' king t' appoint
who should attend him he makes up file
all gentry most part such
whom as great charge as little honour
he meant lay upon his own letter
honourable board council out

kinsmen mine three at least have
by this so sickend their estates never

first gentleman i'll tell little great duke
came bar where his accusations
many sharp reasons defeat law
king's attorney contrary
urg'd examinations proofs confessions
divers witnesses which duke desir'd
have brought viva voce his face
at which appear'd against him his surveyor
sir gilbert peck his chancellor john car
confessor him devil monk
hopkins made this mischief
fed him his prophecies
first gentleman same
all these accus'd him strongly which he fain
would have flung from him but indeed he could not
so his peers upon this evidence
have found him guilty high treason much
he spoke learnedly life but all
was either pitied him or forgotten
second gentleman after all this how did he bear him self
his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
such an agony he sweat extremely
something spoke choler ill hasty
but he fell himself again sweetly
all rest show'd most noble patience
second gentleman do not think he fears death
first gentleman sure he does not
he never was so womanish cause
he may little grieve at
cardinal end this
first gentleman 'tis likely
by all conjectures first kildare's attainder
then deputy ireland who remov'd
earl surrey was sent thither haste too
lest he should help his father
second gentleman trick state
was deep envious one
first gentleman at his return
generally whoever king favours
cardinal instantly will find employment
far enough from court too
second gentleman all commons
hate him perniciously o' conscience
wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
they love dote call him bounteous buckingham
mirror all courtesy
enter buckingham from his arraignment tip staves
each side accompanied sir thomas
lovell sir nicholas vaux sir william sandys
common people etc
first gentleman stay there sir
see noble ruind man speak
second gentleman let's stand close behold him
buckingham all good people
thus far have come pity
hear what say then go home lose
by name must die yet heaven bear witness
if have conscience let sink
even as axe falls if not faithful
law bear no malice death
't has done upon premises but justice
but those sought could wish more christians
what they will heartily forgive 'em
yet let 'em look they glory not mischief
nor build their evils graves great men
further life this world ne'er hope
nor will sue although king have mercies
more than dare make faults few lov'd
dare bold weep buckingham
his noble friends fellows whom leave
only bitter him only dying
go good angels end
as long divorce steel falls
make prayers one sweet sacrifice
lovell do beseech grace charity
if ever any malice heart
were hid against now forgive frankly
buckingham sir thomas lovell as free forgive
as would forgiven forgive all
there cannot those numberless offences
'gainst cannot take peace no black envy
shall mark grave commend his grace
if he speak buckingham pray tell him
yet are king's till soul forsake
shall cry blessings him may he live
longer than have time tell his years
ever belov'd loving may his rule
when old time shall lead him his end
goodness he fill up one monument
lovell th' water side must conduct grace
then give charge up sir nicholas vaux
who undertakes end
duke coming see barge ready
fit such furniture as suits
greatness his person
buckingham nay sir nicholas
let alone state now will but mock
when came hither was lord high constable
duke buckingham now poor edward bohun
yet am richer than base accusers
never knew what truth meant now seal
noble father henry buckingham
who first rais'd head against usurping richard
flying succour his servant banister
being distress'd was by wretch betray'd
without trial fell god's peace him
henry seventh succeeding truly pitying
father's loss most royal prince
restor'd honours out ruins
made name once more noble now his son
made happy at one stroke has taken
ever from world had trial
must needs say noble one which makes
little happier than wretched father
yet thus far are one fortunes both
fell by our servants by those men lov'd most
most unnatural faithless service
heaven has an end all yet hear
this from dying man receive as certain
sure not loose those make friends
give hearts when they once perceive
least rub fortunes fall away
water from ye never found again
but where they mean sink ye all good people
pray must now forsake ye last hour
long weary life come upon
empty
when would say something sad
exeunt buckingham train
first gentleman o this full pity sir calls
fear too many curses their heads
were authors
second gentleman if duke guiltless
'tis full woe yet can give inkling
an ensuing evil if fall
greater than this
first gentleman good angels keep from us
second gentleman this secret so weighty 'twill require
strong faith conceal
first gentleman let have
do not talk much
second gentleman am confident
shall sir did not late days hear
buzzing separation
between king katharine
first gentleman yes but held not
he sent command lord mayor straight
stop rumour allay those tongues
durst disperse
second gentleman but slander sir
found truth now grows again
fresher than e'er was held certain
king will venture at either cardinal
or some about him near have out malice
good queen possess'd him scruple
cardinal campeius arriv'd lately
as all think this business
first gentleman 'tis cardinal
merely revenge him emperor
not bestowing him at his asking
archbishopric toledo this purpos'd
second gentleman think have hit mark but is't
not cruel
she should feel smart this cardinal
first gentleman 'tis woeful

render up great seal presently
into our hands confine yourself

authority so weighty
suffolk who dares cross 'em
bearing king's will from his mouth expressly
wolsey till find more than will or words do
mean malice know officious lords
dare must deny now feel
how eagerly ye follow disgraces
as if fed ye how sleek wanton
ye appear every thing may bring ruin
follow envious courses men malice
have christian warrant 'em no doubt
time will find their fit rewards seal
ask such violence king
mine master his own hand gave
bade enjoy place honours
tied by letters patents now who'll take
surrey king gave
wolsey must himself then
surrey thou art proud traitor priest
wolsey proud lord thou liest
within these forty hours surrey durst better
have burnt tongue than said so
surrey thy ambition
thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
heads all thy brother cardinals
thee all thy best parts bound together
weigh'd not hair his plague policy
sent deputy ireland
far from his succour from king from all
might have mercy fault thou gav'st him
whilst great goodness out holy pity
absolv'd him an axe
wolsey this all else
answer most false duke by law
found his deserts how innocent was
from any private malice his end
his noble jury foul cause can witness
if lov'd many words lord should tell
have as little honesty as honour
way loyalty truth
toward king ever royal master
dare mate sounder man than surrey can
surrey by soul
long coat priest protects thou shouldst feel
sword i' life blood thee else lords
can ye endure hear this arrogance
from this fellow if live thus tamely
thus jaded by piece scarlet
farewell nobility let his grace go forward
dare us his cap larks
wolsey all goodness
surrey yes goodness
gleaning all land's wealth into one
into own hands cardinal by extortion
goodness intercepted packets
writ th' pope against king goodness
since provoke shall most notorious
lord norfolk as are truly noble
as respect common good state
our despis'd nobility our issues
produce grand sum his sins articles
collected from his life i'll startle
worse than sacring bell when brown wench
lay kissing arms lord cardinal
wolsey how much methinks could despise this man
but am bound charity against
norfolk those articles lord are king's hand
but thus much they are foul ones
wolsey so much fairer
when king knows truth
surrey this cannot save
thank memory yet remember
some these articles out they shall
now if can blush cry guilty cardinal
you'll show little honesty
wolsey speak sir
dare worst objections if blush
see nobleman want manners

servant
suffolk then without knowledge
either king or council when went
carry into flanders great seal
surrey item sent large commission
gregory de cassado conclude
without king's will or state's allowance
league between his highness ferrara
suffolk out mere ambition have caus'd
holy hat stamp'd king's coin
surrey then have sent innumerable substance
by what means got leave own conscience
have dignities mere undoing
all kingdom many more there are
which since they are odious
will not taint mouth
chamberlain o lord
press not falling man too far 'tis virtue
his faults lie open laws let them
not correct him heart weeps see him
so little his great self
suffolk lord cardinal king's further pleasure
because all those things have done late
by power legatine within this kingdom
fall into th' compass praemunire
therefore such writ sued against

about giving back great seal us

wolsey so farewell little good bear
farewell long farewell all greatness
this state man day he puts forth
tender leaves hopes morrow blossoms
bears his blushing honours thick upon him
when he thinks good easy man full surely
his greatness ripening nips his root
then he falls as do have ventur'd
little wanton boys swim bladders
this many summers sea glory
but far beyond depth high blown pride
at length broke under now has left
weary old service mercy
rude stream must ever hide
feel heart new opend o how wretched
poor man hangs princes' favours
there betwixt smile would aspire
sweet aspect princes their ruin

didst thou not tell griffith as thou led'st
great child honour cardinal wolsey
was dead
griffith yes madam but think grace
katharine prithee good griffith tell how he died
if well he stepp'd before happily
example
griffith well voice goes madam
after stout earl northumberland
arrested him at york brought him forward
as man sorely tainted his answer
he fell sick suddenly grew so ill
he could not sit his mule
griffith at last easy roads he came leicester
lodg'd abbey where reverend abbot
all his covent honourably receiv'd him
whom he gave these words 'o father abbot
an old man broken storms state
come lay his weary bones among ye
give him little earth charity'
so went bed where eagerly his sickness
pursu'd him still three nights after this
foretold should his last full repentance
continual meditations tears sorrows
he gave his honours world again
his blessed part heaven slept peace
katharine so may he rest his faults lie gently him
yet thus far griffith give leave speak him
yet charity he was man
an unbounded stomach ever ranking
himself princes one by suggestion
his own opinion was his law i' th' presence
he would say untruths ever double
both his words meaning he was never
but where he meant ruin pitiful
his promises were as he then was mighty
but his performance as he now nothing
his own body he was ill gave
clergy ill example
griffith noble madam
write water may please highness
hear speak his good now
katharine yes good griffith
were malicious else
griffith this cardinal
though from an humble stock undoubtedly
was fashiond much honour from his cradle
he was scholar ripe good one
exceeding wise fair spoken persuading
but those men sought him sweet as summer
though he were unsatisfied getting
which was sin yet bestowing madam
he was most princely ever witness him
those twins learning he rais'd
ipswich oxford one which fell him
unwilling outlive good did
other though unfinish'd yet so famous
so excellent art still so rising
his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
then not till then he felt himself
found blessedness being little
add greater honours his age
than man could give him he died fearing god
katharine after death wish no other herald
no other speaker living actions
keep mine honour from corruption
but such an honest chronicler as griffith
thy religious truth modesty
now his ashes honour peace him
patience near still set lower
have not long trouble thee good griffith
cause musicians play sad note
nam'd knell whilst sit meditating
celestial harmony go

personages clad white robes wearing their
heads garlands bays golden vizards their
faces branches bays or palm their hands they
first congee unto her then dance at certain
changes first two hold spare garland over her
head at which other four make reverent curtsies
then two held garland deliver
order their changes holding garland over
her head which done they deliver same garland
last two who likewise observe same order
at which as were by inspiration she makes
her sleep signs rejoicing holdeth up her
hands heaven so their dancing vanish
carrying garland them music continues
katharine spirits peace where are ye are ye all gone
leave here wretchedness behind ye
katharine not call
saw ye none enter since slept

why what shame was this did commission
bid ye so far forget yourselves gave ye
power as he was councillor try him

would try him utmost had ye mean
which ye shall never have while live

religiously provokes pleased then
pay duty which truly owe
then our arms muzzled bear
save aspect hath all offence seald up
our cannons' malice vainly shall spent
against th' invulnerable clouds heaven
blessed unvex'd retire
unhack'd swords helmets all unbruis'd
will bear home lusty blood again
which here came spout against town
leave children wives peace
'tis not roundure old fac'd walls
can hide from our messengers war
though all these english their discipline
were harbour'd their rude circumference
then tell us shall city call us lord
behalf which have challeng'd
or shall give signal our rage
stalk blood our possession
citizen brief are king england's subjects
king john acknowledge then king let
citizen can not but he proves king
him will prove loyal till time
have ramm'd up our gates against world
king john doth not crown england prove king
if not bring witnesses
twice fifteen thousand hearts england's breed
bastard bastards else
king john verify our title their lives
bastard some bastards too
king philip stand his face contradict his claim
citizen till compound whose right worthiest
worthiest hold right from both
king john then god forgive sin all those souls
their everlasting residence
before dew evening fall shall fleet
dreadful trial our kingdom's king
king philip amen amen mount chevaliers arms
sits ons horse back at mine hostess' door
teach us some fence austria sirrah were at home
at den sirrah lioness
would set an ox head lions hide
make monster
austria peace no more
bastard o tremble hear lion roar
king john up higher plain where we'll set forth
best appointment all our regiments
king philip shall so at other hill
command rest stand god our right exeunt
here after excursions enter herald france
trumpets gates
french herald men angiers open wide gates
let young arthur duke britaine
who by hand france this day hath made
much work tears many an english mother
whose sons lie scattered bleeding ground
coldly embracing discoloured earth
victory little loss doth play
upon dancing banners french
who are at hand triumphantly displayed
enter conquerors proclaim
arthur britaine england's king yours
enter english herald trumpet
english herald rejoice men angiers ring bells
king john king england's doth approach
their armours march'd hence so silver bright
hither return all gilt frenchmens blood
there stuck no plume any english crest
removed by staff france
our colours do return those same hands
did display them when first march'd forth
jolly troop huntsmen come
our lusty english all purpled hands
dy'd dying slaughter their foes
citizen heralds from off our tow'rs might behold
from first last onset retire
both armies whose equality
by our best eyes cannot censured
blood hath bought blood blows have answer'd blows
strength match'd strength power confronted power
both are alike both alike
one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
hold our town neither yet both
king john france hast thou yet more blood cast away
say shall current our right run
whose passage vex'd thy impediment
shall leave his native channel o'erswell
course disturb'd even thy confining shores
unless thou let his silver water keep
peaceful progress ocean
king philip england thou hast not sav'd one drop blood
this hot trial more than france
sways earth this climate overlooks
before will lay down our just borne arms
we'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms bear
or add royal number dead
gracing scroll tells this war's loss
slaughter coupled name kings
bastard ha majesty how high thy glory tow'rs
when rich blood kings set fire
o now doth death line his dead chaps steel
now he feasts mousing flesh men
undetermind differences kings
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
cry 'havoc' kings back stained field
equal potents fiery kindled spirits
then let confusion one part confirm
other's peace till then blows blood death
king john whose party do townsmen yet admit
king philip speak citizens england who's king
king philip know him us here hold up his right
king john us are our own great deputy
bear possession our person here
lord our presence angiers
citizen greater pow'r than denies all this
till undoubted do lock
our former scruple our strong barr'd gates
king'd our fears until our fears resolv'd
by some certain king purg'd depos'd
stand securely their battlements
as theatre whence they gape point
at industrious scenes acts death
royal presences ruld by
do mutines jerusalem
friends awhile both conjointly bend
sharpest deeds malice this town
by east west let france england mount
their battering cannon charged mouths
flinty ribs this contemptuous city
i'd play incessantly upon these jades
even till unfenced desolation
leave them as naked as vulgar air
done dissever united strengths
part mingled colours once again
turn face face bloody point point
then moment fortune shall cull forth
out one side her happy minion
kiss him glorious victory
how this wild counsel mighty states
smacks not something policy
king john now by sky hangs above our heads
well france shall knit our pow'rs
lay this angiers even ground
then after fight who shall king
bastard an if thou hast mettle king
being wrong'd as are by this peevish town
as will ours against these saucy walls
when have dash'd them ground
why then defy each other pell mell
make work upon ourselves heaven or hell
king philip let so say where will assault
king john from west will send destruction
into this city's bosom
austria from north
king philip our thunder from south
bastard aside o prudent discipline from north south
austria france shoot each other's mouth
i'll stir them come away away
citizen hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile stay
shall show peace fair fac'd league
win this city without stroke or wound
rescue those breathing lives die beds
here come sacrifices field
persever not but hear mighty kings
citizen daughter there spain lady blanch
niece england look upon years
lewis dauphin lovely maid
if lusty love should go quest beauty
where should he find fairer than blanch
if zealous love should go search virtue
where should he find purer than blanch
if love ambitious sought match birth
whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
young dauphin every way complete
if not complete say he not she
she again wants nothing name want
if want not she not he
he half part blessed man
left finished by such as she
she fair divided excellence
whose fulness perfection lies him
o two such silver currents when they join
two such shores two such streams made one
two such controlling bounds shall kings
these two princes if marry them
this union shall do more than battery can
our fast closed gates at this match
swifter spleen than powder can enforce
mouth passage shall fling wide ope
give entrance but without this match
sea enraged not half so deaf
more free from motion no not death himself
mortal fury half so peremptory
as keep this city
bastard here's stay
shakes rotten carcass old death
out his rags here's large mouth indeed
spits forth death mountains rocks seas
talks as familiarly roaring lions
as maids thirteen do puppy dogs
he speaks plain cannon fire smoke bounce
he gives bastinado his tongue
our ears are cudgelld not word his
but buffets better than fist france
zounds was never so bethump'd words
since first calld brother's father dad
elinor son list this conjunction make this match
give our niece dowry large enough
by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
yon green boy shall have no sun ripe
bloom promiseth mighty fruit
see yielding looks france
mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
are capable this ambition
lest zeal now melted by windy breath
soft petitions pity remorse
cool congeal again what was
citizen why answer not double majesties
king philip speak england first hath been forward first
speak unto this city what say
king john if dauphin there thy princely son
can this book beauty read 'i love'
her dowry shall weigh equal queen
anjou fair touraine maine poictiers
all upon this side sea
except this city now by us besieg'd
find liable our crown dignity
titles honours promotions
as she beauty education blood
holds hand any princess world
king philip what say'st thou boy look lady's face
lewis do lord her eye find
wonder or wondrous miracle
shadow myself form'd her eye
which being but shadow son
becomes sun makes son shadow
till now infixed beheld myself
drawn flattering table her eye
whispers blanch
bastard aside drawn flattering table her eye
hang'd frowning wrinkle her brow
quarter'd her heart he doth espy
himself love's traitor this pity now
hang'd drawn quarter'd there should
such love so vile lout as he
if he see aught makes him
anything he sees which moves his liking
can ease translate will
or if will speak more properly
will enforce eas'ly love
further will not flatter lord
all see worthy love
than this nothing do see
though churlish thoughts themselves should judge
king john what say these young ones what say niece
blanch she bound honour still do
what wisdom still vouchsafe say
king john speak then prince dauphin can love this lady
lewis nay ask if can refrain from love
do love her most unfeignedly
king john then do give volquessen touraine maine
poictiers anjou these five provinces
her thee this addition more
philip france if thou pleas'd withal
command thy son daughter join hands
king philip likes us well young princes close hands
austria lips too am well assur'd
did so when was first assur'd
king philip now citizens angiers ope gates
let amity which have made
at saint mary's chapel presently
rites marriage shall solemniz'd
know she not this match made up
her presence would have interrupted much
where she her son tell who knows
lewis she sad passionate at highness' tent
king philip by faith this league have made
will give her sadness very little cure
brother england how may content
this widow lady her right came
which god knows have turnd another way
king john will heal up all
we'll create young arthur duke britaine
earl richmond this rich fair town
make him lord call lady constance
some speedy messenger bid her repair
our solemnity trust shall
if not fill up measure her will
yet some measure satisfy her so
shall stop her exclamation
this unlook'd unprepared pomp
exeunt all but bastard
bastard mad world mad kings mad composition
john stop arthur's tide whole
hath willingly departed part
france whose armour conscience buckled
whom zeal charity brought field
as god's own soldier rounded ear
same purpose changer sly devil
daily break vow he wins all
kings beggars old men young men maids
who having no external thing lose
but word 'maid' cheats poor maid
smooth fac'd gentleman tickling commodity
commodity bias world
world who itself peised well
made run even upon even ground
till this advantage this vile drawing bias
makes take head from all indifferency
from all direction purpose course intent
this same bias this commodity
this bawd this broker this all changing word
clapp'd outward eye fickle france
hath drawn him from his own determind aid
from resolv'd honourable war
most base vile concluded peace
why rail this commodity
not have power clutch hand
when his fair angels would salute palm
but hand as unattempted yet
poor beggar raileth rich
well whiles am beggar will rail
say there no sin but rich
being rich virtue then shall
say there no vice but beggary
since kings break faith upon commodity

king john not this thou dost forget thyself
enter pandulph
king philip here comes holy legate pope
pandulph hail anointed deputies heaven
thee king john holy errand
pandulph fair milan cardinal
from pope innocent legate here
do his name religiously demand
so wilfully dost spurn force perforce
keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
canterbury from holy see
this our foresaid holy father's name
pope innocent do demand thee
king john what earthly name interrogatories
can task free breath sacred king
thou canst not cardinal devise name
so slight unworthy ridiculous
tell him this tale from mouth england
add thus much more no italian priest
shall tithe or toll our dominions
but as under heaven are supreme head
so under him great supremacy
where do reign will alone uphold
without th' assistance mortal hand
so tell pope all reverence set apart
him his usurp'd authority
king john though all kings christendom
are led so grossly by this meddling priest
dreading curse money may buy out
by merit vile gold dross dust
purchase corrupted pardon man
who sale sells pardon from himself
though all rest so grossly led
this juggling witchcraft revenue cherish
yet alone alone do oppose
pandulph then by lawful power have
thou shalt stand curs'd excommunicate
blessed shall he doth revolt
from his allegiance an heretic
meritorious shall hand calld
canonized worshipp'd as saint
takes away by any secret course
thy hateful life
constance o lawful let
good father cardinal cry thou 'amen
keen curses without wrong
there no tongue hath power curse him right
pandulph there's law warrant lady curse
constance mine too when law can do no right
let lawful law bar no wrong
law cannot give child his kingdom here
he holds his kingdom holds law
therefore since law itself perfect wrong
pandulph philip france peril curse
let go hand arch heretic
raise power france upon his head
unless he do submit himself rome
elinor look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand
constance look devil lest france repent
by disjoining hands hell lose soul
austria king philip listen cardinal
bastard hang calf's skin his recreant limbs
empty
bastard breeches best may carry them
king john philip what say'st thou cardinal
constance what should he say but as cardinal
lewis bethink father difference
purchase heavy curse from rome
or light loss england friend
forgo easier
blanch that's curse rome
likeness new untrimmed bride
blanch lady constance speaks not from her faith
but from her need
constance o if thou grant need
which only lives but by death faith
need must needs infer this principle
faith would live again by death need
o then tread down need faith mounts up
keep need up faith trodden down
constance o remov'd from him answer well
austria do so king philip hang no more doubt
bastard hang nothing but calf's skin most sweet lout
king philip am perplex'd know not what say
pandulph what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
if thou stand excommunicate curs'd
king philip good reverend father make person yours
tell how would bestow yourself
this royal hand mine are newly knit
married league coupled link'd together
all religious strength sacred vows
latest breath gave sound words
was deep sworn faith peace amity true love
between our kingdoms our royal selves
even before this truce but new before
no longer than well could wash our hands
clap this royal bargain up peace
heaven knows they were besmear'd overstaind
fearful difference incensed kings
shall these hands so lately purg'd blood
so newly joind love so strong both
unyoke this seizure this kind regreet
play fast loose faith so jest heaven
make such unconstant children ourselves
as now again snatch our palm from palm
unswear faith sworn marriage bed
smiling peace march bloody host
true sincerity o holy sir
reverend father let not so
out grace devise ordain impose
some gentle order then shall blest
do pleasure continue friends
pandulph all form formless order orderless
save what opposite england's love
therefore arms champion our church
or let church our mother breathe her curse
france thou mayst hold serpent by tongue
chafed lion by mortal paw
fasting tiger safer by tooth
than keep peace hand which thou dost hold
king philip may disjoin hand but not faith
pandulph so mak'st thou faith an enemy faith
civil war set'st oath oath
thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
first made heaven first heaven perform'd
what since thou swor'st sworn against thyself
may not performed by thyself
which thou hast sworn do amiss
not amiss when truly done
being not done where doing tends ill
truth then most done not doing
better act purposes mistook
mistake again though indirect
yet indirection thereby grows direct
within scorched veins one new burnd
religion doth make vows kept
but thou hast sworn against religion
by what thou swear'st against thing thou swear'st
mak'st an oath surety thy truth
against an oath truth thou art unsure
swear swears only not forsworn
else what mockery should swear
but thou dost swear only forsworn
therefore thy later vows against thy first
thyself rebellion thyself
better conquest never canst thou make
than arm thy constant thy nobler parts
against these giddy loose suggestions
upon which better part our pray'rs come
if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
peril our curses fight thee
so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
austria rebellion flat rebellion
bastard willt not
will not calf's skin stop mouth thine
lewis father arms
blanch upon thy wedding day

constance o upon knee
made hard kneeling do pray thee
thou virtuous dauphin alter not doom
forethought by heaven
blanch now shall see thy love what motive may
constance which upholdeth him thee upholds
his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour
lewis muse majesty doth seem so cold
when such profound respects do pull
pandulph will denounce curse upon his head
king philip thou shalt not need england will fall from thee
constance o fair return banish'd majesty
elinor o foul revolt french inconstancy
king john france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
as he will well then france shall rue
blanch suns o'ercast blood fair day adieu
which side must go withal
am both each army hath hand
their rage having hold both
they whirl asunder dismember
husband cannot pray thou mayst win
uncle needs must pray thou mayst lose
father may not wish fortune thine
whoever wins side shall lose
assured loss before match play'd
lewis lady thy fortune lies
blanch there where fortune lives there life dies
king john cousin go draw our puissance together

buss thee as thy wife misery's love

which cannot hear lady's feeble voice
which scorns modern invocation
pandulph lady utter madness not sorrow
constance thou art not holy belie so
am not mad this hair tear mine
name constance was geffrey's wife
am not mad would heaven were
then 'tis should forget myself
o if could what grief should forget
preach some philosophy make mad
thou shalt canoniz'd cardinal
being not mad but sensible grief
reasonable part produces reason
how may deliver'd these woes
teaches kill or hang myself
or madly think babe clouts were he
am not mad too well too well feel
different plague each calamity
king philip bind up those tresses o what love note
fair multitude those her hairs
where but by chance silver drop hath falln
even drop ten thousand wiry friends
do glue themselves sociable grief
true inseparable faithful loves
constance england if will
king philip bind up hairs
constance yes will wherefore will do
tore them from their bonds cried aloud
'o these hands could so redeem son
as they have given these hairs their liberty'
but now envy at their liberty
will again commit them their bonds
because poor child prisoner
shall see know our friends heaven
if true shall see boy again
since birth cain first male child

there was not such gracious creature born
but now will canker sorrow eat bud
chase native beauty from his cheek
he will look as hollow as ghost
as dim meagre as an ague's fit
when shall meet him court heaven
shall not know him therefore never never
must behold pretty arthur more
pandulph hold too heinous respect grief
constance he talks never had son
king philip are as fond grief as child
constance grief fills room up absent child
lies his bed walks up down
puts his pretty looks repeats his words
stuffs out his vacant garments his form
then have reason fond grief
fare well had such loss as
could give better comfort than do
will not keep this form upon head
tearing her hair
when there such disorder wit
o lord boy arthur fair son
life joy food ail world
king philip fear some outrage i'll follow her exit
lewis there's nothing this world can make joy
life as tedious as twice told tale
vexing dull ear drowsy man
bitter shame hath spoild sweet world's taste
yields nought but shame bitterness
pandulph before curing strong disease
even instant repair health
fit strongest evils take leave
what have lost by losing this day
lewis all days glory joy happiness
pandulph if had won certainly had
no no when fortune means men most good
she looks upon them threat'ning eye
'tis strange think how much king john hath lost
this which he accounts so clearly won
are not griev'd arthur his prisoner
lewis as heartily as he glad he hath him
now hear speak prophetic spirit
even breath what mean speak
shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
out path which shall directly lead
thy foot england's throne therefore mark

whiles warm life plays infant's veins
misplac'd john should entertain an hour
one minute nay one quiet breath rest
must boisterously maintaind as gaind
he stands upon slipp'ry place
makes nice no vile hold stay him up
john may stand then arthur needs must fall
so cannot but so
lewis but what shall gain by young arthur's fall
pandulph right lady blanch wife
may then make all claim arthur did
lewis lose life all as arthur did
john lays plots times conspire
he steeps his safety true blood
shall find but bloody safety untrue
this act so evilly borne shall cool hearts
all his people freeze up their zeal
none so small advantage shall step forth
check his reign but they will cherish
no natural exhalation sky
no scope nature no distemper'd day
but they will pluck away his natural cause
call them meteors prodigies signs
abortives presages tongues heaven
plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
lewis may he will not touch young arthur's life
but hold himself safe his prisonment
pandulph o sir when he shall hear approach
if young arthur not gone already
even at news he dies then hearts
kiss lips unacquainted change
pick strong matter revolt wrath

hubert good morrow little prince
arthur as little prince having so great tide
more prince as may are sad
hubert indeed have been merrier
arthur mercy
methinks no body should sad but
yet remember when was france
only wantonness by christendom
so were out prison kept sheep
should as merry as day long
so would here but doubt
uncle practises more harm
he afraid him
fault was geffrey's son
no indeed ist not would heaven
were son so would love hubert
he will awake mercy which lies dead
therefore will sudden dispatch
arthur are sick hubert look pale day
sooth would were little sick
might sit all night watch
warrant love more than do
hubert aside his words do take possession bosom
read here young arthur showing paper
aside how now foolish rheum
must brief lest resolution drop
out at mine eyes tender womanish tears
can not read not fair writ
arthur too fairly hubert so foul effect
must hot irons burn out both mine eyes
hubert young boy must
arthur will
hubert will
arthur have heart when head did but ache
best had princess wrought
did never ask again
hand at midnight held head
watchful minutes hour
still anon cheer'd up heavy time
saying 'what lack you' 'where lies grief'
or 'what good love may perform you'
many poor mans son would have lyen still
ne'er have spoke loving word
nay may think love was crafty love
call cunning do an if will
if heaven pleas'd must use ill
why then must will put out mine eyes
these eyes never did nor never shall
so much as frown
hubert have sworn do
hot irons must burn them out
arthur ah none but this iron age would do
approaching near these eyes would drink tears
quench his fiery indignation
even matter mine innocence
nay after consume away rust
but containing fire harm mine eye
are more stubborn hard than hammer'd iron
an if an angel should have come
told hubert should put out mine eyes
would not have believ'd him no tongue but hubert's
re enter executioners cord irons etc
do as bid do
arthur o save hubert save eyes are out
even fierce looks these bloody men
hubert give iron say bind him here
arthur alas what need so boist'rous rough
will not struggle will stand stone still
heaven sake hubert let not bound
nay hear hubert drive these men away
will not stir nor wince nor speak word
nor look upon iron angrily
thrust but these men away i'll forgive
whatever torment do put
hubert go stand within let alone him
executioner am best pleas'd from such deed
exeunt executioners
arthur alas then have chid away friend
he hath stern look but gentle heart
give life yours
hubert come boy prepare yourself
arthur there no remedy
hubert none but lose eyes
arthur o heaven there were but mote yours
grain dust gnat wandering hair
any annoyance precious sense
then feeling what small things are boisterous there
vile intent must needs seem horrible
arthur hubert utterance brace tongues
must needs want pleading pair eyes
let not hold tongue let not hubert
or hubert if will cut out tongue
so may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
though no use but still look
lo by troth instrument cold
would not harm
hubert can heat boy
being create comfort us'd
undeserved extremes see else yourself
there no malice this burning coal
breath heaven hath blown his spirit out
strew'd repentant ashes his head
hubert but breath can revive boy
arthur an if do will but make blush
glow shame proceedings hubert
nay perchance will sparkle eyes
snatch at his master doth tarre him
all things should use do wrong
deny their office only do lack
mercy which fierce fire iron extends
creatures note mercy lacking uses
hubert well see live will not touch thine eye
all treasure thine uncle owes
yet am sworn did purpose boy
this same very iron burn them out
were disguis'd
hubert peace no more adieu
uncle must not know but are dead
i'll fill these dogged spies false reports
pretty child sleep doubtless secure
hubert wealth all world
will not offend thee
arthur o heaven thank hubert
hubert silence no more go closely

king john here once again sit once again crownd
look'd upon hope cheerful eyes
pembroke this once again but highness pleas'd
was once superfluous were crownd before
high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
faiths men ne'er stained revolt
any long'd change or better state
salisbury therefore possess'd double pomp
guard title was rich before
gild refined gold paint lily
throw perfume violet
smooth ice or add another hue
unto rainbow or taper light
seek beauteous eye heaven garnish
wasteful ridiculous excess
this act as an ancient tale new told
last repeating troublesome
being urged at time unseasonable
salisbury this antique well noted face
plain old form much disfigured
shifted wind unto sail
makes course thoughts fetch about
startles frights consideration
makes sound opinion sick truth suspected
pembroke when workmen strive do better than well
they do confound their skill covetousness
oftentimes excusing fault
doth make fault worse by th' excuse
as patches set upon little breach
discredit more hiding fault
than did fault before was so patch'd
salisbury this effect before were new crownd
breath'd our counsel but pleas'd highness
since all every part what would
doth make stand at what highness will
king john some reasons this double coronation
have possess'd think them strong
more more strong when lesser fear
shall indue meantime but ask
what would have reform'd not well
well shall perceive how willingly
will both hear grant requests
sound purposes all their hearts
both myself them but chief all
safety which myself them
bend their best studies heartily request
th' enfranchisement arthur whose restraint
doth move murmuring lips discontent
break into this dangerous argument
if what rest have right hold
why then fears which as they say attend
tender kinsman choke his days
barbarous ignorance deny his youth
rich advantage good exercise
time's enemies may not have this
grace occasions let our suit
have bid us ask his liberty

between his purpose his conscience
heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set
his passion so ripe needs must break
pembroke when breaks fear will issue thence
foul corruption sweet child's death
king john cannot hold mortality's strong hand
good lords although will give living
suit which demand gone dead
salisbury indeed fear'd his sickness was past cure
pembroke indeed heard how near his death he was
before child himself felt he was sick
this must answer'd either here or hence
king john why do bend such solemn brows
think bear shears destiny
have commandment pulse life
salisbury apparent foul play 'tis shame
greatness should so grossly offer
pembroke stay yet lord salisbury i'll go thee

hubert old men beldams streets
do prophesy upon dangerously
young arthur's death common their mouths
when they talk him they shake their heads
whisper one another ear
he speaks doth gripe hearer's wrist
whilst he hears makes fearful action
saw smith stand his hammer thus
whilst his iron did anvil cool
open mouth swallowing tailor's news
who his shears measure his hand
standing slippers which his nimble haste
had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
told many thousand warlike french
were embattailed rank'd kent
another lean unwash'd artificer
king john why seek'st thou possess these fears
why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death
thy hand hath murd'red him had mighty cause
wish him dead but thou hadst none kill him
hubert no had lord why did not provoke
king john curse kings attended
by slaves take their humours warrant
break within bloody house life
winking authority
dangerous majesty when perchance frowns
more upon humour than advis'd respect
hubert here hand seal what did
king john o when last account 'twixt heaven earth
made then shall this hand seal
witness against us damnation
how oft sight means do ill deeds
make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
fellow by hand nature mark'd
this murder had not come into mind
but taking note thy abhorr'd aspect
finding thee fit bloody villainy
apt liable employ'd danger
faintly broke thee arthur's death
thou endeared king
made no conscience destroy prince
hubert lord
king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
or turnd an eye doubt upon face
as bid tell tale express words
deep shame had struck dumb made break off
those thy fears might have wrought fears
but thou didst understand by signs
didst signs again parley sin
yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
consequently thy rude hand act
deed which both our tongues held vile name
nobles leave state braved
even at gates ranks foreign pow'rs
nay body fleshly land
this kingdom this confine blood breath
hostility civil tumult reigns
between conscience cousins death
hubert arm against other enemies
i'll make peace between soul
young arthur alive this hand mine
not painted crimson spots blood
within this bosom never ent'red yet
dreadful motion murderous thought
have slander'd nature form
which howsoever rude exteriorly
yet cover fairer mind
than butcher an innocent child
king john doth arthur live o haste thee peers
throw this report their incensed rage
forgive comment passion made
upon thy feature rage was blind
foul imaginary eyes blood
presented thee more hideous than thou art
o answer not but closet bring
angry lords all expedient haste
conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt

prince henry how fares majesty
king john poisond ill fare dead forsook cast off
none will bid winter come
thrust his icy fingers maw
nor let kingdom's rivers take their course
make his bleak winds kiss parched lips
comfort cold do not ask much

bastard o am scalded violent motion

king john o cousin thou art come set mine eye

module confounded royalty
bastard dauphin preparing hitherward
where god he knows how shall answer him
night best part pow'r
as upon advantage did remove

devoured by unexpected flood king dies

liege lord but now king now thus
what surety world what hope what stay
when this was now king now clay
bastard art thou gone so do but stay behind
do office thee revenge
then soul shall wait thee heaven
as earth hath been thy servant still
now now stars move right spheres
where pow'rs show now mended faiths
instantly return again
out weak door our fainting land
straight let us seek or straight shall sought
dauphin rages at our very heels
salisbury seems know not then so much as
cardinal pandulph within at rest
who half an hour since came from dauphin
brings from him such offers our peace
as honour respect may take

salisbury nay 'tis manner done already
many carriages he hath dispatch'd
sea side put his cause quarrel
disposing cardinal
whom yourself myself other lords

consummate this business happily
bastard let so noble prince

prince henry at worcester must his body interr'd

second commoner truly sir wear out their shoes get myself

rejoice his triumph
what tributaries follow him rome
grace captive bonds his chariot wheels
blocks stones worse than senseless things
o hard hearts cruel men rome
knew not pompey many time oft
have climb'd up walls battlements
towers windows yea chimney tops
infants arms there have sat
livelong day patient expectation
when saw his chariot but appear
have not made an universal shout
tiber trembled underneath her banks
hear replication sounds
made her concave shores
do now put best attire
do now cull out holiday
do now strew flowers his way
comes triumph over pompey's blood
run houses fall upon knees
pray gods intermit plague
needs must light this ingratitude
flavius go go good countrymen this fault
assemble all poor men sort
draw them tiber banks weep tears
into channel till lowest stream
do kiss most exalted shores all
exeunt all commoners
they vanish tongue tied their guiltiness
go down way towards capitol
this way will disrobe images
if do find them deck'd ceremonies
marullus may do so
know feast lupercal
flavius no matter let no images
hung caesar's trophies i'll about
drive away vulgar from streets
these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing

calpurnia here lord
caesar stand directly antonio's way
when he doth run his course antonio
antony caesar lord
caesar forget not speed antonio
touch calpurnia our elders say
shake off their sterile curse
antony shall remember
when caesar says do this perform'd
caesar set leave no ceremony out flourish
soothsayer caesar
caesar ha who calls
casca bid every noise still peace yet again
caesar who press calls
hear tongue shriller than all music
soothsayer beware ides march
caesar what man
brutus soothsayer beware ides march
caesar set him before let see his face
cassius fellow come from throng look upon caesar
caesar what say'st thou now speak once again
soothsayer beware ides march
caesar he dreamer let us leave him pass
sennet exeunt all but brutus cassius
brutus not
cassius pray do
brutus am not gamesome do lack some part
quick spirit antony
let not hinder cassius desires
i'll leave
cassius brutus do observe now late
have not from eyes gentleness
show love as was wont have
over friend loves
brutus cassius
not deceived if have veild look
turn trouble countenance
merely upon myself vexed am
late passions some difference
conceptions only proper myself
which give some soil perhaps behaviors
but let not therefore good friends grieved
nor construe any further neglect
than poor brutus himself at war
forgets shows love other men
cassius then brutus have much mistook passion
by means whereof this breast mine hath buried
thoughts great value worthy cogitations
tell good brutus can see face
brutus no cassius eye sees not itself
but by reflection by some other things
very much lamented brutus
have no such mirrors as will turn
hidden worthiness into eye
might see shadow have heard
where many best respect rome
except immortal caesar speaking brutus
groaning underneath this age's yoke
have wish'd noble brutus had his eyes
brutus into what dangers would lead cassius
which not
cassius therefore good brutus prepared hear
since know cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection glass
will modestly discover yourself
yourself which yet know not
not jealous gentle brutus
were common laugher or did use
stale ordinary oaths love
do fawn men hug them hard
after scandal them or if know
profess myself banqueting
all rout then hold dangerous
flourish shout
brutus what means this shouting do fear people
choose caesar their king
cassius ay do fear
then must think would not have so
but wherefore do hold here so long
what would impart
if aught toward general good
set honor one eye death i' other
will look both indifferently
let gods so speed as love
name honor more than fear death
cassius know virtue brutus
as well as do know outward favor
cannot tell what other men
think this life but single self
had as lief not as live
awe such thing as myself
was born free as caesar so were
both have fed as well can both
endure winter's cold as well as he
once upon raw gusty day
troubled tiber chafing her shores
leap into this angry flood
swim yonder point upon word
accoutred as was plunged
bade him follow so indeed he did
torrent roar'd did buffet
lusty sinews throwing aside
stemming hearts controversy
but ere could arrive point proposed
caesar cried help cassius or sink
did from flames troy upon his shoulder
old anchises bear so from waves tiber
did tired caesar this man
now become god cassius
wretched creature must bend his body
if caesar carelessly but nod him
he had fever when he was spain
when fit was him did mark
how he did shake 'tis true this god did shake
same eye whose bend doth awe world
did lose his luster did hear him groan
ay tongue his bade romans
mark him write his speeches their books
alas cried give some drink titinius
as sick girl ye gods doth amaze
man such feeble temper should
so get start majestic world
bear palm alone shout flourish
do believe these applauses are
some new honors are heap'd caesar
cassius why man he doth bestride narrow world
colossus petty men
walk under his huge legs peep about
find ourselves dishonorable graves
men at some time are masters their fates
fault dear brutus not our stars
but ourselves are underlings
why should name sounded more than yours
write them together yours as fair name
sound them doth become mouth as well
weigh them as heavy conjure 'em
brutus will start spirit as soon as caesar
now names all gods at once
upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
he grown so great age thou art shamed
rome thou hast lost breed noble bloods
but was famed more than one man
when could they say till now talk'd rome
her wide walls encompass'd but one man
now rome indeed room enough
when there but one only man
o have heard our fathers say
there was brutus once would have brook'd
eternal devil keep his state rome
as easily as king
what would work have some aim
how have thought this these times
shall recount hereafter this present
would not so love might entreat
any further moved what have said
will consider what have say
will patience hear find time
both meet hear answer such high things
till then noble friend chew upon this
than repute himself son rome
under these hard conditions as this time
lay upon us
cassius am glad weak words
have struck but thus much show fire from brutus
re enter caesar his train
brutus games are done caesar returning
cassius as they pass by pluck casca by sleeve
he will after his sour fashion tell
brutus will do so but look cassius
angry spot doth glow caesar's brow
all rest look chidden train
calpurnia's cheek pale cicero
looks such ferret such fiery eyes
as have seen him capitol
being cross'd conference by some senators
cassius casca will tell us what matter
caesar antonio
caesar let have men about are fat
sleek headed men such as sleep o' nights
yond cassius has lean hungry look
he thinks too much such men are dangerous
antony fear him not caesar he's not dangerous
he noble roman well given
caesar would he were fatter but fear him not
yet if name were liable fear
do not know man should avoid
he great observer he looks
quite through deeds men he loves no plays
as thou dost antony he hears no music
seldom he smiles smiles such sort
as if he mock'd himself scornd his spirit
could moved smile at anything
such men as he never at heart's ease
whiles they behold greater than themselves
therefore are they very dangerous
than what fear always am caesar
come right hand this ear deaf
tell truly what thou think'st him
sennet exeunt caesar all his train but casca
casca pulld by cloak would speak
brutus ay casca tell us what hath chanced today
caesar looks so sad
casca why were him were not
brutus should not then ask casca what had chanced
he put by back his hand thus then
people fell ashouting
brutus what was second noise
casca why too
cassius they shouted thrice what was last cry
casca why too
brutus was crown offered him thrice
casca ay marry wast he put by thrice every time gentler
than other at every putting by mine honest neighbors
cassius who offered him crown
casca why antony
brutus tell us manner gentle casca
casca can as well hang'd as tell manner was
mere foolery did not mark saw mark antony offer him
crown yet 'twas not crown neither 'twas one these
coronets as told he put by once but all
thinking he would fain have had then he offered
him again then he put by again but thinking he
third time he put third time by still as he
refused rabblement hooted clapped their chopped hands
threw up their sweaty nightcaps uttered such deal
stinking breath because caesar refused crown had
almost choked caesar he swounded fell down at
mine own part durst not laugh fear opening lips
receiving bad air
cassius but soft pray what did caesars wound
casca he fell down marketplace foamed at mouth was
brutus 'tis very he hath falling sickness
cassius no caesar hath not but
honest casca have falling sickness
casca know not what mean by but am sure caesar fell
down if tagrag people did not clap him hiss him
according as he pleased displeased them as they use do
players theatre am no true man
brutus what said he when he came unto himself
casca marry before he fell down when he perceived common
offered them his throat cut an had been man any
occupation if would not have taken him at word would
might go hell among rogues so he fell when he came
himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss
he desired their worships think was his infirmity three or
four wenches where stood cried alas good soul forgave
him all their hearts but there's no heed taken
them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done
no less
casca ay
cassius did cicero say anything
casca ay he spoke greek
cassius what effect
casca nay an tell i'll ne'er look i' face
again but those understood him smiled at one another
shook their heads but mine own part was greek
could tell more news too marullus flavius pulling
scarfs off caesar's images are put silence fare well
cassius will sup tonight casca
casca no am promised forth
cassius will dine tomorrow
casca ay if alive mind hold dinner worth
eating
cassius good will expect
casca do so farewell both exit
brutus what blunt fellow this grown
he was quick mettle when he went school
any bold or noble enterprise
however he puts this tardy form
this rudeness sauce his good wit
which gives men stomach digest his words
better appetite
brutus so this time will leave
tomorrow if please speak
will come home or if will
come home will wait
exit brutus
well brutus thou art noble yet see
thy honorable mettle may wrought
from disposed therefore meet
noble minds keep ever their likes
who so firm cannot seduced
caesar doth bear hard but he loves brutus
if were brutus now he were cassius
he should not humor will this night
as if they came from several citizens
writings all tending great opinion
rome holds his name wherein obscurely
caesar's ambition shall glanced at
after this let caesar seat him sure
will shake him or worse days endure exit
scene iii
street thunder lightning
enter from opposite sides casca his sword drawn cicero
why are breathless why stare so
casca are not moved when all sway earth
shakes thing unfirm o cicero
have seen tempests when scolding winds
have rived knotty oaks have seen
ambitious ocean swell rage foam
exalted threatening clouds
but never till tonight never till now
did go through tempest dropping fire
or else world too saucy gods
incenses them send destruction
cicero why saw anything more wonderful
casca common slave know him well by sight
held up his left hand which did flame burn
twenty torches joind yet his hand
not sensible fire remaind unscorch'd
besides ha' not since put up sword
against capitol met lion
without annoying there were drawn
upon heap hundred ghastly women
transformed their fear who swore they saw
men all fire walk up down streets
yesterday bird night did sit
even at noonday upon marketplace
howling shrieking when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
these are their reasons they are natural
unto climate they point upon
cicero indeed strange disposed time
but men may construe things after their fashion
clean from purpose things themselves
comes caesar capitol tomorrow
casca he doth he did bid antonio
send word he would there tomorrow
cicero good then casca this disturbed sky
not walk
enter cassius
cassius who's there
casca roman
cassius casca by voice
casca ear good cassius what night this
cassius very pleasing night honest men
casca who ever knew heavens menace so
cassius those have known earth so full faults
part have walk'd about streets
thus unbraced casca as see
have bared bosom thunderstone
when cross blue lightning seem'd open
breast heaven did present myself
even aim very flash
casca but wherefore did so much tempt heavens
part men fear tremble
when most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds astonish us
should roman do want
or else use not look pale gaze
put fear cast yourself wonder
see strange impatience heavens
but if would consider true cause
why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
why birds beasts from quality kind
why old men fools children calculate
why all these things change from their ordinance
monstrous quality why shall find
heaven hath infused them these spirits
make them instruments fear warning
unto some monstrous state
now could casca name thee man
most this dreadful night
thunders lightens opens graves roars
as doth lion capitol
man no mightier than thyself or
fearful as these strange eruptions are
casca 'tis caesar mean not cassius
cassius let who romans now
have thews limbs their ancestors
but woe while our fathers' minds are dead
are governd our mothers' spirits
our yoke sufferance show us womanish
casca indeed they say senators tomorrow
mean establish caesar as king
every place save here italy
cassius know where will wear this dagger then
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
therein ye gods make weak most strong
therein ye gods tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls beaten brass
nor airless dungeon nor strong links iron
can retentive strength spirit
but life being weary these worldly bars
if know this know all world besides
part tyranny do bear
can shake off at pleasure thunder still
casca so can
so every bondman his own hand bears
power cancel his captivity
cassius why should caesar tyrant then
poor man know he would not wolf
but he sees romans are but sheep
those haste will make mighty fire
begin weak straws what trash rome
what rubbish what offal when serves
base matter illuminate
so vile thing as caesar but o grief
where hast thou led perhaps speak this
before willing bondman then know
answer must made but am arm'd
dangers are indifferent
no fleering tell tale hold hand
factious redress all these griefs
will set this foot mine as far
as who goes farthest
cassius there's bargain made
now know casca have moved already
some certain noblest minded romans
undergo an enterprise
honorable dangerous consequence
pompey's porch now this fearful night
there no stir or walking streets
complexion element
favor's work have hand
most bloody fiery most terrible
enter cinna
casca stand close awhile here comes one haste
cassius 'tis cinna do know him by his gait
he friend cinna where haste so
cassius no casca one incorporate
our attempts am not stay'd cinna
cinna am glad ont what fearful night this

but win noble brutus our party
cassius content good cinna take this paper
where brutus may but find throw this

so bestow these papers as bade
cassius done repair pompey's theatre
come casca will yet ere day
see brutus at his house three parts him
ours already man entire
upon next encounter yields him ours
casca o he sits high all people's hearts
which would appear offense us
his countenance richest alchemy
will change virtue worthiness
cassius him his worth our great need him
after midnight ere day
will awake him sure him exeunt
act ii scene
enter brutus his orchard
brutus what lucius ho
cannot by progress stars
give guess how near day lucius say
would were fault sleep so soundly
when lucius when awake say what lucius
lucius calld lord
brutus get taper study lucius
when lighted come call here
lucius will lord exit
brutus must by his death part
know no personal cause spurn at him
but general he would crownd
how might change his nature there's question
bright day brings forth adder
then grant put sting him
at his will he may do danger
abuse greatness when disjoins
remorse from power speak truth caesar
have not known when his affections sway'd
more than his reason but 'tis common proof
lowliness young ambitions ladder
whereto climber upward turns his face
but when he once attains upmost round
looks clouds scorning base degrees
by which he did ascend so caesar may
then lest he may prevent since quarrel
will bear no color thing he
fashion thus what he augmented
would run these these extremities
therefore think him as serpent's egg
which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
kill him shell
lucius taper burneth closet sir
searching window flint found
this paper thus seald up am sure
did not lie there when went bed
gives him letter
brutus get bed again not day
not tomorrow boy ides march
lucius know not sir
brutus look calendar bring word
brutus exhalations whizzing air
give so much light may read by them
opens letter reads
brutus thou sleep'st awake see thyself
shall rome etc speak strike redress
brutus thou sleep'st awake
such instigations have been often dropp'd
where have took them up
shall rome etc thus must piece out
ancestors did from streets rome
tarquin drive when he was calld king
speak strike redress am entreated
speak strike o rome make thee promise
if redress will follow thou receivest
thy full petition at hand brutus
re enter lucius
lucius sir march wasted fifteen days
knocking within
exit lucius
since cassius first did whet against caesar
have not slept
between acting dreadful thing
first motion all interim
phantasma or hideous dream
genius mortal instruments
are then council state man
little kingdom suffers then
re enter lucius
lucius sir 'tis brother cassius at door
who doth desire see
brutus he alone
lucius no sir there are more him
brutus do know them
lucius no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
half their faces buried their cloaks
by no means may discover them
brutus let 'em enter exit lucius
they are faction o conspiracy
shamest thou show thy dangerous brow by night
when evils are most free o then by day
where wilt thou find cavern dark enough
mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
hide smiles affability
if thou path thy native semblance
not erebus itself were dim enough
enter conspirators cassius casca decius cinna
metellus cimber trebonius
cassius think are too bold upon rest
good morrow brutus do trouble
brutus have been up this hour awake all night
know these men come along
cassius yes every man them no man here
but honors every one doth wish
had but opinion yourself
this trebonius
brutus he welcome hither
cassius this decius brutus
brutus he welcome too
cassius this casca this cinna this metellus cimber
brutus they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves
betwixt eyes night
cassius shall entreat word they whisper
casca no
cinna o pardon sir doth yongrey lines
fret clouds are messengers day
casca shall confess are both deceived
here as point sword sun arises
which great way growing south
weighing youthful season year
some two months hence up higher toward north
he first presents his fire high east
brutus give hands all over one by one
cassius let us swear our resolution
brutus no not an oath if not face men
sufferance our souls time's abuse
if these motives weak break off betimes
every man hence his idle bed
so let high sighted tyranny range
till each man drop by lottery but if these
as am sure they do bear fire enough
melting spirits women then countrymen
what need any spur but our own cause
prick us redress what other bond
than secret romans have spoke word
will not palter what other oath
than honesty honesty engaged
this shall or will fall
swear priests cowards men cautelous
old feeble carrions such suffering souls
such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
even virtue our enterprise
nor insuppressive mettle our spirits
think or our cause or our performance
did need an oath when every drop blood
every roman bears nobly bears
guilty several bastardy
if he do break smallest particle
any promise hath pass'd from him
think he will stand very strong us
casca let us not leave him out
cinna no by no means
metellus o let us have him his silver hairs
will purchase us good opinion
buy mens voices commend our deeds
shall said his judgement ruled our hands
our youths wildness shall no whit appear
but all buried his gravity
he will never follow anything
other men begin
cassius then leave him out
casca indeed he not fit
decius shall no man else touch'd but only caesar
cassius decius well urged think not meet
mark antony so well beloved caesar
should outlive caesar shall find him
shrewd contriver know his means
as annoy us all which prevent
let antony caesar fall together
brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
cut head off then hack limbs
wrath death envy afterwards
antony but limb caesar
let us sacrificers but not butchers caius
all stand up against spirit caesar
spirit men there no blood
not dismember caesar but alas
caesar must bleed gentle friends
let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
let's carve him as dish fit gods
not hew him as carcass fit hounds
let our hearts as subtle masters do
stir up their servants an act rage
after seem chide 'em this shall make
our purpose necessary not envious
shall calld purgers not murderers
mark antony think not him
he can do no more than caesar's arm
when caesar's head off
cassius yet fear him
ingrated love he bears caesar
brutus alas good cassius do not think him
if he love caesar all he can do
himself take thought die caesar
sports wildness much company
trebonius there no fear him let him not die
he will live laugh at this hereafter
clock strikes
brutus peace count clock
cassius clock hath stricken three
trebonius 'tis time part
cassius but doubtful yet
whether caesar will come forth today or no
quite from main opinion he held once
fantasy dreams ceremonies
may these apparent prodigies
unaccustom'd terror this night
persuasion his augurers
may hold him from capitol today
decius never fear if he so resolved
can o'ersway him he loves hear
unicorns may betray'd trees
lions toils men flatterers
but when tell him he hates flatterers
he says he does being then most flattered
let work
can give his humor true bent
will bring him capitol
cassius nay will all us there fetch him
brutus by eighth hour utter most
cinna uttermost fail not then
who rated him speaking well pompey
wonder none have thought him
brutus now good metellus go along by him
he loves well have given him reasons
send him but hither i'll fashion him
cassius morning comes upon 's we'll leave brutus
friends disperse yourselves but all remember
what have said show yourselves true romans
brutus good gentlemen look fresh merrily
but bear as our roman actors do
untired spirits formal constancy
so good morrow every one
exeunt all but brutus
boy lucius fast asleep no matter
enjoy honey heavy dew slumber
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
which busy care draws brains men
therefore thou sleep'st so sound
portia brutus lord
brutus portia what mean wherefore rise now
not health thus commit
weak condition raw cold morning
portia nor yours neither have ungently brutus
stole from bed yesternight at supper
suddenly arose walk'd about
musing sighing arms across
when ask'd what matter was
urged further then scratch'd head
too impatiently stamp'd foot
yet insisted yet answer'd not
but an angry waiter hand
gave sign leave so did
fearing strengthen impatience
which seem'd too much enkindled withal
hoping was but an effect humor
which sometime hath his hour every man
could work so much upon shape
as hath much prevaild condition
should not know brutus dear lord
make acquainted cause grief
brutus am not well health all
portia brutus wise were he not health
he would embrace means come by
brutus why so do good portia go bed
portia brutus sick physical
dank morning what brutus sick
will he steal out his wholesome bed
dare vile contagion night
tempt rheumy unpurged air
add unto his sickness no brutus
have some sick offense within mind
which by right virtue place
ought know upon knees
charm by once commended beauty
which did incorporate make us one
unfold yourself half
why are heavy what men tonight
have had resort here have been
some six or seven who did hide their faces
even from darkness
brutus kneel not gentle portia
portia should not need if were gentle brutus
within bond marriage tell brutus
appertain am yourself
but as were sort or limitation
keep at meals comfort bed
talk sometimes dwell but suburbs
good pleasure if no more
portia brutus' harlot not his wife
brutus are true honorable wife
as dear as are ruddy drops
visit sad heart
grant am woman but withal
woman lord brutus took wife
grant am woman but withal
woman well reputed cato's daughter
think am no stronger than sex
being so father'd so husbanded
tell counsels will not disclose 'em
have made strong proof constancy
giving myself voluntary wound
not husband's secrets
brutus o ye gods
render worthy this noble wife knocking within
hark hark one knocks portia go awhile
by by thy bosom shall partake
secrets heart
all engagements will construe thee
all charactery sad brows
leave haste exit portia lucius who's knocks
lucius here sick man would speak

lioness hath whelped streets
fierce fiery warriors fight upon clouds
ranks squadrons right form war
which drizzled blood upon capitol
noise battle hurtled air
horses did neigh dying men did groan
ghosts did shriek squeal about streets
o caesar these things are beyond all use
do fear them
caesar what can avoided
yet caesar shall go forth these predictions

calpurnia when beggars die there are no comets seen
heavens themselves blaze forth death princes

seeing death necessary end

octavius now antony our hopes are answered
said enemy would not come down

antony no caesar will answer their charge
make forth generals would have some words
octavius stir not until signal not until signal
brutus words before blows so countrymen
octavius not love words better as do
brutus good words are better than bad strokes octavius
antony bad strokes brutus give good words
witness hole made caesar's heart
crying long live hail caesar
posture blows are yet unknown
but words they rob hybla bees
leave them honeyless
antony not stingless too
brutus o yes soundless too
have stoln their buzzing antony
very wisely threat before sting
antony villains did not so when vile daggers
hack'd one another sides caesar
bow'd bondmen kissing caesar's feet
whilst damned casca cur behind

cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself
this tongue had not offended so today

upon one battle all our liberties

his opinion now change mind
partly credit things do presage
coming from sardis our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell there they perch'd
gorging feeding from our soldiers' hands
who philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away gone
fly o'er our heads downward look us
as were sickly prey their shadows seem
canopy most fatal under which
our army lies ready give up ghost
messala believe not so
cassius but believe partly
am fresh spirit resolved
meet all perils very constantly
brutus even so lucilius
gods today stand friendly may
lovers peace lead our days age
but since affairs men rest still incertain
let's reason worst may befall
if do lose this battle then this
very last time shall speak together
what are then determined do
brutus even by rule philosophy
by which did blame cato death
but do find cowardly vile
fear what might fall so prevent
time life arming myself patience
stay providence some high powers
govern us below
cassius then if lose this battle
are contented led triumph
thorough streets rome
brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman
he bears too great mind but this same day
must end work ides march begun
whether shall meet again know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take
forever forever farewell cassius
if do meet again why shall smile
if not why then this parting was well made
cassius forever forever farewell brutus
if do meet again we'll smile indeed
brutus why then lead o man might know
end this day's business ere come
but sufficeth day will end
then end known come ho away exeunt

lear lord burgundy
first address toward who this king
hath rivalld our daughter what least
will require present dower her
or cease quest love
bur most royal majesty
crave no more than hath highness offer'd
nor will tender less
when she was dear us did hold her so
but now her price falln sir there she stands
if aught within little seeming substance
or all our displeasure piec'd
nothing more may fitly grace
she's there she yours
bur know no answer
lear will those infirmities she owes
unfriended new adopted our hate
take her or leave her
bur pardon royal sir
election makes not up such conditions
lear then leave her sir by pow'r made
tell all her wealth france great king
would not from love make such stray
match where hate therefore beseech
t' avert liking more worthier way
than wretch whom nature asham'd
france this most strange
she even but now was best object
argument praise balm age
most best most dearest should this trice time
commit thing so monstrous dismantle
so many folds favour sure her offence
must such unnatural degree
monsters or fore vouch'd affection
falln into taint which believe her
should never plant
cor yet beseech majesty
if want glib oily art
speak purpose not since what well intend
i'll do't before speak make known
no vicious blot murther or foulness
no unchaste action or dishonoured step
hath depriv'd grace favour
but even want which am richer
as am glad have not though not have
hath lost liking
lear better thou
hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd better
france but this tardiness nature
which often leaves history unspoke
intends do lord burgundy
what say lady love's not love
when mingled regards stands
she herself dowry
bur royal lear
give but portion which yourself propos'd
here take cordelia by hand

enter king berowne longaville dumain
king let fame all hunt after their lives
live regist'red upon our brazen tombs
then grace us disgrace death
when spite cormorant devouring time
th' endeavour this present breath may buy
make us heirs all eternity
therefore brave conquerors so are
war against own affections
huge army world's desires
our late edict shall strongly stand force
navarre shall wonder world
our court shall little academe
still contemplative living art
three berowne dumain longaville
fellow scholars keep those statutes
are recorded this schedule here
oaths are pass'd now subscribe names
his own hand may strike his honour down
violates smallest branch herein
if are arm'd do as sworn do
subscribe deep oaths keep too
longaville am resolv'd 'tis but three years' fast
mind shall banquet though body pine
make rich ribs but bankrupt quite wits
dumain loving lord dumain mortified
grosser manner these world's delights
he throws upon gross world's baser slaves
love wealth pomp pine die
all these living philosophy
berowne can but say their protestation over
so much dear liege have already sworn
live study here three years
as not see woman term
which hope well not enrolled there
one day week touch no food
but one meal every day beside
which hope not enrolled there
then sleep but three hours night
not seen wink all day
when was wont think no harm all night
make dark night too half day
o these are barren tasks too hard keep
not see ladies study fast not sleep
king oath pass'd pass away from these
berowne let say no liege an if please
only swore study grace
stay here court three years' space
longaville swore berowne rest
berowne by yea nay sir then swore jest
what end study let know
berowne things hid barr'd mean from common sense
king ay study's god recompense
berowne come then will swear study so
know thing am forbid know
as thus study where well may dine
when feast expressly am forbid
or study where meet some mistress fine
when mistresses from common sense are hid
or having sworn too hard keeping oath
if study's gain thus this so
study knows which yet doth not know
swear this will ne'er say no
king these stops hinder study quite
train our intellects vain delight
berowne why all delights are vain but most vain
which pain purchas'd doth inherit pain
as painfully pore upon book
seek light truth while truth while
light seeking light doth light light beguile
so ere find where light darkness lies
light grows dark by losing eyes
study how please eye indeed
by fixing upon fairer eye
who dazzling so eye shall his heed
give him light was blinded by
study heavens glorious sun
will not deep search'd saucy looks
save base authority from others' books
these earthly godfathers heavens lights
give name every fixed star
have no more profit their shining nights
than those walk wot not what they are
too much know know nought but fame
every godfather can give name
king how well he's read reason against reading
dumain proceeded well stop all good proceeding
berowne spring near when green geese are breeding
dumain how follows
berowne fit his place time
dumain reason nothing
berowne something then rhyme
longaville berowne an envious sneaping frost
bites first born infants spring
berowne well say am why should proud summer boast
before birds have any cause sing
at christmas no more desire rose
than wish snow may's new fangled shows
but each thing season grows
so study now too late
climb o'er house unlock little gate
king well sit out go home berowne adieu
berowne no good lord have sworn stay
though have barbarism spoke more
than angel knowledge can say
bide penance each three years' day
give paper let read same
strictest decrees i'll write name
king how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
berowne reads 'item no woman shall come within mile
court' hath this been proclaimed
longaville four days ago
berowne let's see penalty reads ' pain losing her
tongue' who devis'd this penalty
berowne sweet lord why
longaville fright them hence dread penalty
berowne dangerous law against gentility
reads 'item if any man seen talk woman within
term three years he shall endure such public shame as
rest court can possibly devise'
this article liege yourself must break
well know here comes embassy
french king's daughter yourself speak
about surrender up aquitaine
her decrepit sick bedrid father
therefore this article made vain
or vainly comes th' admired princess hither
king what say lords why this was quite forgot
berowne so study evermore over shot
while doth study have what would
doth forget do thing should
when hath thing hunteth most
king must force dispense this decree
she must lie here mere necessity
berowne necessity will make us all forsworn
three thousand times within this three years' space
every man his affects born
not by might mast'red but by special grace
if break faith this word shall speak
am forsworn mere necessity
so laws at large write name subscribes
stands attainder eternal shame
suggestions are other as
but believe although seem so loath

king advancing come sir blush as his case such
chide at him offending twice as much
do not love maria longaville
nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
his loving bosom keep down his heart
have been closely shrouded this bush
mark'd both both did blush
heard guilty rhymes observ'd fashion
saw sighs reek from noted well passion
'ay me' says one 'o jove' other cries
one her hairs were gold crystal other's eyes
longaville would paradise break faith troth
what will berowne say when he shall hear
faith infringed which such zeal did swear
how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
how will he triumph leap laugh at
all wealth ever did see
would not have him know so much by
berowne descending now step forth whip hypocrisy

berowne sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
as true are as flesh blood can
sea will ebb flow heaven show his face
young blood doth not obey an old decree
cannot cross cause why were born
therefore all hands must forsworn
king what did these rent lines show some love thine
rude savage man inde
at first op'ning gorgeous east
bows not his vassal head strucken blind
kisses base ground obedient breast
what peremptory eagle sighted eye
dares look upon heaven her brow
not blinded by her majesty
king what zeal what fury hath inspir'd thee now
love her mistress gracious moon
berowne eyes are then no eyes nor berowne
o but love day would turn night
all complexions culld sovereignty
do meet as at fair her fair cheek
where several worthies make one dignity
where nothing wants want itself doth seek
lend flourish all gentle tongues
fie painted rhetoric o she needs not
things sale seller's praise belongs
wither'd hermit five score winters worn
might shake off fifty looking her eye
beauty doth varnish age as if new born
gives crutch cradle's infancy
o 'tis sun maketh all things shine
king by heaven thy love black as ebony
berowne ebony her o wood divine
wife such wood were felicity
o who can give an oath where book
if she learn not her eye look
no face fair not full so black
king o paradox black badge hell
hue dungeons school night
beauty's crest becomes heavens well
berowne devils soonest tempt resembling spirits light
o if black lady's brows deckt
mourns painting usurping hair
should ravish doters false aspect
her favour turns fashion days
native blood counted painting now
therefore red would avoid dispraise
paints itself black imitate her brow
dumain look her are chimney sweepers black
longaville since her time are colliers counted bright
king ethiopes their sweet complexion crack
dumain dark needs no candles now dark light
berowne mistresses dare never come rain
king 'twere good yours did sir tell plain
i'll find fairer face not wash'd day
berowne i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
king no devil will fright thee then so much as she
dumain never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
longaville look here's thy love foot her face see
showing his shoe
berowne o if streets were paved thine eyes
her feet were much too dainty such tread
street should see as she walk'd overhead
king but what this are not all love
berowne nothing so sure thereby all forsworn
king then leave this chat good berowne now prove
our loving lawful our faith not torn
dumain ay marry there some flattery this evil
longaville o some authority how proceed
some tricks some quillets how cheat devil
dumain some salve perjury
have at then affections men at arms
consider what first did swear unto
fast study see no woman
flat treason 'gainst kingly state youth
say can fast stomachs are too young
abstinence engenders maladies
where have vow'd study lords
each have forsworn his book
can still dream pore thereon look
have found ground study's excellence
without beauty womans face
from womens eyes this doctrine derive
they are ground books academes
from whence doth spring true promethean fire
why universal plodding poisons up
nimble spirits arteries
as motion long during action tires
sinewy vigour traveller
have forsworn use eyes
study too causer vow
where author world
teaches such beauty as womans eye
learning but an adjunct ourself
where are our learning likewise
then when ourselves see ladies' eyes
ourselves
do not likewise see our learning there
vow have forsworn our books
when would liege or or
leaden contemplation have found out
such fiery numbers as prompting eyes
beauty's tutors have enrich'd
other slow arts entirely keep brain
therefore finding barren practisers
scarce show harvest their heavy toil
but love first learned lady's eyes
but motion all elements
courses as swift as thought every power
gives every power double power
above their functions their offices
adds precious seeing eye
lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
lover's ear will hear lowest sound
when suspicious head theft stopp'd
love's feeling more soft sensible
love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross taste
valour not love hercules
still climbing trees hesperides
subtle as sphinx as sweet musical
as bright apollo's lute strung his hair
when love speaks voice all gods
make heaven drowsy harmony
never durst poet touch pen write
until his ink were temp'red love's sighs
plant tyrants mild humility
from womens eyes this doctrine derive
they sparkle still right promethean fire
they are books arts academes
show contain nourish all world
else none at all aught proves excellent
then fools were these women forswear
or keeping what sworn will prove fools
wisdom's sake word all men love
or mens sake authors these women
or womens sake by whom men are men
let us once lose our oaths find ourselves
or else lose ourselves keep our oaths
religion thus forsworn
charity itself fulfils law
who can sever love from charity
king saint cupid then soldiers field
berowne advance standards upon them lords
conflict get sun them
longaville now plain dealing lay these glozes by
shall resolve woo these girls france
king win them too therefore let us devise
some entertainment them their tents
berowne first from park let us conduct them thither
then homeward every man attach hand
his fair mistress afternoon
will some strange pastime solace them
revels dances masks merry hours
forerun fair love strewing her way flowers

one rubb'd his elbow thus fleer'd swore
another his finger his thumb
cried 'via will do't come what will come'

all fair endeavours entreat
out new sad soul vouchsafe
rich wisdom excuse or hide
liberal opposition our spirits
if over boldly have borne ourselves
was guilty farewell worthy lord
heavy heart bears not nimble tongue
excuse so coming too short thanks
great suit so easily obtaind
king extreme parts time extremely forms
all causes purpose his speed
often at his very loose decides
which long process could not arbitrate
though mourning brow progeny
holy suit which fain would convince
yet since love's argument was first foot
let not cloud sorrow justle
from what purpos'd since wail friends lost
not by much so wholesome profitable
as rejoice at friends but newly found
princess france understand not griefs are double
berowne honest plain words best pierce ear grief
by these badges understand king
play'd foul play our oaths beauty ladies
hath much deformed us fashioning our humours
even opposed end our intents
what us hath seem'd ridiculous
as love full unbefitting strains
all wanton as child skipping vain
form'd by eye therefore eye
full strange shapes habits forms
varying subjects as eye doth roll
which parti coated presence loose love
put by us if heavenly eyes
have misbecom'd our oaths gravities
those heavenly eyes look into these faults
suggested us make therefore ladies
our love being yours error love makes
likewise yours ourselves prove false
by being once false ever true
those make us both fair ladies
thus purifies itself turns grace
princess france have receiv'd letters full love
favours ambassadors love
our maiden council rated them
at courtship pleasant jest courtesy
as bombast as lining time
but more devout than this our respects
have not been therefore met loves
their own fashion merriment
longaville so did our looks
rosaline did not quote them so
king now at latest minute hour
grant us loves
princess france time methinks too short
make world without end bargain
no no lord grace perjur'd much
full dear guiltiness therefore this
if love as there no such cause
oath will not trust but go speed
some forlorn naked hermitage
remote from all pleasures world
there stay until twelve celestial signs
have brought about annual reckoning
if this austere insociable life
change not offer made heat blood
if frosts fasts hard lodging thin weeds
nip not gaudy blossoms love
then at expiration year
come challenge challenge by these deserts
by this virgin palm now kissing thine
will thine till instant shut
woeful self up mournful house
raining tears lamentation
remembrance father's death
if this thou do deny let our hands part
neither intitled other's heart
flatter up these powers mine rest
sudden hand death close up mine eye
hence hermit then heart thy breast
berowne what love what
rosaline must he purged too sins are rack'd
are attaint faults perjury
therefore if favour mean get
twelvemonth shall spend never rest
but seek weary beds people sick
wife

scene iii
enter malcolm macduff
malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade there
weep our sad bosoms empty
macduff let us rather
hold fast mortal sword good men
bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn
new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
strike heaven face resounds
as if felt scotland yelld out
malcolm what believe i'll wall
what know believe what can redress
as shall find time friend will
what have spoke may so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
was once thought honest have loved him well
he hath not touch'd yet am young but something
may deserve him through wisdom
offer up weak poor innocent lamb
macduff am not treacherous
malcolm but macbeth
good virtuous nature may recoil
an imperial charge but shall crave pardon
which are thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though brightest fell
though all things foul would wear brows grace
yet grace must still look so
macduff have lost hopes
why rawness left wife child
those precious motives those strong knots love
without leave taking pray
let not jealousies dishonors
but mine own safeties may rightly just
whatever shall think
macduff bleed bleed poor country
great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
goodness dare not check thee wear thou thy wrongs
would not villain thou think'st
whole space that's tyrant's grasp
rich east boot
malcolm not offended
speak not as absolute fear
think our country sinks beneath yoke
weeps bleeds each new day gash
added her wounds think withal
there would hands uplifted right
goodly thousands but all this
when shall tread upon tyrant's head
or wear sword yet poor country
shall have more vices than had before
more suffer more sundry ways than ever
by him shall succeed
macduff what should he
malcolm myself mean whom know
all particulars vice so grafted
will seem as pure as snow poor state
esteem him as lamb being compared
confineless harms
macduff not legions
horrid hell can come devil more damnd
evils top macbeth
malcolm grant him bloody
luxurious avaricious false deceitful
sudden malicious smacking every sin
voluptuousness wives daughters
matrons maids could not fill up
cestern lust desire
all continent impediments would o'erbear
did oppose will better macbeth
than such an one reign
macduff boundless intemperance
nature tyranny hath been
untimely emptying happy throne
take upon what yours may
convey pleasures spacious plenty
yet seem cold time may so hoodwink
have willing dames enough there cannot
vulture devour so many
as will greatness dedicate themselves
finding so inclined
malcolm this there grows
most ill composed affection such
should cut off nobles their lands
desire his jewels this other's house
more having would as sauce
make hunger more should forge
quarrels unjust against good loyal
destroying them wealth
macduff this avarice
sticks deeper grows more pernicious root
than summer seeming lust hath been
scotland hath foisons fill up will
mere own all these are portable
other graces weigh'd
malcolm but have none king becoming graces
as justice verity temperance stableness
bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
devotion patience courage fortitude
have no relish them but abound
division each several crime
pour sweet milk concord into hell
uproar universal peace confound
all unity earth
macduff o scotland scotland
malcolm if such one fit govern speak
am as have spoken
macduff fit govern
no not live o nation miserable
an untitled tyrant bloody scepter'd
since truest issue thy throne
by his own interdiction stands accursed
does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
was most sainted king queen bore thee
oftener upon her knees than her feet
died every day she lived fare thee well
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
have banish'd from scotland o breast
thy hope ends here
child integrity hath from soul
wiped black scruples reconciled thoughts
thy good truth honor devilish macbeth
by many these trains hath sought win
into his power modest wisdom plucks
from over credulous haste but god above
deal between thee even now
put myself thy direction
unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
strangers nature am yet
unknown woman never was forsworn
scarcely have coveted what was mine own
at no time broke faith would not betray
devil his fellow delight
no less truth than life first false speaking
was this upon myself what am truly
thine poor country's command
whither indeed before thy here approach
already at point was setting forth
now we'll together chance goodness
our warranted quarrel why are silent
macduff such welcome unwelcome things at once
'tis hard reconcile
enter doctor

dying or ere they sicken
macduff o relation

malcolm what's newest grief
each minute teems new one
macduff how does wife
ross why well

saw tyrant's power afoot
now time help eye scotland
would create soldiers make our women fight

isabella am woeful suitor honour
please but honour hear
angelo well what's suit
isabella there vice most do abhor
most desire should meet blow justice
which would not plead but must
which must not plead but am
angelo well matter
isabella have brother condemnd die
do beseech let his fault
not brother
provost aside heaven give thee moving graces
angelo condemn fault not actor
why every fault's condemnd ere done
mine were very cipher function
fine faults whose fine stands record
isabella o just but severe law
had brother then heaven keep honour
lucio isabella give't not o'er so him again entreat him
kneel down before him hang upon his gown
are too cold if should need pin
could not more tame tongue desire
him say
isabella must he needs die
angelo maiden no remedy
neither heaven nor man grieve at mercy
angelo will not do't
isabella but can if would
angelo look what will not cannot do
isabella but might do't do world no wrong
if so heart were touch'd remorse
as mine him
angelo he's sentenc'd 'tis too late
lucio isabella are too cold
may call back again well believe this
no ceremony great ones longs
not king's crown nor deputed sword
marshals truncheon nor judge's robe
become them one half so good grace
as mercy does
if he had been as as he
would have slipp'd him but he
would not have been so stern
isabella would heaven had potency
were isabel should then thus
no would tell what 'twere judge
what prisoner
lucio isabella ay touch him there's vein
angelo brother forfeit law
but waste words
isabella alas alas
why all souls were were forfeit once
found out remedy how would
if he which top judgment should
but judge as are o think
mercy then will breathe within lips
man new made
angelo content fair maid
law not condemn brother
were he kinsman brother or son
should thus him he must die morrow
he's not prepar'd death even our kitchens
kill fowl season shall serve heaven
less respect than do minister
our gross selves good good lord bethink
who hath died this offence
there's many have committed
lucio aside ay well said
angelo law hath not been dead though hath slept
those many had not dar'd do evil
had answer'd his deed now 'tis awake
takes note what done prophet
looks glass shows what future evils
either now or by remissness new conceiv'd
so progress hatch'd born
are now have no successive degrees
but here they live end
isabella yet show some pity
angelo show most all when show justice
which dismiss'd offence would after gall
do him right answering one foul wrong
lives not act another satisfied
brother dies morrow content
isabella so must first gives this sentence
he suffers o excellent
have giant's strength but tyrannous
use giant
lucio isabella that's well said
as jove himself does jove would never quiet
every pelting petty officer
would use his heaven thunder
nothing but thunder merciful heaven
thou rather thy sharp sulphurous bolt
splits unwedgeable gnarled oak
than soft myrtle but man proud man
dress'd little brief authority
most ignorant what he's most assur'd
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
as makes angels weep who our speens
would all themselves laugh mortal
lucio isabella o him him wench he will relent
he's coming perceive 't
provost aside pray heaven she win him
isabella cannot weigh our brother ourself
great men may jest saints 'tis wit them
but less foul profanation
isabella captains but choleric word
which soldier flat blasphemy
lucio isabella art avis'd o' more ont
angelo why do put these sayings upon
isabella because authority though err others
hath yet kind medicine itself
skins vice o' th' top go bosom
knock there ask heart what doth know
that's brother's fault if confess
let not sound thought upon tongue
against brother's life
angelo aside she speaks 'tis
such sense sense breeds fare well
isabella gentle lord turn back
angelo will bethink come again morrow
isabella hark how i'll bribe good lord turn back
angelo how bribe
isabella ay such gifts heaven shall share
isabella not fond sicles tested gold
or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
as fancy values them but true prayers
shall up at heaven enter there
ere sun rise prayers from preserved souls
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
nothing temporal
angelo well come morrow
lucio isabella go 'tis well away
angelo aside amen
am way going temptation
where prayers cross
isabella at what hour morrow
shall attend lordship
angelo at any time 'fore noon
isabella save honour exeunt all but angelo
angelo from thee even from thy virtue
what's this what's this this her fault or mine
empty
not she nor doth she tempt but
lying by violet sun
do as carrion does not as flow'r
corrupt virtuous season can
modesty may more betray our sense
than womans lightness having waste ground enough
shall desire raze sanctuary
pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
dost thou desire her foully those things
make her good o let her brother live
thieves their robbery have authority
when judges steal themselves what do love her
desire hear her speak again
feast upon her eyes what is't dream
o cunning enemy catch saint
saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
temptation doth goad us
all her double vigour art nature
once stir temper but this virtuous maid
subdues quite ever till now
when men were fond smild wond'red how exit

angelo when would pray think think pray
whilst invention hearing not tongue
anchors isabel heaven mouth
as if did but only chew his name
heart strong swelling evil
conception state whereon studied
good thing being often read
grown sere tedious yea gravity
wherein let no man hear take pride

dispossessing all other parts

by which he should revive even so
general subject well wish'd king
quit their own part obsequious fondness
crowd his presence where their untaught love
enter isabella
how now fair maid
isabella am come know pleasure
angelo might know would much better please
than demand what 'tis brother cannot live
isabella even so heaven keep honour
angelo yet may he live awhile may
as long as or yet he must die
isabella under sentence
isabella when beseech his reprieve
longer or shorter he may so fitted
his soul sicken not
angelo ha fie these filthy vices were as good
pardon him hath from nature stoln
man already made as remit
their saucy sweetness do coin heavens image
stamps are forbid 'tis all as easy
falsely take away life true made
make false one
isabella 'tis set down so heaven but not earth
angelo say so then shall pose quickly
which had rather most just law
now took brother's life or redeem him
give up body such sweet uncleanness
as she he hath staind
isabella sir believe this
had rather give body than soul
stand more number than accompt
isabella how say
angelo nay i'll not warrant can speak
against thing say answer this
now voice recorded law
pronounce sentence brother's life
might there not charity sin
save this brother's life
isabella please do't
no sin at all but charity
angelo pleas'd do't at peril soul
were equal poise sin charity
isabella do beg his life if sin
heaven let bear granting suit
if sin i'll make morn prayer
have added faults mine
nothing answer
angelo nay but hear
or seem so craftily that's not good
isabella let ignorant nothing good
but graciously know am no better
angelo thus wisdom wishes appear most bright
when doth tax itself as these black masks
proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
than beauty could display'd but mark
received plain i'll speak more gross
brother die
angelo his offence so as appears
accountant law upon pain
isabella true
angelo admit no other way save his life
as subscribe not nor any other
but loss question his sister
finding yourself desir'd such person
whose credit judge or own great place
could fetch brother from manacles
no earthly mean save him but either
must lay down treasures body
this supposed or else let him suffer
what would do
isabella as much poor brother as myself
were under terms death
th' impression keen whips i'd wear as rubies
strip myself death as bed
longing have been sick ere i'd yield
angelo then must brother die
isabella 'twere cheaper way
better were brother died at once
than sister by redeeming him
should die ever
angelo were not then as cruel as sentence
have slander'd so
isabella ignominy ransom free pardon
are two houses lawful mercy
angelo seem'd late make law tyrant
rather prov'd sliding brother
merriment than vice
isabella o pardon lord oft falls out
have what would have speak not what mean
something do excuse thing hate
his advantage dearly love
angelo are all frail
isabella else let brother die
owe succeed thy weakness
angelo nay women are frail too
isabella ay as glasses where they view themselves
which are as easy broke as they make forms
women help heaven men their creation mar
profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
are soft as our complexions are
credulous false prints
angelo think well
since suppose are made no stronger
than faults may shake our frames let bold
do arrest words are
woman if more you're none
if one as are well express'd
by all external warrants show now
by putting destind livery
isabella have no tongue but one gentle lord
let intreat speak former language
isabella brother did love juliet
tell he shall die for't
angelo he shall not isabel if give love
isabella know virtue hath license int
which seems little fouler than
pluck others
angelo believe mine honour
words express purpose
isabella ha little honour much believ'd
will proclaim thee angelo look for't
sign present pardon brother
or an outstretch'd throat i'll tell world aloud
what man thou art
angelo who will believe thee isabel
unsoild name th' austereness life
vouch against place i' th' state
will so accusation overweigh
shall stifle own report
now give sensual race rein
fit thy consent sharp appetite
lay by all nicety prolixious blushes
banish what they sue redeem thy brother
by yielding up thy body will
or else he must not only die death
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
ling'ring sufferance answer morrow
or by affection now guides most
say what can false o'erweighs true exit
isabella whom should complain did tell this
who would believe o perilous mouths
bear them one self same tongue
either condemnation or approof
bidding law make curtsy their will
hooking both right wrong th' appetite
follow as draws i'll brother
though he hath falln by prompture blood
had he twenty heads tender down
twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up
before his sister should her body stoop
such abhorr'd pollution
then isabel live chaste brother die
more than our brother our chastity
i'll tell him yet angelo's request
fit his mind death his souls rest exit

thou dost fear soft tender fork
poor worm thy best rest sleep
thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st
thou exists many thousand grains
issue out dust happy thou art not
what thou hast not still thou striv'st get
what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain
thy complexion shifts strange effects
after moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor
an ass whose back ingots bows
thou bear'st thy heavy riches but journey
death unloads thee friend hast thou none
mere effusion thy proper loins
do curse gout serpigo rheum
ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
but as were an after dinner's sleep
dreaming both all thy blessed youth
becomes as aged doth beg alms
palsied eld when thou art old rich
thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
make thy riches pleasant what's yet this
lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death fear
makes these odds all even

isabella there spake brother there father's grave
did utter forth voice yes thou must die

antonio sooth know not why am so sad
wearies say wearies
but how caught found or came by
what stuff 'tis made whereof born
am learn
such want wit sadness makes
have much ado know myself
salerio mind tossing ocean
there where argosies portly sail
or as were pageants sea
do overpeer petty traffickers
curtsy them do them reverence
as they fly by them their woven wings
solanio believe sir had such venture forth
better part affections would
hopes abroad should still
plucking grass know where sits wind
peering maps ports piers roads
misfortune ventures out doubt
would make sad
salerio wind cooling broth
would blow an ague when thought
what harm wind too great might do at sea
should not see sandy hour glass run
but should think shallows flats
see wealthy andrew dock'd sand
vailing her high top lower than her ribs
see holy edifice stone
not bethink straight dangerous rocks
which touching but gentle vessels side
would scatter all her spices stream
enrobe roaring waters silks
word but even now worth this
now worth nothing shall have thought
think this shall lack thought
such thing bechanc'd would make sad
sad think upon his merchandise
antonio believe no thank fortune
ventures are not one bottom trusted
nor one place nor whole estate
upon fortune this present year
therefore merchandise makes not sad
solanio why then are love
antonio fie fie
solanio not love neither then let us say are sad
laugh leap say are merry
because are not sad now by two headed janus
nature hath fram'd strange fellows her time
some will evermore peep through their eyes
laugh parrots at bag piper
other such vinegar aspect
they'll not show their teeth way smile
though nestor swear jest laughable
enter bassanio lorenzo gratiano

leave now better company
salerio would have stay'd till had made merry

gratiano look not well signior antonio
have too much respect upon world
they lose do buy much care
antonio hold world but as world gratiano
stage where every man must play part
mine sad one
gratiano let play fool
mirth laughter let old wrinkles come
let liver rather heat wine
than heart cool mortifying groans
why should man whose blood warm within
sit his grandsire cut alabaster
by being peevish tell thee what antonio
love thee 'tis love speaks
there are sort men whose visages
do cream mantle standing pond
do wilful stillness entertain
purpose dress'd an opinion
wisdom gravity profound conceit
as who should say 'i am sir oracle
when ope lips let no dog bark'
therefore only are reputed wise
saying nothing when am very sure
if they should speak would almost damn those ears
which hearing them would call their brothers fools
i'll tell thee more this another time
but fish not this melancholy bait
this fool gudgeon this opinion
come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile
i'll end exhortation after dinner
must one these same dumb wise men
gratiano never lets speak
gratiano well keep company but two years moe
thou shalt not know sound thine own tongue
antonio fare well i'll grow talker this gear
gratiano thanks i' faith silence only commendable
neat's tongue dried maid not vendible

unburden all plots purposes

bassanio school days when had lost one shaft
shot his fellow self same flight
self same way more advised watch
find other forth by adventuring both
oft found both urge this childhood proof
owe much wilful youth
which owe lost but if please
shoot another arrow self way
which did shoot first do not doubt
as will watch aim or find both
or bring latter hazard back again
thankfully rest debtor first
antonio know well herein spend but time

then do but say what should do
knowledge may by done
am prest unto therefore speak
bassanio belmont lady richly left
she fair fairer than word
wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
did receive fair speechless messages
cato's daughter brutus' portia

four winds blow from every coast
renowned suitors her sunny locks

which makes her seat belmont colchos' strond
many jasons come quest her
o antonio had but means

belmont portia's house
portia pray tarry pause day or two
before hazard choosing wrong
lose company therefore forbear while
there's something tells but not love
would not lose know yourself
hate counsels not such quality
but lest should not understand well
yet maiden hath no tongue but thought
would detain here some month or two
how choose right but then am forsworn
so will never so may miss
but if do you'll make wish sin
had been forsworn beshrew eyes
they have o'erlook'd divided
one half yours other half yours
mine own would say but if mine then yours
so all yours o these naughty times
puts bars between owners their rights
let fortune go hell not
speak too long but 'tis peize time
eke draw out length
stay from election
bassanio let choose
as am live upon rack
portia upon rack bassanio then confess
what treason there mingled love
bassanio none but ugly treason mistrust
there may as well amity life
'tween snow fire as treason love
portia ay but fear speak upon rack
where men enforced do speak anything
bassanio promise life i'll confess truth
portia well then confess live
bassanio 'confess' 'love'
had been very sum confession
o happy torment when torturer
but let fortune caskets
portia away then am lock'd one them
if do love will find out
nerissa rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice
then if he lose he makes swan end
fading music comparison
may stand more proper eye shall stream
wat'ry death bed him he may win
even as flourish when true subjects bow
new crowned monarch such
as are those dulcet sounds break day
creep into dreaming bridegroom's ear
summon him marriage now he goes
no less presence but much more love
than young alcides when he did redeem
virgin tribute paid by howling troy
sea monster stand sacrifice
bleared visages come forth view
issue th' exploit go hercules
live thou live much much more dismay
view fight than thou mak'st fray
song
whilst bassanio comments caskets himself
tell where fancy bred
or heart or head
how begot how nourished
engend'red eyes
gazing fed fancy dies
cradle where lies
let us all ring fancy's knell
i'll begin ding dong bell
all ding dong bell
bassanio so may outward shows least themselves
world still deceiv'd ornament
law what plea so tainted corrupt
obscures show evil religion
what damned error but some sober brow
will bless approve text
hiding grossness fair ornament
there no vice so simple but assumes
some mark virtue his outward parts
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
as stairs sand wear yet upon their chins
beards hercules frowning mars
these assume but valour's excrement
render them redoubted look beauty
shall see 'tis purchas'd by weight
which therein works miracle nature
making them lightest wear most
so are those crisped snaky golden locks
which make such wanton gambols wind
upon supposed fairness often known
dowry second head
thus ornament but guiled shore
most dangerous sea beauteous scarf
veiling an indian beauty word
seeming truth which cunning times put
entrap wisest therefore thou gaudy gold
hard food midas will none thee
nor none thee thou pale common drudge
'tween man man but thou thou meagre lead
which rather threatenst than dost promise aught
here choose joy consequence
portia aside how all other passions fleet air
as doubtful thoughts rash embrac'd despair
shudd'ring fear green ey'd jealousy
o love moderate allay thy ecstasy
measure rain thy joy scant this excess
feel too much thy blessing make less
fear surfeit
bassanio opening leaden casket what find here
hath come so near creation move these eyes
or whether riding balls mine
seem they motion here are sever'd lips
parted sugar breath so sweet bar
should sunder such sweet friends here her hairs
painter plays spider hath woven
golden mesh t' entrap hearts men
faster than gnats cobwebs but her eyes
how could he see do them having made one
leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
substance praise doth wrong this shadow
underprizing so far this shadow
doth limp behind substance here's scroll
continent summary fortune
'you choose not by view
chance as fair choose as true
since this fortune falls
content seek no new
hold fortune bliss
turn where lady
claim her loving kiss'
gentle scroll fair lady by leave
come by note give receive
one two contending prize
thinks he hath done well people's eyes
hearing applause universal shout
giddy spirit still gazing doubt
so thrice fair lady stand even so
as doubtful whether what see true
until confirm'd signd ratified by
portia see lord bassanio where stand
such as am though myself alone
would not ambitious wish
wish myself much better yet
would trebled twenty times myself
thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
might virtues beauties livings friends
exceed account but full sum
sum something which term gross
an unlessond girl unschoold unpractis'd
happy this she not yet so old
but she may learn happier than this
she not bred so dull but she can learn
happiest all her gentle spirit
commits itself yours directed
myself what mine yours
now converted but now was lord
this fair mansion master servants
queen o'er myself even now but now
this house these servants this same myself
are yours lord's give them this ring
which when part from lose or give away
let presage ruin love
vantage exclaim
only blood speaks veins
there such confusion powers
as after some oration fairly spoke
by beloved prince there doth appear
among buzzing pleased multitude
where every something being blent together
turns wild nothing save joy
express'd not express'd but when this ring
parts from this finger then parts life from hence
nerissa lord lady now our time
have stood by seen our wishes prosper
cry 'good joy' good joy lord lady
gratiano lord bassanio gentle lady
wish all joy can wish
am sure can wish none from
when honours mean solemnize
bargain faith do beseech

gratiano thank lordship have got one
eyes lord can look as swift as yours

sweetest touches pierce mistress' ear

jessica am never merry when hear sweet music
lorenzo reason spirits are attentive
do but note wild wanton herd
or race youthful unhandled colts
which hot condition their blood
if they but hear perchance trumpet sound
or any air music touch their ears
shall perceive them make mutual stand
their savage eyes turnd modest gaze
by sweet power music therefore poet
did feign orpheus drew trees stones floods
since nought so stockish hard full rage
but music time doth change his nature
nor not mov'd concord sweet sounds
fit treasons stratagems spoils
motions his spirit are dullas night
his affections dark as erebus
let no such man trusted mark music
enter portia nerissa
portia light see burning hall
how far little candle throws his beams

substitute shines brightly as king
until king by then his state
empties itself as doth an inland brook
into main waters music hark
nerissa music madam house
portia nothing good see without respect
methinks sounds much sweeter than by day
nerissa silence bestows virtue madam
when neither attended think
ne nightingale if she should sing by day
when every goose cackling would thought
no better musician than wren

their right praise true perfection
peace ho moon sleeps endymion

other must held worthier
hermia would father look'd but eyes
hermia do entreat grace pardon

against our nuptial confer
something nearly concerns yourselves
exeunt all but lysander hermia
lysander how now love why cheek so pale
how chance roses there do fade so fast
hermia belike want rain which could well
beteem them from tempest eyes
lysander ay aught could ever read
could ever hear by tale or history
course true love never did run smooth
but either was different blood
lysander or else misgraffed respect years
hermia o spite too old engag'd young
lysander or else stood upon choice friends
hermia o hell choose love by another's eyes
lysander or if there were sympathy choice
war death or sickness did lay siege
making momentary as sound
swift as shadow short as any dream
brief as lightning collied night
ere man hath power say 'behold'
jaws darkness do devour up
so quick bright things come confusion
hermia if then true lovers have ever cross'd
stands as an edict destiny
then let us teach our trial patience
because customary cross
as due love as thoughts dreams sighs
wishes tears poor fancy's followers
have widow aunt dowager
great revenue she hath no child
from athens her house remote seven leagues
she respects as her only son
there gentle hermia may marry thee
place sharp athenian law
cannot pursue us if thou lovest then
steal forth thy father's house morrow night
wood league without town
do observance morn may
there will stay thee
hermia good lysander
swear thee by cupid's strongest bow
by his best arrow golden head
by simplicity venus' doves
by which knitteth souls prospers loves
by fire which burnd carthage queen
when false troyan under sail was seen
number more than ever women spoke
same place thou hast appointed
morrow truly will meet thee
lysander keep promise love look here comes helena
enter helena
hermia god speed fair helena whither away
helena call fair fair again unsay
demetrius loves fair o happy fair
eyes are lode stars tongue's sweet air
when wheat green when hawthorn buds appear
sickness catching o were favour so
yours would catch fair hermia ere go
ear should catch voice eye eye
tongue should catch tongue's sweet melody
were world mine demetrius being bated
rest i'd give translated
o teach how look what art
sway motion demetrius' heart
helena o frowns would teach smiles such skill
hermia give him curses yet he gives love
helena o prayers could such affection move
hermia more hate more he follows
helena more love more he hateth
hermia his folly helena no fault mine
helena none but beauty would fault were mine
hermia take comfort he no more shall see face
lysander myself will fly this place
seem'd athens as paradise
o then what graces love do dwell
he hath turnd heaven unto hell
lysander helen our minds will unfold
morrow night when phoebe doth behold
her silver visage wat'ry glass
decking liquid pearl bladed grass
time lovers' flights doth still conceal
through athens' gates have devis'd steal
upon faint primrose beds were wont lie
emptying our bosoms their counsel sweet
there lysander myself shall meet
thence from athens turn away our eyes
seek new friends stranger companies
farewell sweet playfellow pray thou us
good luck grant thee thy demetrius
keep word lysander must starve our sight
from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight
as him demetrius dote exit
helena how happy some o'er other some can
through athens am thought as fair as she
but what demetrius thinks not so
he will not know what all but he do know
as he errs doting hermia's eyes
so admiring his qualities
things base vile holding no quantity
love can transpose form dignity
therefore wing'd cupid painted blind
nor hath love's mind any judgment taste
wings no eyes figure unheedy haste
therefore love said child
because choice he so oft beguild
as waggish boys game themselves forswear
so boy love perjur'd everywhere
ere demetrius look'd hermia's eyne
he haild down oaths he was only mine
so he dissolv'd show'rs oaths did melt
will go tell him fair hermia's flight
then wood will he morrow night
pursue her this intelligence
if have thanks dear expense
but herein mean enrich pain
have his sight thither back again exit

act ii scene
wood near athens
enter fairy at one door puck at another
puck how now spirit whither wander
fairy over hill over dale
thorough bush thorough brier
over park over pale
thorough flood thorough fire
do wander every where
serve fairy queen
dew her orbs upon green
cowslips tall her pensioners
their gold coats spots see
those rubies fairy favours
those freckles live their savours
must go seek some dewdrops here
hang pearl every cowslip's ear
farewell thou lob spirits i'll gone
puck king doth keep his revels here night
take heed queen come not within his sight
oberon passing fell wrath
because she as her attendant hath
lovely boy stolen from an indian king
she never had so sweet changeling
jealous oberon would have child
knight his train trace forests wild
but she perforce withholds loved boy
now they never meet grove or green
by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
but they do square all their elves fear
creep into acorn cups hide them there
fairy either mistake shape making quite
or else are shrewd knavish sprite
calld robin goodfellow are not he
frights maidens villagery
skim milk sometimes labour quern
sometime make drink bear no barm
mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm
those hobgoblin call sweet puck
do their work they shall have good luck
are not he
puck thou speakest aright
am merry wanderer night
jest oberon make him smile
when fat bean fed horse beguile
sometime lurk gossip's bowl
very likeness roasted crab
when she drinks against her lips bob
her withered dewlap pour ale
wisest aunt telling saddest tale
sometime three foot stool mistaketh
then slip from her bum down topples she
'tailor' cries falls into cough
then whole quire hold their hips laugh
merrier hour was never wasted there
but room fairy here comes oberon
fairy here mistress would he were gone
enter oberon at one door his train titania
at another hers
oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania
titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
have forsworn his bed company
oberon tarry rash wanton am not thy lord
when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
shape corin sat all day
playing pipes corn versing love
amorous phillida why art thou here
come from farthest steep india
but forsooth bouncing amazon
buskind mistress warrior love
theseus must wedded come
give their bed joy prosperity
glance at credit hippolyta
knowing know thy love theseus
didst not thou lead him through glimmering night
from perigouna whom he ravished
make him fair aegles break his faith
ariadne antiopa
titania these are forgeries jealousy
never since middle summer's spring
met hill dale forest or mead
or beached margent sea
dance our ringlets whistling wind
but thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
therefore winds piping us vain
as revenge have suck'd up from sea
contagious fogs which falling land
hath every pelting river made so proud
they have overborne their continents
ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke vain
hath rotted ere his youth attaind beard
fold stands empty drowned field
crows are fatted murrion flock
nine mens morris filld up mud
quaint mazes wanton green
lack tread are undistinguishable
human mortals want their winter here
no night now hymn or carol blest
therefore moon governess floods
rheumatic diseases do abound
thorough this distemperature see
seasons alter hoary headed frosts
fall fresh lap crimson rose
old hiems' thin icy crown
an odorous chaplet sweet summer buds
as mockery set spring summer
childing autumn angry winter change
their wonted liveries mazed world
this same progeny evils comes
from our debate from our dissension
are their parents original
oberon do amend then lies
why should titania cross her oberon
do but beg little changeling boy
henchman
titania set heart at rest
fairy land buys not child
spiced indian air by night
full often hath she gossip'd by side
sat neptune's yellow sands
marking th' embarked traders flood
when have laugh'd see sails conceive
grow big bellied wanton wind
which she pretty swimming gait
following her womb then rich young squire
would imitate sail upon land
as from voyage rich merchandise
but she being mortal boy did die
her sake do rear up her boy
her sake will not part him
oberon how long within this wood intend stay
titania perchance till after theseus' wedding day
if will patiently dance our round
see our moonlight revels go us
if not shun will spare haunts
titania not thy fairy kingdom fairies away
shall chide downright if longer stay
exit titania her train
oberon well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
till torment thee this injury
gentle puck come hither thou rememb'rest
since once sat upon promontory
heard mermaid dolphins back
uttering such dulcet harmonious breath
certain stars shot madly from their spheres
hear sea maid's music
puck remember
oberon very time saw but thou couldst not
flying between cold moon earth
cupid all arm'd certain aim he took
at fair vestal throned by west
loos'd his love shaft smartly from his bow
as should pierce hundred thousand hearts
quench'd chaste beams wat'ry moon
imperial vot'ress passed
maiden meditation fancy free
yet mark'd where bolt cupid fell
fell upon little western flower
before milk white now purple love's wound
maidens call love idleness
fetch flow'r herb showed thee once
juice sleeping eyelids laid
upon next live creature sees
fetch this herb thou here again
ere leviathan can swim league
puck i'll put girdle round about earth
forty minutes exit puck
oberon having once this juice
i'll watch titania when she asleep
drop liquor her eyes
next thing then she waking looks upon
meddling monkey or busy ape
she shall pursue soul love
ere take this charm from off her sight
as can take another herb
i'll make her render up her page
but who comes here am invisible
will overhear their conference
enter demetrius helena following him
demetrius love thee not therefore pursue not
one i'll slay other slayeth
thou told'st they were stoln unto this wood
here am wood within this wood
because cannot meet hermia
hence get thee gone follow no more
helena draw hard hearted adamant
but yet draw not iron heart
true as steel leave power draw

or rather do not plainest truth
tell do not nor cannot love
helena even do love more
am spaniel demetrius
more beat will fawn
use but as spaniel spurn strike
neglect lose only give leave
unworthy as am follow
what worser place can beg love
than used as use dog
demetrius tempt not too much hatred spirit
am sick when do look thee
helena am sick when look not
demetrius do impeach modesty too much
leave city commit yourself
into hands one loves not
trust opportunity night
ill counsel desert place
helena virtue privilege
not night when do see face
therefore think am not night
nor doth this wood lack worlds company
respect are all world
then how can said am alone
when all world here look
demetrius i'll run from thee hide brakes
leave thee mercy wild beasts
run when will story shall chang'd
apollo flies daphne holds chase
dove pursues griffin mild hind
makes speed catch tiger bootless speed
when cowardice pursues valour flies
demetrius will not stay thy questions let go
or if thou follow do not believe
but shall do thee mischief wood
helena ay temple town field
wrongs do set scandal sex
cannot fight love as men may do
should woo'd were not made woo
exit demetrius
i'll follow thee make heaven hell
die upon hand love so well exit helena
oberon fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
thou shalt fly him he shall seek thy love
re enter puck
puck ay there
oberon pray thee give
know bank where wild thyme blows
where oxlips nodding violet grows
quite over canopied luscious woodbine
sweet musk roses eglantine

there snake throws her enamelld skin
juice this i'll streak her eyes
make her full hateful fantasies
take thou some seek through this grove
sweet athenian lady love
disdainful youth anoint his eyes
but do when next thing he espies
may lady thou shalt know man
by athenian garments he hath
effect some care he may prove
look thou meet ere first cock crow

lysander one turf shall serve as pillow us both
hermia nay good lysander sake dear
lie further off yet do not lie so near
lysander o take sense sweet innocence
love takes meaning love's conference
mean heart unto yours knit
so but one heart can make
two bosoms interchained an oath
so then two bosoms single troth
then by side no bed room deny
hermia lysander riddles very prettily
now much beshrew manners pride
if hermia meant say lysander lied
but gentle friend love courtesy
lie further off human modesty
such separation as may well said
becomes virtuous bachelor maid
so far distant good night sweet friend
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
then end life when end loyalty
here bed sleep give thee all his rest
hermia half wish wisher's eyes press'd
they sleep
enter puck
puck through forest have gone
but athenian found none
whose eyes might approve
this flower's force stirring love
weeds athens he doth wear
this he master said
despised athenian maid

pretty soul she durst not lie
near this lack love this kill courtesy
churl upon thy eyes throw
all power this charm doth owe
sleep his seat thy eyelid
so awake when am gone

helena do not say so lysander say not so
yet hermia still loves then content
lysander content hermia no do repent
tedious minutes her have spent

who will not change raven dove
will man by his reason sway'd
reason says are worthier maid
things growing are not ripe until their season
so being young till now ripe not reason
reason becomes marshal will
leads eyes where o'erlook
love's stories written love's richest book
helena wherefore was this keen mockery born
when at hands did deserve this scorn
is't not enough is't not enough young man
did never no nor never can
deserve sweet look from demetrius' eye
but must flout insufficiency
such disdainful manner woo
but fare well perforce must confess
thought lord more true gentleness
o lady one man refus'd
should another therefore abus'd exit
lysander she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there

oberon wonder if titania awak'd
then what was next came her eye
which she must dote extremity
enter puck
here comes messenger how now mad spirit
what night rule now about this haunted grove
puck mistress monster love
while she was her dull sleeping hour
crew patches rude mechanicals
work bread upon athenian stalls
were met together rehearse play
intended great theseus' nuptial day
shallowest thickskin barren sort
who pyramus presented their sport
forsook his scene ent'red brake
when did him at this advantage take
anon his thisby must answered
forth mimic comes when they him spy
as wild geese creeping fowler eye
or russet pated choughs many sort
rising cawing at guns report
sever themselves madly sweep sky
so at his sight away his fellows fly
at our stamp here o'er o'er one falls
he murder cries help from athens calls
made senseless things begin do them wrong
briers thorns at their apparel snatch
some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
led them this distracted fear
left sweet pyramus translated there
when moment so came pass
titania wak'd straightway lov'd an ass
oberon this falls out better than could devise
but hast thou yet latch'd athenians eyes
puck took him sleeping finish'd too
athenian woman by his side
when he wak'd force she must ey'd
enter demetrius hermia
oberon stand close this same athenian
puck this woman but not this man
demetrius o why rebuke him loves so
lay breath so bitter bitter foe
hermia now but chide but should use thee worse
if thou hast slain lysander his sleep
being o'er shoes blood plunge deep
kill too
sun was not so true unto day
as he would he have stolen away
from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon
this whole earth may bor'd moon
may through centre creep so displease
her brother's noontide th' antipodes
so should murderer look so dead so grim
demetrius so should murdered look so should
pierc'd through heart stern cruelty
yet murderer look as bright as clear
as yonder venus her glimmering sphere
hermia what's this lysander where he
ah good demetrius wilt thou give him
demetrius had rather give his carcass hounds
hermia out dog out cur thou driv'st past bounds
henceforth never numb'red among men
o once tell true tell true even sake
durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
hast thou killd him sleeping o brave touch
could not worm an adder do so much
an adder did doubler tongue
than thine thou serpent never adder stung
demetrius spend passion mispris'd mood
am not guilty lysander's blood
hermia pray thee tell then he well
demetrius an if could what should get therefore
hermia privilege never see more
from thy hated presence part so
see no more whether he dead or no exit
demetrius there no following her this fierce vein
here therefore while will remain
so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
debt bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
if his tender here make some stay lies down
oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
laid love juice some true love's sight
thy misprision must perforce ensue
some true love turnd not false turnd true
puck then fate o'er rules one man holding troth
million fail confounding oath oath
oberon about wood go swifter than wind
helena athens look thou find
sighs love costs fresh blood dear
by some illusion see thou bring her here
i'll charm his eyes against she do appear
puck go go look how go
swifter than arrow from tartar's bow exit
oberon flower this purple dye
hit cupid's archery
sink apple his eye
when his love he doth espy
as venus sky
when thou wak'st if she by
beg her remedy
re enter puck
puck captain our fairy band
helena here at hand
youth mistook by
pleading lover's fee
shall their fond pageant see
oberon stand aside noise they make
will cause demetrius awake
puck then will two at once woo one
must needs sport alone
those things do best please
befall prepost'rously
enter lysander helena
lysander why should think should woo scorn
scorn derision never come tears
their nativity all truth appears
how can these things seem scorn
bearing badge faith prove them true
helena do advance cunning more more
when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray
these vows are hermia's will give her o'er
weigh oath oath will nothing weigh
vows her put two scales
will even weigh both as light as tales
helena nor none mind now give her o'er
lysander demetrius loves her he loves not
demetrius awaking o helen goddess nymph perfect divine
what love shall compare thine eyne
crystal muddy o how ripe show
thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
pure congealed white high taurus' snow
fannd eastern wind turns crow
when thou hold'st up thy hand o let kiss
helena o spite o hell see all are bent
set against merriment
if were civil knew courtesy
would not do thus much injury
can not hate as know do
but must join souls mock too
if were men as men are show
would not use gentle lady so
vow swear superpraise parts
both are rivals love hermia
now both rivals mock helena
trim exploit manly enterprise
conjure tears up poor maid's eyes
derision none noble sort
would so offend virgin extort
poor souls patience all make sport
lysander are unkind demetrius not so
love hermia this know know
hermia's love yield up part
yours helena bequeath
whom do love will do till death
helena never did mockers waste more idle breath
demetrius lysander keep thy hermia will none
if e'er lov'd her all love gone
heart her but as guest wise sojournd
now helen home returnd
there remain
demetrius disparage not faith thou dost not know
lest thy peril thou aby dear
look where thy love comes yonder thy dear
enter hermia
hermia dark night from eye his function takes
ear more quick apprehension makes
wherein doth impair seeing sense
pays hearing double recompense
thou art not by mine eye lysander found
but why unkindly didst thou leave so
lysander why should he stay whom love doth press go
hermia what love could press lysander from side
lysander lysander's love would not let him bide
fair helena who more engilds night
than all yon fiery oes eyes light
why seek'st thou could not this make thee know
hate bare thee made leave thee so
hermia speak not as think cannot
now perceive they have conjoind all three
fashion this false sport spite
injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
have conspir'd have these contriv'd
bait this foul derision
all counsel two have shar'd
sisters' vows hours have spent
when have chid hasty footed time
parting us o all forgot
hermia two artificial gods
have our needles created both one flower
both one sampler sitting one cushion
both warbling one song both one key
as if our hands our sides voices minds
had been incorporate so grew together
double cherry seeming parted
but yet an union partition
two lovely berries moulded one stern
two first coats heraldry
due but one crowned one crest
will rent our ancient love asunder
join men scorning poor friend
not friendly 'tis not maidenly
our sex as well as may chide
though alone do feel injury
hermia am amazed at passionate words
scorn not seems scorn
follow praise eyes face
made other love demetrius
who even but now did spurn his foot
call goddess nymph divine rare
precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
her he hates wherefore doth lysander
deny love so rich within his soul
tender forsooth affection
but by setting by consent
so hung upon love so fortunate
but miserable most love unlov'd
this should pity rather than despise
hermia understand not what mean by this
helena ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
make mouths upon when turn back
wink each at other hold sweet jest up
this sport well carried shall chronicled
if have any pity grace or manners
but fare ye well 'tis partly own fault
which death or absence soon shall remedy
lysander stay gentle helena hear excuse
love life soul fair helena
helena o excellent
hermia sweet do not scorn her so
demetrius if she cannot entreat can compel
lysander thou canst compel no more than she entreat
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
swear by which will lose thee
prove him false says love thee not
demetrius say love thee more than he can do
lysander if thou say so withdraw prove too
demetrius quick come
hermia lysander whereto tends all this
lysander away ethiope
demetrius no no he will
seem break loose take as would follow
lysander hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
or will shake thee from serpent
hermia why are grown so rude what change this
sweet love
lysander thy love out tawny tartar out
out loathed med'cine o hated potion hence
hermia do not jest
helena yes sooth so do
lysander demetrius will keep word thee
weak bond holds i'll not trust word
lysander what should hurt her strike her kill her dead
although hate her i'll not harm her so
hermia what can do greater harm than hate
hate wherefore o what news love
am not hermia are not lysander
am as fair now as was erewhile
since night lov'd yet since night left
why then left o gods forbid
lysander ay by life
never did desire see thee more
therefore out hope question doubt
certain nothing truer 'tis no jest
do hate thee love helena
hermia o juggler cankerblossom
thief love what have come by night
stoln love's heart from him
helena fine i' faith
no touch bashfulness what will tear
impatient answers from gentle tongue
fie fie counterfeit puppet
hermia 'puppet' why so ay way goes game
now perceive she hath made compare
between our statures she hath urg'd her height
her personage her tall personage
her height forsooth she hath prevaild him
are grown so high his esteem
how low am thou painted maypole speak
how low am am not yet so low
but nails can reach unto thine eyes
helena pray though mock gentlemen
let her not hurt was never curst
have no gift at all shrewishness
am right maid cowardice
let her not strike perhaps may think
because she something lower than myself
hermia 'lower' hark again
helena good hermia do not so bitter
evermore did love hermia
did ever keep counsels never wrong'd
save love unto demetrius
told him stealth unto this wood
he followed love followed him
but he hath chid hence threat'ned
strike spurn nay kill too
athens will bear folly back
follow no further let go
see how simple how fond am
hermia why get gone who is't hinders
helena foolish heart leave here behind
hermia what lysander
helena demetrius
lysander not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
demetrius no sir she shall not though take her part
she was vixen when she went school
though she but little she fierce
hermia 'little' again nothing but 'low' 'little'
why will suffer her flout thus
let come her
lysander get gone dwarf
minimus hind'ring knot grass made
bead acorn
demetrius are too officious
let her alone speak not helena
take not her part if thou dost intend
never so little show love her

lysander now she holds not
now follow if thou dar'st try whose right
thine or mine most helena
demetrius follow nay i'll go thee cheek by jowl
exeunt lysander demetrius

helena will not trust
nor longer stay curst company
hands than mine are quicker fray
legs are longer though run away exit
hermia am amaz'd know not what say exit
oberon this thy negligence still thou mistak'st
or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
puck believe king shadows mistook
by athenian garments he had
so far blameless proves enterprise
have 'nointed an athenians eyes
so far am glad so did sort
as this their jangling esteem sport
oberon thou seest these lovers seek place fight
hie therefore robin overcast night
starry welkin cover thou anon
drooping fog as black as acheron
as one come not within another's way
lysander sometime frame thy tongue
then stir demetrius up bitter wrong
sometime rail thou demetrius
from each other look thou lead them thus
till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep
leaden legs batty wings doth creep
then crush this herb into lysander's eye
whose liquor hath this virtuous property
make his eyeballs roll wonted sight
when they next wake all this derision
shall seem dream fruitless vision
back athens shall lovers wend
league whose date till death shall never end
whiles this affair do thee employ
i'll queen beg her indian boy
then will her charmed eye release
from monster's view all things shall peace
night's swift dragons cut clouds full fast
yonder shines aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wand'ring here there
troop home churchyards damned spirits all
cross ways floods have burial
already their wormy beds are gone
fear lest day should look their shames upon
they wilfully themselves exild from light
must aye consort black brow'd night
morning's love have oft made sport
forester groves may tread
even till eastern gate all fiery red
opening neptune fair blessed beams
turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
but notwithstanding haste make no delay
may effect this business yet ere day exit oberon

these antique fables nor these fairy toys
lovers madmen have such seething brains
such shaping fantasies apprehend
lunatic lover poet
are imagination all compact
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
madman lover all as frantic
sees helens beauty brow egypt
poet's eye fine frenzy rolling
doth glance from heaven earth from earth heaven
as imagination bodies forth
forms things unknown poet's pen
local habitation name
such tricks hath strong imagination
if would but apprehend some joy
comprehends some bringer joy
or night imagining some fear
how easy bush suppos'd bear
hippolyta but all story night told over

more witnesseth than fancy's images

enter lysander demetrius hermia helena
theseus here come lovers full joy mirth

philostrate here mighty theseus
theseus say what abridgment have this evening
what masque what music how shall beguile
lazy time if not some delight
philostrate there brief how many sports are ripe
giving paper
theseus 'the battle centaurs sung
by an athenian eunuch harp'
we'll none have told love
glory kinsman hercules
'the riot tipsy bacchanals
tearing thracian singer their rage'
an old device was play'd
when from thebes came last conqueror
learning late deceas'd beggary'
some satire keen critical
not sorting nuptial ceremony
'a tedious brief scene young pyramus
his love thisby very tragical mirth'
merry tragical tedious brief
hot ice wondrous strange snow
how shall find concord this discord
philostrate play there lord some ten words long
but by ten words lord too long
which makes tedious all play
there not one word apt one player fitted
tragical noble lord
pyramus therein doth kill himself
which when saw rehears'd must confess
made mine eyes water but more merry tears
passion loud laughter never shed
theseus what are they do play
which never labour'd their minds till now
now have toild their unbreathed memories
this same play against nuptial
theseus will hear
philostrate no noble lord
not have heard over

unless can find sport their intents
extremely stretch'd connd cruel pain

takes might not merit
where have come great clerks have purposed
greet premeditated welcomes
where have seen them shiver look pale
make periods midst sentences
throttle their practis'd accent their fears
conclusion dumbly have broke off

saucy audacious eloquence
love therefore tongue tied simplicity

but wonder till truth make all things plain
this man pyramus if would know
this beauteous lady thisby certain
this man lime rough cast doth present
wall vile wall which did these lovers sunder
through walls chink poor souls they are content
whisper at which let no man wonder
this man lanthorn dog bush thorn
by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
meet at ninus' tomb there there woo
this grisly beast which lion hight by name
trusty thisby coming first by night
did scare away or rather did affright
as she fled her mantle she did fall
which lion vile bloody mouth did stain
anon comes pyramus sweet youth tall
finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain

how wise how noble young how rarely featur'd
but she would spell him backward if fair fac'd
she would swear gentleman should her sister
if black why nature drawing an antic
if low an agate very vilely cut
if speaking why vane blown all winds
if silent why block moved none
so turns she every man wrong side out
never gives truth virtue
which simpleness merit purchaseth
urs sure sure such carping not commendable
hero no not so odd from all fashions
as beatrice cannot commendable
she would mock into air o she would laugh
out myself press death wit
therefore let benedick cover'd fire
consume away sighs waste inwardly
were better death than die mocks
which as bad as die tickling
urs yet tell her hear what she will say
hero no rather will go benedick
counsel him fight against his passion
stain cousin one doth not know
how much an ill word may empoison liking
urs o do not do cousin such wrong
she cannot so much without true judgment
having so swift excellent wit
as she priz'd have as refuse
so rare gentleman as signior benedick
hero he only man italy
always excepted dear claudio
speaking fancy signior benedick
shape bearing argument valour
goes foremost report through italy
hero indeed he hath an excellent good name
urs his excellence did earn ere he had
when are married madam
hero why every day morrow come go
i'll show thee some attires have thy counsel
which best furnish morrow
urs she's lim'd warrant have caught her madam
hero if prove so then loving goes by haps

exeunt hero ursula
beatrice advances from arbour
beat what fire mine ears can this true
stand condemnd pride scorn so much
contempt farewell maiden pride adieu
no glory lives behind back such
taming wild heart thy loving hand

myself would rearward reproaches
strike at thy life griev'd had but one
child at frugal nature's frame
why ever wast thou lovely eyes
why had not charitable hand
took up beggar's issue at gates

wash'd tears hence from her let her die
friar hear little
have only been silent so long
given way unto this course fortune
thousand blushing apparitions
start into her face thousand innocent shames
angel whiteness beat away those blushes
her eye there hath appear'd fire
burn errors these princes hold

trust not reading nor observation
which experimental seal doth warrant
tenure book trust not age
if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here

proudest them shall well hear
time hath not yet so dried this blood mine
nor age so eat up invention
nor fortune made such havoc means
nor bad life reft so much friends
both strength limb policy mind
ability means choice friends
quit them throughly
friar pause awhile
let counsel sway this case
daughter here princes left dead
let her awhile secretly kept
publish she dead indeed
maintain mourning ostentation
hang mournful epitaphs do all rites
appertain unto burial
leon what shall become this what will this do
friar marry this well carried shall her behalf
change slander remorse some good
but not dream this strange course
but this travail look greater birth
she dying as must so maintaind
upon instant she was accus'd
every hearer so falls out
what have prize not worth
whiles enjoy but being lack'd lost
why then rack value then find
virtue possession would not show us
whiles was ours so will fare claudio
when he shall hear she died upon his words
th' idea her life shall sweetly creep
into his study imagination
shall come apparelld more precious habit
more moving delicate full life
into eye prospect his soul
than when she liv'd indeed then shall he mourn
if ever love had interest his liver
wish he had not so accused her
no though thought his accusation true
let this so doubt not but success
will fashion event better shape
but if all aim but this levelld false
supposition lady's death
will quench wonder her infamy
if sort not well may conceal her
as best befits her wounded reputation
some reclusive religious life

patch grief proverbs make misfortune drunk
candle wasters bring him yet
him will gather patience

their counsel turns passion which before
would give preceptial medicine rage
fetter strong madness silken thread

iago despise if do not three great ones city

one michael cassio florentine
fellow almost damnd fair wife

christian heathen must belee'd calm'd
by debitor creditor this counter caster
god bless mark his moorship's ancient
roderigo by heaven rather would have been his hangman
iago why there's no remedy 'tis curse service

throwing but shows service their lords
do well thrive by them when they have lined their coats
do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
such one do profess myself

following him follow but myself
heaven judge not love duty
when outward action doth demonstrate

roderigo what full fortune does thick lips owe
if he can carry't thus
iago call up her father
rouse him make after him poison his delight
though he fertile climate dwell

if such actions may have passage free
bond slaves pagans shall our statesmen exeunt

officers attending
duke there no composition these news

first senator indeed they are disproportiond
letters say hundred seven galleys

so was bid report here state
by signior angelo
duke how say by this change
first senator this cannot
by no assay reason 'tis pageant
keep us false gaze when consider
importancy cyprus turk
let ourselves again but understand
so may he more facile question bear
stands not such warlike brace
but altogether lacks abilities
rhodes dress'd if make thought this
must not think turk so unskillful
leave latest which concerns him first
neglecting an attempt ease gain
wake wage danger profitless
duke nay all confidence he's not rhodes
enter messenger
messenger ottomites reverend gracious
steering due course toward isle rhodes
have there injointed them an after fleet
first senator ay so thought how many as guess
messenger thirty sail now they do re stem
their backward course bearing frank appearance
their purposes toward cyprus signior montano
trusty most valiant servitor
prays believe him

first senator here comes brabantio valiant moor
enter brabantio othello iago roderigo officers
duke valiant othello must straight employ
against general enemy ottoman
lack'd counsel help tonight
brabantio so did yours good grace pardon
neither place nor aught heard business
hath raised from bed nor doth general care
take hold particular grief
so flood gate o'erbearing nature
engluts swallows other sorrows
still itself
duke why what's matter
all dead
brabantio ay
she abused stoln from corrupted
by spells medicines bought mountebanks
nature so preposterously err
being not deficient blind or lame sense
sans witchcraft could not
duke whoe'er he this foul proceeding
hath thus beguiled daughter herself
shall yourself read bitter letter
after own sense yea though our proper son
stood action
brabantio humbly thank grace
here man this moor whom now seems
special mandate state affairs
hath hither brought
all are very sorry for't
duke othello what own part can say this
othello most potent grave reverend signiors
very noble approved good masters
have ta'en away this old mans daughter
most true true have married her
very head front offending
hath this extent no more rude am speech
little blest soft phrase peace
since these arms mine had seven years' pith
till now some nine moons wasted they have used
little this great world can speak
more than pertains feats broil battle
therefore little shall grace cause
speaking myself yet by gracious patience
will round unvarnish'd tale deliver
whole course love what drugs what charms
what conjuration what mighty magic
such proceeding am charged withal
won his daughter
spirit so still quiet her motion
blush'd at herself she spite nature
years country credit everything
fall love what she fear'd look
judgement maim'd most imperfect
will confess perfection so could err
against all rules nature must driven
find out practices cunning hell
why this should therefore vouch again
or some dram conjured this effect
he wrought upon her
duke vouch this no proof
without more certain more overt test
than these thin habits poor likelihoods
modern seeming do prefer against him
first senator but othello speak
did by indirect forced courses
subdue poison this young maid's affections
as soul soul affordeth
othello do beseech
send lady sagittary
let her speak before her father
if do find foul her report
trust office do hold
not only take away but let sentence
even fall upon life
duke fetch desdemona hither
exeunt iago attendants
till she come as truly as heaven
do confess vices blood
so justly grave ears i'll present
how did thrive this fair lady's love
she mine
duke say othello
othello her father loved oft invited
still questiond story life
have pass'd
ran through even from boyish days
very moment he bade tell
wherein spake most disastrous chances
moving accidents by flood field
hair breadth 'scapes i' imminent deadly breach
being taken by insolent foe
sold slavery redemption thence
portance travels' history
rough quarries rocks hills whose heads touch heaven
was hint speak such was process
cannibals each other eat
anthropophagi men whose heads
do grow beneath their shoulders this hear
would desdemona seriously incline
but still house affairs would draw her thence
which ever as she could haste dispatch
she'ld come again greedy ear
took once pliant hour found good means
draw from her prayer earnest heart
would all pilgrimage dilate
whereof by parcels she had something heard
but not intentively did consent
often did beguile her her tears
when did speak some distressful stroke
youth suffer'd story being done
she gave pains world sighs
'twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful
she wish'd she had not heard yet she wish'd
heaven had made her such man she thank'd
bade if had friend loved her
should but teach him how tell story
would woo her upon this hint spake
she loved dangers had pass'd
loved her she did pity them
this only witchcraft have used
enter desdemona iago attendants
duke think this tale would win daughter too
good brabantio
take up this mangled matter at best
men do their broken weapons rather use
than their bare hands
brabantio pray hear her speak
if she confess she was half wooer
destruction head if bad blame
do perceive all this noble company
where most owe obedience
desdemona noble father
do perceive here divided duty
am bound life education
life education both do learn
how respect are lord duty
am hitherto daughter but here's husband
so much duty as mother show'd
so much challenge may profess
due moor lord
brabantio god have done
please grace state affairs
had rather adopt child than get
come hither moor
here do give thee all heart
which but thou hast already all heart
would keep from thee sake jewel

duke let speak yourself lay sentence
which as grise or step may help these lovers
into favor
when remedies are past griefs are ended

robb'd smiles steals something from thief
he robs himself spends bootless grief
brabantio so let turk cyprus us beguile
lose not so long as can smile
he bears sentence well nothing bears
but free comfort which from thence he hears
but he bears both sentence sorrow
pay grief must poor patience borrow
being strong both sides are equivocal
but words are words never yet did hear
bruised heart was pierced through ear
humbly beseech proceed affairs state
duke turk most mighty preparation makes cyprus

though have there substitute most allowed sufficiency
yet opinion sovereign mistress effects throws more safer

duke what would desdemona
desdemona did love moor live him
downright violence storm fortunes

even very quality lord
saw othello's visage his mind

moth peace he go war
rites which love him are bereft
heavy interim shall support
by his dear absence let go him
othello let her have voices
vouch heaven therefore beg not
please palate appetite
nor comply heat young affects
but free bounteous her mind
heaven defend good souls think
will serious great business scant

feather'd cupid seel wanton dullness
speculative officed instruments
disports corrupt taint business
let housewives make skillet helm
all indign base adversities
duke as shall privately determine
either her stay or going affair cries haste
speed must answer't must hence tonight

up thyme supply one gender herbs or distract
many either have sterile idleness or manured
industry why power corrigible authority this lies

will come man drown thyself drown cats blind
puppies have professed thy friend confess knit
thy deserving cables perdurable toughness could never
better stead thee than now put money thy purse follow thou

money thy purse cannot desdemona should long
continue her love moor put money thy purse nor he his
answerable sequestration put but money thy purse these moors
are changeable their wills fill thy purse money
food him now as luscious as locusts shall him
shortly as acerb as coloquintida she must change youth
when she sated his body she will find error her
choice she must have change she must therefore put money
thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do more delicate
way than drowning make all money thou canst if sanctimony
frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian supersubtle
thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money pox drowning

praise couldst thou bestow deserving woman indeed one
authority her merit did justly put vouch very
malice itself

never lack'd gold yet went never gay
fled from her wish yet said now may

iago indeed
othello indeed ay indeed discernst thou aught
he not honest
iago honest lord
othello honest ay honest
othello what dost thou think
iago think lord
othello think lord by heaven he echoes
as if there were some monster his thought
too hideous shown thou dost mean something
heard thee say even now thou like'st not
when cassio left wife what didst not
when told thee he was counsel
whole course wooing thou criedst indeed
as if thou then hadst shut up thy brain
some horrible conceit if thou dost love
show thy thought
iago lord know love
othello think thou dost
know thou'rt full love honesty
weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath
therefore these stops thine fright more
such things false disloyal knave
they're close dilations working from heart
passion cannot rule
iago michael cassio
dare sworn think he honest
othello think so too
iago men should what they seem
or those not would they might seem none
othello certain men should what they seem
iago why then think cassio's an honest man
prithee speak as thy thinkings
as thou dost ruminate give thy worst thoughts
worst words
iago good lord pardon
though am bound every act duty
am not bound all slaves are free
utter thoughts why say they are vile false
as where's palace whereinto foul things
sometimes intrude not who has breast so pure
keep leets law days session sit
meditations lawful
othello thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
if thou but think'st him wrong'd makest his ear
stranger thy thoughts
iago do beseech
though perchance am vicious guess
as confess nature's plague
spy into abuses oft jealousy
from one so imperfectly conceits
would take no notice nor build yourself trouble
out his scattering unsure observance
were not quiet nor good
nor manhood honesty or wisdom
let know thoughts
othello what dost thou mean
iago good name man woman dear lord
immediate jewel their souls
'twas mine 'tis his has been slave thousands
but he filches from good name
robs which not enriches him
makes poor indeed
othello by heaven i'll know thy thoughts
iago cannot if heart were hand
nor shall not whilst 'tis custody
othello ha
iago o beware lord jealousy
meat feeds cuckold lives bliss
who certain his fate loves not his wronger
but o what damned minutes tells he o'er
who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
othello o misery
iago poor content rich rich enough
but riches fineless as poor as winter
him ever fears he shall poor
good heaven souls all tribe defend
othello why why this
think'st thou i'ld make life jealousy
follow still changes moon
fresh suspicions no once doubt
once resolved exchange goat
when shall turn business soul
such exsufflicate blown surmises
matching thy inference 'tis not make jealous
say wife fair feeds well loves company
where virtue these are more virtuous
nor from mine own weak merits will draw
smallest fear or doubt her revolt
she had eyes chose no iago
i'll see before doubt when doubt prove
proof there no more but this
away at once love or jealousy
iago am glad now shall have reason
show love duty bear
receive from speak not yet proof
look wife observe her well cassio
wear eye thus not jealous nor secure
would not have free noble nature
out self bounty abused look to't
know our country disposition well
venice they do let heaven see pranks
they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
not leave't undone but keep't unknown
iago she did deceive her father marrying
when she seem'd shake fear looks
she loved them most
othello so she did
iago why go then
she so young could give out such seeming
seel her father's eyes up close as oak
he thought 'twas witchcraft but am much blame
humbly do beseech pardon
othello am bound thee forever
iago see this hath little dash'd spirits
othello not jot not jot
iago i'faith fear has
hope will consider what spoke
comes from love but do see you're moved
am pray not strain speech
grosser issues nor larger reach
than suspicion
iago should do so lord
speech should fall into such vile success
which thoughts aim not at cassio's worthy friend
lord see you're moved
othello no not much moved
do not think but desdemona's honest
iago long live she so long live think so
othello yet how nature erring from itself
iago ay there's point as bold
her own clime complexion degree
whereto see all things nature tends
foh one may smell such will most rank
foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
but pardon do not position
distinctly speak her though may fear
her will recoiling her better judgement
may fall match her country forms
happily repent
if more thou dost perceive let know more
set thy wife observe leave iago
iago going lord take leave
othello why did marry this honest creature doubtless
sees knows more much more than he unfolds
iago returning lord would might entreat honor
scan this thing no further leave time
though fit cassio have his place
sure he fills up great ability
shall by perceive him his means
note if lady strain his entertainment
any strong or vehement importunity
much will seen meantime
let thought too busy fears
as worthy cause have fear am
hold her free do beseech honor
othello fear not government
iago once more take leave exit
knows all qualities learned spirit
human dealings if do prove her haggard
though her jesses were dear heartstrings
i'ld whistle her off let her down wind
prey at fortune haply am black
have not those soft parts conversation
chamberers have or am declined
into vale years yet that's not much
she's gone am abused relief
can call these delicate creatures ours
not their appetites had rather toad
live upon vapor dungeon
than keep corner thing love
others' uses yet 'tis plague great ones
prerogatived are they less than base
'tis destiny unshunnable death
even then this forked plague fated us
when do quicken desdemona comes
if she false o then heaven mocks itself
i'll not believe't
desdemona how now dear othello
dinner generous islanders
by invited do attend presence
othello am blame

dangerous conceits are their natures poisons
which at first are scarce found distaste
burn mines sulphur did say so
look where he comes

let him not know't he's not robb'd at all
othello had been happy if general camp
pioners all had tasted her sweet body
so had nothing known o now forever
farewell tranquil mind farewell content
farewell plumed troop big wars
make ambition virtue o farewell
farewell neighing steed shrill trump
spirit stirring drum ear piercing fife
royal banner all quality
o mortal engines whose rude throats
immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit
farewell othello's occupations gone
iago is't possible lord
othello villain sure thou prove love whore
sure give ocular proof
or by worth mans eternal soul
thou hadst been better have been born dog
than answer waked wrath
othello make see't or at least so prove
probation bear no hinge nor loop
hang doubt or woe upon thy life
iago noble lord
othello if thou dost slander her torture
never pray more abandon all remorse
horror's head horrors accumulate
do deeds make heaven weep all earth amazed
nothing canst thou damnation add
iago o grace o heaven defend
are man have soul or sense
god wi' take mine office o wretched fool
livest make thine honesty vice
o monstrous world take note take note o world
direct honest not safe
thank this profit from hence
i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense
othello nay stay thou shouldst honest
loses works
othello by world
think wife honest think she not
think thou art just think thou art not
i'll have some proof her name was as fresh
as dians visage now begrimed black
as mine own face if there cords or knives
poison or fire or suffocating streams
i'll not endure would were satisfied
do repent put
would satisfied
othello would nay will
iago may but how how satisfied lord
would supervisor grossly gape
behold her topp'd
othello death damnation o
iago were tedious difficulty think
bring them prospect damn them then
more than their own what then how then
what shall say where's satisfaction
impossible should see this

as salt as wolves pride fools as gross

if imputation strong circumstances
which lead directly door truth
will give satisfaction may have't
iago do not office
but sith am enter'd this cause so far
prick'd to't by foolish honesty love
will go lay cassio lately
being troubled raging tooth
could not sleep
there are kind men so loose soul
their sleeps will mutter their affairs
one this kind cassio
let us wary let us hide our loves
then sir would he gripe wring hand
cry o sweet creature then kiss hard
as if he pluck'd up kisses by roots
grew upon lips then laid his leg
over thigh sigh'd kiss'd then
cried cursed fate gave thee moor
othello o monstrous monstrous
iago nay this was but his dream
'tis shrewd doubt though but dream
iago this may help thicken other proofs
do demonstrate thinly
othello i'll tear her all pieces
iago nay but wise yet see nothing done
she may honest yet tell but this
have not sometimes seen handkerchief
spotted strawberries wife's hand
othello gave her such one 'twas first gift
am sure was wife's did today
see cassio wipe his beard
othello if
iago if or any was hers
speaks against her other proofs
othello o slave had forty thousand lives
one too poor too weak revenge
now do see 'tis true look here iago
all fond love thus do blow heaven
arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell
yield up o love thy crown hearted throne
tyrannous hate swell bosom thy fraught
'tis aspics' tongues
iago yet content
othello o blood blood blood
iago patience say mind perhaps may change
othello never iago pontic sea
whose icy current compulsive course
propontic hellespont
even so bloody thoughts violent pace
shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb humble love
till capable wide revenge
swallow them up now by yond marble heaven
due reverence sacred vow kneels
here engage words
iago do not rise yet kneels
witness ever burning lights above
witness here iago doth give up
execution his wit hands heart
wrong'd othello's service let him command
obey shall remorse
what bloody business ever they rise
othello greet thy love
not vain thanks but acceptance bounteous
will upon instant put thee to't
within these three days let hear thee say
iago friend dead 'tis done at request
but let her live
othello damn her lewd minx o damn her
come go apart will withdraw
furnish some swift means death
fair devil now art thou lieutenant
iago am own forever exeunt

or made gift father's eye
should hold her loathed his spirits should hunt
after new fancies she dying gave
bid when fate would have wive
make darling precious eye
lose't or give't away were such perdition
as nothing else could match
desdemona is't possible
othello 'tis true there's magic web
sibyl had number'd world

king richard old john gaunt time honoured lancaster
hast thou according thy oath band
brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
here make good boist'rous late appeal
which then our leisure would not let us hear
against duke norfolk thomas mowbray
gaunt have liege
if he appeal duke ancient malice
or worthily as good subject should
some known ground treachery him
gaunt as near as could sift him argument
some apparent danger seen him
aim'd at highness no inveterate malice
king richard then call them our presence face face
frowning brow brow ourselves will hear
accuser accused freely speak
rage deaf as sea hasty as fire
enter bolingbroke mowbray
bolingbroke many years happy days befall
gracious sovereign most loving liege
mowbray each day still better other's happiness
until heavens envying earth's good hap
add an immortal title crown
king richard thank both yet one but flatters us
as well appeareth by cause come
cousin hereford what dost thou object
against duke norfolk thomas mowbray
bolingbroke first heaven record speech
devotion subject's love
tend'ring precious safety prince
free from other misbegotten hate
come appellant this princely presence
now thomas mowbray do turn thee
mark greeting well what speak
or divine soul answer heaven
thou art traitor miscreant
too good so too bad live
since more fair crystal sky
uglier seem clouds fly
once more more aggravate note
foul traitor's name stuff thy throat
wish so please sovereign ere move
what tongue speaks right drawn sword may prove
'tis not trial womans war
bitter clamour two eager tongues
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
blood hot must coold this
yet can not such tame patience boast
as hush'd nought at an say
first fair reverence highness curbs
from giving reins spurs free speech
which else would post until had returnd
setting aside his high blood's royalty
let him no kinsman liege
do defy him spit at him
call him slanderous coward villain
which maintain would allow him odds
meet him were tied run afoot
even frozen ridges alps
or any other ground inhabitable
where ever englishman durst set his foot
by all hopes most falsely doth he lie
bolingbroke pale trembling coward there throw gage
disclaiming here kindred king
lay aside high blood's royalty
which fear not reverence makes thee except
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
as take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
by all rites knighthood else
will make good against thee arm arm
mowbray take up by sword swear
which gently laid knighthood shoulder
i'll answer thee any fair degree
or chivalrous design knightly trial
when mount alive may not light
if traitor or unjustly fight
king richard what doth our cousin lay mowbray's charge
must great can inherit us
so much as thought ill him
mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
name lendings highness' soldiers
which he hath detaind lewd employments
false traitor injurious villain
besides say will battle prove
or here or elsewhere furthest verge
ever was survey'd by english eye
all treasons these eighteen years
complotted contrived this land
further say further will maintain
upon his bad life make all this good
he did plot duke gloucester's death
suggest his soon believing adversaries
consequently traitor coward
sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams blood
which blood sacrificing abels cries
even from tongueless caverns earth
justice rough chastisement
this arm shall do or this life spent
king richard how high pitch his resolution soars
thomas norfolk what say'st thou this
mowbray o let sovereign turn away his face
bid his ears little while deaf
till have told this slander his blood
how god good men hate so foul liar
king richard mowbray impartial are our eyes cars
were he brother nay kingdom's heir
now by sceptre's awe make vow
such neighbour nearness our sacred blood
should nothing privilege him nor partialize
unstooping firmness upright soul
he our subject mowbray so art thou
free speech fearless thee allow
mowbray then bolingbroke as low as thy heart
through false passage thy throat thou liest
three parts receipt had calais
other part reserv'd by consent
sovereign liege was debt
upon remainder dear account
since last went france fetch his queen
now swallow down lie gloucester's death
slew him not but own disgrace
neglected sworn duty case
noble lord lancaster
honourable father foe
trespass doth vex grieved soul
but ere last receiv'd sacrament
did confess exactly begg'd
grace's pardon hope had
this fault as rest appeald
issues from rancour villain
recreant most degenerate traitor
which myself boldly will defend
interchangeably hurl down gage
prove myself loyal gentleman
even best blood chamber'd his bosom
haste whereof most heartily pray
highness assign our trial day
king richard wrath kindled gentlemen ruld by
let's purge this choler without letting blood

deep malice makes too deep incision
forget forgive conclude agreed
good uncle let this end where begun

gaunt make peace shall become age
throw down son duke norfolk's gage
king richard norfolk throw down his
gaunt when harry when
obedience bids should not bid again
king richard norfolk throw down bid
there no boot
life thou shalt command but not shame
one duty owes but fair name
despite death lives upon grave
dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
am disgrac'd impeach'd baffld here
pierc'd soul slander's venom'd spear
which no balm can cure but his heart blood
which breath'd this poison
king richard rage must withstood
mowbray yea but not change his spots take but shame
resign gage dear dear lord
purest treasure mortal times afford
spotless reputation away
men are but gilded loam or painted clay
jewel ten times barr'd up chest
bold spirit loyal breast
mine honour life both grow one
take honour from life done
live will die
king richard cousin throw up gage do begin
bolingbroke o god defend soul from such deep sin
shall seem crest fallen father's sight
or pale beggar fear impeach height
before this outdar'd dastard ere tongue

or sound so base parle teeth shall tear
slavish motive recanting fear
where shame doth harbour even mowbray's face
exit gaunt
king richard were not born sue but command

there shall swords lances arbitrate
swelling difference settled hate

duchess finds brotherhood thee no sharper spur

were as seven vials his sacred blood
or seven fair branches springing from one root
some those seven are dried by nature's course
but thomas dear lord life gloucester

which mean men entitle patience
pale cold cowardice noble breasts

lo this all nay yet depart not so

dear blood which hath fostered
our eyes do hate dire aspect
civil wounds plough'd up neighbours' sword
sky aspiring ambitious thoughts
rival hating envy set
wake our peace which our country's cradle
draws sweet infant breath gentle sleep
which so rous'd up boist'rous untund drums
harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray
grating shock wrathful iron arms
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
make us wade even our kindred's blood
cousin hereford upon pain life
till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
shall not regreet our fair dominions
but tread stranger paths banishment
bolingbroke will done this must comfort
sun warms here shall shine

king richard norfolk thee remains heavier doom
sly slow hours shall not determinate
dateless limit thy dear exile
hopeless word 'never return
breathe against thee upon pain life
mowbray heavy sentence most sovereign liege
all unlook'd from highness' mouth
dearer merit not so deep maim
as cast forth common air
have deserved at highness' hands
native english now must forgo
now tongue's use no more
than an unstringed viol or harp
or cunning instrument cas'd up
or being open put into his hands
knows no touch tune harmony
within mouth have engaold tongue
doubly portcullis'd teeth lips
dull unfeeling barren ignorance
am too old fawn upon nurse
too far years pupil now
what thy sentence then but speechless death
which robs tongue from breathing native breath
king richard boots thee not compassionate
after our sentence plaining comes too late
mowbray then thus turn from countrv's light
dwell solemn shades endless night
king richard return again take an oath thee
swear by duty owe god
our part therein banish yourselves
keep oath administer
never shall so help truth god
embrace each other's love banishment
nor never look upon each other's face
nor never write regreet nor reconcile
this louring tempest home bred hate
nor never by advised purpose meet
'gainst us our state our subjects or our land
bolingbroke swear
mowbray keep all this
bolingbroke norfolk so far as mine enemy
by this time had king permitted us
one our souls had wand'red air
banish'd this frail sepulchre our flesh
as now our flesh banish'd from this land
confess thy treasons ere thou fly realm
clogging burden guilty soul
mowbray no bolingbroke if ever were traitor
name blotted from book life
from heaven banish'd as from hence
but what thou art god thou do know
all too soon fear king shall rue
farewell liege now no way can stray
save back england an world's way exit
king richard uncle even glasses thine eyes
hath from number his banish'd years
pluck'd four away bolingbroke six frozen winters spent
return welcome home from banishment
bolingbroke how long time lies one little word
four lagging winters four wanton springs
end word such breath kings
gaunt thank liege regard
he shortens four years sons exile
but little vantage shall reap thereby
can change their moons bring their times about
oil dried lamp time bewasted light
shall extinct age endless night
inch taper will burnt done
blindfold death not let see son
king richard why uncle thou hast many years live
gaunt but not minute king thou canst give
shorten days thou canst sullen sorrow
pluck nights from but not lend morrow
but stop no wrinkle his pilgrimage
thy word current him death
but dead thy kingdom cannot buy breath
king richard thy son banish'd upon good advice
whereto thy tongue party verdict gave
why at our justice seem'st thou then lour
gaunt things sweet taste prove digestion sour
urg'd as judge but had rather
would have bid argue father
smooth his fault should have been more mild
partial slander sought avoid
sentence own life destroy'd
alas look'd when some should say
was too strict make mine own away
but gave leave unwilling tongue
against will do myself this wrong
king richard cousin farewell uncle bid him so
six years banish him he shall go
aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know
from where do remain let paper show
marshal lord no leave take will ride
as far as land will let by side
gaunt o what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
thou returnest no greeting thy friends
bolingbroke have too few take leave
when tongue's office should prodigal
breathe abundant dolour heart
bolingbroke joy absent grief present time
gaunt what six winters they are quickly gone
bolingbroke men joy but grief makes one hour ten
gaunt call travel thou tak'st pleasure
bolingbroke heart will sigh when miscall so
which finds an enforced pilgrimage
gaunt sullen passage thy weary steps
esteem as foil wherein thou art set
precious jewel thy home return
will but remember what deal world
wander from jewels love
must not serve long apprenticehood
foreign passages end
having freedom boast nothing else
but was journeyman grief
gaunt all places eye heaven visits
are wise man ports happy havens
teach thy necessity reason thus
think not king did banish thee
but thou king woe doth heavier sit
where perceives but faintly home
go say sent thee forth purchase honour
not king exild thee or suppose
devouring pestilence hangs our air
thou art flying fresher clime
look what thy soul holds dear imagine
lie way thou goest not whence thou com'st
grass whereon thou tread'st presence strew'd
flowers fair ladies thy steps no more
than delightful measure or dance
gnarling sorrow hath less power bite
man mocks at sets light
bolingbroke o who can hold fire his hand
by thinking frosty caucasus
or cloy hungry edge appetite
by bare imagination feast
by thinking fantastic summer's heat
o no apprehension good
gives but greater feeling worse
fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
than when he bites but lanceth not sore
gaunt come come son i'll bring thee thy way
had thy youtli cause would not stay
bolingbroke then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
mother nurse bears yet
though banish'd yet trueborn english man exeunt

aumerle brought high hereford if call him so

which then blew bitterly against our faces
awak'd sleeping rheum so by chance

king richard what said our cousin when parted him
aumerle 'farewell'
heart disdained tongue
should so profane word taught craft
counterfeit oppression such grief
marry would word 'farewell have length'ned hours
added years his short banishment
he should have had volume farewells

king richard he our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt
when time shall call him home from banishment
whether our kinsman come see his friends

wholesome counsel his unstaid youth
york vex not yourself nor strive not breath
all vain comes counsel his ear
gaunt o but they say tongues dying men
where words are scarce they are seldom spent vain
they breathe truth breathe their words pain
he no more must say listend more
than they whom youth ease have taught glose
more are mens ends mark'd than their lives before
setting sun music at close
as last taste sweets sweetest last
writ remembrance more than things long past
though richard life's counsel would not hear
york no stopp'd other flattering sounds
as praises whose taste wise are fond
lascivious metres whose venom sound
open ear youth doth always listen
report fashions proud italy
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after base imitation
where doth world thrust forth vanity
so new there's no respect how vile
then all too late comes counsel heard
where will doth mutiny wit's regard
direct not him whose way himself will choose
'tis breath thou lack'st breath wilt thou lose
gaunt methinks am prophet new inspir'd
thus expiring do foretell him
his rash fierce blaze riot cannot last
violent fires soon burn out themselves
small showers last long but sudden storms are short
eager feeding food doth choke feeder
light vanity insatiate cormorant
consuming means soon preys upon itself

thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
whose compass no bigger than thy head

though death poor ends mortal woe
king richard ripest fruit first falls so doth he
his time spent our pilgrimage must
so much now our irish wars
must supplant those rough rug headed kerns
which live venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege live
these great affairs do ask some charge
plate coin revenues moveables
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd
york how long shall patient ah how long

not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment
nor gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs

am last noble edward's sons
whom thy father prince wales was first
war was never lion rag'd more fierce
peace was never gentle lamb more mild
than was young princely gentleman
his face thou hast even so look'd he
accomplish'd number thy hours
but when he frownd was against french
not against his friends his noble hand
which his triumphant father's hand had won
his hands were guilty no kindred blood

king richard why uncle what's matter

pardon if please if not pleas'd
not pardoned am content withal

take hereford's rights away take from time
his charters his customary rights

if do wrongfully seize hereford's rights
call letters patents he hath

save bidding farewell so sweet guest
as sweet richard yet again methinks
some unborn sorrow ripe fortune's womb
coming towards inward soul
nothing trembles at some thing grieves
more than parting from lord king
which shows grief itself but not so
sorrow's eye glazed blinding tears
divides one thing entire many objects
perspectives which rightly gaz'd upon
show nothing but confusion ey'd awry
distinguish form so sweet majesty
looking awry upon lord's departure
find shapes grief more than himself wail
which look'd as nought but shadows
more than lord's departure weep not more not seen
or if 'tis false sorrow's eye
which things true weeps things imaginary
queen may so but yet inward soul
persuades otherwise howe'er
cannot but sad so heavy sad
as though thinking no thought think
makes heavy nothing faint shrink
bushy 'tis nothing but conceit gracious lady
from some forefather grief mine not so
nothing hath begot something grief
or something hath nothing grieve

cannot name 'tis nameless woe wot

king richard barkloughly castle can they this at hand
aumerle yea lord how brooks grace air
after late tossing breaking seas
king richard needs must well weep joy
stand upon kingdom once again
dear earth do salute thee hand
though rebels wound thee their horses' hoofs
plays fondly her tears smiles meeting
so weeping smiling greet thee earth
do thee favours royal hands
feed not thy sovereigns foe gentle earth
nor thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
but let thy spiders suck up thy venom
heavy gaited toads lie their way
doing annoyance treacherous feet
which usurping steps do trample thee
when they from thy bosom pluck flower
guard pray thee lurking adder
whose double tongue may mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies
mock not senseless conjuration lords
this earth shall have feeling these stones
prove armed soldiers ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellions arms
carlisle fear not lord power made king
means heaven yields must embrac'd
not neglected else if heaven would
will not heavens offer refuse
proffered means succour redress
aumerle he means lord are too remiss
whilst bolingbroke through our security
grows strong great substance power
king richard discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
when searching eye heaven hid
then thieves robbers range abroad unseen
murders outrage boldly here
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires proud tops eastern pines
darts his light through every guilty hole
then murders treasons detested sins
cloak night being pluck'd from off their backs
stand bare naked trembling at themselves
so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
whilst were wand'ring antipodes
shall see us rising our throne east
his treasons will sit blushing his face
not able endure sight day
but self affrighted tremble at his sin
not all water rough rude sea
can wash balm off from an anointed king
breath worldly men cannot depose
deputy elected by lord
lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
god his richard hath heavenly pay
glorious angel then if angels fight
weak men must fall heaven still guards right
enter salisbury
welcome lord how far off lies power
salisbury nor near nor farther off gracious lord

o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune thy state
all welshmen hearing thou wert dead

aumerle comfort liege why looks grace so pale
king richard but now blood twenty thousand men
till so much blood thither come again

all souls will safe fly from side

aumerle comfort liege remember who are

king richard mine ear open heart prepar'd
worst worldly loss thou canst unfold

we'll serve him too his fellow so
revolt our subjects cannot mend
they break their faith god as well as us
cry woe destruction ruin decay
worst death death will have his day
scroop glad am highness so arm'd
bear tidings calamity
which makes silver rivers drown their shores
as if world were all dissolv'd tears
so high above his limits swells rage
bolingbroke covering fearful land
hard bright steel hearts harder than steel
white beards have arm'd their thin hairless scalps
against thy majesty boys womens voices
strive speak big clap their female joints
stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
double fatal yew against thy state
yea distaff women manage rusty bills
against thy seat both young old rebel
all goes worse than have power tell
king richard too well too well thou tellst tale so
where earl wiltshire where bagot
what become bushy where green
they have let dangerous enemy
measure our confines such peaceful steps
warrant they have made peace bolingbroke
scroop peace have they made him indeed lord
king richard o villains vipers damnd without redemption
dogs easily won fawn any man
snakes heart blood warm'd sting heart
three judases each one thrice worse than judas
would they make peace terrible hell make war
upon their spotted souls this offence
scroop sweet love see changing his property
again uncurse their souls their peace made
heads not hands those whom curse
have felt worst death's destroying wound

yet not so what can bequeath
save our deposed bodies ground
our lands our lives an are bolingbroke's
nothing can can our own but death
small model barren earth
which serves as paste cover our bones
god's sake let us sit upon ground
how some have been depos'd some slain war
some haunted by ghosts they have depos'd
some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd
all murder'd within hollow crown
rounds mortal temples king
keeps death his court there antic sits
scoffing his state grinning at his pomp
allowing him breath little scene
monarchize fear'd kill looks
as if this flesh which walls about our life
were brass impregnable humour'd thus
comes at last little pin
bores through his castle wall farewell king
cover heads mock not flesh blood
solemn reverence throw away respect
tradition form ceremonious duty
have but mistook all this while
live bread feel want
how can say am king
carlisle lord wise men ne'er sit wail their woes
but presently prevent ways wail
fear foe since fear oppresseth strength
gives weakness strength unto foe
so follies fight against yourself
fear slain no worse can come fight
fight die death destroying death
where fearing dying pays death servile breath
learn make body limb
king richard thou chid'st well proud bolingbroke come
change blows thee our day doom
this ague fit fear over blown
an easy task win our own
say scroop where lies our uncle his power
speak sweetly man although thy looks sour
scroop men judge by complexion sky

aumerle beshrew thee cousin which didst lead forth
what say now what comfort have now

bids comfort any more

currents spring from one most gracious head
by buried hand warlike gaunt

may hourly trample their sovereigns head
heart they tread now whilst live
buried once why not upon head
aumerle thou weep'st tender hearted cousin

very time aumerle did talk
fitzwater 'tis very true were presence then
can witness this true
surrey as false by heaven as heaven itself true
fitzwater surrey thou liest
lie shall lie so heavy sword
shall render vengeance revenge
till thou lie giver lie do he
earth as quiet as thy father's skull
proof whereof there honour's pawn
engage trial if thou dar'st
fitzwater how fondly dost thou spur forward horse
if dare eat or drink or breathe or live
dare meet surrey wilderness
lies lies there bond faith
tie thee strong correction
as intend thrive this new world
aumerle guilty true appeal
besides heard banish'd norfolk say
thou aumerle didst send two thy men
execute noble duke at calais
aumerle some honest christian trust gage
norfolk lies here do throw down this
bolingbroke these differences shall all rest under gage
till norfolk repeald repeald he shall
though mine enemy restor'd again
all his lands signories when he returnd
against aumerle will enforce his trial
carlisle honourable day shall never seen
many time hath banish'd norfolk fought
jesu christ glorious christian field
streaming ensign christian cross
toild works war retir'd himself
italy there at venice gave
his body pleasant country's earth
his pure soul unto his captain christ
under whose colours he had fought so long

bolingbroke god's name i'll ascend regal throne
worst this royal presence may speak
yet best beseeming speak truth
would god any this noble presence
were enough noble upright judge
noble richard then true noblesse would
learn him forbearance from so foul wrong
what subject can give sentence his king
who sits here not richard's subject
thieves are not judg'd but they are by hear
shall figure god's majesty
his captain steward deputy elect
anointed crowned planted many years
judg'd by subject inferior breath
he himself not present o forfend god
christian climate souls refind
should show so heinous black obscene deed
speak subjects subject speaks
stirr'd up by god thus boldly his king
foul traitor proud hereford's king
if crown him let prophesy
blood english shall manure ground
future ages groan this foul act
peace shall go sleep turks infidels
this seat peace tumultuous wars
shall kin kin kind kind confound
disorder horror fear mutiny
shall here inhabit this land calld
o if raise this house against this house
will woefullest division prove

before have shook off regal thoughts
wherewith reignd hardly yet have learnd

do what service am sent hither
york do office thine own good will
which tired majesty did make thee offer
resignation thy state crown
henry bolingbroke

this side hand side thine
now this golden crown deep well
owes two buckets filling one another
emptier ever dancing air
other down unseen full water
bucket down fun tears am
drinking griefs whilst mount up high
bolingbroke thought had been willing resign
may glories state depose
but not griefs still am king those
bolingbroke part cares give crown
king richard cares set up do not pluck cares down
care loss care by old care done
care gain care by new care won
cares give have though given away
they tend crown yet still they stay
bolingbroke are contented resign crown
therefore no no resign thee
now mark how will undo myself
give this heavy weight from off head
this unwieldy sceptre from hand
pride kingly sway from out heart
mine own tears wash away balm
mine own hands give away crown
mine own tongue deny sacred state
mine own breath release all duteous oaths
manors rents revenues forgo
acts decrees statutes deny
god pardon all oaths are broke
god keep all vows unbroke are made thee
make nothing have nothing griev'd
thou all pleas'd hast an achiev'd
long mayst thou live richard's seat sit

god save king henry unking'd richard says

northumberland no more but read
these accusations these grievous crimes
committed by person followers
against state profit this land
by confessing them souls men

king richard must do so must ravel out
weav'd up follies gentle northumberland
would not shame thee so fair troop
read lecture them if thou wouldst
there shouldst thou find one heinous article
containing deposing king
cracking strong warrant an oath
mark'd blot damnd book heaven
nay all stand look upon
whilst wretchedness doth bait myself
though some pilate wash hands
have here deliver'd sour cross
water cannot wash away sin
northumberland lord dispatch read o'er these
empty
king richard mine eyes are full tears cannot see
yet salt water blinds them not so much
but they can see sort traitors here
nay if turn mine eyes upon myself
find myself traitor rest
t'undeck pompous body king

every day under his household roof
did keep ten thousand men was this face

this face which fac'd so many follies
was at last out fac'd by bolingbroke

mark silent king moral this sport
how soon sorrow hath destroy'd face

where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops

mounted upon hot fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seem'd know
slow but stately pace kept his course
whilst all tongues cried 'god save thee bolingbroke'
would have thought very windows spake
so many greedy looks young old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage all walls
'jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke'
whilst he from one side other turning
bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck
bespake them thus 'i thank countrymen'
thus still doing thus he pass'd along
duchess alack poor richard where rode he whilst
york as theatre eyes men
after well grac'd actor leaves stage
are idly bent him enters next
even so or much more contempt mens eyes
did scowl gentle richard no man cried 'god save him'
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
which such gentle sorrow he shook off
his face still combating tears smiles
badges his grief patience
had not god some strong purpose steeld
hearts men they must perforce have melted
but heaven hath hand these events
whose high will bound our calm contents

generation still breeding thoughts
these same thoughts people this little world
humours people this world
no thought contented better sort
as thoughts things divine are intermix'd
against word
as thus 'come little ones' then again
'it as hard come as camel
thread postern small needle's eye'
thoughts tending ambition they do plot
unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
may tear passage through flinty ribs
this hard world ragged prison walls
they cannot die their own pride
they are not first fortune's slaves
nor shall not last silly beggars
who sitting stocks refuge their shame
many have others must sit there
this thought they find kind ease
bearing their own misfortunes back
such as have before endur'd
thus play one person many people
none contented sometimes am king
so am then crushing penury
persuades was better when king
then am king'd again by by
think am unking'd by bolingbroke
straight am nothing but whate'er
nor nor any man but man

so music mens lives

check time broke disorder'd string
but concord state time
had not an ear hear true time broke
wasted time now doth time waste
now hath time made his numb'ring clock
thoughts are minutes sighs they jar
whereto finger dials point
pointing still cleansing them from tears
now sir sound tells what hour
are clamorous groans which strike upon heart
which bell so sighs tears groans
show minutes times hours but time
runs posting bolingbroke's proud joy

made glorious summer by this sun york
all clouds lour'd upon our house
deep bosom ocean buried
now are our brows bound victorious wreaths
our bruised arms hung up monuments
our stern alarums chang'd merry meetings
our dreadful marches delightful measures
grim visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
now instead mounting barbed steeds
he capers nimbly lady's chamber
lascivious pleasing lute
but am not shap'd sportive tricks
nor made court an amorous looking glass
am rudely stamp'd want love's majesty
strut before wanton ambling nymph
am curtaild this fair proportion
cheated feature by dissembling nature
deform'd unfinish'd sent before time
so lamely unfashionable
dogs bark at as halt by them
why this weak piping time peace
have no delight pass away time
unless spy shadow sun
descant mine own deformity
therefore since cannot prove lover
entertain these fair well spoken days
am determined prove villain
plots have laid inductions dangerous
by drunken prophecies libels dreams
set brother clarence king
deadly hate one against other
if king edward as true just
as am subtle false treacherous
this day should clarence closely mew'd up

lord hastings was her delivery
gloucester humbly complaining her deity
got lord chamberlain his liberty

hear piteous moan rutland made
when black fac'd clifford shook his sword at him
told sad story father's death
twenty times made pause sob weep
all standers by had wet their cheeks
trees bedash'd rain sad time
manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
what these sorrows could not thence exhale
thy beauty hath made them blind weeping
never sued friend nor enemy
tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
proud heart sues prompts tongue speak
she looks scornfully at him
teach not thy lip such scorn was made
kissing lady not such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
lo here lend thee this sharp pointed sword
which if thou please hide this true breast
let soul forth adoreth thee
lay naked deadly stroke
he lays his breast open she offers at his sword

anne fear both are false
anne well put up sword
gloucester say then peace made
anne shalt thou know hereafter
gloucester but shall live hope
anne all men hope live so

his resemblance being not duke

bounty virtue fair humility
indeed left nothing fitting purpose
untouch'd or slightly handled discourse
bid them did love their country's good
cry 'god save richard england's royal king'
gloucester did they so
buckingham no so god help they spake not word
but dumb statues or breathing stones
star'd each other look'd deadly pale
which when saw reprehended them
ask'd mayor what meant this wilfull silence
his answer was people were not used
then he was urg'd tell tale again
'thus saith duke thus hath duke inferr'd'
but nothing spoke warrant from himself
when he had done some followers mine own
at lower end hall hurld up their caps
some ten voices cried 'god save king richard'
thus took vantage those few
'thanks gentle citizens friends' quoth

catesby i'll signify so much unto him straight exit
buckingham ah ha lord this prince not an edward

but his knees at meditation
not dallying brace courtezans
but meditating two deep divines
not sleeping engross his idle body
happy were england would this virtuous prince
take his grace sovereignty thereof
but sure fear shall not win him
mayor marry god defend his grace should say us nay
buckingham fear he will here catesby comes again
re enter catesby
now catesby what says his grace
catesby lord

gloucester lord there needs no such apology
do beseech grace pardon
who earnest service god

all good men this ungovernd isle
gloucester do suspect have done some offence
come reprehend ignorance
buckingham have lord would might please
grace
our entreaties amend fault
gloucester else wherefore breathe christian land
buckingham know then fault resign
supreme seat throne majestical
scept'red office ancestors
state fortune due birth
corruption blemish'd stock
whiles mildness sleepy thoughts
which here waken our country's good
noble isle doth want her proper limbs
her face defac'd scars infamy
her royal stock graft ignoble plants
almost should'red swallowing gulf
dark forgetfulness deep oblivion
which recure heartily solicit
kingly government this land
not as protector steward substitute
or lowly factor another's gain
but as successively from blood blood
right birth empery own
this consorted citizens
very worshipful loving friends
by their vehement instigation
this just cause come move grace
or bitterly speak reproof
best fitteth degree or condition
if not answer might haply think
tongue tied ambition not replying yielded
bear golden yoke sovereignty
which fondly would here impose
if reprove this suit yours
so seasond faithful love
then other side check'd friends
then speaking not incur last
definitively thus answer
love deserves thanks but desert
unmeritable shuns high request
first if all obstacles were cut away
path were even crown
as ripe revenue due birth
yet so much poverty spirit
so mighty so many defects
being bark brook no mighty sea
than greatness covet hid
vapour glory smother'd
but god thank'd there no need
much need help were there need
royal tree hath left us royal fruit
which mellow'd by stealing hours time
will well become seat majesty
make no doubt us happy by his reign
right fortune his happy stars
which god defend should wring from him
buckingham lord this argues conscience
empty
but respects thereof are nice trivial
all circumstances well considered
say edward brother's son
so say too but not by edward's wife
first was he contract lady lucy
afterward by substitute betroth'd
bona sister king france
these both put off poor petitioner
care craz'd mother many sons
beauty waning distressed widow
even afternoon her best days
made prize purchase his wanton eye
seduc'd pitch height his degree
base declension loath'd bigamy
this edward whom our manners call prince
more bitterly could expostulate
save reverence some alive
give sparing limit tongue
then good lord take royal self
this proffer'd benefit dignity
if not bless us land withal
yet draw forth noble ancestry
from corruption abusing times
mayor do good lord citizens entreat
buckingham refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love
catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
gloucester alas why would heap this care
am unfit state majesty
do beseech take not amiss
cannot nor will not yield
buckingham if refuse as love zeal
loath depose child brother's son
gentle kind effeminate remorse
which have noted kindred
egally indeed all estates
yet know whe'er accept our suit or no
brother's son shall never reign our king
but will plant some other throne
disgrace downfall house
this resolution here leave
come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more
exeunt buckingham mayor citizens
catesby call him again sweet prince accept their suit
if deny them all land will rue
gloucester will enforce world cares
call them again am not made stones
but penetrable kind entreaties
albeit against conscience soul
re enter buckingham rest
cousin buckingham sage grave men
bear her burden whe'er will or no
must have patience endure load
but if black scandal or foul fac'd reproach
attend sequel imposition
mere enforcement shall acquittance
from all impure blots stains thereof
god doth know may partly see
how far am from desire this
mayor god bless grace see will say
buckingham then salute this royal title
long live king richard england's worthy king
all amen
buckingham morrow may please crownd
gloucester even when please will have so
buckingham morrow then will attend grace

which after hours gives leisure repent
if did take kingdom from sons
make amends i'll give daughter

endur'd her whom bid sorrow
children were vexation youth

loss have but son being king
cannot make what amends would
therefore accept such kindness as can

o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream fees
o'er ladies' lips who straight kisses dream
which oft angry mab blisters plagues
because their breaths sweetmeats tainted are
sometime she gallops o'er courtier's nose
sometime comes she tithe pig's tail
tickling parsons nose as 'a lies asleep

sometimes she driveth o'er soldier's neck
then dreams he cutting foreign throats
breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
healths five fadom deep then anon

bare vowel 'i' shall poison more

nurse will speak well him killd cousin
jul shall speak ill him husband
ah poor lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
when thy three hours wife have mangled
but wherefore villain didst thou kill cousin
villain cousin would have killd husband
back foolish tears back native spring
tributary drops belong woe
which mistaking offer up joy
tybalt's dead would have slain husband
all this comfort wherefore weep then
some word there was worser than tybalt's death
murd'red would forget fain

he should hither come as this dire night
help take her from her borrowed grave
but he which bore letter friar john

without parallel those being all study
government cast upon brother
state grew stranger being transported
rapt secret studies thy false uncle
dost thou attend
miranda sir most heedfully
prospero being once perfected how grant suits
how deny them who t' advance who
trash over topping new created

suck'd verdure out ont thou attend'st not
miranda o good sir do
prospero pray thee mark
thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
closeness bettering mind
o'er priz'd all popular rate false brother
awak'd an evil nature trust
good parent did beget him
falsehood its contrary as great
as trust was which had indeed no limit
confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
not only what revenue yielded
but what power might else exact one
who having into truth by telling
credit his own lie he did believe
he was indeed duke out o' th' substitution
executing th' outward face royalty
all prerogative hence his ambition growing
dost thou hear
miranda tale sir would cure deafness
prospero have no screen between this part he play'd
him he play'd he needs will
absolute milan poor man library
he thinks now incapable confederates

inveterate hearkens brother's suit
which was he lieu o' th' premises
homage know not how much tribute
should presently extirpate mine
out dukedom confer fair milan
treacherous army levied one midnight
fated th' purpose did antonio open
gates milan i' th' dead darkness
ministers th' purpose hurried thence

tale provokes question dear they durst not
so dear love people bore nor set
mark so bloody business but
few they hurried us aboard bark
bore us some leagues sea where they prepared
rotten carcass butt not rigg'd

instinctively have quit there they hoist us
cry th' sea roar'd us sigh
th' winds whose pity sighing back again
did us but loving wrong
miranda alack what trouble

infused fortitude from heaven

miranda how came ashore
prospero by providence divine
noble neapolitan gonzalo
out his charity who being then appointed
master this design did give us
rich garments linens stuffs necessaries
which since have steaded much so his gentleness
knowing lov'd books he furnish'd
from mine own library volumes
prize above dukedom
miranda would might
prospero now arise puts his mantle
sit still hear last our sea sorrow

vainer hours tutors not so careful

worse than worst content
thou should'st desire die being miserable
timon not by his breath more miserable
thou art slave whom fortune's tender arm
favour never clasp'd but bred dog
hadst thou us from our first swath proceeded
such as may passive drugs
freely command thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
general riot melted down thy youth
different beds lust never learnd
icy precepts respect but followed
sug'red game before thee but myself
who had world as confectionary
mouths tongues eyes hearts men
at duty more than could frame employment
do oak have one winter's brush
fell from their boughs left open bare
every storm blows bear this
never knew but better some burden
thy nature did commence sufferance time
hath made thee hard int why shouldst thou hate men
they never flatter'd thee what hast thou given
if thou wilt curse thy father poor rag
must thy subject who spite put stuff
poor rogue hereditary hence gone
if thou hadst not been born worst men
thou hadst been knave flatterer
apemantus art thou proud yet
timon ay am not thee

second bandit true he bears not about him 'tis hid
first bandit not this he

banditti save thee timon
timon now thieves
banditti soldiers not thieves
timon both too womens sons
banditti are not thieves but men much do want
timon greatest want want much meat
why should want behold earth hath roots
within this mile break forth hundred springs
bounteous housewife nature each bush
lays her full mess before want why want
first bandit cannot live grass berries water
as beasts birds fishes
timon nor beasts themselves birds fishes
must eat men yet thanks must con
are thieves profess'd work not
holier shapes there boundless theft
limited professions rascal thieves
till high fever seethe blood froth
so scape hanging trust not physician
his antidotes are poison he slays
moe than rob take wealth lives together
do villainy do since protest do't
workmen i'll example thievery
suns thief his great attraction
robs vast sea moons an arrant thief
her pale fire she snatches from sun
moon into salt tears earth's thief
feeds breeds by composture stoln
from genral excrement each thing's thief
laws curb whip their rough power
has uncheck'd theft love not yourselves away
rob one another there's more gold cut throats
all meet are thieves athens go
break open shops nothing can steal
but thieves do lose steal not less this
empty
third bandit has almost charm'd from profession by
persuading
first bandit 'tis malice mankind he thus advises

first bandit let us first see peace athens there no time so
miserable but man may true exeunt thieves
flavius o gods
yond despis'd ruinous man lord
full decay failing o monument
wonder good deeds evilly bestow'd
what an alteration honour
has desp'rate want made
what viler thing upon earth than friends
who can bring noblest minds basest ends
how rarely does meet this time's guise
grant may ever love rather woo
those would mischief than those do
has caught his eye will present
honest grief unto him as lord
still serve him life dearest master
timon away what art thou
flavius have forgot sir
timon why dost ask have forgot all men
then if thou grant'st th'art man have forgot thee
timon then know thee not
never had honest man about
all kept were knaves serve meat villains
flavius gods are witness
nev'r did poor steward wear truer grief
his undone lord than mine eyes
timon what dost thou weep come nearer then love thee
because thou art woman disclaim'st
flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
strange times weep laughing not weeping
flavius beg know good lord
t' accept grief whilst this poor wealth lasts
entertain as steward still
timon had steward
so true so just now so comfortable
almost turns dangerous nature mild
let behold thy face surely this man
was born woman
perpetual sober gods do proclaim
one honest man mistake not but one
no more pray he's steward
how fain would have hated all mankind
thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee
fell curses
methinks thou art more honest now than wise
by oppressing betraying
thou mightst have sooner got another service
upon their first lord's neck but tell true
must ever doubt though ne'er so sure
not thy kindness subtle covetous
if not usuring kindness as rich men deal gifts
expecting return twenty one
flavius no most worthy master whose breast
doubt suspect alas are plac'd too late
should have fear'd false times when did feast
suspect still comes where an estate least
duty zeal unmatched mind
care food living believe
most honour'd lord
any benefit points
either hope or present i'd exchange
this one wish had power wealth
requite by making rich yourself
timon look thee 'tis so thou singly honest man
here take gods out misery
but thus conditiond thou shalt build from men
hate all curse all show charity none
but let famish'd flesh slide from bone
ere thou relieve beggar give dogs
what thou deniest men let prisons swallow 'em
debts wither 'em nothing men blasted woods
may diseases lick up their false bloods
so farewell thrive
flavius o let stay

till now have gone filld time
all licentious measure making wills

when crouching marrow bearer strong
cries itself 'no more' now breathless wrong
pursy insolence shall break his wind
fear horrid flight
first senator noble young
when thy first griefs were but mere conceit
ere thou hadst power or had cause fear
sent thee give thy rages balm
wipe out our ingratitude loves
above their quantity
second senator so did woo
by humble message by promis'd means
were not all unkind nor all deserve
common stroke war
first senator these walls ours
were not erected by their hands from whom
have receiv'd griefs nor are they such
these great tow'rs trophies schools should fall
private faults them
second senator nor are they living
shame they wanted cunning excess
hath broke their hearts march noble lord
into our city thy banners spread
by decimation tithed death

first senator all have not offended
those are revenge crimes lands

first senator set but thy foot
against our rampir'd gates they shall ope
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before

here lie timon who alive all living men did hate
pass by curse thy fill but pass stay not here thy
empty
these well express thee thy latter spirits
though thou abhorr'dst us our human griefs
scorndst our brains flow those our droplets which
taught thee make vast neptune weep aye
thy low grave faults forgiven dead

virtue stoops trembles at her frown

he hath breath'd dishonour here
chiron am prepar'd full resolv'd
foul spoken coward thund'rest thy tongue

now by gods warlike goths adore
this pretty brabble will undo us all
why lords think not how dangerous
jet upon prince's right
what lavinia then become so loose
or bassianus so degenerate
her love such quarrels may broach'd

young lords beware an should empress know
chiron care not knew she all world
love lavinia more than all world
demetrius youngling learn thou make some meaner choice
lavina thine elder brother's hope
aaron why are ye mad or know ye not rome

cannot brook competitors love
tell lords do but plot deaths
by this device
would propose achieve her whom love

chiron ay so turn were served
aaron would had hit too

'tis policy stratagem must do
what cannot as would achieve

take this lucrece was not more chaste
than this lavinia bassianus' love
speedier course than ling'ring languishment
must pursue have found path

scene iii
lonely part forest
enter aaron alone bag gold
aaron he had wit would think had none
never after inherit
let him thinks so abjectly
know this gold must coin stratagem
which cunningly effected will beget
very excellent piece villainy
so repose sweet gold their unrest
hides gold
have their alms out empress' chest
enter tamora alone moor
when everything does make gleeful boast
birds chant melody every bush
snakes lie rolled cheerful sun
green leaves quiver cooling wind
make chequer'd shadow ground
under their sweet shade aaron let us sit
while babbling echo mocks hounds
replying shrilly well tund horns
as if double hunt were heard at once
after conflict such as was suppos'd
wand'ring prince dido once enjoyed
when happy storm they were surpris'd
curtaind counsel keeping cave
may each wreathed other's arms
our pastimes done possess golden slumber
whiles hounds horns sweet melodious birds
unto us as nurse's song
lullaby bring her babe asleep
saturn dominator over mine
what signifies deadly standing eye
silence cloudy melancholy
fleece woolly hair now uncurls
even as an adder when she doth unroll
do some fatal execution
no madam these are no venereal signs
vengeance heart death hand
blood revenge are hammering head
which never hopes more heaven than rests thee
this day doom bassianus
his philomel must lose her tongue day
thy sons make pillage her chastity
wash their hands bassianus' blood
seest thou this letter take up pray thee
give king this fatal plotted scroll
now question no more are espied
here comes parcel our hopeful booty
enter bassianus lavinia
tamora ah sweet moor sweeter than life
aaron no more great empress bassianus comes
cross him i'll go fetch thy sons
back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they exit
bassianus who have here rome's royal emperess
unfurnish'd her well beseeming troop
or dian habited her
who hath abandoned her holy groves
tamora saucy controller private steps
had pow'r some say dian had
thy temples should planted presently
horns as was actaeons hounds
should drive upon thy new transformed limbs
unmannerly intruder as thou art
lavinia under patience gentle emperess
'tis thought have goodly gift horning
doubted moor
jove shield husband from his hounds day
'tis pity they should take him stag
bassianus believe queen swarth cimmerian
doth make honour his body's hue
spotted detested abominable
why are sequest'red from all train
dismounted from snow white goodly steed
wand'red hither an obscure plot
accompanied but barbarous moor
lavinia being intercepted sport
great reason noble lord rated
sauciness pray let us hence
let her joy her raven coloured love
this valley fits purpose passing well
bassianus king brother shall have notice this
lavinia ay these slips have made him noted long
good king so mightily abused
tamora why have patience endure all this
demetrius how now dear sovereign our gracious mother
why doth highness look so pale wan
tamora have not reason think look pale
these two have 'ticed hither this place
barren detested vale see
trees though summer yet forlorn lean
overcome moss baleful mistletoe
here never shines sun here nothing breeds
unless nightly owl or fatal raven
they told here at dead time night
thousand fiends thousand hissing snakes
ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
would make such fearful confused cries
as any mortal body hearing
should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
no sooner had they told this hellish tale
but straight they told they would bind here
unto body dismal yew
then they calld foul adulteress
lascivious goth all bitterest terms
ever ear did hear such effect
had not by wondrous fortune come
this vengeance had they executed
revenge as love mother's life
or ye not henceforth calld children
demetrius this witness am thy son
stabs bassianus
also stabs
lavinia ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora
no name fits thy nature but thy own
tamora give poniard shall know boys
mother's hand shall right mother's wrong
demetrius stay madam here more belongs her
first thrash corn then after burn straw
this minion stood upon her chastity
upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
shall she carry this unto her grave
chiron an if she do would were an eunuch
drag hence her husband some secret hole
make his dead trunk pillow our lust
tamora but when ye have honey desire
let not this wasp outlive us both sting
chiron warrant madam will make sure
come mistress now perforce will enjoy
nice preserved honesty yours
tamora will not hear her speak away her
lavinia sweet lords entreat her hear but word
demetrius listen fair madam let glory
see her tears but heart them
as unrelenting flint drops rain
lavinia when did tiger's young ones teach dam
o do not learn her wrath she taught thee
milk thou suck'dst from her did turn marble
even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
chiron do thou entreat her show womans pity
chiron what wouldst thou have prove myself bastard
lavinia 'tis true raven doth not hatch lark
yet have heard o could find now
lion mov'd pity did endure
have his princely paws par'd all away
some say ravens foster forlorn children
whilst their own birds famish their nests
o though thy hard heart say no
tamora know not what means away her
lavinia o let teach thee father's sake
gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
not obdurate open thy deaf ears
tamora hadst thou person ne'er offended
even his sake am pitiless
remember boys pour'd forth tears vain
save brother from sacrifice
but fierce andronicus would not relent
worse her better lov'd
lavinia o tamora calld gentle queen
thine own hands kill this place
'tis not life have begg'd so long
poor was slain when bassianus died
tamora what beg'st thou then fond woman let go
lavinia 'tis present death beg one thing more
womanhood denies tongue tell
o keep from their worse than killing lust
where never mans eye may behold body
do this charitable murderer
tamora so should rob sweet sons their fee
no let them satisfy their lust thee
demetrius away thou hast stay'd us here too long
lavinia no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature
blot enemy our general name
confusion fall
chiron nay then i'll stop mouth bring thou her husband
demetrius throws body
bassianus into pit then exeunt
demetrius chiron dragging off lavinia
tamora farewell sons see make her sure
ne'er let heart know merry cheer indeed
till all andronici made away
now will hence seek lovely moor
let spleenful sons this trull deflower exit
re enter aaron two
aaron come lords better foot before
straight will bring loathsome pit
where espied panther fast asleep
quintus sight very dull whate'er bodes
martius mine promise were not shame
well could leave our sport sleep awhile
falls into pit
quintus what art thou fallen what subtle hole this
whose mouth covered rude growing briers
as fresh as morning dew distilld flowers
very fatal place seems
speak brother hast thou hurt thee fall
martius o brother dismalst object hurt
ever eye sight made heart lament
aaron aside now will fetch king find them here
he thereby may have likely guess
how these were they made away his brother exit
martius why dost not comfort help out
quintus am surprised an uncouth fear
chilling sweat o'er runs trembling joints
heart suspects more than mine eye can see
martius prove thou hast true divining heart
aaron thou look down into this den
see fearful sight blood death
quintus aaron gone compassionate heart
will not permit mine eyes once behold
thing whereat trembles by surmise
was child fear know not what
martius lord bassianus lies beray'd blood
all heap slaughtered lamb
this detested dark blood drinking pit
quintus if dark how dost thou know 'tis he
martius upon his bloody finger he doth wear
precious ring lightens all this hole
which taper some monument
doth shine upon dead mans earthy cheeks
so pale did shine moon pyramus
when he by night lay bath'd maiden blood
o brother help thy fainting hand
if fear hath made thee faint as hath
out this fell devouring receptacle
as hateful as cocytus' misty mouth
quintus reach thy hand may help thee out
or wanting strength do thee so much good
may pluck'd into swallowing womb
have no strength pluck thee brink
martius nor no strength climb without thy help
quintus thy hand once more will not loose again
till thou art here aloft or below
thou canst not come come thee falls
enter emperor aaron moor
saturninus along i'll see what hole here
what he now leapt into
say who art thou lately didst descend
martius unhappy sons old andronicus
brought hither most unlucky hour
find thy brother bassianus dead
saturninus brother dead know thou dost but jest

upon north side this pleasant chase
'tis not an hour since left them there
martius know not where left them all alive
but out alas here have found him dead
attendants titus andronicus lucius

saturninus here tamora though griev'd killing grief
tamora where thy brother bassianus
saturninus now bottom dost thou search wound

aaron gracious lord here bag gold

sirs drag them from pit unto prison
there let them bide until have devis'd
tamora what are they this pit o wondrous thing
how easily murder discovered
titus high emperor upon feeble knee
beg this boon tears not lightly shed
this fell fault accursed sons
accursed if fault prov'd them
saturninus if prov'd see apparent
who found this letter tamora was
tamora andronicus himself did take up
by fathers' reverend tomb vow
they shall ready at highness' will
answer their suspicion their lives
saturninus thou shalt not bail them see thou follow
some bring murdered body some murderers
let them not speak word guilt plain
by soul were there worse end than death
end upon them should executed

marcus who this niece flies away so fast
cousin word where husband
if do wake some planet strike down
may slumber an eternal sleep
speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
hath lopp'd hew'd made thy body bare
her two branches those sweet ornaments
whose circling shadows kings have sought sleep
might not gain so great happiness
as half thy love why dost not speak
alas crimson river warm blood
doth rise fall between thy rosed lips
coming going thy honey breath
but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee
lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
ah now thou turnst away thy face shame
notwithstanding all this loss blood
as from conduit three issuing spouts
yet do thy cheeks look red as titans face
blushing encount'red cloud
o knew thy heart knew beast
might rail at him ease mind
sorrow concealed an oven stopp'd
doth burn heart cinders where
fair philomel why she but lost her tongue
tedious sampler sew'd her mind
but lovely niece mean cut from thee
craftier tereus cousin hast thou met
he hath cut those pretty fingers off
o had monster seen those lily hands
tremble aspen leaves upon lute
make silken strings delight kiss them
he would not then have touch'd them his life
or had he heard heavenly harmony
which sweet tongue hath made
he would have dropp'd his knife fell asleep
as cerberus at thracian poet's feet
come let us go make thy father blind
one hour's storm will drown fragrant meads
what will whole months tears thy father's eyes
do not draw back will mourn thee
o could our mourning case thy misery exeunt
act iii scene
rome street
enter judges tribunes senators titus' two sons
martius quintus bound passing stage place execution
titus going before pleading
pity mine age whose youth was spent
dangerous wars whilst securely slept
all blood rome's great quarrel shed
all frosty nights have watch'd
these bitter tears which now see
filling aged wrinkles cheeks
pitiful condemned sons
whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought
two twenty sons never wept
andronicus lieth down judges
pass by him prisoners exeunt
these tribunes dust write
heart's deep languor souls sad tears
let tears stanch earth's dry appetite
sons' sweet blood will make shame blush
o earth will befriend thee more rain
shall distil from these two ancient urns
than youthful april shall all his show'rs
winter warm tears i'll melt snow
keep eternal spring time thy face
so thou refuse drink dear sons' blood
enter lucius his weapon drawn
o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men
unbind sons reverse doom death
let say never wept before
tears are now prevailing orators
lucius o noble father lament vain
recount sorrows stone
titus ah lucius thy brothers let plead
grave tribunes once more entreat
lucius gracious lord no tribune hears speak
titus why 'tis no matter man if they did hear
they would not mark if they did mark
they would not pity yet plead must
bootless unto them
therefore tell sorrows stones
yet some sort they are better than tribunes
they will not intercept tale
when do weep they humbly at feet
receive tears seem weep
were they but attired grave weeds
rome could afford no tribunes these
stone soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
stone silent offendeth not
tribunes their tongues doom men death
but wherefore stand'st thou thy weapon drawn
lucius rescue two brothers from their death
which attempt judges have pronounc'd
everlasting doom banishment
titus o happy man they have befriended thee
why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive
rome but wilderness tigers
tigers must prey rome affords no prey
but mine how happy art thou then
but who comes our brother marcus here
enter marcus lavinia
marcus titus prepare thy aged eyes weep
or if not so thy noble heart break
bring consuming sorrow thine age
titus will consume let see then
marcus this was thy daughter
titus why marcus so she
lucius ay this object kills
speak lavinia what accursed hand
hath made thee handless thy father's sight
what fool hath added water sea
or brought fagot bright burning troy
grief was at height before thou cam'st
now nilus disdaineth bounds
give sword i'll chop off hands too
they have fought rome all vain
they have nurs'd this woe feeding life
they have serv'd effectless use
now all service require them
one will help cut other
'tis well lavinia thou hast no hands
hands do rome service but vain
lucius speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee
marcus o delightful engine her thoughts
blabb'd them such pleasing eloquence
torn from forth pretty hollow cage
sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
lucius o say thou her who hath done this deed
marcus o thus found her straying park
seeking hide herself as doth deer
hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound
titus was dear he wounded her
hath hurt more than had he killd dead
now stand as one upon rock
environd wilderness sea
expecting ever when some envious surge
will his brinish bowels swallow him
this way death wretched sons are gone
here stands other son banish'd man
here brother weeping at woes
but which gives soul greatest spurn
dear lavinia dearer than soul
had but seen thy picture this plight
would have madded what shall do
thou hast no hands wipe away thy tears
nor tongue tell who hath martyr'd thee
thy husband he dead his death
thy brothers are condemnd dead by this
look marcus ah son lucius look her
when did name her brothers then fresh tears
stood her cheeks as doth honey dew
upon gath'red lily almost withered
marcus perchance she weeps because they killd her husband
titus if they did kill thy husband then joyful
because law hath ta'en revenge them
no no they would not do so foul deed
witness sorrow their sister makes
gentle lavinia let kiss thy lips
or make some sign how may do thee ease
shall thy good uncle thy brother lucius
thou sit round about some fountain
looking all downwards behold our cheeks
miry slime left them by flood
fountain shall gaze so long
till fresh taste taken from clearness
made brine pit our bitter tears
or shall cut away our hands thine
or shall bite our tongues dumb shows
pass remainder our hateful days
what shall do let us have our tongues
plot some device further misery
lucius sweet father cease tears at grief
see how wretched sister sobs weeps

lucius' banishment was wrongfully
they have wish'd lucius were their emperor
tamora why should fear not city strong
saturninus ay but citizens favour lucius
tamora king thy thoughts imperious thy name
sun dimm'd gnats do fly
eagle suffers little birds sing
not careful what they mean thereby
knowing shadow his wings
he can at pleasure stint their melody
even so mayest thou giddy men rome
then cheer thy spirit know thou emperor
will enchant old andronicus
than baits fish or honey stalks sheep
when as one wounded bait
other rotted delicious feed
saturninus but he will not entreat his son us
tamora if tamora entreat him then he will
can smooth fill his aged ears
golden promises were his heart
almost impregnable his old ears deaf
yet should both ear heart obey tongue
say emperor requests parley

act v scene
plains near rome
enter lucius an army goths drums colours
lucius approved warriors faithful friends
have received letters from great rome
how desirous our sight they are
therefore great lords as titles witness
imperious impatient wrongs
wherein rome hath done any scath
let him make treble satisfaction
first goth brave slip sprung from great andronicus
whose name was once our terror now our comfort
whose high exploits honourable deeds
ingrateful rome requites foul contempt
stinging bees hottest summer's day
led by their master flow'red fields
aveng'd cursed tamora
all goths as he saith so say all him
lucius humbly thank him thank all
but who comes here led by lusty goth
enter goth leading aaron his child his arms
second goth renowned lucius from our troops stray'd
gaze upon ruinous monastery
upon wasted building suddenly
heard child cry underneath wall
made unto noise when soon heard
crying babe controlld this discourse
'peace tawny slave half half thy dam
did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
had nature lent thee but thy mother's look
villain thou mightst have been an emperor
but where bull cow are both milk white
peace villain peace' even thus he rates babe
'for must bear thee trusty goth
who when he knows thou art empress' babe
will hold thee dearly thy mother's sake'
this weapon drawn rush'd upon him
surpris'd him suddenly brought him hither
use as think needful man
lucius o worthy goth this incarnate devil
robb'd andronicus his good hand
here's base fruit her burning lust
say wall ey'd slave whither wouldst thou convey
this growing image thy fiend face
why dost not speak what deaf not word
halter soldiers hang him this tree
by his side his fruit bastardy
aaron touch not boy he royal blood
lucius too sire ever being good
first hang child he may see sprawl
get ladder
ladder brought which aaron made climb
aaron lucius save child
bear from emperess
if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things
highly may advantage thee hear
if thou wilt not befall what may befall
i'll speak no more but 'vengeance rot all'
lucius say an if please which thou speak'st
aaron an if please thee why assure thee lucius
'twill vex thy soul hear what shall speak
must talk murders rapes massacres
acts black night abominable deeds
complots mischief treason villainies
ruthful hear yet piteously perform'd
this shall all buried death
unless thou swear child shall live
lucius tell thy mind say thy child shall live
lucius who should swear by thou believest no god
granted how canst thou believe an oath
aaron what if do not as indeed do not
yet know thou art religious
hast thing within thee called conscience
twenty popish tricks ceremonies
which have seen thee careful observe
therefore urge thy oath know
an idiot holds his bauble god
i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow
by same god what god soe'er
thou adorest hast reverence
save boy nourish bring him up
or else will discover nought thee
lucius even by god swear thee will
aaron first know thou begot him empress
lucius o most insatiate luxurious woman
aaron tut lucius this was but deed charity
'twas her two sons murdered bassianus
they cut thy sister's tongue ravish'd her
cut her hands trimm'd her as thou sawest
lucius o detestable villain callst thou trimming
aaron why she was wash'd cut trimm'd 'twas
trim sport them which had doing
lucius o barbarous beastly villains thyself
aaron indeed was their tutor instruct them
codding spirit had they from their mother
bloody mind think they learnd
as true dog as ever fought at head
well let deeds witness worth
traind thy brethren guileful hole
where dead corpse bassianus lay
wrote letter thy father found
hid gold within letter mentiond
confederate queen her two sons
what not done thou hast cause rue
play'd cheater thy father's hand
when had drew myself apart
almost broke heart extreme laughter
pried through crevice wall
when his hand he had his two sons' heads
beheld his tears laugh'd so heartily
both mine eyes were rainy his
when told empress this sport
she swooned almost at pleasing tale
goth what canst thou say all this never blush
aaron ay black dog as saying
lucius art thou not sorry these heinous deeds
aaron ay had not done thousand more
even now curse day yet think
few come within compass curse
wherein did not some notorious ill
as kill man or else devise his death
ravish maid or plot way do
set deadly enmity between two friends
make poor mens cattle break their necks
set fire barns hay stacks night
bid owners quench them their tears
oft have digg'd up dead men from their graves
set them upright at their dear friends' door
even when their sorrows almost was forgot
their skins as bark trees
have knife carved roman letters
tut have done thousand dreadful things
as willingly as one would kill fly
nothing grieves heartily indeed
but cannot do ten thousand more
lucius bring down devil he must not die
so sweet death as hanging presently
aaron if there devils would were devil
live burn everlasting fire
so might have company hell
lucius sirs stop his mouth let him speak no more
enter aemilius

this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf
these broken limbs again into one body
lest rome herself bane unto herself
she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy
forlorn desperate castaway
do shameful execution herself
but if frosty signs chaps age
grave witnesses true experience
lucius speak rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor
when his solemn tongue he did discourse
love sick dido's sad attending ear
story baleful burning night
when subtle greeks surpris'd king priam's troy
tell us what sinon hath bewitch'd our ears
or who hath brought fatal engine
gives our troy our rome civil wound
heart not compact flint nor steel
but floods tears will drown oratory
break utt'rance even time
when should move ye attend most
force commiseration
here's rome's young captain let him tell tale
while stand by weep hear him speak
lucius then gracious auditory known
chiron damnd demetrius
were they murd'red our emperor's brother
their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
our father's tears despis'd basely cozend
true hand fought rome's quarrel out
sent her enemies unto grave
lastly myself unkindly banished
gates shut turnd weeping out
beg relief among rome's enemies
who drownd their enmity true tears
op'd their arms embrace as friend
have preserv'd her welfare blood
from her bosom took enemy's point
sheathing steel advent'rous body
alas know am no vaunter
scars can witness dumb although they are
report just full truth
but soft methinks do digress too much
citing worthless praise o pardon
when no friends are by men praise themselves
pointing child an attendant's arms
this was tamora delivered
issue an irreligious moor
chief architect plotter these woes
villain alive titus' house
damnd as he witness this true
now judge what cause had titus revenge
these wrongs unspeakable past patience
or more than any living man could bear
have done aught amiss show us wherein
from place where behold us pleading
poor remainder andronici
will hand hand all headlong hurl ourselves
ragged stones beat forth our souls
make mutual closure our house
speak romans speak if say shall
lo hand hand lucius will fall
aemilius come come thou reverend man rome
lucius our emperor well know
common voice do cry shall so
all lucius all hail rome's royal emperor
marcus go go into old titus' sorrowful house
hither hale misbelieving moor
adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death
as punishment his most wicked life exeunt some
attendants lucius marcus others descend
all lucius all hail rome's gracious governor
heal rome's harms wipe away her woe
but gentle people give aim awhile
nature puts heavy task
stand all aloof but uncle draw near
shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
o take this warm kiss thy pale cold lips kisses titus
these sorrowful drops upon thy blood staind face
last true duties thy noble son
marcus tear tear loving kiss kiss
o were sum these should pay
countless infinite yet would pay them
lucius come hither boy come come come learn us
melt showers thy grandsire lov'd thee well
many time he danc'd thee his knee
sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
many story hath he told thee
bid thee bear his pretty tales mind
talk them when he was dead gone
when they were living warm'd themselves thine
o now sweet boy give them their latest kiss
bid him farewell commit him grave
do them kindness take leave them
boy o grandsire grandsire ev'n all heart
would were dead so did live again
o lord cannot speak him weeping
tears will choke if ope mouth
re enter attendants aaron
give sentence execrable wretch
hath been breeder these dire events
lucius set him breast deep earth famish him
there let him stand rave cry food
if any one relieves or pities him
offence he dies this our doom
some stay see him fast'ned earth
aaron ah why should wrath mute fury dumb
am no baby base prayers
ten thousand worse than ever yet did
would perform if might have will
if one good deed all life did
do repent from very soul
lucius some loving friends convey emperor hence
give him burial his father's grave
father lavinia shall forthwith
closed our household's monument
as ravenous tiger tamora
no mournful bell shall ring her burial
but throw her forth beasts birds prey
her life was beastly devoid pity
being dead let birds her take pity exeunt

troy there lies scene from isles greece
princes orgillous their high blood chaf'd
have port athens sent their ships
cruel war sixty nine wore
their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
put forth toward phrygia their vow made
ransack troy within whose strong immures
ravish'd helen menelaus' queen
wanton paris sleeps that's quarrel
tenedos they come
deep drawing barks do there disgorge
their war fraughtage now dardan plains
their brave pavilions priam's six gated city
dardan tymbria helias chetas troien
antenorides massy staples
corresponsive fulfilling bolts
sperr up sons troy
now expectation tickling skittish spirits
one other side troyan greek
sets all hazard hither am come
prologue arm'd but not confidence
conditions as our argument
tell fair beholders our play
leaps o'er vaunt firstlings those broils
beginning middle starting thence away
what may digested play
or find fault do as pleasures are
now good or bad 'tis but chance war
act scene 1
troy before priam's palace
troilus call here varlet i'll unarm again
why should war without walls troy
find such cruel battle here within
each troyan master his heart
let him field troilus alas hath none
pandarus will this gear ne'er mended
troilus greeks are strong skilful their strength
fierce their skill their fierceness valiant
but am weaker than womans tear
less valiant than virgin night
skilless as unpractis'd infancy
pandarus well have told enough this part
i'll not meddle nor make no farther he will have cake
out wheat must needs tarry grinding
troilus have not tarried
pandarus ay grinding but must tarry bolting
troilus have not tarried
pandarus ay bolting but must tarry leavening
pandarus ay leavening but here's yet word
'hereafter' kneading making cake heating
oven baking nay must stay cooling too
or may chance burn lips
troilus patience herself what goddess e'er she
doth lesser blench at suff'rance than do
at priam's royal table do sit
when fair cressid comes into thoughts
so traitor then she comes when she thence
look or any woman else
troilus was about tell thee when heart
as wedged sigh would rive twain
lest hector or father should perceive
have as when sun doth light storm
buried this sigh wrinkle smile
but sorrow couch'd seeming gladness
mirth fate turns sudden sadness
pandarus an her hair were not somewhat darker than helens well
part she kinswoman would not as they term
praise her but would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as
did will not dispraise sister cassandra's wit but
troilus o pandarus tell thee pandarus
when do tell thee there hopes lie drownd
reply not how many fathoms deep
they lie indrench'd tell thee am mad
cressid's love thou answer'st 'she fair'
pourest open ulcer heart
handlest thy discourse o her hand
whose comparison all whites are ink
writing their own reproach whose soft seizure
cygnet's down harsh spirit sense
hard as palm ploughman this thou tellst
as true thou tellst when say love her
but saying thus instead oil balm
thou lay'st every gash love hath given
knife made
troilus thou dost not speak so much
pandarus faith i'll not meddle let her as she if
she fair 'tis better her an she not she has
mends her own hands
troilus good pandarus how now pandarus
pandarus have had labour travail ill thought
her ill thought gone between between but
small thanks labour
troilus what art thou angry pandarus what
helen an she were not kin she would as fair friday
as helen sunday but what care care not an she were
blackamoor 'tis all one
troilus say she not fair
pandarus do not care whether do or no she's fool stay
behind her father let her greeks so i'll tell her
next time see her part i'll meddle nor make no
more i' th' matter
troilus pandarus
troilus sweet pandarus
pandarus pray speak no more will leave all
as found there an end exit sound alarum
troilus peace ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
fools both sides helen must needs fair
when blood daily paint her thus
cannot fight upon this argument
too starv'd subject sword
but pandarus o gods how do plague
he's as tetchy woo'd woo
as she stubborn chaste against all suit
tell apollo thy daphne's love
what cressid what pandar what
her bed india there she lies pearl
between our ilium where she resides
let calld wild wand'ring flood
ourself merchant this sailing pandar
our doubtful hope our convoy our bark
aeneas how now prince troilus wherefore not afield
troilus because not there this womans answer sorts
womanish from thence
what news aeneas from field day
aeneas paris returned home hurt
troilus by whom aeneas
aeneas troilus by menelaus
troilus let paris bleed 'tis but scar scorn
paris gor'd menelaus' horn alarum
troilus better at home if 'would might' were 'may'
but sport abroad are bound thither
aeneas all swift haste
troilus come go then together exeunt

grow veins actions highest rear'd
as knots by conflux meeting sap
infects sound pine diverts his grain
tortive errant from his course growth
come short our suppose so far
after seven years' siege yet troy walls stand
sith every action hath gone before
whereof have record trial did draw
bias thwart not answering aim
unbodied figure thought
gave't surmised shape why then princes
do cheeks abash'd behold our works
call them shames which are indeed nought else
find persistive constancy men
fineness which metal not found
fortune's love then bold coward
wise fool artist unread
hard soft seem all affind kin
but wind tempest her frown
distinction broad powerful fan
puffing at all winnows light away
what hath mass or matter by itself
nestor due observance thy godlike seat
great agamemnon nestor shall apply
thy latest words reproof chance
lies true proof men sea being smooth
how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
upon her patient breast making their way
those nobler bulk
but let ruffian boreas once enrage
gentle thetis anon behold
bounding between two moist elements
perseus' horse where's then saucy boat
whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
co rivalld greatness either harbour fled
or made toast neptune even so
doth valour's show valour's worth divide
storms fortune her ray brightness
herd hath more annoyance by breeze
than by tiger but when splitting wind
flies fled under shade why then thing courage
as rous'd rage rage doth sympathise
an accent tund self same key
retorts chiding fortune
ulysses agamemnon
thou great commander nerve bone greece
heart our numbers soul only spirit
whom tempers minds all
should shut up hear what ulysses speaks
which agamemnon most mighty thy place sway
nestor thou most reverend thy stretch'd out life
give both speeches which were such
as agamemnon hand greece
should hold up high brass such again
as venerable nestor hatch'd silver
should bond air strong as axle tree
which heaven rides knit all greekish ears
his experienc'd tongue yet let please both
agamemnon speak prince ithaca be't less expect
matter needless importless burden
divide thy lips than are confident
when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
shall hear music wit oracle
ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down
great hector's sword had lack'd master
but these instances
specialty rule hath been neglected
hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
when general not hive
whom foragers shall all repair
what honey expected degree being vizarded
th' unworthiest shows as fairly mask
heavens themselves planets this centre
observe degree priority place
insisture course proportion season form
office custom all line order
noble eminence enthrond spher'd
amidst other whose med'cinable eye
corrects ill aspects planets evil
posts commandment king
sans check good bad but when planets
evil mixture disorder wander
what plagues what portents what mutiny
what raging sea shaking earth
commotion winds frights changes horrors
unity married calm states
quite from their fixture o when degree shak'd
which ladder all high designs
enterprise sick how could communities
degrees schools brotherhoods cities
peaceful commerce from dividable shores
primogenity due birth
prerogative age crowns sceptres laurels
but by degree stand authentic place
hark what discord follows each thing melts
mere oppugnancy bounded waters
should lift their bosoms higher than shores
make sop all this solid globe
strength should lord imbecility
rude son should strike his father dead
force should right or rather right wrong
between whose endless jar justice resides
should lose their names so should justice too
power into will will into appetite
appetite an universal wolf
so doubly seconded will power
must make perforce an universal prey
last eat up himself great agamemnon
this chaos when degree suffocate
follows choking
this neglection degree
by pace goes backward purpose
by him one step below he by next
next by him beneath so ever step
exampld by first pace sick
his superior grows an envious fever
pale bloodless emulation
'tis this fever keeps troy foot
not her own sinews end tale length
troy our weakness stands not her strength
nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
agamemnon nature sickness found ulysses
what remedy
ulysses great achilles whom opinion crowns
sinew forehand our host
having his ear full his airy fame
grows dainty his worth his tent
lies mocking our designs him patroclus
upon lazy bed livelong day
breaks scurril jests
which slanderer he imitation calls
he pageants us sometime great agamemnon
thy topless deputation he puts
strutting player whose conceit
lies his hamstring doth think rich
hear wooden dialogue sound
'twixt his stretch'd footing scaffoldage
such pitied o'er wrested seeming
he acts thy greatness when he speaks
which from tongue roaring typhon dropp'd
would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff
large achilles his press'd bed lolling
from his deep chest laughs out loud applause
cries 'excellent 'tis agamemnon just
now play nestor hem stroke thy beard
as he being drest some oration'
that's done as near as extremest ends
parallels as vulcan his wife
'tis nestor right now play him patroclus
arming answer night alarm'
then forsooth faint defects age
must scene mirth cough spit
palsy fumbling his gorget
shake out rivet at this sport
sir valour dies cries 'o enough patroclus
or give ribs steel shall split all
pleasure spleen' this fashion
severals generals grace exact
achievements plots orders preventions
excitements field or speech truce
success or loss what or not serves
as stuff these two make paradoxes
nestor imitation these twain
who as ulysses says opinion crowns
an imperial voice many are infect
ajax grown self willd bears his head
as broad achilles keeps his tent him
makes factious feasts rails our state war
bold as an oracle sets thersites
slave whose gall coins slanders mint
match us comparisons dirt
weaken discredit our exposure
how rank soever rounded danger
ulysses they tax our policy call cowardice
count wisdom as no member war
but hand still mental parts
do contrive how many hands shall strike
when fitness calls them know by measure
their observant toil enemies' weight
why this hath not finger's dignity
they call this bed work mapp'ry closet war
so ram batters down wall
great swinge rudeness his poise
they place before his hand made engine
by reason guide his execution
nestor let this granted achilles' horse
makes many thetis' sons tucket
agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus
menelaus from troy
enter aeneas
agamemnon what would fore our tent
aeneas this great agamemnons tent pray
agamemnon even this
do fair message his kingly eyes
agamemnon surety stronger than achilles' an
fore all greekish heads which one voice
call agamemnon head general
aeneas fair leave large security how may
stranger those most imperial looks
know them from eyes other mortals
agamemnon how
aeneas ay
bid cheek ready blush
modest as morning when she coldly eyes
youthful phoebus
which god office guiding men
which high mighty agamemnon
agamemnon this troyan scorns us or men troy
are ceremonious courtiers
aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
as bending angels that's their fame peace
good arms strong joints true swords jove's accord
nothing so full heart but peace aeneas
peace troyan lay thy finger thy lips
worthiness praise distains his worth
if prais'd himself bring praise forth
but what repining enemy commends
breath fame blows praise sole pure transcends
agamemnon sir troy call yourself aeneas
aeneas ay greek name
aeneas sir pardon 'tis agamemnons ears
agamemnon he hears nought privately comes from troy
aeneas nor from troy come not whisper him
bring trumpet awake his ear
set his sense attentive bent
then speak
agamemnon speak frankly as wind
not agamemnons sleeping hour
thou shalt know troyan he awake
aeneas trumpet blow loud
send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
every greek mettle let him know
what troy means fairly shall spoke aloud
sound trumpet
have great agamemnon here troy
prince called hector priam his father
who this dull long continued truce
resty grown he bade take trumpet
if there one among fair'st greece
holds his honour higher than his ease
seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
knows his valour knows not his fear
loves his mistress more than confession
truant vows her own lips he loves
dare avow her beauty her worth
other arms than hers him this challenge
hector view troyans greeks
he hath lady wiser fairer truer
than ever greek did couple his arms
will morrow his trumpet call
mid way between tents walls troy
rouse grecian true love
if any come hector shall honour him
if none he'll say troy when he retires
grecian dames are sunburnt not worth
splinter lance even so much
if none them have soul such kind
left them all at home but are soldiers
may soldier mere recreant prove
means not hath not or not love
if then one or hath or means
one meets hector if none else am he
nestor tell him nestor one was man
when hector's grandsire suck'd he old now
but if there not our grecian mould
answer his love tell him from
i'll hide silver beard gold beaver
vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
meeting him will tell him lady
was fairer than his grandame as chaste
as may world his youth flood
i'll prove this truth three drops blood
aeneas now heavens forfend such scarcity youth
ulysses amen
our pavilion shall lead first
achilles shall have word this intent
so shall each lord greece from tent tent
yourself shall feast us before go
find welcome noble foe
exeunt all but ulysses nestor
ulysses nestor
nestor what says ulysses
ulysses have young conception brain
nestor what is't
ulysses this 'tis
blunt wedges rive hard knots seeded pride
hath this maturity blown up
rank achilles must or now cropp'd
or shedding breed nursery evil
overbulk us all
nestor well how
ulysses this challenge gallant hector sends
relates purpose only achilles
nestor true purpose perspicuous even as substance
whose grossness little characters sum up
publication make no strain
but achilles were his brain as barren
as banks libya though apollo knows
'tis dry enough will great speed judgment
ay celerity find hector's purpose
pointing him
nestor why 'tis most meet who may else oppose
can from hector bring those honours off
if not achilles though 't sportful combat
yet this trial much opinion dwells
here troyans taste our dear'st repute
their finst palate trust ulysses
our imputation shall oddly pois'd
this vile action success
although particular shall give scantling
such indexes although small pricks
their subsequent volumes there seen
baby figure giant mas
things come at large suppos'd
he meets hector issues from our choice
choice being mutual act all our souls
makes merit her election doth boil
as 'twere from forth us all man distilld
out our virtues who miscarrying
steel strong opinion themselves
which entertaind limbs are his instruments
no less working than are swords bows
directive by limbs
ulysses give pardon speech
therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector
let us merchants show our foulest wares
think perchance they'll sell if not lustre
better yet show shall show better
ever hector achilles meet
both our honour our shame this
are dogg'd two strange followers
nestor see them not old eyes what are they
ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector
were he not proud all should wear him
but he already too insolent
were better parch afric sun
than pride salt scorn his eyes
why then do our main opinion crush
taint our best man no make lott'ry
by device let blockish ajax draw
sort fight hector among ourselves
give him allowance better man
will physic great myrmidon
who broils loud applause make him fall
his crest prouder than blue iris bends
if dull brainless ajax come safe off
yet go under our opinion still
have better men but hit or miss
our project's life this shape sense assumes
ajax employ'd plucks down achilles' plumes
nestor now ulysses begin relish thy advice
will give taste thereof forthwith
agamemnon go him straight
two curs shall tame each other pride alone

priam after so many hours lives speeches spent
'deliver helen all damage else
as honour loss time travail expense
wounds friends what else dear consum'd
hot digestion this cormorant war
shall struck off' hector what say to't
hector though no man lesser fears greeks than
as far as toucheth particular
yet dread priam
there no lady more softer bowels
more ready cry out 'who knows what follows'
than hector wound peace surety
surety secure but modest doubt calld
beacon wise tent searches
th' bottom worst let helen go
since first sword was drawn about this question
every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
hath been as dear as helen mean ours
if have lost so many tenths ours
had our name value one ten
what merit's reason which denies
yielding her up
troilus fie fie brother
weigh worth honour king
so great as our dread father's scale
common ounces will counters sum
past proportion his infinite
buckle waist most fathomless
as fears reasons fie godly shame
helenus no marvel though bite so sharp at reasons
are so empty them should not our father
bear great sway his affairs reasons
because speech hath none tells him so
troilus are dreams slumbers brother priest
fur gloves reason here are reasons
know an enemy intends harm
know sword employ'd perilous
who marvels then when helenus beholds
grecian his sword if he do set
very wings reason his heels
fly chidden mercury from jove
or star disorb'd nay if talk reason
let's shut our gates sleep manhood honour
should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts
this cramm'd reason reason respect
make livers pale lustihood deject
keeping
troilus what's aught but as 'tis valued
hector but value dwells not particular will
holds his estimate dignity
as well wherein 'tis precious itself
as prizer 'tis mad idolatry
make service greater than god
will dotes attributive
what infectiously itself affects
troilus take day wife election
led conduct will
will enkindled by mine eyes ears
two traded pilots 'twixt dangerous shores
will judgment how may avoid
although will distaste what elected
wife chose there can no evasion
blench from this stand firm by honour
turn not back silks upon merchant
do not throw unrespective sieve
because now are full was thought meet
paris should do some vengeance greeks
breath full consent benied his sails
seas winds old wranglers took truce
did him service he touch'd ports desir'd
an old aunt whom greeks held captive
he brought grecian queen whose youth freshness
wrinkles apollo's makes stale morning
she worth keeping why she pearl
whose price hath launch'd above thousand ships
turnd crownd kings merchants
if you'll avouch 'twas wisdom paris went
as must needs all cried 'go go'
if you'll confess he brought home worthy prize
as must needs all clapp'd hands
cried 'inestimable' why do now
issue proper wisdoms rate

hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains
divination our sister work
some touches remorse or blood
so madly hot no discourse reason
nor fear bad success bad cause
troilus why brother hector
may not think justness each act
such no other than event doth form
nor once deject courage our minds
because cassandra's mad her brain sick raptures
cannot distaste goodness quarrel
which hath our several honours all engag'd
make gracious private part
am no more touch'd than all priam's sons
such things as might offend weakest spleen
fight maintain
paris else might world convince levity
as well undertakings as counsels
but attest gods full consent
gave wings propension cut
all fears attending so dire project
what alas can these single arms
what propugnation one mans valour
this quarrel would excite yet protest
were alone pass difficulties
had as ample power as have will
paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
nor faint pursuit
priam paris speak
one besotted sweet delights
have honey still but these gall
so valiant no praise at all
pleasures such beauty brings
but would have soil her fair rape
wip'd off honourable keeping her
what treason were ransack'd queen
disgrace great worths shame
now deliver her possession up
terms base compulsion can
so degenerate strain as this
should once set footing generous bosoms
without heart dare or sword draw
when helen defended nor none so noble
whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
where helen subject then say
well may fight her whom know well
world's large spaces cannot parallel
hector paris troilus have both said well
cause question now hand
have gloz'd but superficially not much
unfit hear moral philosophy
reasons allege do more conduce
hot passion distemp'red blood
than make up free determination
'twixt right wrong pleasure revenge
have ears more deaf than adders voice
any true decision nature craves
all dues rend'red their owners now
what nearer debt all humanity
nature corrupted through affection
great minds partial indulgence
their benumbed wills resist same
there law each well order'd nation
curb those raging appetites are
most disobedient refractory
if helen then wife sparta's king
as known she these moral laws
nature nations speak aloud
doing wrong extenuates not wrong
but makes much more heavy hector's opinion
this way truth yet ne'er less
spritely brethren propend
resolution keep helen still
'tis cause hath no mean dependence
upon our joint several dignities
troilus why there touch'd life our design
were not glory more affected
would not wish drop troyan blood
spent more her defence but worthy hector
she theme honour renown
spur valiant magnanimous deeds
whose present courage may beat down our foes
fame time come canonize us
presume brave hector would not lose
so rich advantage promis'd glory
as smiles upon forehead this action

agamemnon what wouldst thou us troyan make demand
calchas have troyan prisoner calld antenor
yesterday took troy holds him very dear
desir'd cressid right great exchange
whom troy hath still denied but this antenor
know such wrest their affairs
their negotiations all must slack
wanting his manage they will almost
give us prince blood son priam
change him let him sent great princes
he shall buy daughter her presence

he shall as soon read eyes others
as feel his own fall men butterflies
show not their mealy wings but summer
not man being simply man
hath any honour but honour those honours
are without him as place riches favour
prizes accident as oft as merit
which when they fall as being slippery standers
doth one pluck down another together
die fall but 'tis not so
fortune are friends do enjoy
at ample point all did possess
save these mens looks who do methinks find out
something not worth such rich beholding
as they have often given here ulysses
i'll interrupt his reading
how now ulysses
achilles what are reading
ulysses strange fellow here
writes man how dearly ever parted
how much having or without or
cannot make boast have which he hath
nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
as when his virtues shining upon others
heat them they retort heat again
first giver
beauty borne here face
bearer knows not but commends itself
others' eyes nor doth eye itself
most pure spirit sense behold itself
not going from itself but eye eye opposed
salutes each other each other's form
speculation turns not itself
till hath travelld mirror'd there
where may see itself this not strange at all
familiar but at author's drift
who his circumstance expressly proves
no man lord anything
though him there much consisting
till he communicate his parts others
nor doth he himself know them aught
till he behold them formed th' applause
where th' are extended who an arch reverb'rate
voice again or gate steel
his figure his heat was much rapt this
apprehended here immediately
th' unknown ajax heavens what man there
very horse has he knows not what
nature what things there are
most abject regard dear use
what things again most dear esteem
poor worth now shall see morrow
an act very chance doth throw upon him
while some men leave do
how some men creep skittish fortune's hall
whiles others play idiots her eyes
how one man eats into another's pride
while pride fasting his wantonness
see these grecian lords why even already
they clap lubber ajax shoulder
as if his foot were brave hector's breast
great troy shrinking
as misers do by beggars neither gave
good word nor look what are deeds forgot
ulysses time hath lord wallet at his back
wherein he puts alms oblivion
great siz'd monster ingratitudes
those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
as fast as they are made forgot as soon
as done perseverance dear lord
keeps honour bright have done hang
monumental mock'ry take instant way
honour travels strait so narrow
where one but goes abreast keep then path
emulation hath thousand sons
one by one pursue if give way
or hedge aside from direct forthright
an ent'red tide they all rush by
leave hindmost
or gallant horse falln first rank
o'er run trampled then what they do present
though less than yours past must o'ertop yours
time fashionable host
slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand
his arms out stretch'd as he would fly
grasps corner welcome ever smiles
farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek
remuneration thing was
beauty wit
love friendship charity are subjects all
envious calumniating time
one touch nature makes whole world kin
all one consent praise new born gawds
though they are made moulded things past
give dust little gilt
more laud than gilt o'er dusted
present eye praises present object
then marvel not thou great complete man
since things motion sooner catch eye
than what stirs not cry went once thee

if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
case thy reputation thy tent
whose glorious deeds but these fields late
made emulous missions 'mongst gods themselves

'tis known achilles are love

providence that's watchful state
knows almost every grain plutus' gold
finds bottom th' uncomprehensive deeps
do thoughts unveil their dumb cradles
there mystery whom relation
durst never meddle soul state
which hath an operation more divine
than breath or pen can give expressure
all commerce have had troy
as perfectly ours as yours lord
better would fit achilles much
throw down hector than polyxena
when fame shall our island sound her trump
all greekish girls shall tripping sing
'great hector's sister did achilles win
but our great ajax bravely beat down him'
farewell lord as lover speak

patroclus this effect achilles have mov'd
woman impudent mannish grown

patroclus ay perhaps receive much honour by him
achilles see reputation at stake

what he has he gives what thinks he shows
yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
nor dignifies an impair thought breath
manly as hector but more dangerous
tender objects but he heat action
more vindicative than jealous love
they call him troilus him erect
second hope as fairly built as hector
thus says aeneas one knows youth
even his inches private soul
did great ilion thus translate him
alarum hector ajax fight

ajax thank thee hector

great addition earned thy death

whose bright crest fame her loud'st oyes
cries 'this he' could promise himself
thought added honour torn from hector
aeneas there expectance here from both sides
what further will do
hector we'll answer
ajax if might entreaties find success

famous cousin our grecian tents
diomedes 'tis agamemnons wish great achilles

menelaus name her not now sir she's deadly theme
hector o pardon offend
nestor have thou gallant troyan seen thee oft
labouring destiny make cruel way
through ranks greekish youth have seen thee
despising many forfeits subduements
when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air
not letting decline declined
have said some standers by
'lo jupiter yonder dealing life'
have seen thee pause take thy breath
when ring greeks have hemm'd thee
an olympian wrestling this have seen
but this thy countenance still lock'd steel
once fought him he was soldier good
but by great mars captain us all
never thee o let an old man embrace thee
worthy warrior welcome our tents
aeneas 'tis old nestor
hector let embrace thee good old chronicle

hector know favour lord ulysses well
ah sir there's many greek troyan dead
since first saw yourself diomed
ulysses sir foretold then what would ensue
prophecy but half his journey yet
yonder walls pertly front town
yond towers whose wanton tops do buss clouds

hector o book sport thou'lt read o'er
but there's more than thou understand'st
why dost thou so oppress thine eye
shall destroy him whether there or there or there
may give local wound name
make distinct very breach whereout
hector's great spirit flew answer heavens
hector would discredit blest gods proud man
answer such question stand again
think'st thou catch life so pleasantly
as prenominate nice conjecture
where thou wilt hit dead
hector wert thou an oracle tell so
i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well
i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
but by forge stithied mars his helm
i'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er o'er
wisest grecians pardon this brag
his insolence draws folly from lips
but i'll endeavour deeds match these words

achilles let these threats alone

if injuries justly weigh'd
olivia alas poor fool how have they baffld thee
clown why 'some are born great some achieve greatness some
have greatness thrown upon them' was one sir this
interlude one sir topas sir but that's all one 'by lord

love hath chas'd sleep from enthralled eyes

these affairs aid thy counsel
proteus go before shall enquire forth
must unto road disembark
some necessaries needs must use
valentine will make haste
proteus will exit valentine
even as one heat another heat expels
or as one nail by strength drives out another
so remembrance former love
by newer object quite forgotten
mind or valentinus' praise
her true perfection or false transgression
makes reasonless reason thus
did love now love thaw'd
which waxen image 'gainst fire
bears no impression thing was
methinks zeal valentine cold
love him not as was wont
o but love his lady too too much
that's reason love him so little
how shall dote her more advice
thus without advice begin love her
hath dazzled reasons light
but when look her perfections
there no reason but shall blind
if can check erring love will
if not compass her i'll use skill exit

ev'n kind love do conjure thee
who art table wherein all thoughts
lesson tell some good mean
how honour may undertake
journey loving proteus
lucetta alas way wearisome long
julia true devoted pilgrim not weary
measure kingdoms his feeble steps
much less shall she hath love's wings fly
when flight made one so dear
such divine perfection as sir proteus
julia o know'st thou not his looks are souls food
pity dearth have pined
by longing food so long time
didst thou but know inly touch love
thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire snow
as seek quench fire love words
lucetta do not seek quench love's hot fire
but qualify fire's extreme rage
lest should burn above bounds reason
current gentle murmur glides
thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
but when his fair course not hindered
he makes sweet music th' enamelld stones
giving gentle kiss every sedge
he overtaketh his pilgrimage
so by many winding nooks he strays
willing sport wild ocean
then let go hinder not course
make pastime each weary step
till last step have brought love
there i'll rest as after much turmoil
blessed soul doth elysium
lucetta but what habit will go along
julia not woman would prevent
loose encounters lascivious men
gentle lucetta fit such weeds
as may beseem some well reputed page
julia no girl i'll knit up silken strings
twenty odd conceited true love knots
fantastic may become youth
greater time than shall show
lucetta what fashion madam shall make breeches
julia fits as well as 'tell good lord
what compass will wear farthingale'
why ev'n what fashion thou best likes lucetta
lucetta must needs have them codpiece madam
lucetta round hose madam now's not worth pin
unless have codpiece stick pins
julia lucetta as thou lov'st let have
what thou think'st meet most mannerly
but tell wench how will world repute
undertaking so unstaid journey
fear will make scandaliz'd
lucetta if think so then stay at home go not
julia nay will not
if proteus journey when come
no matter who's displeas'd when are gone
fear he will scarce pleas'd withal
julia least lucetta fear
thousand oaths an ocean his tears
instances infinite love
warrant welcome proteus
lucetta all these are servants deceitful men
julia base men use them so base effect
his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
lucetta pray heav'n he prove so when come him
julia now as thou lov'st do him not wrong
bear hard opinion his truth
only deserve love by loving him
presently go chamber
furnish upon longing journey

act iii scene
milan duke's palace
enter duke thurio proteus
have some secrets confer about exit thurio
now tell proteus what's will
proteus gracious lord which would discover
law friendship bids conceal
but when call mind gracious favours
done undeserving as am
duty pricks utter
which else no worldly good should draw from
know worthy prince sir valentine friend
myself am one made privy plot
know have determind bestow her
thurio whom gentle daughter hates
should she thus stoln away from
would much vexation age
thus duty's sake rather chose
cross friend his intended drift
than by concealing heap head
pack sorrows which would press down
duke proteus thank thee thine honest care
which requite command while live
this love theirs myself have often seen
haply when they have judg'd fast asleep
oftentimes have purpos'd forbid
sir valentine her company court
but fearing lest jealous aim might err
so unworthily disgrace man
rashness ever yet have shunnd
which thyself hast now disclos'd
thou mayst perceive fear this
knowing tender youth soon suggested
nightly lodge her an upper tow'r
key whereof myself have ever kept
thence she cannot convey'd away
proteus know noble lord they have devis'd mean
how he her chamber window will ascend
corded ladder fetch her down
this way comes he presently
where if please may intercept him
but good lord do so cunningly
discovery not aimed at
love not hate unto friend
hath made publisher this pretence
duke upon mine honour he shall never know
had any light from thee this
proteus adieu lord sir valentine coming exit
duke sir valentine whither away so fast
valentine please grace there messenger
stays bear letters friends
am going deliver them
duke they much import
valentine tenour them doth but signify
health happy being at court
duke nay then no matter stay awhile
am break thee some affairs
'tis not unknown thee have sought
match friend sir thurio daughter
valentine know well lord sure match
were rich honourable besides gentleman
full virtue bounty worth qualities
beseeming such wife as fair daughter
cannot grace win her fancy him
duke no trust she peevish sullen froward
proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
nor fearing as if were her father
may say thee this pride hers
upon advice hath drawn love from her
where thought remnant mine age
should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty
now am full resolv'd take wife
turn her out who will take her
then let her beauty her wedding dow'r
possessions she esteems not
duke there lady verona here
whom affect but she nice coy
nought esteems aged eloquence
now therefore would have thee tutor
long agone have forgot court
besides fashion time chang'd
how which way may bestow myself
regarded her sun bright eye
valentine win her gifts if she respect not words
more than quick words do move womans mind
duke but she did scorn present sent her
valentine woman sometime scorns what best contents her
send her another never give her o'er
scorn at first makes after love more
if she do frown 'tis not hate
but rather beget more love
if she do chide 'tis not have gone
why fools are mad if left alone
'get gone' she doth not mean 'away'
flatter praise commend extol their graces
though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces
man hath tongue say no man
if his tongue he cannot win woman
duke but she mean promis'd by her friends
unto youthful gentleman worth
kept severely from resort men
no man hath access by day her
duke ay but doors lock'd keys kept safe
no man hath recourse her by night
valentine what lets but one may enter at her window
duke her chamber aloft far from ground
built so shelving one cannot climb
without apparent hazard his life
valentine why then ladder quaintly made cords
cast up pair anchoring hooks
would serve scale another hero's tow'r
duke now as thou art gentleman blood
advise where may have such ladder
valentine when would use pray sir tell
duke this very night love child
longs everything he can come by
valentine by seven o'clock i'll get such ladder
duke but hark thee will go her alone
how shall best convey ladder thither
valentine will light lord may bear
duke cloak as long as thine will serve turn
valentine ay good lord
duke then let see thy cloak
i'll get one such another length
valentine why any cloak will serve turn lord
duke how shall fashion wear cloak
pray thee let feel thy cloak upon
what letter this same what's here 'to silvia'
here an engine fit proceeding
'my thoughts do harbour silvia nightly
slaves they are send them flying
o could their master come go as lightly
himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
herald thoughts thy pure bosom rest them
while their king thither them importune
do curse grace such grace hath blest them
because myself do want servants' fortune
curse myself they are sent by
what's here
'silvia this night will enfranchise thee'
'tis so here's ladder purpose
why phaethon thou art merops' son
wilt thou aspire guide heavenly car
thy daring folly burn world
wilt thou reach stars because they shine thee
go base intruder over weening slave
bestow thy fawning smiles equal mates
privilege thy departure hence
thank this more than all favours
which all too much have bestow'd thee
but if thou linger territories
longer than swiftest expedition
will give thee time leave our royal court
by heaven wrath shall far exceed love
ever bore daughter or thyself
gone will not hear thy vain excuse
valentine why not death rather than living torment
die banish'd from myself
silvia myself banish'd from her
self from self deadly banishment
what light light if silvia not seen
what joy joy if silvia not by
unless think she by
feed upon shadow perfection
except by silvia night
unless look silvia day
there no day look upon
she essence leave
if not by her fair influence
foster'd illumind cherish'd kept alive

falsehood cowardice poor descent
three things women highly hold hate
duke ay but she'll think spoke hate
proteus ay if his enemy deliver
by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
duke then must undertake slander him
proteus lord shall loath do
'tis an ill office gentleman
especially against his very friend
duke where good word cannot advantage him
slander never can endamage him
therefore office indifferent
being entreated by friend
by aught can speak his dispraise
she shall not long continue love him
but say this weed her love from valentine
follows not she will love sir thurio
thurio therefore as unwind her love from him
lest should ravel good none

cannot soon revolt change mind
upon this warrant shall have access
where silvia may confer at large
she lumpish heavy melancholy
friend's sake will glad
where may temper her by persuasion
hate young valentine love friend

must lay lime tangle her desires
by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
should full fraught serviceable vows
duke ay
much force heaven bred poesy
proteus say upon altar her beauty
sacrifice tears sighs heart
write till ink dry tears
may discover such integrity
orpheus' lute was strung poets' sinews
whose golden touch could soften steel stones
make tigers tame huge leviathans
forsake unsounded deeps dance sands
after dire lamenting elegies
visit by night lady's chamber window
some sweet consort their instruments
tune deploring dump night's dead silence
this or else nothing will inherit her
duke this discipline shows thou hast been love
thurio thy advice this night i'll put practice

lest growing ruinous building fall
leave no memory what was
repair thy presence silvia
what halloing what stir this day
these are mates make their wills their law

they love well yet have much do
keep them from uncivil outrages
withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here
steps aside
enter proteus silvia julia as sebastian
proteus madam this service have done
hazard life rescue from him

vouchsafe meed but one fair look
smaller boon than this cannot beg

love lend patience forbear awhile
silvia o miserable unhappy am
proteus unhappy were madam ere came
silvia by thy approach thou mak'st most unhappy
julia aside when he approacheth presence
silvia had been seized by hungry lion
would have been breakfast beast
rather than have false proteus rescue
o heaven judge how love valentine
whose life's as tender as soul
full as much more there cannot
do detest false perjur'd proteus
proteus what dangerous action stood next death
would not undergo one calm look
o 'tis curse love still approv'd
when women cannot love where they're belov'd
silvia when proteus cannot love where he's belov'd
read over julia's heart thy first best love
whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
into thousand oaths all those oaths
descended into perjury love
that's far worse than none better have none
than plural faith which too much by one
thou counterfeit thy true friend
proteus love
who respects friend
silvia all men but proteus
proteus nay if gentle spirit moving words
can no way change milder form
i'll woo soldier at arms' end
silvia o heaven
proteus i'll force thee yield desire
valentine ruffian let go rude uncivil touch
thou friend an ill fashion
proteus valentine
valentine thou common friend that's without faith or love
such friend now treacherous man
thou hast beguild hopes nought but mine eye
could have persuaded now dare not say
who should trusted when one's own right hand
perjured bosom proteus
am sorry must never trust thee more
but count world stranger thy sake
private wound deepest o time most accurst
'mongst all foes friend should worst
proteus shame guilt confounds
forgive valentine if hearty sorrow
sufficient ransom offence
as e'er did commit
valentine then am paid
once again do receive thee honest
who by repentance not satisfied
nor heaven nor earth these are pleas'd
by penitence th' eternals wrath's appeas'd
love may appear plain free

valentine why boy why wag how now

julia o good sir master charg'd deliver ring madam
silvia which out neglect was never done

julia julia herself did give
julia herself have brought hither
proteus how julia
julia behold her gave aim all thy oaths
entertaind 'em deeply her heart
how oft hast thou perjury cleft root
o proteus let this habit make thee blush
thou asham'd have took upon
disguise love
lesser blot modesty finds
women change their shapes than men their minds
proteus than men their minds 'tis true o heaven were man
but constant he were perfect one error
fills him faults makes him run through all th' sins
inconstancy falls off ere begins
what silvia's face but may spy
more fresh julia's constant eye
let blest make this happy close
'twere pity two such friends should long foes
proteus bear witness heaven have wish ever

polixenes no longer stay
leontes one sev'night longer
polixenes very sooth morrow
leontes we'll part time betweens then
polixenes press not beseech so
there no tongue moves none none i' th' world
so soon as yours could win so should now
were there necessity request although

charge trouble save both
farewell our brother
hermione had thought sir have held peace until
had drawn oaths from him not stay sir
charge him too coldly tell him are sure
all bohemia's well this satisfaction
by gone day proclaim'd say this him
he's beat from his best ward
leontes well said hermione
hermione tell he longs see his son were strong
but let him say so then let him go

polixenes no madam
polixenes may not verily
hermione verily
put off limber vows but
though would seek t' unsphere stars oaths
should yet say 'sir no going' verily
shall not go lady's 'verily'
as potent as lord's will go yet
force keep as prisoner
not guest so shall pay fees
prisoner or guest by dread 'verily'
one them shall
polixenes guest then madam
prisoner should import offending
which less easy commit
than punish
hermione not gaoler then
but kind hostess come i'll question
lord's tricks yours when were boys
polixenes were fair queen
two lads thought there was no more behind
but such day morrow as day
boy eternal
hermione was not lord
verier wag o' th' two
polixenes were as twinnd lambs did frisk i' th' sun
bleat one at th' other what chang'd
was innocence innocence knew not
any did had pursu'd life
our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
stronger blood should have answer'd heaven
boldly 'not guilty' imposition clear'd
hereditary ours
hermione by this gather
have tripp'd since
polixenes o most sacred lady
temptations have since then been born 's
precious self had then not cross'd eyes
young playfellow
hermione grace boot

queen are devils yet go
th' offences have made do we'll answer
if first sinnd us us

hermione he'll stay lord
leontes at request he would not
hermione dearest thou never spok'st
better purpose
hermione never
leontes never but once
hermione what have twice said well when was't before
prithee tell cram's praise make's
as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
our praises are our wages may ride's
one soft kiss thousand furlongs ere
spur heat an acre but th' goal
last good deed was entreat his stay
what was first has an elder sister
or mistake o would her name were grace
but once before spoke th' purpose when
nay let have't long
leontes why was when
ere could make thee open thy white hand
clap thyself love then didst thou utter
'i am yours ever'
hermione 'tis grace indeed
why lo now have spoke th' purpose twice
one ever earnd royal husband
th' other some while friend
giving her hand polixenes
leontes aside too hot too hot
have tremor cordis heart dances
but not joy not joy this entertainment
may free face put derive liberty
from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
well become agent 't may grant
but paddling palms pinching fingers
as now they are making practis'd smiles
as looking glass then sigh as 'twere
mort o' th' deer o entertainment

mamillius ay good lord
leontes i' fecks

mamillius yes if will lord
leontes thou want'st rough pash shoots have
full yet they say are
almost as as eggs women say so
will say anything but were they false
as o'er dy'd blacks as wind as waters false
as dice are wish'd by one fixes
no bourn 'twixt his mine yet were true
say this boy were come sir page
most dear'st collop can thy dam may't
affection thy intention stabs centre
thou dost make possible things not so held
communicat'st dreams how can this

fellow'st nothing then 'tis very credent
thou mayst co join something thou dost
beyond commission find
infection brains
polixenes what means sicilia
hermione he something seems unsettled
polixenes how lord
what cheer how is't best brother
hermione look
as if held brow much distraction
are mov'd lord
leontes no good earnest
how sometimes nature will betray its folly
harder bosoms looking lines
boy's face methoughts did recoil
twenty three years saw myself unbreech'd
green velvet coat dagger muzzld
lest should bite its master so prove
as ornaments oft do too dangerous
how methought then was this kernel
this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
will take eggs money
leontes will why happy man be's dole brother
are so fond young prince as
do seem ours
polixenes if at home sir
he's all exercise mirth matter
now sworn friend then mine enemy
parasite soldier statesman all
he makes july's day short as december
his varying childness cures
leontes so stands this squire
offic'd two will walk lord
leave graver steps hermione
how thou lov'st us show our brother's welcome
let what dear sicily cheap
next thyself young rover he's

beneath sky aside am angling now
though perceive not how give line

exeunt polixenes hermione attendants
gone already
inch thick knee deep o'er head ears fork'd one
play too but so disgrac'd part whose issue
will hiss grave contempt clamour
will knell go play boy play there have been
or am much deceiv'd cuckolds ere now
many man there even at this present
now while speak this holds his wife by th' arm
little thinks she has been sluic'd ins absence
his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
sir smile his neighbour nay there's comfort int
as mine against their will should all despair
hath revolted wives tenth mankind
would hang themselves physic for't there's none
bawdy planet will strike
where 'tis predominant 'tis pow'rfull think
from east west north south concluded
no barricado belly know't
will let out enemy
bag baggage many thousand ons
mamillius am they say
leontes why that's some comfort
what camillo there
camillo ay good lord
leontes go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
exit mamillius
camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
camillo had much ado make his anchor hold
when cast out still came home
camillo he would not stay at petitions made
his business more material
leontes didst perceive
aside they're here already whisp'ring rounding
'sicilia so forth' 'tis far gone
when shall gust last how came't camillo
he did stay
camillo at good queens entreaty
leontes 'at queens' be't 'good' should pertinent
by any understanding pate but thine
thy conceit soaking will draw
more than common blocks not noted is't
but finer natures by some severals
head piece extraordinary lower messes
perchance are this business purblind say
camillo business lord think most understand
bohemia stays here longer
leontes ha
leontes ay but why
camillo satisfy highness entreaties
our most gracious mistress
leontes satisfy
th' entreaties mistress satisfy
let suffice have trusted thee camillo
all nearest things heart as well
chamber councils wherein priest thou
hast cleans'd bosom from thee departed
deceiv'd thy integrity deceiv'd
which seems so
camillo forbid lord
leontes bide upont thou art not honest or
if thou inclinst way thou art coward
which hoxes honesty behind restraining
from course requir'd or else thou must counted
servant grafted serious trust
therein negligent or else fool
tak'st all jest
camillo gracious lord
may negligent foolish fearful
every one these no man free
but his negligence his folly fear
among infinite doings world
sometime puts forth affairs lord
if ever were wilfull negligent
was folly if industriously
not weighing well end if ever fearful
do thing where issue doubted
whereof execution did cry out
against non performance 'twas fear
which oft infects wisest these lord
are such allow'd infirmities honesty
never free but beseech grace
plainer let know trespass
by its own visage if then deny
leontes ha' not seen camillo
but that's past doubt have or eye glass
thicker than cuckold's horn or heard
vision so apparent rumour
cannot mute or thought cogitation
resides not man does not think
wife slippery if thou wilt confess
or else impudently negative
have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
as rank as any flax wench puts
before her troth plight say't justify't
camillo would not stander by hear
sovereign mistress clouded so without
present vengeance taken shrew heart
never spoke what did become less
than this which reiterate were sin
as deep as though true
leontes whispering nothing
kissing inside lip stopping career
laughter sigh note infallible
breaking honesty horsing foot foot
skulking corners wishing clocks more swift
hours minutes noon midnight all eyes
blind pin web but theirs theirs only
would unseen wicked this nothing
why then world all that's int nothing
covering sky nothing bohemia nothing
if this nothing
camillo good lord cur'd
this diseas'd opinion betimes
'tis most dangerous
leontes say 'tis true
camillo no no lord
leontes lie lie
say thou liest camillo hate thee
pronounce thee gross lout mindless slave
canst thine eyes at once see good evil
inclining them both were wife's liver
infected as her life she would not live
running one glass
camillo who does her
leontes why he wears her her medal hanging
about his neck bohemia who if
had servants true about bare eyes
see alike mine honour as their profits
which should undo more doing ay thou
his cupbearer whom from meaner form
have bench'd rear'd worship who mayst see
plainly as heaven sees earth earth sees heaven
how am galld mightst bespice cup
give mine enemy lasting wink
which draught were cordial
camillo sir lord
could do this no rash potion
maliciously poison but cannot
believe this crack dread mistress
so sovereignly being honourable
have lov'd thee
leontes make thy question go rot
dost think am so muddy so unsettled
appoint myself this vexation sully
purity whiteness sheets
which preserve sleep which being spotted
give scandal blood o' th' prince son
who do think mine love as mine
without ripe moving 't would do this
could man so blench
camillo must believe sir
do will fetch off bohemia for't
provided when he's remov'd highness
will take again queen as yours at first
even sons sake thereby sealing
known allied yours
leontes thou dost advise
even so as mine own course have set down
i'll give no blemish her honour none
camillo lord
go then countenance as clear
as friendship wears at feasts keep bohemia
queen am his cupbearer
if from he have wholesome beverage
leontes this all
do't thou hast one half heart
do't not thou split'st thine own
camillo i'll do't lord
leontes will seem friendly as thou hast advis'd exit
camillo o miserable lady but
what case stand must poisoner
good polixenes ground do't
obedience master one
all are his so too do this deed
promotion follows if could find example
thousands had struck anointed kings
flourish'd after i'd not do't but since
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
let villainy itself forswear't must
forsake court do't or no certain
break neck happy star reign now
here comes bohemia
polixenes this strange methinks
favour here begins warp not speak
good day camillo
camillo hail most royal sir
polixenes what news i' th' court
camillo none rare lord
polixenes king hath him such countenance
as he had lost some province region
lov'd as he loves himself even now met him
wafting his eyes th' contrary falling
lip much contempt speeds from
so leaves consider what breeding
changes thus his manners
camillo dare not know lord
polixenes how dare not do not do know dare not
intelligent 'tis thereabouts
yourself what do know must
cannot say dare not good camillo
which shows mine chang'd too must
party this alteration finding
myself thus alter'd with't
camillo there sickness
which puts some us distemper but
cannot name disease caught
yet are well
polixenes how caught
make not sighted basilisk
by regard but killd none so camillo
as are certainly gentleman thereto
clerk experienc'd which no less adorns
our gentry than our parents' noble names
whose success are gentle beseech
if know aught which does behove knowledge
thereof inform'd imprisont not
ignorant concealment
camillo may not answer
must answer'd dost thou hear camillo
conjure thee by all parts man
which honour does acknowledge whereof least
not this suit mine thou declare
what incidency thou dost guess harm
creeping toward how far off how near
which way prevented if
if not how best bear
camillo sir will tell
think honourable therefore mark counsel
which must ev'n as swiftly followed as
mean utter or both yourself
cry lost so goodnight
polixenes good camillo
camillo am appointed him murder
polixenes by whom camillo
camillo by king
polixenes what
as he had seen 't or been an instrument
vice to't have touch'd his queen
empty
polixenes o then best blood turn
an infected jelly name
yok'd his did betray best
turn then freshest reputation
savour may strike dullest nostril
where arrive approach shunnd
e'er was heard or read
camillo swear his thought over
by each particular star heaven
by all their influences may as well
forbid sea obey moon
as or by oath remove or counsel shake
fabric his folly whose foundation
pild upon his faith will continue
standing his body
camillo know not but am sure 'tis safer
avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born
if therefore dare trust honesty
lies enclosed this trunk which
shall bear along impawnd away night
followers will whisper business
will by twos threes at several posterns
clear them o' th' city myself i'll put
fortunes service which are here
by honour parents
have utt'red truth which if seek prove
dare not stand by nor shall safer
than one condemnd by king's own mouth thereon
his execution sworn
polixenes do believe thee
saw his heart ins face give thy hand
pilot thy places shall
still neighbour mine ships are ready
two days ago this jealousy
precious creature as she's rare
must great as his persons mighty
must violent as he does conceive
he dishonour'd by man which ever
profess'd him why his revenges must
made more bitter fear o'ershades

hermione more than mistress
which comes name fault must not
at all acknowledge polixenes

why he left court gods themselves
wotting no more than are ignorant

leontes actions are dreams
had bastard by polixenes

thy brat hath been cast out itself
no father owning which indeed
more criminal thee than so thou
shalt feel our justice whose easiest passage
look no less than death
hermione sir spare threats
bug which would fright seek

crownd brother these contracted
heirs kingdoms poor house visit
surplus grace which never
leontes o paulina

many singularities but saw not
which daughter came look upon

paulina draws curtain discovers hermione
standing statue
silence more shows off
wonder but yet speak first liege

chide dear stone may say indeed
thou art hermione or rather thou art she
thy not chiding she was as tender
as infancy grace but yet paulina
hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
so aged as this seems
polixenes o not by much
paulina so much more our carver's excellence
which lets go by some sixteen years makes her
leontes as now she might have done
so much good comfort as
now piercing soul o thus she stood
even such life majesty warm life
as now coldly stands when first woo'd her
am asham'd does not stone rebuke
being more stone than o royal piece
there's magic thy majesty which has
evils conjur'd remembrance
standing stone thee
perdita give leave
do not say 'tis superstition
kneel then implore her blessing lady
dear queen ended when but began
give hand yours kiss
paulina o patience
statue but newly fix'd colour's
not dry
which sixteen winters cannot blow away
so many summers dry scarce any joy
did ever so long live no sorrow
but killd itself much sooner
polixenes dear brother
let him was cause this have pow'r
take off so much grief from as he
will piece up himself
paulina indeed lord
would thus have wrought stone mine

leontes do not draw curtain
paulina no longer shall gaze ont lest fancy
may think anon moves
leontes let let
would were dead but methinks already
what was he did make see lord
would not deem breath'd those veins
polixenes masterly done
very life seems warm upon her lip
leontes fixture her eye has motion int
as are mock'd art
paulina i'll draw curtain
lord's almost so far transported
he'll think anon lives
leontes o sweet paulina
make think so twenty years together
pleasure madness let 't alone
paulina am sorry sir have thus far stirr'd but
could afflict farther
leontes do paulina
this affliction has taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort still methinks
there an air comes from her what fine chisel
could ever yet cut breath let no man mock
will kiss her
ruddiness upon her lip wet
you'll mar if kiss stain own
oily painting shall draw curtain
leontes no not these twenty years
perdita so long could
stand by looker
paulina either forbear
quit presently chapel or resolve
more amazement if can behold
take by hand but then you'll think
which protest against am assisted
by wicked powers
leontes what can make her do
am content look what speak
am content hear 'tis as easy
make her speak as move
paulina requir'd
do awake faith then all stand still
am about let them depart

when she was young woo'd her now age

leontes o she's warm
if this magic let an art
lawful as eating
camillo she hangs about his neck
if she pertain life let her speak too
polixenes ay make manifest where she has liv'd
or how stoln from dead

an old tale but appears she lives
though yet she speak not mark little while
please interpose fair madam kneel

gave hope thou wast being have preserv'd
myself see issue
lest they desire upon this push trouble
joys relation go together
precious winners all exultation

will wing some wither'd bough there
mate that's never found again
lament till am lost
leontes o peace paulina
thou shouldst husband take by consent
made betweens by vows thou hast found mine
but how questiond saw her

son unto king whom heavens directing
troth plight daughter good paulina
lead us from hence where may leisurely
each one demand answer his part

lover's complaint
by william shakespeare
from off hill whose concave womb reworded
plaintful story from sist'ring vale
spirits t'attend this double voice accorded
down laid list sad tuned tale
ere long espied fickle maid full pale
tearing papers breaking rings atwain
storming her world sorrow's wind rain
which fortified her visage from sun
whereon thought might think sometime saw
carcase beauty spent done
time had not scythed all youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite heavens fell rage
some beauty peeped through lattice seared age
oft did she heave her napkin her eyne
which had conceited characters
laund'ring silken figures brine
often reading what contents bears
as often shrieking undistinguished woe
clamours all size both high low
sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride
as they did batt'ry spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
th' orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right anon their gazes lend
every place at once nowhere fixed
her hair nor loose nor tied formal plat
proclaimed her careless hand pride
some untucked descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale pined cheek beside
some her threaden fillet still did bide
true bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided loose negligence
thousand favours from maund she drew
amber crystal beaded jet
upon whose weeping margent she was set
usury applying wet wet
or monarchs' hands lets not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
folded schedules had she many one
which she perused sighed tore gave flood
cracked many ring posied gold bone
bidding them find their sepulchres mud
found yet moe letters sadly penned blood
enswathed sealed curious secrecy
these often bathed she her fluxive eyes
often kissed often 'gan tear
cried 'o false blood thou register lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seemed more black damned here
this said top rage lines she rents
big discontents so breaking their contents
reverend man grazed his cattle nigh
court city had let go by
swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
privileged by age desires know
brief grounds motives her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
comely distant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance his hearing divide
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
'tis promised charity age
'father' she says 'though behold
injury many blasting hour
let not tell judgement am old
not age but sorrow over hath power
might as yet have been spreading flower
fresh myself if had self applied
love myself no love beside
youthful suit was gain grace
o one by nature's outwards so commended
maidens' eyes stuck over all his face
love lacked dwelling made him her place
when his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged newly deified
'his browny locks did hang crooked curls
every light occasion wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
each eye saw him did enchant mind
his visage was little drawn
what largeness thinks paradise was sawn
'small show man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but appear
unshorn velvet termless skin
whose bare out bragged web seemed wear
yet showed his visage by cost more dear
nice affections wavering stood doubt
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
maiden tongued he was thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such storm
as oft 'twixt may april see
when winds breathe sweet unruly though they
his rudeness so his authorized youth
did livery falseness pride truth
'well could he ride often men would say
horse his mettle from his rider takes
what rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes
controversy hence question takes
whether horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by th' well doing steed
'but quickly this side verdict went
his real habitude gave life grace
appertainings ornament
accomplished himself not his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
pierced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so tip his subduing tongue
all kind arguments question deep
all replication prompt reason strong
his advantage still did wake sleep
make weeper laugh laugher weep
he had dialect different skill
catching all passions his craft will
'that he did general bosom reign
dwell him thoughts or remain
personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitched ere he desire have granted
dialogued him what he would say
asked their own wills made their wills obey
'many there were did his picture get
serve their eyes put their mind
fools th' imagination set
goodly objects which abroad they find
labouring moe pleasures bestow them
than true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have never touched his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress his heart
woeful self did freedom stand
was own fee simple not part
what his art youth youth art
threw affections his charmed power
reserved stalk gave him all flower
demand him nor being desired yielded
finding myself honour so forbid
safest distance mine honour shielded
experience many bulwarks builded
proofs new bleeding which remained foil
this false jewel his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunned by precedent
destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples 'gainst her own content
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
when rage advice often seen
by blunting us make our wills more keen
'nor gives satisfaction our blood
must curb upon others' proof
forbod sweets seems so good
fear harms preach our behoof
o appetite from judgement stand aloof
one palate hath needs will taste
'for further could say this mans untrue
knew patterns his foul beguiling
heard where his plants others' orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers defiling
thought characters words merely but art
bastards his foul adulterate heart
'and long upon these terms held city
till thus he 'gan besiege gentle maid
not holy vows afraid
that's ye sworn none was ever said
feasts love have been called unto
till now did ne'er invite nor never woo
'all offences abroad see
are errors blood none mind
love made them not acture they may
where neither party nor true nor kind
they sought their shame so their shame did find
by how much their reproach contains
'among many mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame heart so much as warmed
or affection put th' smallest teen
or any leisures ever charmed
harm have done them but ne'er was harmed
kept hearts liveries but mine own was free
reigned commanding his monarchy
'look here what tributes wounded fancies sent
figuring they their passions likewise lent
grief blushes aptly understood
bloodless white encrimsoned mood
effects terror dear modesty
encamped hearts but fighting outwardly
'and lo behold these talents their hair
twisted metal amorously empleached
have receiv'd from many several fair
their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched
deep brained sonnets did amplify
each stone's dear nature worth quality
'the diamond why 'twas beautiful hard
whereto his invised properties did tend
deep green em'rald whose fresh regard
weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
heaven hued sapphire opal blend
objects manifold each several stone
wit well blazoned smiled or made some moan
pensived subdued desires tender
nature hath charged hoard them not
but yield them up where myself must render
origin ender

since their altar enpatron
'o then advance yours phraseless hand
whose white weighs down airy scale praise
take all these similes own command
what minister obeys
works under audit comes
their distract parcels combined sums
'lo this device was sent from nun
or sister sanctified holiest note
which late her noble suit court did shun
whose rarest havings made blossoms dote
she was sought by spirits richest coat
but kept cold distance did thence remove
'but o sweet what labour is't leave
thing have not mast'ring what not strives
playing place which did no form receive
playing patient sports unconstrained gyves
she her fame so herself contrives
scars battle scapeth by flight
makes her absence valiant not her might
'o pardon boast true
accident which brought her eye
now she would caged cloister fly
religious love put out religions eye
not tempted would she immured
now tempt all liberty procured
'how mighty then are o hear tell
broken bosoms belong
have emptied all their fountains well
mine pour ocean all among
strong o'er them o'er being strong
as compound love physic cold breast
'my parts had pow'r charm sacred nun
who disciplined ay dieted grace
believed her eyes when they t'assail begun
all vows consecrations giving place
o most potential love vow bond nor space
thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
thou art all all things else are thine
'when thou impressest what are precepts worth
how coldly those impediments stand forth
wealth filial fear law kindred fame
love's arms are peace 'gainst rule 'gainst sense 'gainst shame
sweetens suff'ring pangs bears
aloes all forces shocks fears
'now all these hearts do mine depend
feeling break bleeding groans they pine
supplicant their sighs extend
leave batt'ry make 'gainst mine
credent soul strong bonded oath
shall prefer undertake troth
'this said his wat'ry eyes he did dismount
whose sights till then were levelled face
each cheek river running from fount
brinish current downward flowed apace
o how channel stream gave grace
who glazed crystal gate glowing roses
flame through water which their hue encloses
small orb one particular tear
but inundation eyes
what rocky heart water will not wear
what breast so cold not warmed here
o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
both fire from hence chill extincture hath
'for lo his passion but an art craft
even there resolved reason into tears
there white stole chastity daffed
appear him as he appears
all melting though our drops this diff'rence bore
his poisoned mine did him restore
'in him plenitude subtle matter
applied cautels all strange forms receives
burning blushes or weeping water
or swooning paleness he takes leaves
either's aptness as best deceives
blush at speeches rank weep at woes
'that not heart which his level came
could scape hail his all hurting aim
showing fair nature both kind tame
veiled them did win whom he would maim
against thing he sought he would exclaim
when he most burned heart wished luxury
he preached pure maid praised cold chastity
'thus merely garment grace
naked concealed fiend he covered
which cherubin above them hovered
who young simple would not so lovered
ay fell yet do question make
what should do again such sake
'o infected moisture his eye
o false fire which his cheek so glowed
o forced thunder from his heart did fly
o sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed
o all borrowed motion seeming owed
new pervert reconciled maid'
