cause you know this heart i'll always share
slither spiraling banister down a hide
and i'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water my god
naw let's take naw let's aaah shit well i guess that about says it
i mean i'm only one servant ayo one hell of a diversion
carpet by my spearheading fink eye beretta
all y'all saw was aesop rock holding an empty book of matches
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
for breaking down their ropes ladders and stairs
free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
on a silver screen that throws gummy bears back attack
sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
it sucks it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
i was born in 1 9 7 6 at biosfet hospital located in long island ny
and ahhh i mean i could live to be a thousand years old and never re pay them
for ciggaretes and soda shook me to kasper
and i'd be lying if i said all of this
tony i know you know you crazy 'cause you told me
you listened to me brag about my issues for hours
so i guess this is my feeble way to thank you
i'ma get you back someday thank you
thank you for helping me to not die
aesop rock
aesop rock
either jump or run
aesop rock
mr lif
i'ma smoke it tomorrah
itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
aesop rock
some cats grow by the laws of the wild
jack fell
turns out i wasnt cast in the master plan anyway
i'll love you forever cuz you know me better
aesop rock el p mr lif
train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
like a flatline fetish had it's feathers fanned out
vicinity wander claim no soul
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks
another dark night
soldiers mold it where the jones is every grown up
chronicle the loading dock they crawl to lodge the colony
or waddle through this section where the natives feel murdery
mr lif talking
a pierced nose a model with a stalker cheap hooker jay walkers
a thug circus a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
a black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
there's a fun house ooh a sun spout
a carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
conditions of never blends science with religion
man patrick blockhead mr roper omega one my man hates one percy p
the give it get it never let it self pass the word eyeing stubborness
under a dusted angel heartstring big brother is watching
make a move pause make a move break cannon
sometimes i laugh at victory kissing these little question marks
but we hate jobs in general
everything i built burned yesterday
it's the year of the landshark
cockroach utter thug specimen
and i'ma let you think you won
but we'd rather be supporting ourselves
pour myself a cup of ambition and
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
when a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
bored lasso down polaris let the glow amuse me
pain combine cant even manage to tell what the swell is like
buckle the architecture til it fell through
'it's time to let go' the tin man bangin upon his chest to hear the echo
invade the town while village elders holler 'who the fuck's this'
abandon all hope y'all abandon all hope
i'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
you solar system is my condiment
aesop rock chorus
ah dirty dirty destiny
with a grin style stinger creeping out the basement
i dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
alchemy hold it from the colder sob story
rudely awoke
more postille and docile insubordinance your phylum
jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop
while slaves defy water start roofing paper bags
first time i bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain a
zipped lips clipped to my peaking
turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
yeah
yeah yeah i rap tight like saran
and man i dunno if it was me or you
and we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers
one muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center housing style pagents
i fell asleep holding an appleseed woke up holding a tree
pardon cadaver had a legitimate pulse
bazooka tooth zoo keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
serpentine in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
somebody warped the message tried to pass it to the next next
have a mid life crisis when you're ten years young
teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra curricular flagpole scrapping
i used to think i'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber
if i'm not back in a week tell the crew i said peace and lay low
somebody's losing track of their flesh and bloods and arrests rests
it adds it up when a pioneer fall in comparison to your 99 bottle of beer wall
let a blue screen bruised dream canopy
blue be the propaganda banners well sure i'll be a marine
plug it in turn it on prop me up against the couch
deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
i can turn from toxicated visuals
i bond with a six string correspondence
so i can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance
your majesty i love you i despise you
training generation fallout
dont tell me lucifer and god dont carpool
back in a long time ago i was to way the wishers wish
now where i live there's a homeless man
but only time can tell
idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
with no holes poked in the nozzle
thank you james anthony for the band aids on my ego
verse 1
oh my god
buckle in the bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smacks
offical max fischer blume break cable clipper def
my face like top to bottom train car feelings
i dont have the answers or at least the ones you want to hear
physically the situations hard to stop
aesop rock chorus
a new universe in ancient so i stay patient
yeah its like sloooowww dooowwwn
while most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
this for the erchants allergic to they own stingers
well so we meet again
but it's like man i really cant afford the oxen
this textbook magnificently prude
so i lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain
and a prime concern to earn thanks i'm a be a big bang
i observed him fly ten feet then drop the bottles to the devils
if you promise to help pull this hook out my lip bitch
chorus 2x
i swear to god i never meant to spill the beans
and buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
big bang
where the ebony should of cracked shit ratio tragic
and i'm about half way to nausea half way to contentment
sweet leaf grief your dreams a needle in a needle stack claiming safety pin physics
where i can store remnants of the day i once slept in build me a home
listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
i felt a tug on my line and i lugged a trash can
bridges give us traps and tried to walk to get stogs just like hop
anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
blip blip dag these ghosts need a doctor
girl what are you doing up there
major label ax got to act like they dont have deals
chillin at the crib by the time you get your shit straight
i cant wait to hear it
basic leader camp is cardboard
corpses tryin to abort the thoughts of coming out wildn
thinkin on the low it's perfect when he put the mic down
get your doors darkened by the house of card carpenters
and i poured in with a large coffee
too strange within just to stop demented interactions sleep
when his wrists released he wrote tunes you could snoop through
looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
i have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
oh
moments later 2 have been released
who was at the doorjust now
defies the glory ofthe poultry or fish
who was at the doorjust now
hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that there's flatware exhumed by a crane arm
both of my brothers break in like he's on his davie hogan no mistaken by the way
hot summer gun or box cutter slow dance
others queens packed to the very last rafter
know that
like yes the pain dazzles men pass the popcorn
i got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
and saints and every trainee face painted while his great
on your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow maker's
caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patriots
spangled in hooks dangle by anglers off the plank of burning books
i am the triant diaries of a low life siphon through that vein
call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that
with an eyedropper a poison passions hoist above the masses
we build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
the over spilled theory's all faucet
so that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach
father black suit white collar
along island was jesus every weekend spoon fed to appease traditional love bringing
said if only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your kool g
down the hatch and pass 'em through the kill switch
in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren
like cups over dumb shits better than the schools
not an asshole i'm just a little confused
we'll be escorting vital organs
might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
take the brain out
before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines
take the brain out leave the carcass
take the brain out leave the heart in
and dammit you gotta hustle this is a slacker free zone
and skip stones in the morning as i
to the light heavy and middle weight integrate
come visit me
you have to want the castle head up shoulders back
you can kick and scream and yell but damn i'm only tryin to help
of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess
big dick three cheers to the product
slug
born to kill the insecure
i dunno what i have to left
as long as i know right from wrong i'll be ok i'll sing my songs
beats upon my windows with mother nature's adrenaline
weed out the bums who practice migration under the elegant
i'm stuck in the center and could care less
intro
you look like you've seen a ghost
so when they gather by the birdbath in the morning he will tell 'em
i dont know homey you decide
with a steaming plate of justice for them easy baker stomachs say what
zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
you look like you've seen a ghost
outro

every hero dead and its making you forget
and he's up nights bumping over crunk and bug bites
pick up stix and ponies
i want to solve world hunger and fuck a pinup
so its left to the dogs to find their way home
this is labor echoes
this years brain crop spread spectacular
who ranned off but only meet to face the fact
we sell popcorn beer and balloons
beat plays with some scracthing
guards like all signs correlate with sorcery
patiently adhering to the chandelier ta key in door
intimately spaced pylons on a plot of inhospitable terrain
now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
i'm back to kill the video star and i'm double parked
geechi suede
kill it now fade to black comfortably
dont watch the stars the stars aint fallin
freak abort fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress
see the halflings flee the shire before he tore open the packaging
wonder woman went whistling
and head up the rock highway
with the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases
that drop in the bucket boogie begun
keen cold the straight soul drenched temper
other rapper begins cuts out
when i was a boy i employed styles exhausted by every lost child
i reside up on the opposite circuit in glorious dazes
and i laughed i laughed for me and my starving art family

my girl ties on my cape smoke a bone then work my dental tree
spurting magma cursing television urns to burn until my cleopatra

interject a bad dream candidly
lacing non sequitur's that spittle off the chin spittle of the chin

circling the wild fires fires

alarmed pardon the old buzz deader

there's a single spanish female out west traveling the country
groveling villagers trying to hide behind the windmill

alright ok i'mi'm hungry
night light suckas
see a cretins still a cretin even speakin altered moniker
you wont be laughing when your covered wagons crash
spit 'em at your species
lift me to activism chain activate wild style pluto orbit
heads ripped watch red bricks turn yellow
stomach full of diner food
spit 'em at your species
and all for the want of a horse shoe
cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
no city too charred
comfortably sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
all kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
no mountain too high

wired underagers play box cutter facelift
tin men suck traditional rituals
hazy days will stay purple

there was mrs crabtree and her poodle
but she would only smile
and she stopped

lucy was 87 upon her death bed
she'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
'specially words like that
in october i was introduced as coward
and my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day gretel met hansel
the night is near so
fame war love honor crime innocence tragedy sunshine
freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning
i wanna weeble well i wanna set of knitting needles

see new york is ancient rome basic basically stone faces
kill 'em all slow i was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a c rayz walz show
stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
listeners how we dissolve it's spores and i'll tell you not flying
murder of holy in cushion

and once i get tired of holding this gavel up
diss blatant harassment spit honor whistle fearless
mantlepieces dusted
only the tree of life flourishing
wingless angels
stare out potions restrain fertility
life's an oragmi box and i'm hidden within the fold
finding me lost among statues and mainstream idols
i stand my own two aura illuminated in red
was is and forever will be a luxury
defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
i deemed practical now is you is or is you aint compatible
i am skin and bones i am sin and poems i am tin and chrome
what like novels man that dont hold my attention what about television
casually note the blossom of phantom alignment strategy
one must pardon yee old common street detour
i'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
each alive is an equal and vital piston i support
as the bourbon odor smokers' coughs smolder off the cohiba
wide load pigs
no pagan or sacrilege just bacon for scavengers
and while i dont really know the working details of your tribes
let's make a deal
push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
god damn pigs
grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftan
and venturing the plaza pleasant i saw it all from pixie dust to crepid pins and
that a line so gray will last forever more dusting off the dreams to be an autopilot

soggy beagle gently dragging ruby in his yellow teeth

devil dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
the company of similars couldnt excite the motor
said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous bound by concern

dense spreads like new names at the writers bench
encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas
getting dusty in the cellar
looked like sickle cells with the principles of high rotary
quality control stand still string up the banner
iron bandit give them the stars the head balloons and rubies
getting dusty in the cellar

do you know what 'nemesis' means
of a barnstormer reveal time with a jagged edge
i got absurd magic
i never said i gave them all the fight to be brave
i try to debate
it becomes the lung the mind is a closet
that's why i took my time
on the train
the pirate tyrant breathes feed on your precious little pixels
an i'm here to pose inquiries
i'm gone and i best believe i'm leavin
my time is the day before the hunter made his kill
where expectant slave smiles at the stick in the painted living
tryina pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost
this turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
ok see two canaries on the wire aspire to separate luulabies both of which had me drifting
chorus
electric charge comin from the mainframe
the bow breakers turned a cradle fatal every spirit clung
i've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week
and i'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall and i'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
choke up on watcher logic with a left center field indicator gestured gently
out of dodge nauseousi dont feel good yo el leave the keys to the delorian with lauren at the office
this is the sound of one man getting high with one hand in a forest with a tree falling alone ya heard
so i line 'em up and ask 'em flat wanna de worm the belly of this orphan bloodlust or timidity
lucky sevens buddy up for mass taxidermy some burn facts and secure camo to past

who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
ma can we get a pool
bang followed from a pulling of hair
pipe cleaner mustache fork hands google eyes

some do let sleeping dogs lie still
why what kind of lsd you like
mister big sleep with the carp and kale
maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
found nothing in the water but salt piss and whiskey
got a brand new skeleton crew on the move now
anchors up hoist push the jolly roger way too much
pretend like her gills didnt dry up and suffer
no more pencils no more books
and she'll bring the cadavers set em' free and let em' feed
cut into 5 digit slide clock the essentials in i'll be a bill collector
i'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
hows this my little loom
captive passive spring loaded serenity
so one overlooked the scene including loopholes
i'm mad at how far this is dishonoring occam's razor
close to insanity
malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow
god damn must have remembered me
like as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion
close to insanity
hug on my canteen like in a dream
mood swingin from the mezzanine level
i never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh
militant dance split the sun and sip the filament
now all hail defenders of the trash talk
i could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
just to scream fuck off as the engine pulls out the station
this basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic fold origami
practically caress the utterings of crushed brothers and sisters
now i stand to breath as not to disturb the
but i aint about to say that i'm the only cat you got bubbling
he's actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
you made comments to the wrong who out of respect and honor leaked your program
to the ceiling above my bed
man i'm just a bum
might of tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes
my fire escape overlooks ghost town market place
i cant afford another in a cell
and it fell in my lap
i'll sell your worth in a bottle at profit explain my bias
i am not your friend anymore
and a red radio flyer
for the purity the anger
for the three legged dog i saw dragged on a leash
jiggy jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
it's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
bliss mimic baptise chastise laugh die
hermit crabs and new york city sewer aligators
who tattooed the city scape up skin to blend in
and i keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
aesop rock
i hate em all i kick the bottom brick out shouting yes y'all
like this i'm just trying to milk the mileage
miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions
my intuition felt you slip up
on the game board lunge forward and wind up impaled by the same sword
like while i put my foot down stomp your city
disoriented malicious god you'll burn your bridges
the starving institution broke your main frame
aesop rock
defunct and apparently examinin famine i'm a
brain trip the beta weights trap for the slaughter
and i laughed i laughed for me and my starving art family
i'm not your average man bragging toe or hand tagging
my new cuts are hot bodies chewed up a lot
but i rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster
a hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
but what lies inside my heart is off the motherfucking meter
the water aint safe no more
now tip toe across a lost cause
and cretins acts aint that memorable
here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement
i'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across
no gun talk no gimmicks just rounds of raw dogging
with an indelible squad of design monsters
so when i battled in basements i had eight sentences
hold it sacred living it for the culture
you clown you dont you drown
i'm keeping their puppy styles in the company flow kennels
and ya'll trying to chase me
dig it daddy dug his own tunnel under the gutters where the numbers bleed
and still know the time when you record flops
come soak in it resume sturdy composer soldier bliss

soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfer
clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren mayday
i have no training in reconnaissance combat or colluding
hold the sword of the only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
so he list the little boy into the pin up pineapple heh
strap on a helmet and start shooting
and the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that i slept in
evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
bindle on a broomstick pancaked shoes
m m moral compass all batshit
in the terrifying face of a future tongue
only a particularly menacing
arm in the maw
but i spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
i curdle with burnt milk pariah sigh honor piranha money
we bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha bot
push that button
sit up sit down
i was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
it's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
and a pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
down to the valley time for miss ahkmar watch
the class was making them develop backwards
while bent funny bone grown community
but i'll get you i'm going to get you
we could run that or' wells '84 war
chorus
i race the derby in the first heat strike personal
outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
therefore it is and the melody settles
choose one
flirtin with a serpent workin overtime
steal a sloppy earth meal feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
no enigma an attempt to bury the hatchet
it's the carnival have you any feed for my cheery grin
hitchin my life to the leash of one minstrel
the ritual goes same window different visual
the seven deadly sins
lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
transcend backlash jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages
heaves breath the last gasp
style messiah hot like a volcano with fire
all i see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
emotion reads close encounters i run
we shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude
and threaten entire structure of our society
jupiter aint talk to mars he felt the host of rovers sold him out
who later learned it may actually be safer to play with knives
the eddy on the roof rack
with a nose for commotion and stolen goods
stare into the glowing eye of cerberus and grow
the birth of an old slang the death of a new speak
who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation
may or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy
moments of land war my lazarus species
and underdogs with posters of a front side tony alva
standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out
never mind time on the short bus
ooh wee do we roast in a bilge when the skinny from afar is thar be gold in them hills
makin bath tub meth
leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds

tome told me tell 'em hello 7 30 noodle town
talking rubes on the radio
long island was porn stars and puppies pushin sniffles
the kid his ring king dummies to king kullen where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
trap the traitor
like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
extra
they chase cheese fries with binaca
flood a parking meter fever knucle up for love and rockets
meets the lust for blood and demerits
with clippers for your belly up mascots and never dine alone
don and vagabond alike repent
kill television kill television kill television
or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
at least i'll always know which side of the gun i'm supposed to buy the farm from
they said
choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
pale arcadian moon high definition flat plasma
to murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before
nope no walkie talkies
more in a cave with a torch on the wall
but a model of mercy and might no way
just walk walk
nope no walkie talkies

the action we all compete the masked illusion
then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
during my famine i never got broke your bread well equation of intrigue yes yes let me fence sit for a bit
check it i'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time gripping the stem in right invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
must not sleep must warn others trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
young valkyrie's open what's yours
sorry hun it's just the last few have been a fistful

the all absorbing metamorphing monument
while the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
in a metra pot sell
i blend life
this is aesop rock
its a wreck in dire vocabulary
load a back alley shiner liquid
i've just got dreams that i dont understand
ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes
sadly i withered a non believer
hook simple samaritans' eyes buried in books
walkie talkers turn awkward fixtures to complete the wicked mixture
little baby bluebird's eyes turn black
dead of winter shit graveyard tchk tchk
now i baptize skips in larvae and dental records
i'll even grit my teeth for you
kimya dawson
i will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
while it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
watch our father
chippin a drippy set of broke bone grinders
never run truck jewels
maybe sin ll make for sugar flavored flesh
for the dead alive that rented parking space 37
the man ape translates glam thru the visor
going ford jag datsun corvette lotus
it was less an act of hubris
grabbing a cabin in the fuck outta dodge
so many dark hearts to choose
aesop rock
bags full of smelling salts mad as the magazine
turning into something to the sound that the triggers make
watch them collide and explode
then we'll climb a tree and wait
no more would my president come off as a crook and thief
riff raff fallon
while the triple sixers lassos keep angels roped in the basement
and you would stop following me around the jungle gym
and i hang my boots to rest when i'm impressed
put the pieces back together my way
i hack swords wars for the morbid spreading of mad men
sort of similar to most backbones at camp icarus
i got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
put the pieces back together my way
formed by the village of badness and bad karma
con artist kamikaze conduct
or maybe i'll be gramacin homes poor broke and lonely
spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
some get excited when the bullet hits bone and a board
this be the windshear dodgin dead water
treble hook two birds cheap thrills free meal
the new kowloon chowline two leads routing medicine and gruel
handle that huffy wit' a timely parry
steak tartare but we're hardly pet food
who got an x marked mouth and a hooch machine
step around the rhythm of the red rain
this is not your ordinary ballad
cant forget that not so perfect
sew your first martyr stitch

murder the gossip fuck it run off happily
my name is flagrant
my name is polarized
no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past
if only yeah but i'm lonely
arachnids on the celing rugged thumb tacks bones and rusty pipes
so if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
my name is pillar
my name is carnival
and clock the profits for the captains sake
my name is cigarettes
upside down i pick wigs for beetles
man the city bred the brittle cheapo
i went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy it's bliss

slave pain cave children game
call ripley skippy motorhead dope fixture on some go to bed no dinner
no bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye
fast cars danger fire and knives

skip around the money peel the color me bunny killer
i hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked

on the day it rained but y'all posed by the slave ship anyway how sweet
when everyone around me's busy drowning i float

her lips wet a very particular mischief
fully patterned had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board
the key to open his closure
and in the same direction
feverishly sponged up the information high
the more she fed him yes the more he fed her fresh barbiturates
down down down
never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language
in under two minutes he fuming with a flipped lid stormed into the crib
with the same speed slow down
this pass you by

pulling out knots pulling in residuals
dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
trench coat wing tip going to work
hot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin
year and a day
arrested bailed but cuffed and indicted
i drop the l when i'm skiing
dont need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
so once again the mirror raised and i see myself as clear as day
the bronx is up and i'm brooklyn down
keep keepin on i dont care what they say
i got the jammy but i dont got the permit
if your world was all black and if your world was all white
smokin much buddha and smokin much boots
cause i got more flavor than fruit striped gum
now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
i keep my friends around so i have someone to talk to
got fat bass lines like russel simmons steals money
mike d with the vinyl with the grooves so rare
and like the knicks i got game like i worked at hasbro
ah yea i like that shit is kind of rough
i'll grab the tee i'll tee off
all good in the zone
believe in me
and for this human body that i know i've earned
i'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
so we can work to release them until they're cleared
there is a path for the good for all
you will do this four times with the left
let your back bone flip but dont slip a disc
body movin body movin
puttin bodies in motion cause i got the notion
body movin body movin
so kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
you will do eight hops on the left eight on the right
something that you wont mind
rob and steal from the health food store
a rightous sic man who's flipping the script
that funky monkey
double r foots the bill most definitely
this girl walked by she gave me the eye
we had a case in the place and we went right through it
i love brass monkey but i wont give d it
possession is half the law
i'm a writer a poet a genius i know it
you cant deny me you always want to try me
like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin
of another rhyme i'm rapping mc'ing i rock
i'll snatch you up
i'm a mother fucking nick at night with
so i guess it aint true
stuck in your ass
i stole your mic and you wont see it later
light rays blazin

i'll fake right cross over and shoot lefty
set the town ablaze
i got more product than ron popeil
i got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
dont even get me started on intercourse
you're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
you look a little chilly can i get you a shall
chorus
listen all of y'all i'm not the son of sam
and back on through ellis island goes through the family tree
well when i get it into the zone
take you to another realm another level
and we turn it out
suckers try to bite they try to pursue it
the egg a symbol of life
always got my windows rolled down
when i pull out the station you're gonna get yours
up all night i'm pulling through signs like dolomite
you go through life with egg on your face
i pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games
so i plan and i scam and write it off on my taxes
but like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
24 is my age 22 is my gauge
it's gonna get you it's gonna get you
coordinating chics is my man dave scilkin
racism is schism on the serious tip
had too much to drink at the red lobster
i live in the village wherever i go i walk to
1 on the side and dont touch the back
you wanna know what's a mullet well
read the new york post read a story
as i feel this reality gently fade away
and it seems like it's been so long since he shined
it's the absence of light
always in a rush to hit that switch
too much action right by me
beastie boys always on vacation
another girl another fight
we got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
got limos arena tv shows
true feelings are shown from the way that i talk
to adrock c'mon and do anything you like
i give thanks for inspiration it guides my mind along the way
find that i can groove with the beat when i let go
i'm like clyde and i'm rockin steady
mowing down mc's like i'm mowing a lawn
with adrock mca and me mike d
his name is mca i said howdy he said hi
he put the gun to my head and this is what he said
i can blow you away or you can ride with me i said i'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
this dude was staring like he knows who we are
i'm mike d and i get respect
the cars pass by outside
something on the windowsill
i do the smurf the popeye and the jerry lewis
mike d's day off everyday of the week
i travel around the globe it's keeping girlies dizzy
caught you poppin that weak and you must of been dusted
drinking up the shasta
so dont touch me 'cause i'm electric
this one goes out to my man the groove merchant
but one big oaf whose faker than plastic
with your headphones strapped you're rockin rewind pause
beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
so watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
time's an illusion as the moments race by
it starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
nonstop hip hop
i get so hyped when i hear this song
getlive alright
so i say this rhyme built by design
living in this city of pure confusion
remote i want control
so i got a little something for your pay per view
with the cornbread stuffin with the blimpie bluffin
'cause i'm a craftsman who aint fastin
and when i get the feeling i feel the feel swell

the dregs of the earth and the eggs that i eat
had to get up to get the jimmy protector

cause i'm goin and goin and goin this way
eating chicken gizzards with a girl named lizzy
wired up sing sing
now i'm not sure what it takes to be hip
bringing light to your mind
breaking fool with no need to hide
dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
same faces every day but you dont know their names
5000 fine for disturbing the peace
went from the station straight to orange julius
it's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
world is the the spice you bring the sauce
so money makin money money makin manhattan

and when it comes to that type shit i paved the way
i'm unlockable so dont check me
keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
bgirls be rockin on and on
just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet

to rhyme for a girl i hear talk fly down some papaya

like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
i'm giving shouts to gandhi gravy and king
off tracks that i kick come on and give it up
well that's the feeling that i make my goal
dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
all your eggs then you go up the river
and my moms is not butt but fuck it
ad rock down with the ione

my brain is roaming and i dont know where it's going
resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the farmes boulevard
never ever ever fucking wack
people say that they been missin me and missin you
pulling out knots pulling in residuals
and i can always make them smile
i hope she'll say hey me and you should hit the hay
girls to do the laundry
it's so free this kind of feeling
when you've got so much to say
keep on getting bigger because you know that you can
weighs in at two seventy five
what do we know about partying or anything else
'cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
her breast i saw i reached i felt
with your ticky tack calls didnt touch you at all
and if you dont like then hey fuck you
you're hearing me and you're like oh my god its sasquatch
the albee square mall brooklyn downtown
there's more to me than you'll ever know
your body's on time and your mind is appealing
in my apartment i begged her please stop it
i liked the little cutie but i kicked her in the bootie
break up with your girl it ended in tears
woke up in the morning at the won ton ho
and i'm a drifter
check out the odometer and i was on my way
i'm a kleptomaniac k mart shoplifter
i made my getaway and i thought that i had it made
you've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
my man turned to me and said why are you here
brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
if i run out of ale it's thunderbird wine
i come out at night 'cause i sleep all day
beer drinking breath stinking sniffing glue
you like men and we like beer
the king adrock that is my name
on the bus on the train
i am yes you are no
i have lost my mind
but then again what is
we'll bum rush the door if you dont let the whole crew in
so much violence hate and spite
now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
first the 'war on terror' now war on iraq
they're layin on the syrup thick
not a damn one so what's the deal
get your hand out my grandma's pocket
how do i make friends now
maybe it's because i'm so versatile
coming from uranus to check my style
too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean
intergalactic planetary
beastie boys known to let the beat drop
planetary intergalactic
we've got a president we didnt elect
we've got to give before we can get
it takes time to build
what the real deal why you cant connect
but now the sun is shining let's roll back the awning
bass from the back of my car feels soothing
washing windows on the bowery at a quarter to four
sleepin on the street in a cardboard box
memphis is where he's from
donald trump donald tramp living in the mens shelter
johnny
and flew down like a raven in the dark of night
as time goes by in this give and take
smokin much buddha and smokin much boots
'cause i got more flavor than fruit striped gum
you gotta fight for your right to party
repeat chorus
gonna break it down to the nitty grit
life i love you now give me a pound
we got sixteen men on a dead mans chest
all for one and one for all
i'm wheeling' i'm dealin i'm drinking not thinking
'cause i pull out my jammy and squeeze off six
when it comes to keep it real i keep it really wrong
a curve balls what my pitch is
dont let me begin about heroin
because mutiny on the bounty's what we're all about
cause i am most ill and i'm rhymin and stealin
big biting suckers getting thrown in the moat
and when my girlie shakes her hips she sure gets funky
rhymin and stealin in a drunken state
still around the way is where we'll stay
be be fore fore
false elections got me losing my patience
it's too far gone
well let's go to work and not beserk
we gotta work together it's been too long
never let you down with the stereo sound
well i'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys
i'll fill you with the fuckin rim like brim
on the way back up hearing battle tapes
and no one can stop this flow from flowing on
i got this fucking thorn in my side
i'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i cheat and steal and sin and i'm a cynic
shadrach mesach abednago
and nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic
i hold the title and you are the challenger
jerry lee swaggert or jerry lee falwell
amps and crossovers under my rear hood
i got a boat to eat shrimp in
you heard my style i think you missed the point
a puppet on a string i'm paid to sing or rhyme
and when the mic is in my mouth i turn it out y'all
in the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
instrumental
all this cheese is gonna make me cry
huh huh huh huh shazam
cant keep a catalog up on the shelf
you're flipping and flopping just like a flounder
everybody get down huh
the next think she said my place or yours
she's crafty she's gets around
asked her to come home and she couldnt say no
but i just figured she'd spend the night
there's no confusion in her conclusion
cold chillin in the spot and she wont stop
let it flow let yourself go
we slowed it on down so get the hell up
we're the beastie boys not cheech and chong
when i'm recorded you'll be rewarded
it's truly stable and you ought to be able
slow riding gun hidin on the go
i got rhythms i got rhymes
i'm a gangster i'm a prankster i'm the king of the ave
the reason that you're smiling or wilding
you think that you can front when revelation comes
well it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
i'm tired of driving it's due time that i walk about
i'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
there's something coming to the surface
and on the cool check in

y hoy lloran porque tu presencia se disolvio entre el odio el rencor y la deseperacion
donde tu estas baby

loud and clear i dont want no one to miss one
all competition flee and start goin in
and that's the reason i dont swine
cause mine'll keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore
somethin for all the bitin mc's to treasure
as i manifest in hip hop
cause i break bones just like sticks and stones
a replace erase the waste without a trace
total destruction as i rip up the damn stage
and god damn it's got to be the kane
one two one two
and we gonna rock a little something like this gt
drink ginger ale or root beer soda

well it's the kane in the flesh
just by picking up the mic to go solo
cause i'mma pimp hear the primp yes the emp
the judge and jury releasing my fury
to be specific i may die one day
gigolo romeo friday night spend money on a ho
the musical maestro
but i'm not don cornelius
that might best describe
give it here
a voice that's choice as strong as sarah vaugh
i'm ready to break this groove down
trace of this bad case of dance fever
become a slave to the rhythm
so build a nation pump the bass and
now what you gonna do when black caesar comes to surface
chorus
here comes the reign of kane about to get in your spot
i come as living proof so bear witness
making it irie
i got bunions on my game from it being too tight
oh that bootleg copy
was it lobster
cause when i come through i'm catchin wreck like a tow truck
to make the long story short i kill em
and yo i got the funky flow
ripped it flipped it hit it split it let it so dig it
and watch him fade like my voice is doin doin doin
then come on heidi heidi heidi hoe
and yo i got the funky flow
you're sayin that you're buckwhylin
now i dont mean to take the fun out the jam
come on heidi heidi heidi hoe
always seem to come off hard for you somehow
for you to perpetrate the role of me the big daddy
and when i said that i'm the kane you said oh yeah
to make a long story short yo i aint no joke
point blank the cream to rise supreme
a big movement by the time i'm through
because i got a black belt in rap can do
break it down
people'll start singin it noise oh i'm bringin it
it's like they lack the crowd to get live
you shouldnt address me cause you cant impress me
break out before there be some sugar honey iced tea
the power to maintain and sustain cause i'm righteous
aiyyo i think you better let it go
i slay okay okay
do you like this style of rap that i'm showin you
but now just like a grill inside burger king the beef is on
and you know sometimes it's so sad that
singing never to walk in anyone's shadow
a rapper off the map with the rap when i flow
and this is for all of the rappers that like and they bite that
with skills to pay the bills to make more stacks than
as many rappers i burnt i should open a crematorium
aw yeah baby c'mon and check the rhymes to the song
no matter the tempo fast or slow
jump up and down and eh and all around and
dj mister ceeon the mix gt x4
now yo tell yourself a song gt
ltoh mister cee oh mister cee gt
ltlewisavenue lewisavenue gt

spike d willie d na rock chicago yo
fists of fury suckers get buried
that claim to glitter you're so bitter like kitty litter
address and bless any mic that i clutch
put me to my knees or at ease chillllld please
but if a rapper tries to diss i crush the motherfucker
i aint a child that's why i dont smile
i get busy get you dizzy like a merry go round
cause i lead ahead of others who rhymes are old as pro keds
if you ever try to step to the big daddy kane
slaves from mental death in power
i wanna tell this story
i said man the hype behind run dmc and cool j
and sure enough huh in about a year's time
i bought myself a condo out in queens
and family members askin for my papers
but for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical
to shemp shawn you know what i mean
that they can raise up on this and put the kane in fright
when i kick a verse the scene becomes so scary
i break down shake down proceed down beat down
if you ever see a jam playin you can bet that damn kane
cause young boy all of your rhymes are pre natal
update yourself just like an 850
the brother to break em when bringin the bomb
big daddy kane
if they aint lying they tryin to do some other wildness
now there's this girl named monique
and monique would be ready to sleep
in order to gain respect from anyone else
female voice
verse 2
to lie about his means of transportation
and couldnt hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
and sayin i'm baggin all rappers on the bandwagon
sittin next to the man sittin next to the man sittin next to the man
mumble jumble kick yak you better get back
i played him like a toy heavens to merkatroid
you're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
huh nuff respect due
pardon me a moment as i interrupt
both straight from the bottle not the cup
of da ville
keep food in the fridge so it dont get stale
coffee on the table orange juice as well
so step aside as i take the lead
on the dance floor hype moves i be freakin
i hate to brag but damn i'm good
so in turn sit back and learn
na na na now girls step up the quick ones kept up
gtfrom the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely
because you say that i love 'em and leave 'em but no i please ya
i wont get tipsy i dont drink and talk
so girls dont barge dont blink be still
repeat chorus
always gave headahces never known for heartaches
no tokens for heart broken turnstiles
you keep on to the break of dawn
or non equivalent or natural ebony
to show a pro and let em all know
nah nah nah nana uhh
give a little shout to the rappers that's out
you're still 2 live if you never get a grammy
becomes a friend of me
nah nah nah nana
but you're talking ying yang like as if you're in a gang
when i can rap about gettin some ass
be because it's ok ya know it's ok to brag and boast
cause i'm the straight up wholly original yeah that's right mmm hmm
so ladies grab a hand and join the caravan
so mysterious and serious the women are curious
change the groove and funk it up a little bit
then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods
i'm like a nine and you're just a naked gun
cant get next to this
i strike like mike tyson i be icin
these is the grounds that the kane is conquerin
your brain and remain like hairweave
but i'm like a renegade so i never been afraid
big daddy kane a teacher 2x
looks to me like eastside got problems
point blank let's change the whole scenery
big daddy kane
dont be dont be mislead use your brain instead
but for your but for your own good just lean on me
goes a little somethin like like
the students the pupils have morals and scruples
that means authority
here i am r a w
try to front perpetratin a stunt
the rhymes i use definitely amuse
as i shoot the gift mc's stand stiff
problem i could sneeze sniffle or cough
i get ill and kill at will
and be the most and boast the loudest rap
shakin em up breakin em up takin no stuff
a lyrical knockout showin i got clout
and spaciousness and even where it applies to convey actual movement gt
but i drop bass just like barry white
get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
a terrorist here to bring trouble to
when you know that i'll smoke you up like a blunt
better than dynasty or hill street blues
give me that title boy you dont deserve this
when i clear my throat that's all she wrote
ltbreak gt
only crushing mc's that be trying to riff
bring your own casket and tombstone
one evening while it was in the studio
the microphone assassinator and furthermore
king asiatic no other rapper stands this
acquit em when i get wit em you can tell that i did em
so dont even start it black
rappers sat there and listened a lot of young huh
now may it rest in peace
i keep the crowd loud when you're hype
go with the flow my rhymes grow like an afro
save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
you ever had to confront me and you can bet that
dancin with the crew so allow the boys to smother
and if you are what you eat they're feedin me dope
female reporter
and well clears throat according to the prince of darkness
and when it comes to girls i show no mercy
the way that i plan to put this chocolate syrup to use
then bend over doggy style and just watch me
aiyyo
say i eat it i eat it whoahhh shit
or could it be the president that's being hesitant
then you find your state of revenue remains the same
they got game for every young rapper they see out on the streets
of a friend to me to injure me
lord have mercy i know how julius caesar must have felt
it's a shame to see how far left people be going
pretending huh so full of it they need an enema
and i grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough
and i'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
even if you join a army you still couldnt battle
hey here i come with a slick rap tic tac toe
who could ever say that i dont get plenty play
so shyheim if your down with the groove
cause i rock the world from usa to asia to russia
verse four big daddy kane
that is i thrown ya scold ya jones ya i tried to warn ya
if i was wearing pantyhose you still couldnt give me no run
get on the mic it's time to show and prove
the incredible skills of the g from brooklyn big up kid
so ason huh if you're down with the groove why dont ya
whether at a party or just in bed
of ason who carries on like a manager
but i'm not animated like a cartoon
rappers act so wild and love to profile
now girls step up to this
that when it comes to this there's none greater
attack you like robatussin on a cough
genuine for eighty nine
i love her and i need her and i never ever cheat her
now i've heard of traffic but i've never heard of when
another thing that's quite bizarre
cause thinkin about the cost of a divorce
all day long i'm just singin a
cause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort
and come back home college feet be on
yeah i went from rags to riches but i still rock the saggy britches
kane stop shammin
money you're worse than yacub
that you can donate to leukemia all the time
stop hold up pause wait 2x
well i'ma hit it but still i show no pity
stop hold up pause wait 2x
and since i got paid and blew up like a live grenade
or should i say peace as i start to release
so grab one line rub it on your face like sunshine
comin together like keys on a piano
and once i rock these with a style that's cock deis
verse 2
but child what i'll compile is too versatile
i learned the dead presidents to pass american history
but at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
you like that type music yo'self stick yo'self
yes mon me got mad flava just like jerk chicken
here we go children
i kick so much flavor that my shoes look like a rainbow
and had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin see
i was out flex lookin cold sex in a lex'
word to miz what the problem is is that the kids
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
that's how i did em huh that's how i did em hah
cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
dance across the land the kane will scar the
mislead victims who dance with the devil
destroy all our kind without a hassle
begins the game wonderin who will the killer be
to a higher level than dancin with the devil
misled and unknowin people are goin
so one for the bass and two for the treble
it's not a fairy tale a myth it's a musical uplift
so to the rear step off and let the man flex
one hip hopper that dont have to sound proper
and any mc that tries to test me
you're too pathetic bring in a paramedic
that you cant deny
so why you standin there with yo' nails bitten low
aint gon be no looking tight we gon party tonight
as i run it down to you all skillfully
chorus
and dismantle handle everyone i ran through
chorus
yo it's time for me to get busy on the mic by myself
the only other people you can see is scoob and scrap
i'm supposed to go big daddy hell no
until you learn to show your dj some respect
do the knowledge
he rocked the kangols adidas when run and them had that spot
now sure he should he started acting like he from the hood
do you really know
but then it happen
you went upstairs thinking that she wasnt able
you should have been thankful for your child like cheryl pepsi
because you aint got it in the heart
you couldnt handle 3 to 5
y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks
oh my god tell me is it really him
i bring it raw gee too hardcore gee
oh i originate and create the great to dictate
yo you better not do it you better not
nobody and i mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
i crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
okay okay okay okay
and dont make the error of tryin to come near a
hard as concrete and always on beat
there's no laughter cause the one that i'm after
only mc with an original rap style
yo the microphone's mine
now back to the subject of the matter
well it takes style charisma class
round of combat where my left arm's at
mc's crawl by when they see this tall guy
i'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
and it's a fact that i can swing i'm not a new jack
all i need is my loaded four five
and we outta here love peace and hairgrease
sha queen
and that's absurd i kick the illest shit you ever heard
i'm a let you know that stuff you pop is junk
hit you like mortal kombat you in danger
earth wind amp fire you bout to learn
instead i appear and take your fuckin spot like sinbad
i made many men bleed i made hairlines recede
the brat lil kim foxy get that loochee
peace to eazy e stretch and mercury
east coast west coast organizin
lost boyz being found in lex coups bimas and benz
need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin jewels
dont make me have to bring it to ya'
i'm too poetically inclined one of a kind
float float on
you'd probably come out better tryin to fight in kuwait
of a lover and a smooth black brother
see the way that you serve rap's like a death penalty
so i can get five to ten for carryin a papermate
i build and excel and plus i rap like hell
somethin exquisite and clever like a wizard
cause if i'm correct i kicked them all in the anus
so when one tries to battle i'm like hoo boy
i start to flow slow and then ohh no
chop suey soft and chewy
and show some unity in music
jay z you gotta get down and
and to my cousin '95 you gotta get down
cause i'm everlastin and my rhymes keep blastin
and keep the girls screamin just like captain caveman
as i progress to bless the mic and strike the stage
and competition i'll explain to them
i wanna take all of the people that's leaping along with this tune

for the day that you can give your all to me

i gotta throw joints to prove my point
and life is the same old song
i roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
beware of one of the best they be
and let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
a fast demise disaster lies as he dies
but take a look i think the kane about to overcook

somebody get the god kane i know he'll back you up
now look what i dug me somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
they cant believe it infatuated hardcore rhymes

verse 3
your gimmick is primitive and impotent
i can rock your headpiece worse than the wop ever did
whip ass is probably out there
become the most to you like love is supposed to do
and my dreams are very special
well i must admit that you know how to treat a woman
and just so it can stay that way
no not that good
come get some you little bum
make you tumble and stumble in a rumble just crumble
and i can slice and dice a fisher price mc
take two other men with soul that you probably know
so toss the sauce across to the boss no remorse
you start hallucinatin like magic
i meant to say wack a vision of blur
and my man big jay cee
a black man from the motherland
i saw my peoples sold raped and took out
i was born
i had to make that change and rearrange
money is not only the root of all evil

visions occupy my synaptic's space
destined to rise because i'm basement adjacent

i dunno what it is but the girls get hot
a gangsta or villain in mine is in session
writin my lyrics with this hyped information

yo compton was like still water just strictly calm
murder was a dirty job to rob a dead man
or some niggas in a muthafuckin gang
so i made a song so
as the sea
remember when we first met
the sun is trying to kill the moon
run away tonight
everything you want is wrong
freedom freedom
everything is turning blue
mas eu sou um brasileiro antes de ser rapper ou pagodeiro ou os dois ou nenhum
e abre as pernas pro que os outros lhe impe
capacidade que muitas vezes no utilizada
talvez acordar
aproveitando o que vem l de fora mas sem esquecer o nosso valor nacional
e mesmo hoje em dia bom que se lembre
ento se voc s d ateno para o que vem de fora no me d ateno
do nosso jeito
mas eu t na vida real e no quero fugir dessa realidade
mas isso ns no merecemos porque s vivemos dormindo no ponto
meus amigos

so take these broken wings and learn to fly again and learn to live so free
now i'ma flip this session over to the positive
driving in the sun
here we come
right back where we started from
a voice calls out behind my back
now you've got me on the ropes out here
but you cant just leave it
you and i
dont let it come apart
give it all away
would you give it all away
not in here either where did she go
no she's not
but you look confused and you dont know what to do
the best thing you can do is get lost on the way
its hard to get an answer when you havent got a clue
porque o fim pra eles j chegou
mas no alcancei
se enrolam mais e mais
s vezes que nem rita lee eu penso que um dia eu quer ser ndio
ento viva intensamente a sua enquanto d
mas no deixe ningum dominar a sua
o que est dentro do seu corao da mente e da alma
chegando a concluso de que morreu e no viveu
sem paz

but sister you know i'm so weary
you who are my home
in your love my salvation lies
how can you say your life is empty

abandoned feeling for just a piece of mind
play
everybody knows that life can be wonderful
every sunrise and starry night
oh my love i can`t let go
oh my love i can`t let go
the rain clouds move so slowly
bury tears in the chapters you shut

it's three strikes two tokes two times for the mind repeat 8x
the persona is to crush kill destroy the bad karma that
of they lp's try to tell me shit
speak your name if your lyrics hold sorrow aint that a damn shame
extra tight one hundred percent drama full armor
the particular way that i've kicked it
study facts my brother read all about it
giving it a steady a flow who's like dope you are
witness the presence of the two n e w
mc's clingin i bring on a new swing and they swung
is takin you to another dimension keepin you up to par

five years later now i'm off to work
to be a jackass in the future then who's gonna shoot ya

i year later i made demo cassettes with the monch
old snake shit hissin in the grass
outro
thirty two bit computer chip be slipped between my lips
all over the track
cling when i sing a song of sixpence if it makes sense then sing along
that i'm ahead of your time specifically right behind a dope rhyme
i'm mystical rip shit til the power blows
the pharoah usually go first but it dont matter
when i proceed to light the party
cause i'm poetry the psychic
i'd rather make the money bein on the cover of em
i hit the hook heavy
i figure the eight inches of me will be the remedy
tricky in a joust plus i'm down with mickey mouse
nigga political snitches abe me which is
when the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
mike
speak
i'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
so my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
lemon to a lime lime to a lemon
organized but at the same time konfusing
for crowds just like any body
i'm the prolific child these are
to wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
who share needles outside in the rain on kraftmatics
than to be scorned in this world of hate
the love with the hatred inviting friction
flow as a positive form to first step
from all that unprotected sex and cold ballantyne ales
glisten destined forever weather the storm
verse one prince poetry
lay it down for the south side sounds of blackness
forming like voltron and then attacking at dawn
migrating in the whole tri state area
on a passenger side this is what i'm asking her
chorus 12
for years tears shed it but never let it
with the big big o and you know
and blow up the spot and organize on that ass i'm hot
ryyyyyuuuu kick tiger tiger uppercut
raid your block blow your mind like fans
taste the bread i break off as i take it to your face whew
many claim masculine but sport garters
that elevates you like steps
niggas try to get over pressure on my shoulders
that's why i should be rapping and packing pistols on the bully
we gotta maintain repeat 8x
take a good look at what you fear ha
all you have to do is show some decency
prince poetry
mack 10 under seat for carjacking passenger 57's
on the corner of my block doin crime now i'm
it's love in the form of life as you know it
but i'm not not eighty six in the mind mind you
racin a 50 in my 380i
now just yesterday i couldnt took my last five heartbeats
when in the world 12 disciples in this life cycle
there's just too many rages
but the soul is uplifted
or maybe in the form of a man
hmmmmmmm and now i ask lord have mercy upon me
homicides over epidemics and crack vials
brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
you better get up and wipe to clear your eyes
ooooooh cold but yummy
i'm watchin you front
the chosen lyrical soldier who backs me up
stuck up and quite conceited
shredder of a competitor makin it better for
interrupting your braincells dilutin your thoughts
pharoahe monch
better figure the verbs are thick in you
wack style the critics are sore to crack smiles
when i roll offbeat offbeat again
down the sewer always knew i could do a brother
so dont ever despise
words of wisdom never abuse the lines
any man wearing a blindfold can be misled
releasin deadly gasses bodies deteriorating
as the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times
fifty two pick up a stick up so get on the floor facedown
pickin em stickin em up breakin em shakin em up and bashin
there is strength in my men tal bolism brains to spare
and enemy lines are crushed bumrushed
prince poetry
the niggas with skills
who rips shit
dont mean they got that flow
now your soul bubblin brown sugar so you remember it
as you look from whenceforth i come riding the wind
it's ironic when a demonic government
prince poetry
precision beams
johnny more grotesque
into dimensions to unlock new doorways
the intelligent one utilizing the mind third vision
from the slums of earth to center
round of poetical warfare energetically i walk with the flare
for god still is my upliftor
so i stretch like reed richards across the land
running upon the jagged edge fuck the rough life
playin the courts takin the loss to wherever
roosevelt felt staticky he knew things were shady
after takin aim and buckin and blowin the smoke away
so i dont give a two drip drops about what those have felt
i dont sleep at night time cause dimes i dont drop
i was abused they stripped the mind for amusement
in soda cans so dogs wont sniff me
damn i almost forgot yo yo i have to break out
chorus
you know deep inside i wanna sex you like no other
into this elevator exotic world with the tall black
pharoahe monch
oh you smoke beedies see you go
believe me
with your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
but still hinted like i was self centered
my name is prince boo
far
to throw up some heat
we buildin baby
i scatter data that i catapult to metaphor
all opticals are not inside the plan
and even when i'm gone
exquisite with the style that i be using
my termi ni ni ni ni ni nology
with the men of medicine
for salvation will perish
i bless souls thru the worldz second religion
was a 7 my steps and wit da few
chorus
standin aloneit gets you tinimented
my physical form iz like nam and sane like sadaam hussein buit still calm
visualize the scene of a homicide a slaughter
a red range rover then i ricochet
crashin through the doors of projects hallways
nobody seen shit nobody heard it 4x
shall i bust ya liver faster blood pours bang
i flip up the hollow tipper and i'm not the one
yo o peep it oh shit o duck oh shit oh shit
figure i'm bigger takin your heart nigga at twenty years old
with dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
you will now consider me the apocalyptic one
my perception of poetical injection is ejactulation
the four cabs before didnt pick me up
hand to hand rap combat black
the trilogy of terror whatever i do i bring light
chorus repeat 2x
for my disposal to dispose of who are you kidding
when to say the least
check the metaphors make sure they're making sense and then
he fought back but the attack was brutal
and a glock 9 when he stops at the light
hoppin hopin to catch them all open girls scopin as you unlock
on the side of a slug damn it's bugged
cause the life of an illegal entrepeneur
to match the colors inside of your eightball sherling
thinkin about pickin up a convertible saab
piles up like drug cases in queens
then i take it's name and change it's religion
styles i file are not decaffinated i'm rough
for the periodical table of contents symbol au
with some more fat shit i tell your empty mind
with the crew that rolls deeper than the mediterranean
prince poetry
blue fields green
come in and he'll feel dumb if his son
we gotta walk into the sun ha hah
some smoke joints to annoint their brain
on a kaleidoscopic tree visually
we gotta get away we gotta do it now
of scratches that strike like sticky matches
in this particular era of darkness
prince poetry
round up the herbs at six flags we're on a mission
with the sum there were some who wasnt dumb
damn it really hurts my heart to remember these remember these
when i collect my thoughts i recollect
ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix
somebody stole my piece of chicken
prince poetry
pharoahe monch
little suzy may robinson used to play
i said to myself please oh please reverend now would
but there's not one piece of chicken on the table left
well i expect to find it when i get home or else
out like a sucker repeat 4x
sometimes i swear i think about robbing 'em
for her fing finger yes i used to bang her
just to stress a nigga quick young she's on a ego trip
loved to cover her neck for stress gave her a cat as a pet meow
out like a sucker repeat 4x
what can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club
that we get em confused
where sodomites get all the rights
the devil say the end is the beginning
told the truth to get what i want but shot it with no shame
where me and my niggaz surpassed the flow
something's gotta change
for the robbin crew thinkin they robbin you you must be cautious
as the candidate keeps flippin niggaz dippin
psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
friday's are tight but saturday just makes it old
trees bright and green turn yellow brown
by not bein ourself
i say stand up on deception of time all of revelations
just face this mindstate
them hooks like sellin dope to black folks
the southern slang figure ways and mojo chicken wangs
like memories of yesterday
you catchin the wrong vibe packin yo' shit and rollin yo' eyes back
like soap is to lather we come clean
like some eagles people dont understand
musical interlude 2x
feat big rube
nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get our meat
known as mankind
my memories of yesterday
my stomach cant digest it even when i bless it
so go 'head and diss it while real hop hippers listen
uhh born antwan patton but my potnahs they call me big boi
but man it seems i'm reachin out and touchin the wrong nigga
oh like liberty bells yes them bullets keep on rangin
in your raps mercedes benz and all your riches
voice of andre fades in
a bad note aint no bad note
a bad note aint no bad note
in case of physical breakdowny'all can break now
as long as big boi's still livin never standin by my lonesome
i'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause it's the

the hound's only found when you feed him
chorus

cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents
and your baby mamma on child support
three strikes and you're ruined now where your crew at
but still aint did nuttin that aint been done befo'
fever was it me or either summer madness

verse two
especially when the music's going slow
indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving
if you just keep kickin listen to the mix
rising to the top and i came to drop it
i'm the r the a to the k i m
pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well
when the crowd is moving i compete with the mix
control of the mic uptight when i grabbed it
casualties of war
bullets whistlin over my head remind me
casualties of war x4
back to the battlegrounds it's war they declare
shooting at the general and where's the sergeant
it'll be more dead people after this
when i dont know who or what i'm fighting for
take control cause i'm in charge
you're my only girl

kissed the girls and made them cry

dont sweat the technique x2
prepared never scared i'll just bless one
if he bleed he wont need no band aid to fix
dont get excited you've been invited to a quiet storm

verse 1 bone crusher
verse 2 killer mike
repeat chorus w ad libs by ti
like hope for the best but i'on think he gon make it
yea nigga just break'em off muthafucka
melodies for mc's motivates the breaks
i was supposed to wait but let's motivate
planets are small as balls of clay
verse two
a magnum as a microphone murderin mc's
in history not a mystery or a memory
it cant be mixed diluted it cant be changed or switched
on every traitor or snake so stay awake
directions is told then the rhymes are stolen
keep comin but you came too late but i'll wait
you better take a deep breath and keep followin
even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned
this is what we all sit down to write
so when you see me come up freeze
i hold the microphone like a grudge
like before the middle of my story i'm telling
guide you out of triple stage darkness
and you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon
a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go
i know you got soul
you wanna rhyme you gotta sign my list
drop the mic you shouldnt be holding it
i got soul you got it that's why i came
whoever's out of hand i'm give him handles
it should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
planet earth was my place of birth
but it seems like i'm locked in hell
you're at
make way 'cause here i come
'cause back in the days they lived in caves
mind keeps traveling i'll be back after i
it aint where you're from it's where you're at
i'm so low key that you might not see me
people in my neighborhood they know i'm good
it shouldnt have to be like that
and then taught to hawk new york
raking em up breaking em up
and i do work with these like hercules
black gambino die like a hero
i paid my dues paid the cost
hang out wit smith and wesson dont try to play me
girls sip cristal and whisper my name
come get me that's if you want to sip the juice
put together well so it aint hard to tell
so let me handle this gettin scandalous
no huss cuss what i discuss'll bust his head
on my level to think or sink like quicksand
eager to listen dance in a trance til you see the
i get my point across when you respond i make sense
keep em out of they seats and on the floor
cause i keep em eager to listen
like rick james i'm the fire in your desire's flames
heart to heart and cheek to cheek then i complete the beat
i'll give you a beat you never had before
the instrumental enters your mental
rise like the sun here comes the sun
heart to heart and cheek to cheek then i complete the beat
ripping up comp i step and then stomp
get up to the trick as i flip the script
i project alot so you can use every kick you got
and whoever try to take 'em i'm a break 'em
too quick to pause it you almost lost it
innovated 'cause the flow
expect the expert to perfect and do work
i go to queens for queens to get the crew from brooklyn
standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
switch to southpaw split your right jaw
living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
and my pockets are still fat
i'm at war alot like anwar sadat
i push up like an exercise
cause the streets await me so i take my gun off safety
then i'm 'a give 'em piano
nothin can bruise me
none on target
and watch 'em radiate
powerful paragraphs
eric hit 'em with' some of that
will spread when
plus i'm packed up with
nothin can harm me
let it split 'im
maybe they might dance
touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
that kill a man
if i speed they know you'll blow the hell up
blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
before i get that fifi i met
i'm the arsenal
massage 'n melodies
no time to do your hair baby
penetrate at a crazy rate
the hit man is the
reduced the friction with crucifixion
lyrics made of lead
ya hide in the back
you been hit with somethin
put 'em by the basement
rhyth with ral rough rhyme
i'm hard read like graffiti but steady
too many milligram
was the rhythm
section for section
now i'm 'a have to let the style brak
makes her feel secure whenever i'm wit' 'er
ya tremble like a alcoholic muscles tighten up
friday the thirteenth walking down elm street
worse than a nightmare you dont have to sleep a wink
the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
if not my soulll release
i sit back and observe the whole scenery
furier than ever i remain the furture
lyrics of fury
almost looked korean but european
calm ya nerves massage ya brain
she said she'd have my kids and help me make my next g
take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
thinkin of later on of what she would do to me
and couldnt wait to get 'soft and warm' i said
champagne she'll entertain then sing some
i melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
to dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
everything is written in the cold so it can coin
i fiend for a microphone like herion
after 12 i'm worse that a gremlin
i wrote the rhyme that broke the bulls back
more than cracked up you should have backed up
when all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure
contact is compact when i bust
sumpin and pumpin and slobbin and droolin
maybe later youre gonna be
distance i kept ou better watch your step
embalmed with fluid
maybe what youll find somewhere over the rainbow
go manufacture a match send me after a blast
as i memorize advertise like a poet
and i'll break when i'm through breakin i'll leave you broke
you shouldnt have told me you said you controlled me
i wouldnt a came and said my name and run same weak shit
when i approach i exercise like a coach
extra event the grand finale like bonus
i take 7 mc's put 'em in a line
so many rhymes you wont have time to go for yours
eric b made a cut and advertised it
mc you'll beat the r i'll say oh never
neighborhood to support ya
try to concentrate maintain then elevate
competition is none i'm the soul survivor
three fourths of water makes seven seas
when i translate the situations straight
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
rainin on rappers there's no parade
eye inside no extended version
you bite like a parasite you attacks
check your engine and ask your engineers
and you'll remain backstage
sprayed up he said he was gonna do what
fill her with life until she burst with energy
not to be hot to trot by a haunt
that you dont scratch your cuts in the grave
no intermissions cause it aint commercial
i cant stop
i cant stop
check this out since we talking over
i need money i used to be a stick up kid
a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
'cause my girl is definitely mad
peace
more volts than a lightning bolt handle with care
they couldnt get warm gimme a cut
if you try this your response is tonsilitis
you cant destroy the decoys so detour
this is for thousands of people who came
sneak in the back door lookin for the stage
eric b clap your hands cut and scratched x8
soon as i stop you had enough of
i got a tip of my own and i dont sing
the chance to put actual facts on wax
rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
microphone your majesty no one's bad as me
instead of goin with the flow like you're supposed to go
women i give 'em pain and still soothe
the day is kind of off but i can get it on
no more crimes i got rhymes and it pays
to the max it's in depth it attacks but it's relax wit pep
blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
relax wit pep it's relax wit pep
pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
i said i'm tight from a real long flight could you soothe me
we wish you didnt have to leave no more
fly ladies in the house all screamin awww yeah
i set up hips like domino chips
double oh seven is back
better hope my mic dont blow again
so track the wack at the right and exact could
format collapse your lungs twist your tongues
no obituary and nothing left to bury
strategy that'll be tragic automatically
the days in the park when rap was an art then
then you've got seven minutes to vacate the
brother like me
scratching
cause i already got light
so hand in your application
go 'head and flow cause i close the show
so bring a dictionary so you can look it up
cause sellin drugs is for handicaps
you got lost and couldnt go on
driftin up the creek without a beat or a paddle
see if you can step to this
so absorb the song til the rhyme's all gone
three hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
when we reach the top dont stop risin
with run on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
just step the rhymes create energy
dance without hopin that this come on next
eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab without a mic to grab
nature's balance is way off balance
but he dont want to hear it it's out of the question
i parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
understand the words in this song
the one's that interfere wit nature

in another place and time
with all my heart
wont you please be my own

in walked a man in the shape of a man
and the man broke into a smile
we talked like children without breathing
in the shape of a man
both of us drink from a fountain of feeling waiting for the blood to spill
have some faith in what's his name
for i just found someone else who's sure to take your place
but you wont catch my glances anymore
you're a quarrel patcher
talking out of turn drawing circles down
ulterior motives
of the ones that bite
yea i know we just got through
i can be at my job in my car up in church
sex can make you crazy
i aint proud of it cause it's getting in the way of love for me

first officer danze reportin for 'nam

there's a war goin on outside it's impossible to stop

chorus guru
and they deserve ruin like ancient rome i span the universe
i notified families we shed tears and more
john f kennedy the moon and the planets are there
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
guru
pretendin that she loved him only really loved dollars
bring a gat wear a mask and come through the window
dukes with the mask told him run your shit
it's alongwaytogo when you dont know where you're going
so i'mma step just to speak about the counterfeit unlegit type of people
q tip from check the rhime how far must you go to gain respect um
i came to claim shit this year this year
there's a large amount of wack crews for them i got bad news
we know who we are but do you know who you are
lyrical elements emerge from the intro
relate to what i create
so you can get this right
cause this party i own it
and then sway as i read my s a
soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot
i'm blastin your sons i'm snatchin your funds
i bring it straight to your chest ask your staff about me
legendary worldwide we can battle right here
scratched i'm bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game
yo what up kid
hopefully they wont keep you in there for too long
scarface is tight son
and each and everyday around the way gats bust
of course over some drug shit
supposed to be an unclefam and all that
he on a mission to become a ball player
kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
while he's starin at the shell
reacting to a beat in a whisper
past your head i'm grabbin abstract thought
like planets in orbit we ride the life cycle
poetry it comes from within and will always win
between em because y'know some things can happen
ghetto people
and turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
of interstate cargo taxin niggaz like us embargoes
chorus mop and guru
i'm true to myself y'all and i'm a down ass nigga
in the penile to bville down to grayson
i divide anything that i got
hey yo we went through all out wars half assed tours
ah so now ya got me pissed off blast off lift off
i'll stick an mc for his spot and sign in blood on his wack record
let you slide through rhymes will scar you
extreme temperatures from my mic stuns amateurs
i'm bout to blow the fuck up
i got you open and now you cling to my sac
guru
pick the vic who will it be
so i'ma take dough from em and then stum em
not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
cause baby there aint no sunshine when i'm gone
you might be bigger than me so i'ma wet ya
your time's up
for me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
when i come through i'm pullin whole crews cards
do what you want to but watch yourself though duke
and i insist that if you persist
cuz at the battle last time you snuck out
big shug
if you dont know the equation then you cant do the math
i push these lyrics through any emcee
while you fidget you could get killt for your digits
you're gonna need more than doo rags and timb's against us
everybody get the fuck up welcome me back
niggaz come to my suite to pick up heat
i'll bust right 'till i find just bumpy left
will you please take your seats and clear the aisles
and once again brains on bend as i go half with premier
aint no gimmicks no phony image cuz i'm a natural
the rules say dont check the pimp check the hoe
skiggy hair man style like lee archer
guru
of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
apocalipse yo i'm not new to this i'm true to this
but the competition keeps me on point
bright lights big city and the dark alleyways
you get bent up sent up creek without a paddle
they wanna shut us down and i say shut up clown
from new york straight talk america's best
so just perhaps you wanna challenge my style of rap
i'm swingin lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
you thought i wouldnt step up to keep my rep up
just like the river niger all the way to the hudson
chorus cut short in 2nd repeat at i rocked you in your knot
so you can help me get my money
i feel ya aura like i'm reading ya horo
guru
i like your little outfit i like the way you're wearin it
your innocent stare and derriere so crazy
hon it aint nothing to it i wanna see you do it
and all i wanna know is why why
you had the opportunity for bein cool with me
and as i speak you girlies yell to your friends yo it's him
from my pocket that is bulging i'm not indulging
and i'll reply with a wink of an eye there'll be no more mr nice guy
you stare you fear my wrath is too severe
motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
i know the time with this rap shit cuz they got it all backwards
a lot of mc's fake hard just to gain appeal
50's still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin
so bug lose your mind but i aint goin insane
and when it comes to rhyming you know i'm hitting hardest
your game is weak you geek so dont sleep
i'll fake you left and go right straight down the lane
with ease and the ladies are swoonin
and even be down to give you a rematch
dj premier scratching
true and livin with a youthful vengeance yo
i show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
we represent the pain that's real talk what's y'all claim to fame
you're better off back on the ave doin somethin else
cause they reflect our light so yo act right fool
i show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
for my respect i just might have to shut you down
you're mediocre son you're barely average kid
players get your pay up
what goes around comes around they tried me later
real rough rhymes
for years i ran with some of the greatest men
now is the chance to advance and get an outlook
cause i must bring ideals for better living see
tape playing loudly inside my headphones
havin nothin to lose so much to win
positive but never negative
la and the rest of the country's got positivity
a new image and let's begin as
dj premier cuts n scratches
suckers who suck because i find more
crew the guru and truth i wanna give to you
so if you're generatin positivity out there
guru
and since i'm inclined i'll kick precisely the right rhymes
received a curse that was much worse than voodoo
with power and punch and yo you might want to step back
premier is here with the flair we're running to you
we'll rip you and ship you back and you'll be repeating
so take a backseat with all your wack beats
you're played out you'll fade out i doubt that you can do me
the dj's name is premier and i'm the guru
since i was twenty one years old and legal
aint no way so come make my day
always talkin bout your dough and your wealth and fame
crazy degrees of difficulties
drop jewels infinite for the blind deaf and dumb
plus y'all dont really wanna see krumb dumb out
pullin out tools on them fools who be flossin
all you foul niggaz gonna pay the fuckin price
you know we're nearest the original gifted
which ones will gain how many suckers will feel pain
but what he owns is his and what's mine is mine

so i'm one two checkin and yes yes y'allin
but still the question remains
what is it
and you're selfish and rather immature
dope beat combined with lyrical energy
me to hold the spot here your rhymes are not clear
i gotch u
i gotch u
i'm flipping like a kilo stash a million or so
i make the moves i'm never faking
i'll beep your style you cant fuck wit the golden child
i came to get what's due to me 'cause i got clout
and i could never go out like a crab
the loot is for the taking
i've got gusto
and i'm here cause you've been victimized
i've got gusto
attack mack and rap
into hype gear no fear i persevere
my man gots that gusto word
my vocals carry and then i bury
the crew already knows that you're really a crab
and hold my own with a mike just to stagger
to give original sound and as your ears pound
cause i'm the hardcore composer
but in the next year someone new will just squoosh him
like they're thinking they're running
i'll take you out while i talk about some ugly
and after the circus i'm certain to prove
and at the stake is where we're gonna burn crooks
we'll never lie to you
as i shoo the tenderonies dont be phony
in a daze like a maze they cant get out of
the glowing light brighter than any ever in your sight
not sissy like and not so decietful
nine and a half 'll get you in a dame
make it slick bitch my dick game's official
that's some brilliant shiznit yo aiyyo
revolvin on task man yeah i'm doper than my last jam
verse 2 guru
but the truth comes to light and push comes to shove
i came to bring your fake hip hop to an ending
what's your name call me guru that's my man premier
makes me much more than just an angry rebel
that's why you stare and point and others cling on to
before i get irate
so dont stop to say hi muthafucka just die
thinking that they are god
rhymes are organized like crime
another minute
tryin to get down
step to the bedlamite i'll prove my word is law
like i said before
when we rock knots and got props like norm peterson
you still here though
you were the illest man alive now i'm reading your eulogy
i'm not sure about any of these names
gq johnny presley fuckin up the elegances
keith 'cowboy' scott larock
to all my brothers doin time whether or not you did the crime
if we dont build we'll be destroyed
linnet grinnich cookie murray
all sung parts in chorus performed by uncle reo
rome
dj p i go all out y'knahmsayin
in the hood we see oppressive genocide
dogg money is key
verse 2 snoop dogg
disrespect me things could get messy
guru in this life i wont have to struggle no mo' no i wont
and you can say i'm getting kind of greedy
most likely in a blunt as i roll it really steady
'cause you gain interest in my lines like i'm city bank
some like are wannabees and some like are wouldbees
i dont brag about the stuff i did
chorus
guru it's time to upset the set up
but i'm confident a few are due to redeem
while some'll be rippin it they be in the crowd wildin
society puts the squeeze on mc's like iron grips of death
conceive to make the beast bleed enhance thoughts
unleash the black rain
sendin out a message of peace to everybody and
yo the music that pops and other cats made
the big band beat was very neat and unique
this is the music that we give tribute to
guru the music called jazz
through the sweat the blood and the toil
and when satchmo blew the audience knew
defining how a beat could be so complete
droppin the bass all over the place
he was another soul man
scheamin on the meaning
with notes as words and havent you heard
yo
please approach the bench
it's ok though cause from grey skies comes blue
of course i know that i'm a role model
dont wanna see us come up dont wanna see us makin g's
for example i know this rich nigerian
there's war in the streets prepared men know best
i've been there i've seen how they make us fall victim
and at the sight of a 4 5th i guess you just might
so he thinks he got a little fame
claimin respect just to get a rep
and little shorty with the 3 8 yo he was inchin
but the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
he might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
they'll be long gone before the kid recovers
kick in the rings and everything ok
rolling with troops of his sons like a gansta figure
some brothers gotta go out just to get are
you'll see my shadow rather my silhouette
i win the science fair so you dont you try and scare
the rhymes are peaceful like yoga and yo i know the
and i will take the mic from you and make the
but violence is never my first choice
and yo her style is worthwhile
someone who'll be there for the whole nine
right now i'm loungin with my man
can i call you later on
when she aint there i feel sad i feel ill
and wont you just check it
hey dont you turn your back like that
when i cock back these lyrics y'all punks best be ghost
and gettin all up in your fuckin mix
you know my fuckin name i rule all game
dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
demandin that you pay for your weak rhyme display
or to thug you gotta be an mc this shit is bugged
in black talkin bout how much his mac spit
ignorance is spreadin through the streets like it was cancer
i am effective here cause i select a clear
it's just true there's nothing so so cause i know
rhymin for climbin and chill while i attract that
knowledge is wisdom understanding
i convey that what i say will awaken you today
i'm elite i'll defeat delete and mistreat
a lot of rappers be like one time wonders
maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal
lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
i've suffered setbacks but now i'm makin greenbacks
so i'ma end this lecture and i betcha
nobody's invincible no plan is foolproof
it's like sabotage it's got me ready to bust
everybody else is gonna get theirs too
dont fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
the anxieties that i wish i could alleviate
so like they say every dog has it's day
now if i pull the trigger on these fully loaded lines
a lot of mc's act stupid to me
throw up your he allah i now divine saviors
a lot of rappers got flavor and some got skills
my religion is rap r a p
makes your girls rear shake let me set it straight
i plan to keep rap real
be aware like swv i'm right here
outro guru shug
i'm sayin yo if i let you get busy youknowhati'msayin
competition come against me and you're losing
that's why the people say that i'm much too much
just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
pumping kinda loud in your blazer or cherokee
cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
that's why everybody knows that i'm much too much
there was a few times i needed your support
rap is an art you cant own no loops
so premier drops a beat for me to say verses to
so you can tell everyone that i'm jerking you
hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
the club is crowded everyone's up in here
the system booming let the bass increase
cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
they got a broken headlight
you got dirty politicians dirty judges and dirty cops
speed on before you get peed on
and i'ma put the squeeze on all of 'em
hustler's convention every night at dd
cause all you gonna find is sufferin and pain
it takes the illest brother just to get respect
and like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
even take their boys with 'em cause they know their boys will go out
they wanna arrest me cuz i'm causing a frenzy
cuz to make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
except it's reality and you dont see it on tv
a method to the madness and you know what i'm meaning
you're making me vexed but yeah you can go next
and when it comes to your destruction i aint really concerned
g dep
ice herbs nice curves girlfriend with the white fur
king raggedy fiends naggin me shit i had to breathe
so if he's here i ace the toners out my holdin tight
chorus 12
she wanted me to knock her in the back of foot locker
cant forget the avorex pocket for the royalty checks
with a sense of confidence
kane and able jealous brothers
or reflections through a spectrum
and the starr symbolizes the power
but to be chosen is a divine gift
guru
and kick hot shit so we can stack the johnny cash
the illest realest word up
look while i'm in new york city
chorus
no interferin if you aint down you got to swearin
the militia
shared cells with lifetakers have sex with rumpshakers
and in the dark hours is when i will shower
chorus freddie foxxx
i creep gradually til everybody knows
that i walk on i meditate while you talk on
i master my hunger blow the spot when i bomb cats
for you dope fiend niggaz in rap i here to inject check
i be standing over you screamin nigga what what nigga what
gloria gaynor on you motherfuckers i will survive

come on now come on
primo said that we should just lock it all down
verse 3 guru
cause our shit be hittin and yours is plain olfashioned
verse 1
cuz in brooklyn we be into our own thing
all this included when you go for a tour
i came in for a visit and ever since then
dont be afraid to venture over the bridge
guru
needed some boom for the mental relaxation
out in b r o o k lyn the planet
sometimes all you need to get by is a girlie
so i stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms
a lot of niggaz be livin real trife out here
on myrtle ave to get a fade with the sides clean
listening to red and marley wishin i was on kid
here in b r double o k lyn the planet
so much cream chumps they cant understand it
you've got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz that's hype
new york city aint the place to be frontin
wishin that we could better our position
the name is well kept and the rep just gets bigga
want some shit that's fat catch a victim do a stick
tons o' guns you got we got they got
and i'm not seeing that them days are gone
tons o' guns got to watch the way you act
'cos there aint no supervision putting kids in check
smiley yo preem' what's good
yo gangsta gangsta og is what you call me
to keep food on my plate stick a mac to your face
it's the message in the song that makes you rock on
with their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
while others rhyme with no reason i be breezin
i never fall off point like deniro in casino
i'm type slick known as the god universal
yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
a man a lover maybe someone to talk to
dont you know the guru's not the type to be out skeezin
verse 2
she pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
living legends ya heard me
an arrogant fuck wave hi when they watch me
lil fame
fit raw this nigga you aint loco
crazy ill man rowdy
i'm tryna cop some more property and in case of them guns
you rich just for you he got a lavish casket
still throwin down on the grounds that i'm average
on the concrete we palm heat like soldiers
prayin to the east
you're gonna see what i'm sayin now
on fools with no rhymes skills messin up the flow
still all of that is just material
the weight of the world is heavy on my mind
we gotta fight with the right mentality
so let me ask you is it too late
so what the fuck y'all movin on up
guru
networkin like a conference cause the nonsense is yet to stop
son is it me they hawk cause i be puttin in work son
they be beggin for attention or some more of the dillznick
paid in the shade with some fly gators on
keep frontin like you's a thug and get your dome pushed back
head of the cartel sellin more cakes than carvel
victory is mine yeah surprisingly
we can do this shit right here in front of your people
the veteran runnin my plan i'm the better man
a kid got shot on the spot for goin where he should not
i put in work and watch my status escalate
the vibe'll drive you crazy almost break your neck
then the set gets wet i bring the crowd into a frenzy
super star studded buyin rings that's flooded
rage next to blast off
puffin get higher than four centers
three men and the lady and uh you know my steez
you know my steez
in a seek and destroy mission to burn and blaze
you know my steez steez steez steez
the style of beats is elevated
it's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
so as i have in the past i whup ass
method man you know my steez
it's often easier for one to give advice
i travel through the darkness carrying my torch
tryin to be fly ridin high on the jet set
my style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
your song's pathetic synthetic like rayon
i aint tall but i can show y'all what a problem is
and yo i'm deadin all the bullshit 'til my casket drops
i speak that re real shit just listen
the golden voice holdin toys
guru
you can or be an evil man
or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
the energy released comes back there is no doubt of it
and you shouldnt stand to let
friend cause the time you spend
i light my sentence like incense
cause homeboy life is cause and effect
go ahead
into my deathtrap right into my clutches
do you wanna mess with this
since back in the day i held the weight and kept my head up
catchin rep off my name your bound to fry
face the consequence of your childish nonsense
i hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
i'm sayin i'm sayin son man
for certain niggaz to blow up and crime paid
you a man baby pop you know right from wrong
for a nigga like me most time that shit's bad news
and make my ends triple and double with them
think twice
riot act let's bring the power to the people
young gun high strung ready to trey eight revolve 'em
verse 2 guru
and do the math figure how to use your talents in a fight
it's growin tense okay i can smell it today
in a minute they gon have us duckin and divin
time out to pull a rhyme out and update this
the outcome is death dont ask me to sympathize
and as i'm speakin i'll be bombin the dumb
and that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
punks are thinkin they're alla that their voices are all flat
or any other train in the city for that matter
sit back and reflect ponder and chill out
all the slobs just run when i come to get some
they're gettin daytime play but i still say they should take a rest
shit it's that ol g flavor
it dont matter you dont have to be likin me man
d block gangstarr leave you right where you stand what
as soon as the chrome scope him right there two in the dome
you gangstas is cosmetic
yeah the most righteous till malcolm got a close likeness
i do my thing like the whole planet depends on me
about the situation for today's youth man the seeds man
then the sins of the father will visit the children
verse 1 guru
we're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
i meant to elevate at every venue
cause systematically they gettin greedier and greedier
for those who cant follow that spells guru when in my circle
gangstarr represent
products and puppets and pawns gettin played out
check it the ground be hot under our feet
wherever i go
my honey annoits me with oils g
and to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
i have to stand out from all the rest
i want the public to know what goes on
and ronnie's self interests had him livin in a different world
there aint nobody to trust
dissension can occur from within one's ranks
take you under my wing it dont matter god
premier scratching guru samples
as a little nigger broke thinking soda and coke
h staxx
i'm the truth give you proof and your video shoot
nyg'z
the name the set you rep connects you get
since you aint wanna let niggers eat
and let's see if the gimmick last until the next season
you find yourself saying who me time and again
'cause if you dont have it you may simply go mental
she knows what she wants 2x
not the frantic freak type but if you speak right
yo she knows what she wants
and if you happen to luck up and get in
yo she knows what she wants
it was all hype i needed more insight
like her no disrespect miss
she knows what she wants and just how to get it
suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
so when you say yo baby she aint gotta say hi to ya
it's going down
one she said she wanted to give me a son
cause i got more to do than to be sucked dry
the funky beat
watch as we do it again
mic skills type grills like i'm michael jill
spit flows rip shows peep the recital
we hold it down like a holy crown
fulfill your need and catch joyful rush
each thug is now reppin this with deep love
but i'm a stay with my peeps stay in these streets
watch as we do it againskills
i dont mean to preach but i'll impeach your phony form of speech
crush your dome section punks i wreck em mics i bless em

the rest is up to you to choose
the death toll rises more
chorus
our music pertains to those who remain
fear is a joke slowpoke i'm like claws
yellow fluid check out how i mellowed into it
born wit the art in his heart that is spartacus
one mc got beheaded and you can too
dj premier cuts the phrase step inside my arena over and over
tryin to toy wit a destroyer of many
presenting you with alternative music
finding a way is important
chorus
the guru is now the brother you fear and
run step yeah bounce nigga bounce

stagnate competition like an earthquake

ufo's surround the globe
rock stars and mobsters above streets in helicopter
captured placed inside of aquariums studied by scientists
usin cell division and molecular collision within me
as nuclear dropped out of the sky
deposited in scripts of the 20th century prophets
where you run ten paces and your face is fallin off
controls the people livin legal
liars in the pentagon drop their nuclear bombs ran panic
it aint over motherfuckers
the shadow the dark side
it's a suicide a suicide
the world it aint safe no more
cause tragically i carry thee
you're forced to reside on the north side
the alpha and omega and the home of the beggars the black sellers
but read about this inside the ancient books of war
tobagos separated us from slave boats
at night time i can hear the earth cry
pyramids built accordin to how we made it to be
god cypher love devine is what i miss
older than the sun moon and stars unprecedented
i wonder how many black gods must die
you need somebody to dig that grave up and bring them back to life
and this is it the black god exists
the fourth dimension is time it goes inside the mind
the small towns is like ghost towns everybody moves slowed down
a teflon vest so bullets cant penetrate

would u be offended if i showed ya kiss you baby love you baby
baby show me the best time of my life
i saw her right there just the other night
when we lied about the beautiful time to come
prepare for the lowest standard
make no mistake
against the wind
when the beauty and the miracle of new life
lies of self indulgent pride
with so few actions so many words
there will be no peace
and look beyond
this useless praise
my existence will not be dictated like a reading from a book
take my arms that i might reach you
as blood to heart
flesh is predisposed to die
poured myself out
yet i want to be held by anyone
i was not born as what i have come to be
it is not who i am
in peace
breathe easy friend
i may very well be the strongest man
of impulse and self indulgence
born from this soil
let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams
there is a need for faith
i drink from the grail and war with the immortals
i must inspire while i live
where everything important to me
singin jibberish
the way you thought no one ever would
accept this pretty package named friend
friendships are weak and nothing is dear to me
staring at the reflection of failed attempts at love and a black heart
the act is contemptible
how i have learned to wield this scorched jet blood
may this blood pave the way to solution
developing an even more insatiable thirst for chaos
let this be my refusal to fit in
a product of conceit so absorbed and vain that he thinks himself divine he
will bring forth reparations of the most severe degree
my soul is free from weakness
my heart is open this slate is clean
chorus
beggin for forgiveness and your sympathy
bridge
fight without purpose
the beautiful moment of song and passion
to arms
for life is weary without song or sound of harps
only instead reflections of a rippled self
moving through self degradation
he has failed where others
suffering knows no end
why should time be any different than life
his endless misfortune
sway my temper's balance
the strings so carelessly attached to me
and i have a lifetime left to learn
indeed i have grown cold
we would truly know winter
i bang and let your fuckin brains hang snitches
pointed hollow point shit
pour the cristal on the way to trial rico law
my two cannons blast niggaz ass niggaz
bling bling it's a bad boy thing
make ya popular
what type of nigga stay in the trump for weeks bad boyz
prolific words i speak for the unheard
it is what is either graveyards or consecutive life bids shit
a couple of mils and good attorneys
verse 3
and all we got is sports entertainment or the streets
just walkin uh in ya chin chilla fur
and ya diamond cluster to much just to touch ya
tell me to pick her up in my rolls royce
well maybe not completely but stay alarmed
take you to the balcony pick you up
in paris eiffel tower
even if the paragraphs didnt hit the charts and smash
come quick yeahhhhhhhhh come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa

man of children died in vain
men of steel and men of pride
frightening shelter likes you

in this world made of pain

i'll come and get you with my car
magnos homines virtute non fortuna metimur
i have lived my life in a way that i know that i was not born in vain
so many times i've been down that road before on my way to insanity
sometimes your submarine wont dive
i'm just a tale from long ago
of war and blood and those who died
with a heart of stone
and round and round again
they found a skeleton on the beach
some years ago he had been a teacher
it must have been a miracle
but no body was ever found
the little boy's now growing older fast
this is the end and this is the time
and here i stand and watch the waters flow
to keep your heart
and time time will tell
some give all
we dont need no one
but we wont give up
oh we will we will
oh it's all about spreadin our love all over
we will return
it's all good now
gimme the reasons
and after all these one night stands
what you give is what you get
we'll never give in

through the fire we will ride
will the forces of daybreak someday quit the fight
follow acid tears down to the river of
swallow our fears for the trace of a moment

verse three
cause when i bust my nut i'm raisin up off the cot
the telegraph pole knows where
you holy cow
at least the dog has a smile on its face
a little too often these days
i've not made amends for yesterday
like uninvited guests
you dont seem to care
as long as you can see
together and it's killing me
pick up the soap
ya sputter and splash all over the tub
ud dle um dum
scramble through greasy pathways
we dont need
are said too much
around our heads
all that i am
i'm aware i'm alive
it scares me more every day
and winter plucks your strings
the drinking strangles me
i just couldnt believe
you opened your heart
getting your kit off in the street
or i will leave you then we'll see
ho la la ee ay
the words dont mean a thing
called me back to the start
i need the darkness a death grip embrace
so good i cant see the light
we are the light we are the light
we are the light we are the light
we are the light we are the light
you're my favourite friend
you're my favourite friend
keep it with me always in my mind
fire light fire light fire little fire light
i only know it's a matter of time
to come into my life
only in dreams could it be this way
and a love that will survive
wont you come into my life
i try hard not to laugh
i'll get tired of the heart attacks
buried deep in the telegram
you would never know
your breakfast will get cold
just save your energy
the best thing that i have
x2
i wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
cos i'm so tired of all ths fear
so beautiful so clear
we dig dig dig dig dig dig dig from early morn till night
heigh ho heigh ho
heigh ho hum
you woke up cold this morning
and i'm getting so tired and so old
every minute from this minute now
in all i've done
and we'll run for our lives
i'll be right beside you dear
we're bound to be afraid
makes patterns on your face
baby wont you breathe x2
i know your birthday
sometimes i think if you opened your eyes and looked
i'm in love with you
the laughter penetrates my silence
after i have travelled so far
and i i pray that something picks me up
and when the worrying starts to hurt
just close your eyes until
i could be stuck here for a thousand years
the only resolution and the only joy
and the birds will sing
another soldier says he's not afraid to die
i find it easier to sit and stare
please take your time i'm not in any rush
andrew's a starfighter pilot
i've got all the toys from his programme
keep in time
the crack of radios seems close enough to touch
the lyrics
but people say we're not the same
training or a trade
there aint none too high
the noise well it's just love
is there a light to get me there
i am standing here arent i
i cant keep up with you
since i gave up the drinking
just want to stay here in your arms
if i put my back into it
i cant begin to even curse
but it could become a problem if
curled and joyless we try once again
and spilling beer all over the place
when he leasts expects it
another version
to whistle while you work
when the raindrops come tumbling
means there's no one watching as we leave
if you'd just take ten more steps to me
if it looks like it works and it feels like it works
but not our last days of silence screaming blur
take a glorious bite out of the whole world
i have no fear cos you are all that i have
just give me something to hold onto
just give me something to hold onto
repeat
though your teeth are out
when you know your legs are gonna give out soon
no you dont know what happened
it's hardly what i'd be doing if you gave me a choice
i havent made half the mistakes
i'd tell you you're safe and take hold of your hand
how did we ever survive for this length of time
by your side
that has possessed me
to find me to find me
it's not there now
that i know more of the stars and sea
i only need
no one knows what this fight's about
and not collapse under its weight
why not speed it up
kids screaming in the back seat
they're made up in your minds
wrapped around my head
wrapped around my head
she a born and she raised to keep dem mon hungry
can i hit that
here's another tale about this girl name laura
verse 2
obviously you're unhappy with my stares that i hold far too long
i could help myself to something
i'd never do that
i guess we'll agree
the last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as i could
the weight of water the way you told me to look past everything i had ever learned
my words just break and melt
cause if you didnt you'd want her soon enough
this song was not included in the theatrical release of snow white it was never
get a wiggle on your chin

the blind lead the blind so why cant i find my way

formed from the candle light shadows
all of the things i been tryin to forget about
every single tear shed every single smile
aint if ever there was one my gramma brown she is a saint
well it was not that he was particularly

for a job with a hammer where the pay is good
the phone ring rings yo it's me your big brotha
so he hung up the phone in a rush to leave
once again up the hill down the other side
shut them lips boy dont let 'em get no bigger
the cop shouts freeze raise ya hand kid
and i'm afraid that my day has been great
morning's fresh oxygen cleanest
i dont have any change so i'm steppin along
should i give it to the mans the question in my brain
and i still cant rememba why i need a spool of thread
i put back on my cap and i start headin back
bake some bread for you
here at home
but the warmth of your lips on my fingertips wont go away
i wasnt even looking when i realized
and you never know when you might
i wish i had an ocean of some magic potion
ooh oooh
sometimes it feels like a bad initiation but you
repeat
we had a celebration man i'm glad that you're alive
but can you see me in the desert
through the puddles
that a tree it couldnt feel
bridge
eric claptons singin i shot the sherriff

and the vibe was lovin
your friends and their enemies all have their lovers
chorus
the man at the door invited us inside
you feel no pain
so dat they could test their weapons
you can chop off my legs and i'll land upon my feet
boom boom boom

and anyone who does is really really whack
even out in the bright sunshine
for me to rethink this
like cocaine
make me feel kinda dreamery
they took my blood
a risk assessment
get on the phone and call my past lovers
a day to live and a day to die
but cold medication should not be taken nightly
it smells hella sexy when it's on the kitchen stove
i dont know which fork is for meat or for salad
if you're havin problems i invite you here
get a pound aof beans yeah
when it's on the table i lick my plate clean
chorus

chorus
chorus
even taking kids on vacation or having a simple operation

reading books about places i'll probably never go
i'm just a poor wayfarin stranger
look in my eyes and you can see a red marble
some day i'll make
she said she'll meet me when i come
dont ever mistake my anger for resentment
i'm just a poor wayfarin stranger
when the road is callin
they fit my feet like cinderella when i'm shooting hoops
i played with brothas with so much badness
even in seasons when it's another color sport
old timers new timers would get in line there
and he had handles and like mcdonald's he could clown ya
wiping windex index finger rolls off the glass
chorus
to say hey i like the way the deejay is playin
and i the funky super psychodelic words that match
superglue couldnt put you back together again

the quest from man repentance while
men earth look surprised
of a celestial nazarite with appetites to bite from the tree of life
philophosies and greek mythologies
strong as and voice echo like across the great amazon
speeding bubbin lobbing we the nation
sky can pass with darkness
as they flow across the sky
the first shall be last and the last shall be first
i didnt like staying cuz of busy bodies and dizzy hotties
with no trace of trivia left with the hiss
and put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax

upon my death bed in roast in fire
cluttered up change quick to pop a slug in your brain
i do this shit for the streets cause a nigga gotta eat luv 2x
if it hit me it's god's wish
we live the life of a true thug

when i die will i open my eyes in hell again
chorus 2x killah priest
approached the bench with teary eyes
raining mahogany
walk besides white women they start holding they purse
poverty stricken beaten with the rod ol envy
to dealing with miscarriages
information begins the gathering
as we begin racing like a sparrow through the narrow population
pick up quasars inside the radar
giant antennas high tech space cameras
i'm the pilot on galactical plain of knowledge the culture
destination of the ride is to reach is the peak angelic landscape
grabbing a brass cup of wine heavy mental
there existed a hebrew lodge heavy mental
jet lag is if your cassette drag heavy mental

swinging a double edge sword trying to stay the beast

where do we go from here things going on word shooting up
it's the end of the road it's like the red moon
screaming life is what you make it so called fake friends
my sword would drink the blood of an un believer
my home is where the physco rage spending long nights and cold days
where the air stays hot and misty i see crack fiends with rotten titties
i dropped the tek out my hand dropped to the earth

briefcase is opened

1 yo yo yo they got the lights on that's the cops
blast that motherfucker blast him
enemies approachin identify yourself
as i chill again like gilligan and the skipper
it's a bird it's a plane it's a god damn shame
others fall like missiles the cap was artificially flavored
i'm comin through ya living room boom shok a lok a boom
and it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
chorus 2x
nefrettiti's in the house
and like for real i never liked no superficial hero
hip hop style while jazz in the meanwhile
feelin like a hood with a beanie in a caddy
into the ground i'm ghetto clown number one
pass it around 5x
so i'm whistlin sittin on the dock by
pass it around
i dont wanna kick it in your pocket no mo'
where's the hoes at where's the hoes at

and that's real comin from a real ass g
then ask who's next and ask who wrecks
a quick blast for the buck
to all my people with the funk where ya at
steel
to the records on felts your earwax melts
the man at the top of the needle drop
new technic turntables the party i wreck
recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
on your radio pull out your aerial
marley yo that is
g how much it run you
a convertible porsche is what i'm striving to drive
operator your call cannot be completed at this time
tires made from pirelli getting all of the heinies
dope cars
started committin murder after murder
it's bout whose draw is quicker
started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
got back on crackin i let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
keep it real on the street
and he goes by the name of dj polo see
a professional performer wheels of steel trainer
my recital will form a musical brainstorm
fan fascinator i supply data
see it's a demo
the microphone fanatic cause i'm the asiatic
i take a scene to the extreme
cause my fury is scary
who macks the most shit smoke ya whole clique like roach spliffs
swift with the words well
the main crime wave
rackateerin prostitution and paid execution
pile this paper longer than malice from ney york to dallas
from out the darkest shadow
money
to shake or bake or flake cause i never fry
cause i'mma get crazier than crazy eddie
nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
cant wait to peep my profile on paper mate
i might be cool but i'm far from a fan
and then build a skyscraper
my ideas overload
prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
sleep while you knock z's i'mma clock g's
for a strong foundation of wheels of steel
so take caution if you want to know the truth
what
if you're still hard of hearing i'mma scrub them with ajax
mandatory for the auditory and its glory
get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
for reaching the goal and the dream wouldnt you want to be in it to win
yeah poison
i'll turn the mike's last name into tyson
g rap is a terror not a error and never will i stop reaching for better
biz markie dj cool v tj swan big daddy kane
you big fat sap sucker
receive my command and follow our orders
complete the beat and end it splendid
cause under x ray they are parkay
that's how the record starts motivating
record rotation forms a revolution
when i was five years old i realized there was a road
all my manpower for four bucks an hour
dreamed about it for five years straight
people hungry for the blast that dont even last
collecting scars from little neighborhood wars
a thug a mugs for drugs he eventually bugs
that means dead in other words deceased
plus caps to cops policeman drops
rough in the ghetto but in jail he's jello
not my lifestyle so i made a u turn
the things we used to do and how we used to act
given a chance for romance until the sunlight
if it is then god then bring it back again
but when i wake up i'm the same love slave
so i race in space and try to replace the pretty face
now all i got is total confusion
see what i'm saying
give me a pen a typa writer then
lyrics blast out or leave it will cast out
kool g rap makes you wonder
so called mc's will freeze so cold
their latest release x2
dj's relax kneecaps collapse
treat them like your son in the butcher shop
they reported his fins on 1010 west
horror terror errors zero
not a sinner or an mc beginner
m yo that is real real fonkee yo yo what up g rap
all what word
with a amg kit in his pockets a mitt
or traveled beyond the service area
all the seats are stitched and hemmed mcm and gold rims
i knew a youngster met him at 14 a very short scene
slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
died at the age of 17 brooklyn east new york legend
then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
when i found out another soldier died in the territory
people in the audience kool g rap is my name
i supply the data he's the wheel operator
the maker and creator of the lyrical line
the performer recites competitors ignite
i activate a musical device
better than a snicker when it comes to a snack
ly suffer as i suffocate then i start to alienate
so dont even quote what you write is dolt
go ahead and dare me if you think i'm joking or playing
no mo' shifts i hold enough chips to toast criss
kicked up enough dust to hurt cells
get your mind grazed
my corporations body casin watch where you pacin
bodies get dropped while i attend the opera
i'll spark this barrel
smoking so bad i'mma cause a pollution
silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
of course polo's the boss of the crossfader
give me a prince and i'mma a show you a g wiz
donate it to science to answer the unexplained
definitely def the five fingers of death
just enter the place to see the entertainer
rhymes like thieves will seize enemies
polo works the crossfader he's a bricklayer
listen to the sound dont dare look down
those who act courageous you will get nauseous
you're a slave to my sound wave
g speaks in a new technique of fury
shut the hell up man
biters are wanted like animals hunted
check it out
material stitch by stitch for decoration
g rap will make you feel the real deal
my manager fly ty mr magic my dj polo
musical outcome lyrical tantrum
this is hip hop your optical nerve
with the rhymes that i express
in no position to be official
poetical recital is vital and tragic
it corresponds to the message i've sent
never took a break never made a mistake
shoes are scoffed cos the road gets rough
the road aint yellow and there aint no witches
gettin richer and richer the police took my picture
and if provoked i let the pistol smoke
the squealers tells but the dealer still sells
bombs were planted the kids were kidnapped
troopers soldiers rollin like boulders
one court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate
pushin all buttons pullin all switches
because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
but now the reflection is gone and i cry out
i need a love mate so i can create
she loves me she loves me not
now i whisper how much i missed her
my life is bitter the memories glitter
yo sometimes you just gotta let go man
with diction sparked from friction
wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
effort for the method meditation
if you're a square you freeze into an ice cube
i'm hot as a tamale on fire
and the mind is the real main course
to handle a man
and yet i like 'em old fashioned
scintillating sultry stimulating sexy
but i'll always love a true fan
i'ma rapper but i dont rap
i'll give you something you can feel
since the day i was born i was on a mission
with arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
as a teen i was on the scene cleaner than clean
i wasnt diggin for niggas so brother dig deep
but i beat the game but it was war boy
i heard some brothers say he aint the best
on turntables i'm able to start a movement
other mc's i want you to know
y does the things that i do
yeah moe dee is coming moe dee is coming
just gimme a pound cause i'm a bad bad bad mutha
i'm cyanide deadly and lethal
ask em who's the best their shoulders start shruggin
some things i wont do and here's an example
expressing verbally or if it's
stimulating emmulating heat that's corally
now i was never solo i was always in a group
i could go on and on and on and on for days
ha ha ha this time it's over boy
you still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
you swallow it yea finish burp
how can one man be so dumb
your brain of fatigue you're out of your league
so who's got no style look at your profile
the man who lost one one too often
chorus
i'm that type of guy oh my god
label ledger left the leper liar
yo tell 'em how you fell l hard as hell
talking to me like i'm a kindergartian
cause i'm a treat you like beaver on a basketball court
they're materialistic and unrealistic
like a mechanic all i do is bodywork
and i bet you think i'm fronting but i tell you i aint
all you ladies seem to sing the same old song
maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is
about a homeboy from back in the day
one thing went wrong rick got obsessed
d d d du dumb dumb
he'd hound em like a dog so we used to say fetch
i'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
he hustled on the streets cause he had no choice
the people on the streets he was workin for
funke funke funke
make a little money now you wanna tell me how you're livin
with or without money with funke funke wisdom
from birth to earth and earth to re birth
funke funke funke
take the 1st power elevate to the 3rd
funke funke funke
no matter who you are
the fu man chu
but if ya steppin watch ya step
trying to burn me
meanwhile laughin all the way to the bank
because the rhymes i made
and i aint sniffin nothing but
coming out of their pockets for me to rock it
i'll make apollo's ryhmes sound like
i aint a myth
lack of knowledge
telling you the truth
i aint a mandate cause
treating me like more
not only the youth
i was walking down the street rocking my beat
as soon as i finished i lost my poise
woke up fussing yelling and cussing
now i know why her ex boyfriend dave
he turned and said in a real deep voice
if i see another girl and i get an erection
kool moe dee's in the house again
i got a funky beat to let you know
it's hard to rock a party when you're lyrically advanced
verse 2
intellects get it and others want the beat
there's no need for the profane rap
to be known as the great
if you cant relate just clap your hands
i make miracles happen
that is so essential
if he's a sucker
just when i wanna
yo man
and check the clock
with each letter it becomes visibly better
the base and a taste of who's the ace
is anything short of stupendous
and if it's weak when i'm done
so hard it stops ya
like a flurry
so stay awake
if you're slow
must be new to this
i go to work
rhyme loaded
at my rate
boom and there goes ya
a zone that's hidden
am i a genius
to run for cover
me blowin up in your face
i'm blowin up
who yell out
you'll run out of gas
my reign is the longest
blow 'em up
clap
like a lame
where's your focus
how to get paid
i'm blowin up
i wont whip ya
because i said i was and always was
beyond nonsense
minds in limbo
you cant find your heart
cause i read minds
neurotic from a narcotic
i hit ya hard
bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
through overt overtures
the rhymes that cut like an uppercut
to mess your head up
then you fall in a dopefiend nod
you'll fail the exam
that you just cant live with
to make green so
with the rhyme i know
in that class
knowledge and wisdom
message divesting all men from
for the weak who seek power it'll bring
stop the music
party and dance
weak in the mind
so eject it
by the serpent's sound
and you're brain dead
to understand
instead of the prophets
stonger than any
brains
live bourgeios
lookin at the pretty girls and the things he'd love to have
end today
he slipped away
slipped away
he was little jon
homicide on 116th and eighth
it's alive and killin and the star is a villain
the feeling is high but the high dont last
he'll hook an innocent baby cause he dont care
your soul cause he'll take the rest
on life you're obsessed possessed and defective
and we're nowhere near the end this is only the beginning
ladies and gentlemen
a fight on the mic you dont want one
suicide wont do it either
hurt like the truth poetic justice
or you might miss the next rhyme ink
cause kool moe dee dont rhyme like most
who's on the radio poetic justice
and usually cant grow afros
over like a nova never ever
this is our ancestors' poetic justice
davis howard beach
new evidence brings doubt
can you hear me
the lust for money
ignorance is bliss
we lost
i look back and say wow
the slave mentality
you got the chains on your brain
no racism delusion
black proud
special shout to melodie
the rain is over and the sun is here
cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead
yeah that's funky
stand up tall get up and get up y'all
rise with the sun and think with a bird's eye
you see what you want to instead of what you been through
the sixth and seventh is how you elevate it
even though america kill di african
variations of chorus
got to make it know and to pass it down
that's right baby i run the yard
if the party's not enough and you still wanna rock say
i wanna see you at the party we can dance a bit first
you'll be soaken wet and drenched sweaty and ready
cause my rap is strong
and next time you'll bring a friend
turn the corner
i wear shades
better hop in while the light's still red
their daughter
but when i come home
if i'm walking and talking
she didnt want
couldnt drive his benz
when they come
cause i'm just chillin
we all look good
execution of a feud formality
for instance
beats that meet the standard of a street credit
and yes i'm legendary also very very
and that's why i can
many imitate me
cause when i'm rhymin on the mic i always take control
tomato tomata my data's up to data

brothers aint takin their time with the rhyme
for all ears to hear and prepare
time's up

cocaine and propane no pain and no gain
metaphysical spiritual conscience
time's up
this one goes out to all the homeboys
keep clappin while i'm rappin while i'm rappin clap your hands
i can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
give the people what they want and what they want is what they need
and now you're goin out like a sucker like todd
synchronize a party cause the party people watch

cause while you respect tupac tupac respected me
black cop black cop black cop black cop
killin each other on a west coast block
this type of warfare isnt new or a shock
in the east we are chased by the same black beast
1993 mad kids are gettin tense
dont be the sucker
dont be the sucker comin into my face with that yang yang
or chill out watchin videos
we respond we connect on the same deck
where you fit in true friends are quick to sit
but i cant say that where i play at isnt fast paced
mutual support from the beginning
but if we had nuttin no frontin whatever
boom bap original rap

but now the competition on the block is the cops
i thought to myself damn something's wrong
the dt that woke me up was like what
we want you to point out the rest of the cops that are criminal
the federal and local cops got wars with themselves
then i heard hey yo it's us open up the door
joe
rappers bite like dracula the soul of hip hop
and what you feel is the forward direction
presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
so they fired up up and away
tonight a rapper gwan die
kickin edutainment while you wait for your arraignment
tonight a rapper gwan die
i got only friends cause i killed all my rivals
and sociological books while you worried about your looks
twenty bucks for a rap show is still twenty bucks
with my nigga kris knockin off frauds
yeah uhh
but i cometh forth today to say thus
okay now listen to this
and the teacher replied well where do you reside
sound effect phone being dialed
you could not be dissatisfied
one piece and then she replied
sound effect door closes
where could he hide
and you said that i wasnt purified
free mumia
but she was caught up she hit the floor like a breakdance
she said i like it that's why i jock it
instead of fighting them why dont you go free mumia
expenditures forgettin gut from the poor
and the up and coming shift in the economy
it's hakim that voice from the east
maybe because they cannot understand the quotes
sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
the devil i rebel until babylon is dust
hardcore
rap is something you do

protect yourself that's right
in any club in the country when you say krs they say let him in
philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
and he said he said yo kris
in lyrical persistance
in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh
if you dont like what you do you're through

rap relieve stress so yes i guess it's medical

back to the bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
poorly or greatly
loosen your mind to the truth and dont get mad at me
debatin on where and when and how and what massa gave
let me take you to a higher level
church is to blame
the same governments tellin people to vote
i pray to you for the light you might give them
vote for god dont vote for the devil
he said record companies aint got nuttin for ya
but his freedom of speech is declined
with human education against lies we tried
they said yo kris what you wanna do
if a rapper wanna diss yo i'd do it again
conscious rap is still alive
cause new york dj's changed the flows
dj's dont raise our kids cuz
bloods crips they held me down
big up to la temple members
now i overstand
to view the world so rap music is something we do but hip hop
with the invention of the mixer on to run dmc and then myself

no matter how i think we grow
as painful as this thing has been
said you'd be there for me
words so profuse
like particles while i make international articles

first and only verse
epedemic lies and deception
head first in the cavity
some program on television
the bloodshed of male
totally paranoid
we prolong the true enemies defeat
iniquity shapen in
an invisible war
the atom bomb is saddam and minister farakkhan
everything else is damned
everybody knows that they've guilty yes
they just take it to the streets
his life so incomplete and nothing can replace it
and while the people sleep too comfortable to face it
wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
singing chorus
preventin me from freedom
you just wanna use me
if everything must go then go
appealin through material

repressin true expression

oh just to keep us as a slave

keeping me from your love what was i thinking of
wont you come free my mind

everyday's another chance
dulled my senses blurred my sight
for something to happen that just wasnt fated
greater than planets deeper than oceans
verse 1
he's just like the water
spilling over into all i do
he causes my expression to remain
burning to be worthy of his land
he's bathing me
and around
you keep my feet on the ground
but that aint me next time around
kept my feelings underground
i just need you around
i know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
you might win some but you just lost one
i was hopeless now i'm on hope road
never want to face it when it's time for punishment
you just lost one it's so silly how come
trying to pretend like your word is your bond
you might win some but you just lost one
see the road to hell is paved with good intentions
oh ohhh ohh ohhh
exploiting ignorance in the name of love
except the truth about you
please dont entertain me mr intentional
all falls down
it all falls down
high profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
receiving the judge's favor
babylons benefactors
emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
dodging duty for years
blind leading the blind
both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
when the son of podition is commander in chief
internally they absent of light
let him who stole no longer steal
self interest broadway to death
where the majority remains caught
it's the mystery of inequity
'cause nothing even matters at all
nothing even matters at all
nothing even matters to me
i have no time for manicures
'cause nothing even matters no more
naked as the day that i was born i tried to hide
causing me to see only what pertains to me
focused on the shadow with my back turned to the light
submit to truth leave the deception of thy youth
perpetrating we're in covenant with him
oh so repressed so convinced that i was blessed
i am the vine ye are the branches he's in live in me
is an abomination to emmanuel
oh jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
on exactly what an artist should be
how come we aint getting no higher
everything you drop is so tired
writing rhymes my range with the frames slightly tinted
and put your pinky in it then taste it
though i may suffer i'll envy it not
it'll be alright
tell him i love him tell him
oooh and loveis not loud
tell him i need him yeah
and every time i try to be
now i know his strength is within me
for unto me a man child would be born
than to wait at zions door
and i'm reminded every time i see your face
when it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad
i cried and i cried and i cried
will turn out what you want to be
but i i loved the young man
if you dont catch it
when it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad

and in my dreams i've kissed your lips
because you know just what to say
because i wonder where you are
and i wonder what you do
the one you search for from the start
it could never compare to the feeling
making love under the stars
here is my heart please dont break it
every time i see you and i look into your eyes

and we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear

i guess only the strong survive
but we managed to stay alive

maybe there's a way to stop
golden days
just for you
and lies were lies
just for you

oh these tears i'm crying are just for you
so i still walk on through the night and through the rain
are the words i didnt say
well that's the way life goes
without love what is life and anyone who knew us
then everytime i turn around and you're nowhere to be found i know
before i can say goodbye to all i ever knew
it's time to stand up
and let there be peace on earth
all the suffering will be no more
we can save this world if we try
here we are out hear me and you
ooh and why why is the world so unkind
there's nowhere else we can turn
that's what my little heart was looking for
you are my one and only
oh i know it's so right
i'm so glad i found you
dont let this love end
my love just thinking about you baby
hoeny you're everything i need
tell the conductor you're heading
all aboard the night train
up and down my scales
together
those precious moments
'cause when there's love
yes when there is love
we've got so many road before us
are we living for the truth or an illusion
in our hearts
there's a thing i miss about holding her tight
thinking that true love would never die
she'll make you feel like you're king of the world
cant deny her your desire
penny lover dont you make me cry
girl a love like yours is hard to resist
i've spent all of my life in search of your love
when i'm lost and alone it's you that i miss
penny lover dont you make me cry
but i want you to know
and i promised myself i would never trust my heart again
i just gotta say
falling in love was just not in my plan
they say come follow me

time for us to show that everybody got to give love
where did we go
because i needed you so desperately
and the way i feel now i guess
around for a man like me
i've got this feeling down
just say you want to spend some time with me
just come on inside and make this dream reality
you know there's such a place
because i really need you baby
i wake up to the thought of you and i call your name
knowing that i'm not the one you want
with my tender heart
maybe i'll look back and understand some day
my tender heart
walk in the sunshine come out the rain
it's our time to celebrate
you're once twice
there's nothing to keep us apart
true love i know is hard to find
we now know that dream's come true
let's go and play
if only she could let me be the man i wanna be
and that's what it feels like
will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today
just to love a woman uh huh
little darling
to a midnight honey town and set it on fire
till our hearts desire
cause tonight will be alright
got this feeling deep inside
get lost in the magic lose control
tonight if you're ready it's time
a night of passion is what you'll find
it's all right
and forever i will be your lover
i need to have you near me
wanna keep me up all night
where the girls and trees can get hotter
but she didnt want to hear it
damn she might kill me
but now i may never go home
damn she might kill me
i've been here about an hour
but i'm searching for an answer
but i dont want to stay
can you help me make it through
now that i know it's so wrong
i never knew it before i always thought i was sure
with you goodbye you can leave you can leave
it's time you know that all the things we had that felt so good
i'm putting this on tape baby you're wonderful
sometimes it slips my mind so in case i forget
and no man can ever say he does a woman better than i do you
and still have to ask the same question
now you want it back
why dont it feel like it felt on the first night
no longer got their respect for me
remember what we tripped like
i thought i had just a little more daylight
why dont it feel like it felt on the first night
when we were saying things like where have you been all my life
my love for you
you are the rain
i've got so much love
you need to know
chorus
there's no other in my life
'till the life runs out of me
l stansfieldi devaneya morris

chorus

been around the world and i i i
he gave the reason the reasons he should go
and i dont think he's comin back comin back
gonna find him
then she says
tears that she's been holding back so long
he hasnt seen the pain he's put her through
this woman needs a loving man to keep her warm
another day another night i long to hold you tight
sometimes i wonder will it ever be the same
the way you touch my hair
may you always be mine
and i thank god for the day i found you
blitzkrieg baby you look so cute
i dont want no infantry
chorus
and if i didnt want you then i would want you out
'cos i'll always want your love
'cos they dont see me kissing you no more
learn to be alone
when i know i'm not the only one who feels like this
'cos they dont see me kissing you no more
you awoke my mind my soul and my body
it seemed we'd be that way forever
one set of footsteps in the sand
one set of footsteps in the sand
i'm gonna walk on

but now you seem to feel
goodbye to you
chorus
they play the game play hard to get
i had it all under control
and baby try as i might
i've made a full time job of going out of my mind
honestly baby you've got me down on my knees
i wanna be honest with you
well it just aint enough
i love you
and chase your face from my mind
wont be crying over you

if you think i'll be broken hearted

that you cant see anything else
and i'll convince you that you need my time
nearly goes insane

people think they've got priorities right
to listen to them like a friend
dont think about tomorrow

and i'll love you ooh ooh
but if you'll wait i'll wait too
so hold on to me just one last time

decisions from a motherfucker strugglin
i try to talk to my dad but my old man ignores me
and what about the man with the cane and the black suit
left his family heartbroken
no doubt if you cross then i'ma take ya
and if you want to cap come cap me
staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed

when a man loves a woman just like i do
cause breaking it down until it's broke is no joke

the new mic holder who causes any fair
nine to five is how you survive i aint tryin to survive jay z
crooklyn dodgers and that libation touched the fan base
three years gone but i will survive
for the duration

make more greens than ferns

the t'cha breaks the campaign down plain
now in '92 i find a brand new crew
let's squash this shit and maybe then
cry in the hanky franky where's the fly ins
not from warner sony or rca
we throw the record out now and then you pay later
to express his many views
make it uptempo for the dancers
silence up the lambs cause they're screaming like some next shit
ku klux that's for red neck fucks
chubb is a loveable guy not a teddy riley group
feelings between the music scene
that mislead the head of the bad boy robin
and de tv on de bed an de watch said not
fully strapped definitely aimed at
the overjoy of the bad boy robin
me take off on di foot and me started to run
the people wanna jock but if they wont here's a quote

i make them hold on peace signs say swinga i retreat
is the product of ten intense games of balls under balls
and strive the venoms the five check this out

of my heritage who will bring forth the people
why should you hate me what have i done
uhh what should we do should we run
introchorus two g man
but i i am totally ignorant to that type of pride
change your tune for the man and
cant paint the scene dissipates the dream
end of question start of answer contradiction

you get hemmed up and cut down in park jurassic
your nine spray my mind spray jeru
the circumfrence of the bedouins or is it the thespians
the mind
the mind
even though they werent born in the carribean like me

you flipped in the tape you just barely escaped
and made it suitable to be ripped by the one

howie takes a style when he's developing my track
the green doesnt symbolize i made it on the top
sent by the nation

members only playing pool like willie marconi
all the places and spaces i've been can you feel it repeat 6x
cause every time i'm yapping something crazy happens
from the way i see it seems to still stem from
to burst the scene or conquer like a philistene
protest the teachings of another man
let's get together and raise
and here is one recollection of imperfection
rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
some walk slow cause the water's not shallow
reality is real so how do you feel
animalism pumped on a lower level
psychedelic
not a pale frail ghost cl'll wreck the most
hit the pitch and then i'm gone as the funk lingers on
yes you know i got to talk
drop a scud fully capable a form in a eclipse
to hear gabriels horn blow it like a naiji

chicks are never waitin when the bodies start marinatin
to make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude

left to the hood to play daddy
rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
now i stand in the same spot as my old man
it's hard to stay grounded
in the area where it's more weaves and less dreads

kids stating their dreams

on the streets love is hard to see
my man had to dig deep to find his
at time it can take ya for a spin
we holla love hopin it would come one

so get off the rap tip and go back to bein a drunk wino

in this day and age the time of choice is strongly upon us
blaze ya dead homie
so many people in the matrix die alone they
dead bodies make me happy
cause we accend from the same dirt filth grit and grime
do you know what it feels like to feel the warmth of the sunlight
and since i live on the underground it all fit in
but we built a team of same killers with the same dream
look into my mind tell me what you see what you find
let me get two turntables and a microphone
come with me right into the edge of your mind
hands grabbing at me but i'm dodging them all
and remarks so i waited in the dark where his car was parked
if you listen too close you might lose your mind
you fuckin with a old school cat that aint friendly
come with me right into the edge of your mind
on clouds makin electrical sparks
and fuck a headache
i can make it thunda
push the button i dare you go ahead and do it
and split the spine of many a hater
the dark lotus fam is shaking clouds bringin the thunder down
everything around is crumblin
i can make it thunda
kind of soaking it all in and feeling alright
what i was feeling was just so dark and twisted
i know this aint right
suffocation through the mouth breathing
the fist time i didnt pull the heat
i finally took someone else's life
abk
chorus
someone else's life
spreading disease like it was dope

one tender kiss made everything right
through the storm through the darkest night
one touch from you and this world was mine
and your never gonna break my heart again
you've had your last one more chance
when you fall in love that's a chance you take
but it's hard to forget
but i made my commitment to you
i'm sad to say love wins again
but you came along and changed my mind
to take some time and take care of me
nobody's supposed to be here
to take some time and take care of me
love can make you do some crazy things
so what you tryin to do tonight oh my gosh
and no that aint no lie
we can rock it all night long
be walking down the street
and you will wish you were still right here by my side
you'll want me back again
you dont miss me now
one day you will
running through my warming veins
in the perfect love fantasy
but nothing else compares to this
with one exception
spontaneous of mind
young dear keep it going
my one wish would be
the lead role of my heart
and rehearsals are long because your timing is all wrong
now to be without your love
i'm going crazy alone in a daze
i cant believe i'm on my own

but i just aint for sure
after what he's done
repeat hook
now i gotta let you go
instrumental
sending dwarfs back to birth
hail the ravenlord
he would soon be facing the lurkers of time life death
the lurker of time cried out blackheims fooling strategem
stormed over fields with might in hand
coloured my pictures so dusty and old
the oath i swore
i make sure evil will rise
with winds from our northstar striking shores oh so far
striking upon the hillsides
web of moonshine
through moonshine portals leatherwinged serpents fly
long gone spheres of dismal gleam
a landscape in ancient sleep of deathlike silence
to conquer time by possessing immortality
and so it's heardthis became the castle of blackheim
miracles of the undeserted
they are tearing you apart
the puzzling constellation of a deathrune
a darkened dungeon for the pale i seek
unentered and unseen
once there were spirits lurking like serpent tounges
this is the winter of an eternal season of doom
nowhere to hide your time has come
i might have been a singer
a criminal who drink champaign
everyone i'll never meet
and i will not turn again
and the dreams are always deep
lyin alone in the darkness
i'd like to watch you sleep at night
i'll let you know that
if those seeds had not been sown
can leave the way you just came in
i found no peace
whao ao
that you will come to me
you're the one that i've been calling for
he asked to drink by our fire and
and your voice is filled with sweet beauty
my sister knows
i shall return for you
i shall return my love on christmas day
he doesnt want to lose this memory
and he'll tell her what he's done today
of the only part of life to him that's safe
do you have a little time for me
do you have a little time
if you should stop for a while
if you have a little time
this morning
you're too close to me
your safe hands
nothing is wrong for me
if i dont believe in love
when i've been here for just one day
i'll make you weaker weaker still
everything is clear and everything is new
and so pretty
when you see her sweet smile baby
when you see her sweet smile baby
does it bother you now all the angry games we played
'bout a month ago i'd never seen your face
i wouldnt notice if it wasnt there
well i'd get you dressed and i'd get you out
you'd ask me who you'd need to kill to make it ok again
i wont cry for you cos i will wait until
wondering when you'll be home
and no more saying goodbye for the last time again
we had in grafton street
oh if you'd come home
if only you had slept alone
and you and your sin
to hear you breathe by my side
i cant breathe
oh i am what i am
until your resting here with me
i just want to feel safe in my own skin
one long pause then you begin oh look what the cat's bought in
to take a chance on life again so let me go
i'm no angel but does that mean that i cant live my life
i thought it was funny when you missed the train
by loving you more
when it's last day leaving and i'm helping it pass
sometimes i can feel it and suddenly it's gone
some days i can tell you the truth and some days i just dont
but you havent and it's hard to talk with people all around
i'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you
the man behind the wire
dont try to say goodbye if i dont want to
it's just a thought only a thought
and i dont learn to buy
but if my life is for rent and i dont learn to buy
i never stick around quite long enough to make it
to travel the world alone
cos nothing i have is truly mine
cos nothing i have is truly mine
danny's not eating he's drinking and sleeping
but as the sun sets on mary it's rising on him
i've got clothes in case it's hot
my cat at home thinks it's a dog
and a man at home who likes to think
it's my life
my lover's gone
or coming home to an empty house
well i've been gently drifting
and i'm settled now
i felt the same today
i never wanna say it's love
oh and i have returned to the somber grace
under these white northern skies
with you i feel i'm the meek leading the blind
one step too far
dont let no one guide you
i'm with you with you
it's always one step too far
i saw you
its been seven days without a word
i didnt know it would be the last time
and boy is it hard
additional dates they were plannin just fell through
and boy is it hard
but there's fifteen of us in a bus state to state
if these walls cant hold you
his boots no longer by my door
florida's out we fly september 22 to heathrow
the tm recommend sanatogen
god bless
we've done five gigs but we're only in our third state
wo wo
its hard enough to see the world as it is and hold on anything
and it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here
and i need you
to real life where i cant watch sunset
tomorrow's back to work down to sanitation
two weeks away all it takes to change in time around by falling
and you'll have to tell them again and again
and yes they'll ask you where you've been
but it's no more
see the sun again
i thought that i would give it just one more chance
being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know
even on a day like this when you're crawling on the floor
take time to catch your breathe and choose your moment
and it's high time you left it there
if you wont let me fall for you
and if you find one day find some freedom and relief
i'd feel like i belong
the summer's come too soon and i'm still missing you
touch my skinand tell me what you're thinking
give your trust to me and look into my heart and show me show me what you're doing
catch the snow on your tongue and show me how it tastes
it reminds me that it's not so bad
i want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
flowers wont be left in parks work will still be done
i didnt get to say goodbye the day before the day
the sweetest that i've heard
after all the battles and the wars
chorus
you'll never fit in your long white dress
drinking beer moon on the left
where's the sense in that
i understand if you cant talk to me again
will be there still
and i wont put my hands up and surrender
what couldnt wait now waits and usually goes away
but listen and think when i say it
being sad and love's not alone
and it's lost to me
i will open my door
i dont need it no more
i want to tell you something
but in a written testimonial i'd say
you cant get inside someone
it's a matter of honour with me
it's just the end of a perfect day
he brought the clouds to my day
you got me over him
no dont let him worry you so
you got it all over him
all over him
notte d'amore con te

closer than my heartbeat he comes
baby goodnight
and when the feeling's right it's right
when the feeling's right it's right
keep me away from where
back home
old folks that i have missed
and i see that home is where my heart belongs
the more she'd look the less she'd find
she's walking down an endless street
repeat chorus
you took me from the shelter of my lover i had never known
like you tried before
hoping soon
repeat
before this night is through we're gonna get to the truth
they live their lives alone
before this night is through
before this night is through
who needs some love in my life
than to find out too late it's not true
could ever know for the whole of their lives
but now i need something more
someone who honestly feels like i do
dont throw away my love babe
breaking up is hard to do
oh darling i'm crazy after all these years
bitterblue bitterblue
proud to cry
oh hoh oh it aint what it seems
if you're wondering why i turned from you this morning
baby i'm sorry
oh hoh
walk through a fire
oh there's no mountain high enough
you'll never grow old
there's no other say
ooh together we can win it all
you're taking on the world
like a cat on a hot tin roof
you're taking on the world
i'm on your side oh when times get rough
like a bridge over troubled water
i will ease your mind
and once or twice you've shown the face i like
and now and again when i dont feel so shy
feelings are the hardest words to say
that's no way to say goodbye oh
from the bottom of your heart
if there's one thing that i know
to go with a face that i'll never forget
i havent stopped believing no no
i'm thinking about while i'm singing
sometimes i wish that i was back
livin on the road again
i been up and down
i can feel you near whisperin my name
and how people can hurt each other
it aint got nothing to do with love
nothing to do with love
and i'll always remember
it's something i'll try
and i'll always remember
to every little thing she has to say
he should have let me take her in the first place and
she ties a ribbon to and with the stars
break another little piece of my heart now baby
but when ya hold me in your arms i'm singing again
make a fist and grab so fast he said
with bigger eyes that understand
cause love is never in the same place if you left her
maybe he's the man behind the wire
that's no lie my baby
race to the fire only the strong survive
race to the fire time is on his side
there's nobody down in the woods
ravishing ravishing
and this is the season i've got something to lose
we'll be ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
than anything i ever wanted was to see the light
and it's just my luck tonight i dont have anything to wear
ravishing ravishing
you shot me where you wanted
so hold me hold me in your arms
just a rebel without a clue
dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
there's nothing to it really i think they call it love
a rebel without a clue
so hold me baby hold me a little longer
i'm on a freeway to nowhere
i felt your passion
i dont know what to do
without the love i need to feel
so i make the move
and serve you in a real time movie
but days have been lucky
on this rolling home
your sleep's dreams gets corrupted
on this rolling home
and it's so hard to forget her past
oh when sally comes around
so hang on in dont you cry
oh when sally comes around
i need your arms to hold me tight
take me in your arms and save me
save me from this emptiness
i dont know where i'll sleep tonight
cause you'll be cryin over me
i wont wipe them away
written by jerry lynn williams
like it means the world to you
then maybe someday we'll be friends
come on save your love
where can i go to find you
what can i do to hold you
but i was looking for freedom just had to be free
sayonara tokyo
ha uma ponte pra nos dois em algum lugar
onde o trem tem que parar
finds the love in a man
nothing else to lose when you're reaching for the infinite heart
in a place where cool breezes blow
carry me to our heart's fantasy
in the middle of a sleepless night
can tell by the way you love me
i know i dont take you to heaven anymore
it's nothing like before
cant afford to lose it all again
here am i in love again
clinging to your arms again
music by giorgio moroder
here she comes here she comes
i sense i feel
here she comes here she comes
here's monday
goodbye my love
and the day is just beginning
the only one i can see every single day
i wonder where he cam from
and you can all be as smug as hell
and pretty soon he may
it never told you lies
you wont touch sacred ground
but there's always one thing you should realize
he is the king
i do believe in
now i know lord how i know
hey love it's a feeling inside
hey love it's a feeling inside
rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
cause you're playin with fire
johnny better run better run
lovers finally understand
he's gotta be strong
somewhere just beyond my reach
and the storm and the flood
i think about you all night
chorus
put me to bed baby there i'll stay
show me a lover and i'll write you a song
i believe in my good times
there's a devil on my shoulder
there's no life in this bleak desert
i cant leave your love alone
i'm searching for you baby
i'll climb every mountain
somethings they will never change
for eternity
you belong to me
i know you like what you got
i'm all shook up
if we dont make it no one can
you say that there's nobody else
and say what you're thinking
and the best of my loving you know you aint seen nothing yet
when i play
the fire below
it takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below
come on come on come on
i didnt even try
i can be romantic
and if it goes my way
and if it goes my way
can you see it in my face
where did our love go wrong
the reason why
where did our love go wrong
where did our love go wrong
it's the one who wont be taken who can not seem to give
cause you made me grasp
ooh the world starts tonight
and the world starts tonight
we can find a better way to live all our lives
every night and every day
every night and every day
a sight of heaven in a grain of sand
i thought that happiness was by your side
but time mends a broken heart
you dont know what it's like
if i aint got you
but you were too good to last
like foxes on the run
i'll sail with you the seven seas
not just in my arms and in my heart
cause i know babe what you feel
i'll sail with you the seven seas
why are you too hot
turnaround bright eyes
turnaround every now and then i get a little bit terrified
and we'll only be making it right
forever's gonna start tonight
turnaround bright eyes
turnaround bright eyes every now and then i fall apart
i dont know what to do and i'm always in the dark
but now there's only love in the dark
oh lord i once had a daddy
yeah but if you just wanna go out drinkin honey
they call me mean people call me evil
but that'll never change the way that i feel
i need you
of a cracker jack box
he never loved me back
i need you
but that aint gettin g us nowhere
cause two out of three aint bad
if there's a slower death than living here and now they havent found it yet
i want you by my side you'll be all my own
i want them bad and i want 'em now
i want it bad and i want it now we were born going faster than the limits
i loved a man whose name was dick
now men from every parish round
but little willy wee who took me on his knee
for they're good badboys from the lonely farms
i never felt so scared and helpless before
dont try to pull the wool right over my eyes
here i go for days so i write just in case
maybe it's just late night thinkin
i let you slip away i guess i never knew
if not for my careless heart
chorus
there's peace in this winter night
far from the city lights
heaven let love be the guide along the way
from the way my heart is hurting
i got so used to loving you baby
baby it's tragic
i got so used to touching you honey
you stop fooling around
sometimes you're more like a stranger
you stop fooling around
more than a stranger
with all those sailor boys
and i still cant quite remember
well i never will get over
as i move down the street
i'll come out and shout it loud there aint nothing better then my
girl i dont want nothing like boy where have you been
but for now i'm improvising
i'll make time for you
oh i wish i could hold you in my arms again
lonely nights i dream of you
darling if i must stay here without you
first guy that calls me on the telephone says
ah the closer you get the more that i see
he'll do his best to hear this sweet lady sing
and all the reasons to believe
touch me now or set me free
we know the game we could play
we can start here
chorus
as the night woke up to the dawn
i need you when the lights go down
come on come on and give me loving
cause it's driving me crazy
come on to me
as the summer turned to autumn
what happened girl
has melted with the past
i would give up everything
we are daytime friends and nighttime fools
repeat chorus
you'll pay the price when you know the words are killing the meanings
the desert is in your heart
greek
dont blame me for something i cant change
take one look and listen to me play
well it makes no sense having us apart
living my life and singing my songs
written by scott and wolfe
it's one of those nights when the music takes me there
dont stop the music not now
i'm gonna be strong
just walk away
dont worry about this heart of mine
i'm letting you go
just walk away
the dusty road side
turn me around
the warm river flowing inside
everyone loves a mystery
each time i find i'm running blind
if i could walk with you to bridge this fallen dream
the words that we said fill my head
and when the morning comes it'll all be gone
you're such a pretty boy
faster than the speed of night
let me show you how to drive me crazy
we got the music in our fingers and the radio
and all we'll ever need
faster than the speed of night
yeah
oh oh
repeat chorus
the love you gave me's just a waste of time
far away from home
oh baby if you call me i'll be there
your life stretched tight and breaking now
let the cool breezes through your life somehow
but i know when you look at my life
forget her she has forgotten you
it's you i give my love to
i'll never never feel this way again
something's happened to me
you shot me through the heart without a gun
i know it isnt me
the lights are dim to match the conversation
the's music's dark begins to get blacker
they're trashing it up
a ribbon of blood on the floor
written by scott and wolfe
oh baby i need you now
it's ok it's ok
now the dice have tumbled
we wander from the straight and narrow and we
i'm searching for the strength inside of me
i have given it all
you said your life couldnt get much better
take what you want or
i know you do
which you dont have
and i know i need somebody
always said we'd make my dreams come true
we're going through it
cause you're going nowhere
gave us something to do
i'll even sign it love to you again
so dont cry it i say
was high and came the fall
need you here to stay
i love you yes it's true
it's gone like a dream in the night
why love did you treat me this way
instrumental
when it's over so they say
fill the circle fast and slow
well the bus that picks him up from work is late again
'cause he's tired of being so lonely all the time
letting go and giving in
i dont want to hear what the people might say
it's not easy
and you might find when you wake up the break of dawn has come
oh it hurts to know you're still so far away
if i wake up and still you're not there
i'm so tired of being alone
it's not enough you know
it's only love and that is all
why should i feel the way i do
blue eyes that gleam just like james dean
oh she'll never see her baby again
no she had never seen
cause a mind like yours is too good to waste
it's a love for life so you better think twice
cause you know the love we have is always gonna be
living for the light that's coming from within
so dont you worry who you're kissin on at midnight
the way i see it i've got you and i both covered
if you want to kiss someone else
will secretly enjoy our time
all i can i'm going home
yea i'll tell ya'
like the leaves we tumble
if we dont remember anything
let the show begin
instrumental
and i feel like i've been here too long
i feel like i've seen you before
way over mountains higher than high
like an ocean
i can hear the roar
oh limelight
holding on
there's a long way to fall
i'm gonna show them all
and you can bet he barely makes a dollar
living just enough
living just enough
i was lost in france
didnt catch what they were saying
oo la la la dancing
to say baby i wont be home
from up on high
countless enemies that could've been friends
he keeps sending me angels
but love is a marytr through the joy and the fear
he keeps sending me angels
from up on high
written by stuart emerson
i get what i want
an oasis in the fire
be my sexual
i miss someone maybe she's not a crazy girl like you
from wondering every time
i dont know if this is love
so easy to win
sometimes a heart can hurt a lot
all is calm all is bright
christ the savior is born
oh babe it's not too late now
you're just like an angel
the reasons plain to see
i hope one day she'll see
that feeling returns
i'm just sitting on the edge of the ocean
you want me to stay
in the wires that decide
in the wires that decide
inside i'd say i slide
baby you're not playing fair anymore
i've got someone to run to
and i'll keep lovin you
than mislead you with a lie
till we both break down and cry
chorus
feelings that are colder than ice upon a rock
hopefully dreaming that love will still survive
go anywhere from here
so insecure of what tomorrow will bring
we'll make forever
oh baby wont you stay
cause i know
i've been dreaming
it's coming straight from the heart
instrumental
it's coming straight from the heart
the families the street life the spark
that separate our lives
does the morning sunlight
and i feel it ever present
oh i call your name
there will never be another
you're like a candle in the wind
why is it all or nothin everywhere
baby take another look at your heart
written by billy cross
and she cant love you the way i do
baby late at night
take me back
that we were meant to part
maybe she could try with money
take me back
tell me you've changed after all this time
i was sad
say you've rearranged after all this time
oh take my heart and dont be a dreamer
i wasted days i wasted nights
tell me the truth no compromise
only a strong love will survive
you come to me give me everything i need
anyone i ever met
just as long as i'm here in your arms
came after the miles
we danced on the ceiling
we danced on the ceiling
what a way to let me know
what a way to treat my heart
i'm so sorry baby
my little heart must been leakin
honey i dont need a lot
and how long you must have waited
a little bit a little bit
a day that doesnt come
you better hang on to your bench seat
uncomfortable as a centerfold
i'll let you know
and i'll let you know
and i'll let you know
bridge
i'm the one you're with tonight
whenever you need me to be your lover
whenever you need me for the good times and bad
to pick you up when you were falling down
when i needed a shoulder to cry on
i gave away my heart i knew just where i stood
i never let you down when you wee full of fear
no one cares about you
you are always oh in my mind
how many tears can i hide
chorus
that you just cant disguise
wild love
wild love
you asked me not to call you on the phone
but i'm not that kind of angel heaven knows
i'm only a honky tonk angel
it doesnt matter where you are they touch you
words words we mean to say
sometimes linger on
so many reasons why
time passes by so slow
standing quietly going insane
yesterday dreams
but you dont even see what i mean
always aware we're gonna make it above
yesterday dreams
was it all because i
a women such as
it happened on a sunday
to find more
god was there to pass me
a women such as
to pass me you my love
oh i'm sick and tired of yesterday
you know how hard it is to keep from crying out loud
but still the whole world can see you
all these illusions wont cover your pride
you dont need nobody
written by preston and fisher
i used to feel uninspired
i didnt know just what was wrong with me
and you make me feel
so many times before
you wont see me cry please baby baby
you wont see me cry please baby baby
here i stand alone with my dreams
you're breaking my heart again
you're breaking my heart again and i will be here for you
your cool blue eyes are killing me
the greatest of all
just the thought of you it drives me wild
to lose this love would be a crime
another rainy morning
the one who keeps me goin
it's written a thousand years ago
if you're lookin for your chance for one good payday
when the world's gone crazy it's so hard to handle
when the world's gone crazy love's so hard to handle
and you said it aint no fun
all i ever wanted was a baby in my arms
one day you may miss me
billy me bobby and anne
chorus
instrumental
and i'll cherish those years but i'll bet i'll forever
but they're not forgotten
with that smile i knew and the new name you've taken
written by jim steinman
why dont you stop tearing up everyone you need the most
boy there were times when we'd never fake it
in the beating of the drummer
let's just peel out of this town
both who's gonna believe all your lies
there were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
from the heavens on down to the dives
nothing could have torn us apart
gotta find an open road to your heart
gotta find some peace of mind
whatever is wrong
the world is full of married men
oh your love is a secret
comes through
they do it married men
no dont cry for your lover
dont cry for your lover
you feel defeated
when you start to loose control
you thought she'd swallow
if you understand
just a monday in september
i know i believe it's the hardest part of love
to fly alone
always learns pain
kids dont grow up like us
alone in the breeze
you're the world that i wanna discover
let me be more than a lover
oh but i got tired of dreaming
and a full time place in your heart
i remember that night
wild wild honeycomb
to watch the hours
your leavin this place that you once called home
dont go to new york baby new york no way
new york can wait baby i miss you
because i believe every lie you told
and my love doesnt come that cheap
but believe me
you had better stop the things that you do
i just cant stand it
if i sing you a love song
so baby let me sing a love song for you
so baby let me sing a love song for you
to keep you close to me
and you will notice me someday
i'm waiting for you to look my way
baby if you ever need me again
so baby if you ever need me again
oh baby for just one day
i look at you you look away
hey we're just two people trying to love
then when you descended to rescue my life
i'll never let you down
i wont let you down
i'm a fool let me tell you
call it what you like but it aint love
written by scott and wolfe
you could throw me away like some old shoes
and there are times you really show
i'm just a woman you are the only man
i'm just a woman you are the only man
and i've been getting the impression
chorus
how you hurt me once before
you better take notice of what i say
always forever to stop it dying
nothing going on our way
and the more i try the more that i forget
i've said to you for you
i miss the girl whose not impressed by
when you see one bird into the wind another one's turning
islands never been to before
hits you when it's too late
it aint right with love to share
standing in the cold rain
it's a fools game
unending nights of temptation
it's a jungle out there
i hear you call it civilization
it's a jungle out there
and rotate while the rhythm motivates
you need rhymes no not none of these

my thoughts are floating as reality explodes
and i dont want to leave this place yet
and i dont want to die
jamie's on the bathroom floor she dont know why

he's trading all his life away
i think we're alone here you and i
wake up i can almost see the light
and see this sign carved in my arm
just why the fuck do you think i'm crying
all the blessings from these things given
under cover of everthing made dear
hook
places where we can make love
you are the only
outta my mind for you
i unfurl my flag my nation helpless
covers lie and we will bend and borrow
i'm on fire i'm rotting to the core
well take america
a circus sideshow but the makeup's shining through it's not so bad
and all the stars are out for you
but i cant try to be as plain as daylight
we're changing
that the sky has turned so blue
so far so good
where the lights are
where the lights are low
without question or faith then we fight till we hate
where you gone
from the first attack we could never go back so we just keep on coming
i cant feel you anymore
my eyes are taken still too high

thought we'd together you and me would find it
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
but you still want more

and when the guilt is all gone

funny how quiet has slipped to our corners
winter by morning
but you're sinking so deep in the water
and i always thought i'd make it up to you
but high above me i can see the surface now
these visions fly so quickly on the edge
'cause i cant seem to walk outside
but i dont need it x9
you cant wait to get even
somebody that keeps it all in together now
and always wanted to run in the streets

but i was wrong and now i must move on
i thought we had a good thing
watching as the flames grew higher and higher
all of us are hurting
who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
when we fail
all of us are hurting
turned my world upside down
into a space that i would never dare
this heart of mine is beating inside my chest
cuz you give my life a meaning
reporters asking questions spoken

chorus
there've been times when i thought i heard angels
and the mountains in reply

angels we have heard on high gloria
the neighbours might think baby it's bad out there

the essence of someone is constantly here
are you what you seem
are the people who look and think like you
come roll in all the riches all around you
how high does the sycamore grow
though i tried to hide it
constantly you're on my mind
how could this be wrong
someone asked me about you
that's the chance that i'm gonna take
and i hope you're not wasting my time
takes me under

that you put me through
these lonely nights without you

the ox and lamb kept time
rum bum bum bum
but someplace there's a point you cross the line
it's a long way home
how can you retrace the steps
it's a long way home
it's taking all i have just to live day to day
memories of loving you still linger in my head
they say it's a river that circles the earth
love takes no less than everything
2 love breaks the chains
i'll take my chances that it's not too late
havent seen the sun since eighty nine

well it'll take more than a fancy trip
he's the only to give me that lovin
holding the night so close
we battle the fear within
hold me now and dont let go
counting every minute every hour till you're with me
i like to savor every second you thrill me with your charm
you always take your time and you always get it right
we can learn to live together
from town to town from shore to shore
so many voices go unheard
this this is christ the king
joy joy for christ is born
what did i ever see in him
is he thoughtful
broken dates broken nails broken heart
vw no we wont tell me what did i say that for
the reasons we two are apart
that forgot how to ring
to fool the whole town may be smart
and we'll kiss before we say goodnight
just as long as you're around
or rearrange in time lose the past
we color then erase we've been erased when we lose face
to scared to speak
who were you thinkin bout

and that i was a fool and that i would never suspect
who were you thinkin bout who were you thinkin about
but i got so much to do
i got work to do i got a job yeah
to pull me
to keep me safe from the cold
when i couldnt find my way
you are the shelter i run to
and i'll never be alone
show me a heart that's got no passion
you know you cant run
ooo you can run but you wont find no place to hide
you know you cant run

and there's no good in goodbye
and if you should leave i hope you see

take good care of my heart
i'm so glad you gave me yours when i gave you mine
no matter the price i'll pay my dues
i dont know much about you but i know i cant live without you
and soar to the other side
there's a chance that maybe i'm risking much too soon
feat santana
and tell me no
every step i take you're right there trying to block my next move
and i cant wait for the day
to make you drop to your knees
i've got the stuff that you want
you've got a problem with the way that i am
the queen of the night
i've got the thing that you need
oh yeah
'cause i'm the queen of the night
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
between their loved homes and the war's desolation

to cheer the night along
and give you my love with sweet surrender
this moment's ours to treasure
there's something in your eyes i see
the lord has never never failed you yet
now when it seems that you cant stand
i'm begging cause i know
i'm thankful cause i know he is
so glad to know hey

and i believe in dreams again
my love you know i love you boy
i believe in miracles
sometimes love can wear you out
but i'm back on top
nothin has ever felt so right
chorus
this time i wont play this game
you're just a stage i went through
maybe you will realize
when there's nobody else to turn to
i run to the mountain
i go to the rock
i can go to the rock
i can go to the rock
there's nowhere to hide
you break down my walls with the strength of you love
but it took time to understand the man
still the gap between us is too wide
isnt it madness he cant be mine
did you think that i'd still care
i learned from you
now you say your sorry and
did you really think that
the way that i cried when you broke my world in two
wouldue sold my soul then
who said goodbye
and pitied every groan yes he did
i know i can go to his throne
i'll hasten hasten to his throne
oh wanna dance with somebody
so when the night falls
they even boo hooed it
my love grew sweeter through the years
but i love my baby love my baby oh
cuz i was made to love him
if i
will always
we both know i'm not what you
and i hope
repeat

if i told you that i wanted to see you
i'd rather stay the same

if you say my eyes are beautiful
and the warm sensations touch my heart
if you say my eyes are beautiful

but would this really
three niggas bleedin
so we had to creep
i needed a snatch bar
when they pulled us over
made it back to the hood
with no goddamn warning
ride a dope track
it's what you sy
a fool could get his head split
at night and fall asleep
then i write on the

she grabbed for my leg raw sex she demanded
i would'a paid a million dollars that's what it was worth
it's the homeboys always tryin to act real chill

you just makin me backtrack
and i'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years
i cant explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth
my skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto
remember when niggas would shoot joints
in this cold world the war that's controlled by the trigger
droppin emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight
street of my styles no smiles trying to gun down the golden child
lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks
jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor
i might sound hard but nigga i can die too
dont try to size upyou better wise up
you wanna get highlet the record play
and anyone who says it islies
because all the fly will be high off that ice t
because you might od if you overdrive

wont you let em know how it's goin down
cause there's more to the l o c

on his never ending journey to the top

sucker mc's you aint down with the syndicate
up against the wall it's valentine's day

and no remains they'll find
what's more powerful the brain or a twelve gauge
the mind

move our bodies like up and down
girl let's get butt naked and fuck
you're trying to rap but they give you frustration
and after they dog iti autograph it
sex in effect when we're on the road

that's the price ya pay for big fame
but there's no time for slow trains
i wanna kiss the ground
into fake laughs
but you'll never understand this
the one to look up
i was gonna break down
like a hype sex thriller
with the whole damn floor
e hits the fader and the crowd is lit
if that aint enough
felonist street thugs
cause my crew dont mess around

that why a low down nigga gets hyped
though the radio wont play this
to live with my aunt
but in highschool i changed
you wore the right color or your ass got shot
but my hustle was weak it was a no go
even though it passed the statue of limitation
but the pimpgame moved too slow
this time they didnt catch me

gats flashin mothers make cream on a stick move
and your back just rips
cause i command a whole batallion of life takers
hostage taker

high risk'll bring more riches than the national debt
hype super dope body and face her mini skirt tight

migranes fill my brain as i reach toward the realm of the insane
tryin to jump over the bree and plannin and hustlin
on the east and the west coast

i know all my niggas live in down ass towns
evil eturn up the microphone
at school you dropped math science and history
how'd you get into this spot
but you fool out your pockets got blew out
and for the money they're sell out stunts
that attitude is rude you wont get far
you got problems you claim you need a break
and then you get an idea for a big move
you played yourself
got a dope pitbull named felony
and you're goin to sleep
kick a little flavor
so niggas is forced to do dirt prodigy
too damn fly too much finesse for the hoo ride
the hustlers win the busters wont
damn over your head got a problem

oh blinker links und alles klar
wie es ihn ab und zu mal gibt
oh blinker links und ab dafr
oh blinker links
ja ich sitze hier und warte schon lang
hast du angst vor mir angst vor dir selbst
denn seit gestern bin ich wieder neu verschossen
mein vater war mal grtner in ner universitt
das sind wohl die nebenwirkungen meiner geistigen potenz egal
obwohl ich wirklich viel getrunken hab
und ich hoffe da du das da oben sprst
ich vermisse dein lachen
uh ich wnsch mir so da du mich einmal im schlaf berhrst
in der erinnerung
wr ja auch schade
ich trum von dir ich trum' von uns beiden
ich geh' doch zu mirko mist
ich wrde alles fr dich tun
dabei hab ich immer nur auf treibsand gebaut
einmal um die erde nur wir zwei
die zeit ist viel zu schade um sich falsch zu versteh'n
keine and're frau hat es jemals geschafft und hat mich so wie du abhngig gemacht
der laden die leute das bierchen am tresen
kneift in meinen hintern setzt sich auf meinen scho
und danach der mammi illegal ein stndchen bringen
ich knnt natrlich auch ber wahre liebe singen
zugegeben diese methode ist nicht fair
sogar die npd wird in deutschland akzeptiert
das einzige was euch auf die plame bringt
zuerst hat's mich geschockt denn ich hab dich geliebt
und ich tiger durch die straen ganz so als such ich dich
ja diese fotografie von dir aus meinem portemonnaie
ja diese fotografie von dir aus meinem portemonnaie
wenn du jetzt mit mir sauer bist dann hab ich wohl selber schuld
und jetzt steh ich auf'm bahnhof und du sitzt zuhaus und weinst
wenn du mit deiner ente in einen lkw krachst
alles liebe alles gute
er geht zurck ins zimmer und ich warte vor der tr
dum da da
hipp hipp hurra du hast geburtstag
hipp hipp hurra du hast geburtstag
nie verlt
alle haben angst sich anzuschaun als nhme man ihnen etwas fort
ich werde niemals aufhr'n verliebt in dich zu sein
gute nacht meine liebe
und hab laut gelacht
das wurde jetzt auch langsam zeit
da ich noch am leben bin ist wohl reines glck denn
weil ich in gedanken ganz tief bei dir bin
achtung fertig gnadenlos
diese nacht wird gnadenlos
mach jetzt keine kompromisse
ein leben vor dem tod ist mglich
ohne dich knnt' ich mein ganzes leben vergessen
denn ich wei ganz genau es wird nie langeweile geben
ich drck auf den roten knopf dann wird sie explodier'n
oder besser gesagt ich liebe dich
ich liebe dich
ich liebe dich

wirkt viagra auch bei frauen und hat uns gildo wirklich lieb
oh manchmal hab ich das gefhl ich lebe hier total verkehrt
ja gegen den groen hunger wird frisches obst organisert
wir haben endlich urlaub
auf der strae liegt ein mann er hat ne zukunft mal gehabt
da geht ein mann im grauen anzug mit nem koffer in der faust
sicher wird sich alles finden vielleicht auch ein sinn
ich habe einen groen hund du hast 'ne kleine katze
ich putze und ich schrubbe und dann kommst du nach haus'
willst du eine neue nase haben
und lade nur noch promis ein
ja wenn ich gro bin werd' ich schnheitschirurg
dann nenn ich mich doktor frankenstein
und lade nur noch promis ein
die anderen frauen waren neidisch denn die wurden nie gefragt
es war ein groer anfang doch dann war der ofen aus
doch jede frau die mit mir im bett war die glaubt nicht da das stimmt
der fleischertresen das war ihre welt ich hab' mir immer vorgestellt
denn jedesmal wenn ich den laden betrat da fing' die hunde draussen an zu belln
ich griff ihr ganz frech an die brust
die reden zwar nur bldsinn doch sie wollen alles glauben
und auf gitarristen fliegen sie in scharen
ihr seid arm das ist hart ich bin reich das ist fair
ich glaube nur an sachen die ich auch kaufen kann
mnner wie wir
mnner wie wir zeigen dem leben die zhne
oh mnner mnnermnnermnnermnnermnner
und heute suft er lieber bier
und jeder tag sollte der schnste sein
war ich schon lange hier und du bist auf mich draufgetreten
hab mich geqult mit fragen ob es das nun wirklich ist
meinen charme den ich hab den sahst du nur mit trnen
ich kann dich nie verlieren hab ich immer gedacht
nie mehr zurck
und auerdem hab' ich wieder mit roswitha rumgemacht
vielleicht bist du bei wolfgang
und du hast zuviel gelacht
ich hab dich am telefon ich wei es ist soweit
ich bin vllig aufgedreht ich glaub' ich liebe dich
in wirklichkeit steht sie auf pferde kein kommentar
du machst dich vor aller welt gnadenlos zum trottel
rette die erde in geheimer mission schie alle pferde am besten auf den mond
so eine wie die gisela so eine richtig nette
und du bist schuld daran
drei tage spter sagten wir vor'm priester ja
doch meine liebe das ist jetzt vorbei
ich wei genau mit dir werd ich nicht alt
fr sie war ich doch sowieso immer nur der letzte arsch
kannich endlich wieder rauchen im wohnzimmer
dann bist du ein frauenheld
jetzt schlgt dein mann dich grn und blau
und lade nur noch promis ein
ja wenn ich gro bin
manchmal bin ich etwas angestrengt vom leben
wo man nichts mehr wo man nichts mehr sagen kann
das leben ist manchmal hart blutige kmpfe und mieser verrat
ja so richtig nett ist es nur im bett nur im bett ist es so richtig nett
ein nackter rcken kann auch mcken entzcken
wir hassen jede arbeit und gammeln nur herum
wir zerschlagen eure werte und wollen anarchie
dann wrst du platt wie ne flunder und ich dein bezwinger
und dein bldes lachen verging dir auch
der sand auf deiner haut schmeckt nach meer
und ich ich hab dich lieb
das meer spielt
und hr' dem rauschen zu
das meer spielt unser lied
doch meine koffer sind in afrika
u u urlaub
jajajaja ich habe urlaub
so herr ltsch fiebermessen hose 'runter popo hoch
tjaich dachte da ich als echter mann
oh wenns kommt dann kommt's
und war'n auch sonst sehr sprlich verhllt
da hast du keine chance
dann ging' sie beide lachend raus
da hast du keine chance
lalala
ich komm auch sehr gut ohne dich klar
und selbst im traum hab ich mich von dir befreit
ich war besser in der schule doch du warst unser held
uns're trume sind lngst gro geworden doch lange nicht so wie wir dachten
wir ha'm uns wiedergefunden
und feierst einfach weiter und schaust nicht raus
und pltzlich singt der wind dieses kleine lied
heute ist der erste tag vom rest unseres lebens
schlafen knn wir immer noch wenn wir in der kiste liegen
hab mich so oft in dich verliebt selbst deine schwchen mag ich gern
wenn du es merkst dann schrei mich an damit ich mich erinnern kann
standen stundenlang vor'm spiegel und sangen unser lied

i dont know where i am going to
and the streets are never clean
think we're standing for injustice
what are you going to do to make me hate me
well i'm getting so sick and tired of
i'm flying higher than a pig in space
four hundred years or more
if i was taken for a day
so where has the love all gone
till i had a vision of you
i had a vision of peace

you're the one thatmakes me smile
a place havent seen sits at the end of space and time
been so long i've been hopelessly confused
but will i ever dare
a picture of my life
so come on bring your advice along
2000 years they've been and gone
planet home planet home
find yourself some peace on planet home
war zones no homes aint it time we gave the dog a bone
still we dont seem to understand we need a revolution
blinded i cant see
but often more than not this is abused
wont be long before the welfare
scam
why i have to give it all up just when i want to get ahead
they got to justify for what i should be giving
signed sealed delivered i'm yours
ooh baby here i am
see i thought i had it all
we've got all the funk we need to make me happy
hey well i guess i'm not as cool as i used to be

spent my days breaking the rules and regulations
i've got my soul education
see your mad you cant delude
and if there's green wax in your eye
my friends
good vibe zone
high in the sky
and i know you can give such sweet moments
until you're in my arms girl

for you and for me to be
than this journey of discovery
look around at what you're running from
see i'm a high pressure operator
stop dont panic it's just a thing i do
yesterday my life was filled with rain
oh now you gave to me your all and all
now sunny one so true
supersonic
but between the day you're born and when you die
as the sun will shine
and then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
it's taking time for you to realise
fifteen years of royal pleasure
well i guess i'm just an educated fool
stormy weather
fifteen years of royal pleasure
so many people
you know we're too young to die
dancing like we do now
can the politicians reassure
or dont we count at all

and i cant go on
living virtual insanity
and it's no fun you can lose
sadlands are where i live
the evidence in these events
if i pick it up can i put it down
too too near now
stop it going on
and you'd better play it natures way
oh people

if your love comes with a twist
it's not exactly clear no no

and not only that you'd be under my wing
a ittle moan and groan after some fuss and fight
i want to love you every moment i can
and then i'd proceed to make your nature rise
round and round upside down
looking out for the danger signs
found a new tab thought i'd take a grab
years slip away and i get older
and if they're willing sure i'll bring them
satelliting what i was writing
so instead of fighting out our problems
something something is not right

imagine life without a choice at all
they would decapitate the tongue if you would mention the word freedom
release the hot ones and let freedom ring
cause there's not a lot of time to
the past depart the present cause the future is near
the struggle and the pain to maintain and continue
keep across your vision blurred from heat distortion
great expectations on our committee unified relations
that's right that's where we dwelled and the rhythm rebelled
expectations on our committee unified relations

oh this world aint nothing like folks say it is
cause i was there to watch you grow
young black male growing up without a father figure
cause aint nothing like the birth of a child
daddy do you love me and if so
this is what it sound like
silhouette of a dream
from the firelight
for us there is no easy way
everyone fights
it cuts like a whip through the air
break
to thrill you with delight
everything that will excite
i like the way the light falls today
freedom well it's a thing that is fleeting
cool and collected
it's all in the way that you look
i was with him
freedom
i did a thing last night
while playing future games
well i know i'm not the only one
wondering if they will be here tonight
future games
come with me
cant stay on track when your back turns on me
the silence
the silence
and i could tell she was feeling abandoned
she was a sailboat of sweet perfume
if i could sing like paul mccartney and funky like etta james
i'd never change no i'd never change her i'd never change silver heeled ways
and a black widow spider makes
i cared not for love nor money
so we make our choices
we can hit it on the nail
and when we do
it will be greater
how can we fail
oh the sky is the limit
slow your roll niggas

about the times we used to have
talking with nothing to say
lifting our hearts to the day
'cause i feel that when i'm with you

and you will find while in the wind something that you lost

you think you're so shrewd
how could they know
your touch i've grown tired of your words
a brief remark an utterance information
dont know who i'm supposed to be
i'm not myself when you're around
i always wished that i could find someone as talented as you
you'll see
i know i'll stay alive
you only have deceit
no one can take it from me
it's your honesty
with you i have no choice
pulling me closer to you
when i look into your eyes
when you talk to me
and i feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas
someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
could be the wine i drink
and i wanted to be
chorus
in a tiny bubble
everybody's looking for something
nothing out there looks the same the same
why is how creation goes
take me where my heart wants to go
kiss me
i'm in a trance
nothing out there looks the same the same
and i didnt have a chance to say goodbye
nothing in the world that he wouldnt do
ignorance is not bliss
why do we have to pretend what for
that used to get you down
i felt it it thrilled me
cant get my head around it i need to think about it x2
when everything goes incredible
you were my friend
so i can relate
that used to get you down

but this heartache isnt going anywhere
next to my bed at night
you'll always be inside of my heart
i'll always have you inside of me

was it just a dream

and all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
that you have abandoned the love you had
and i saw a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads
and they worshipped the beast saying
if anyone is to be taken captive into captivity he will go
he will wipe away every tear from their eyes
their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone
amen
for you to justify my love
chorus
i'm not afraid of who you are
to justify my love
gonna get out of here i'm gonna leave this place
to your heart and your soul

chorus
i live at the top of the hill
and i never want to make a sound
you gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
o o on the street
like nobody booming supporting that

i like to play the queen of hearts and never thought i'd lose
chorus without last two lines
i see you on the street and you walk on by
open your heart to me darlin
chorus
open your heart i'll make you love me
and if i fall i get up again now

but you should know by now
papa dont preach i'm in trouble deep
what i need right now is some good advice please
oh i'm gonna keep my baby ooh

rain is what the thunder brings
your love's coming down like

quicker than a ray of light
and i feel
with you i'm not a little girl with you i'm not a man
and gives me hope that there could be
and you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
i'm sending out an sos
it's hard to believe life can be so demanding
i believe in the power i believe you can rescue me
repeat
if you wanna talk to me that's exactly what you're gonna have to do talk to me
my mind says
you're callin and callin i dont understand at all
ring my ring my bell you cant
babe if you want more you come to my front door
ring my ring my bell you cant
but now there's just no place for you to go
you'll never get your money back
it doesnt pay to give away what you lack

who needs the light with the darkness in your eyes
surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice

verse 2
right now your children might grow up like this
they were no win losers
10 g's a head whoever you want dead
you gotta live this life for you to try and understand
with nothing on his mind at the time but to get him
cause she's put out of misery
yeah they talk but they be talking diarrhea
i keep the soul cause i'm a lyrical pro
a small pack you're fucking right i think i'm all that
i keep the soul cause i'm a lyrical pro
boom bashing in '94 know what i'm saying
check the picture with the apple jack hat
pop with a limp low pro pimp
i rip rappers up like a card
you use a lawn mower you got peat moss
now i'm a flip the track and bring you back to reality
after mad tribe vibes rollin in the black jeep
verse 2
wild is cookin up these deadly drugs
like everyone who rhymes packs a gat with the silencer
man what i've been through is strife
and they're never in a slump
instead he was a bigot dig it
just as bad as bein shot in the groin
once a brother tried to take a leave
the umpires are the government
the bases are loaded
i'm just hangin out
which is the reason why i like to hang out and
i go over k cut's block cause raw cuts is what he blends
on the problems of the weak dumb and meek my mans deep
from flushing to the streets of new york in fact
nah but aint nuthin at your house
in this here field my foot equals yield
sir scratch and k cut the main source
on the constant truth of the main source crew
finessing the songs like this babblists get bust with the quickness
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
and wouldnt have so much hate
but regardless you shouldnt have to be so raw
but all i get is gray hairs and strife
the best looking girl in the whole us
sitting' in the chair just to stare set to sprint
to me it means the absence of all confusion
little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
set it off set it off set it off
they think i'm crazy nigga like a bag of dust
if it's a dealer the tec 9 will gun him quick
so i just pollute and kickin heads with the fuckin boot
i find a victim and stick him and move to the next one
yo watch the evil spirit rise when niggas get me fed
so all that shit you plan on talkin yo you wont be able
i got a crew of niggas waitin for the combat
i gotta get it off when i let it off
for a sandwich and selter so probablt sell the
cause i keep looking and you'll keep scheming
you sleeping in the end you get swept cause you slept
and tax and probably smoke cracks
false producers are telling lies why they're rolling snake eyes
rappers can dance sing and shake their thing at the same time
hey and i make em concentrate on the songs i create
y cucata estaba con grande como eso
we can work like strainers or filters
come and show your tactics asap let's rap
on to the meaning of a real rap song
que effe fiete hora tiende pero de la gente
and gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
attained a job as a manager at a bank
always in good spirits and money's never made
you're going to fail child
that's what an education can and might do
it's like i'm lifted out of time
will you return to love me
after tonight
time
and pulled me closer
when the morning comes
when i stand here taking every breath with you
just the memory of your face
so take a look at me now

chorus
and your spirit diminishing

and i believe it was a little something like this

chorus
and you feel like giving up
i struggled and i prayed
just hold on tight
and baby i just melt away
and i cant conceal that i'm slowly weakening
en mi corazon vuelvo a estar mal
mi todo todo doy por tener tu amor
tu cuerpo junto a mi
reviviendo aqui nuestra cancion
just like the calgon commercial
shake it off
but now it's clear to me
and you keep on playing games
boy i gotta shake it off
by the pool on the beach in the streets
baby i'm gone
and go somewhere
chorus
i never let 'em use me
shining like a chandelier
when i space am i still dreaming 'bout them violent times
once in awhile put up a fight
still kept the tears inside
side effects oh oh
hurt you if ya let 'em in
what can you prescribe for this
cause i knew if i started i'd keep crying
side effects oh oh
silent night
sleep in heavenly peace
baby i'm so afraid
that it's just a losing fight
your silence chills me to the bone
slipping away from what we had
lying beside you
shining completely
is all i need
dont ever leave me
you had it all but didnt know
someday hey hey
you're needing me in spite of all the others
and you're thinking
i dont want to leave
you keep saying stay the night
and i still havent learned how
it's cold outside
on the off chance you'd hear
what can i say i had a little extra time
if she hurts you or misleads you
if you really need me
reach baby
baby just reach out and touch me
that anytime you need a friend
in that this one's for you
bitterness isnt worth cling to
trying to preserve each word
boy have'nt you noticed
maybe soon
just you andi
repeat chorus
oh baby
and the hurt from the heart it would not subside
i'm overwhelmed with gratitude
if you're keeping me warm each and every night
i'm overwhelmed with gratitude
and i'd go through it all over again
sweet baby i'm so thankful
my baby i'm so thankful i found you
until you saved my life
i found you

and i'm nervous
and once they do it's never the same
finally found somebody the only one
finally found somebody
oh baby

but i promised myself that i wouldnt give in to love
i got you stuck off the realness
and then you casually walked in the room
i envision you caressing me
i couldnt bear to let you go yet
there in the rain
so still you lie
took to
how could you let life pass you by
giving me strength to face another morning
they are the light of hope that burns inside me
and i'm never alone cause in my heart i know
some of us dont even care
in another land they still believe
hey and maybe then the future will be a time
chorus

and i make it through the rain

just one time
there were no words for me to find at all
i'd never be
with no beginning and
we barely understood
who knows what miracles
my heart's so full i cant explain
chorus

outside the december wind blows
most at christmas time
alone in the darkness
with the april rain
when i am low
sweet and tenderly
beyond the rain
you tell me i'm the only one you need
if it's wrong to love you
'cause i cant go on
chorus
been burned a lot in my life and times
i found my saving grace within you
giving me peace
giving me strength
only only you
through that door
you will always be here with me
i should have said i love you
you're with me
still belongs to us
when i remember
nobody can take your place
one bit of yesterday
that you want me for me
and you were killing some time
and you would leave me behind
so much joy
it is the night
o hear the angels' voices
fall on your knees
so so lonely

twis and mariah togetha like them grips on ya tires
cause i wanna be wit you dont wanna leave you lonely
agh ha ha ha ha
i'm lookin for my one and only
'cause you've flown away
and i know eventually we'll be together
lord i know when i lay me down to sleep
how could our love be so blind
with open arms
but now that you've come back
somewhere halfway
somewhere on the
and it's hard
blind and unguided
you'll always be
and i miss you dandelion
i was resigned to spend my life
always love you
although that knife was chipping
to see me suffer
and i found the strength to break away
here comes the night
i see through your disguise
used to keep me by your side
so when the morning comes
expect me to hug and kiss you
i'm not one of those girls who'll wait around
so i'll be allright
a picture fades of you and i together
she pressed on night and day
a mother's love
why you left me there so helplessly
chorus
he knows when you're awake
they're gonna build a toyland
looking at you
and baby i'm ready to go

holding her hand
something in your eyes
and here i am
i try and try
even though i try
that i dont matter at all

when they fall they fall hard
who's gonna care when the novelty's over
you're no superhero
its a ladies night
later on at night i'll be tellin you soo

and it's bittersweet
late at night like a little child
by the stereo

it's late
so that he wont know
on my tippy toes
i cry
cry
do do do do do

so that he wont know
i still cry
in my daydreams
but it's just a dream
and a sweet so sweet
but you're just a fantasy
cant stop now uh

just a little crazy
you can really lose your mind
conversations painfully weak
and do things you would never do
though your attention spans not that long
dont try uh
no
you rhapsodize
do the things do such stupid things
you rhapsodize
i knew what you were all about
i want a friend
oh
cause i wouldnt play by your rules
end of our relationship

then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread
paid no attention when he started chokin
you never know when they'll be layin in a coffin

and i'm hoping that you just might
within this there's so much happiness

withering soon sour
succumbed the ancient spirit
let my body into nothingness
now everything is withered
i thought we were close together
engraving our lecherous lust
the wounds wide open
hounds of love we were
all left are the scars it made
mutilate the meak terrorize the timid
made the whirlwind of the experimentalists
never see us perspire building this empire
sea salt eye of newt horn of bison
cant get no higher or stop my desire
the howling wolfpack who dwells in outgoing maddness
conquer all my challenges by reaching within
i will have achieved my life in leaves of paper that kept me safer than hangin with theives
we both have inkpads covered with blood and scabs
yo it's funny how time flies
before i'm laid to rest i'ma do my best
maybe it's not meant to be but eventually
life has lows and highs
we move with grace
both kings on the mic we got kings on production fuck fallin off this is just and introduction

big rip off big rip off
verse
they also made you think much less o' me
she didnt want any tom or dick or harry
she always said i would like to have a son
and just because they loved their children
he she was so kind that she hated vivisection
throughout the song the policeman interprets the sounds
there's going to be a killing
the sap's from syracuse
most rightfully refuse
duke
he had twins
i had twins who looked alike
just
having lost my son
from my home to far off samos
to
there's going to be a killing
i know what guys want
arent you just special
i know what boys like i know what guys want
i feel sad now
i know what boys like boys like
na na na na na na na
because cliches dont have any impact
i choke and they are gone forever
i love you you know that
i love you
this is our crime
oh i still believe
i still believe
upon my knees
i feel like i
through the waiting
but you know good ones
dont go under the sheets
straight
try to get a message to her
your willow
i wont be brooding in my bedroom
pulled by both arms nearly torn in two
sipping lazy cups of tea
showdown in the northland
and take me through the years
to kill my sense of fear
and take me through the years
you'll have to sleep alone
and your plum colored pvc wet look maxi mac
you're even wronger than you'd normaly be
fame i wanna live for 15 minutes
what's the fuss i've gotta be in it to win it
fame i wanna live for 15 minutes
lost in the loneliness
candlelights
no one knows
say hello to the night
i cant wait for this feeling to free me
oh when the tv's on
waiting for some inspiration but lack the human interaction
i dont think i can put my all in
just to keep my contract did i say i meant 130
i'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum
since my working week departed
chorus
la la la
oh digenes
have tou got your stick
but you've got the whole thing wrong
now it's in to be out
look inside
streets are uneven when you're down
faces come out of the rain
no one remembers your name
they'll have me hunting you
he'll lift you out of the cradle
it's not important
the lyrics
scratch out a postcard
everyday is like sunday
i hear duke boning keisha tonya and tiff uh huh yeah
ooh ohh y'all dont want a girl in yves saint laurent
what you had in me too fine to see
cos i dont really wanna stay baby
i thought i was a friend not just another man
verr' nice crib and a nurr' blue five uh huh
full of bullshit he acting like a star cant cry c'mon man
what do you wanna be
a robot or a monkey
and know we're so grown up just like we wanted to be
then you work all day it's not right it's not right
spilling thoughts void of true opinion
what is open minded to calmly digest the very question and
so settle down settle down
hawks and crows do lots of things
and you'll get breakfast
now is the time to
we chew the fat of life
how's the weather
so speak your mind my dear
how's the weather
when the sun is dawning
we let the burglars take their snatch
a joke becomes a pun
with the ladies of the evening
originality is so passe
a hundred years ago or more
and on and on and on and on
for he fell in love
this cant be love because i fell so well
my head is not in the skies
have you heard all the stars that are relentlessly living
there's nowhere else to go
maybe it could be avoided but i dont think so
i've been taking the dark route home
so you're quite happy
feel really truly unfulfilled
week in and week out
maybe
you unleash the tension
glazed eyes and double vision
your weekday demons take their toll on you
believing in coincidence
and try to remind myself who is laughing
i want the best job ever forever
we've got the best job ever oh oh x2
luce
what can you do with a man
go on and count a million
each weighs a pound
and got a cold potato
thanks to julia james for submitting
chorus
everything about you
the way i do
oh weie taube
auf meinem weg durch den goldenen himmel
refrain 3x
la palma blanca
frm my glden skylight way
once ei had my share of losing
so tante judda alles gte und prost
speakin with a stunt steady stagger preachin with a southern drawl
cause sometimes that shit can help you get your ass kicked
but if i didnt take a toke i'd be leadin a street revolt
but shit i'm hockin spit like i thought it was worth somethin
now i'm pennin rhymes about gettin on the wagon
wait a minute while i get up in a funky situation
my partner's cousins uncle got killed by a shooter
dj pam the funkstress starts cuttin up that was fly
this commentary's for my folks under involuntary servitude
this composition is sedition opposition to the rulin class
old ladies play canasta under roofs of cracker plaster
from the force as we make it tight and ignite
paging dr kevorkian paging dr kevorkian
tell me who it was and i'll be buckin like a untamed stallion
sheeyit like i needed you to tell
bzzzzzzzzzzzzt clear
boots
and it's slugs goin off if they let you die

and now they wanna assassinate me like they john wilkes booth
i'm risin like the vapors from the dank
nuttin ass tricks gangin up on my homie
chorus boots
and to my old buster ass manager licky deez
he told me then that he wasnt gonna lay me off
cap peelers want your autograph say you know the path
and while we gettin strangled by the slave wage grippers
busterismology it only fi bustas 2x
and last but not least busterismology
and dont even try to lean the shit back
the radio gets one station on am it's chinese
you need to act a little older
like the other day in a '81 datsun
fixed the beat first cause that's my choice
they need to pay me for all these adventures
yo go and flow for the mack and be the hoe
e roc we're all cooped up so feel the pain
so how is this we never had no funk
the golden leg to chair again despair again
the record skip the record skip the record ship scratch
our time is over past it's due
c c c come with it
so you know i got the stolen bus pass
now what the fuck is new
i'm a thief or pickpocket give a fuck what you call it
my teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
im just kidding i'ma call you write you love letters
gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the vittles that i just got
a building door opened
a party with rich motherfuckas i dont know the situation
alright i'm ready
what no place where a brother might been
we looking hella bourgie
to say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet
this is how deep shit can get
it just brings me elation
and thats a damn abomination
boots 2nd verse
caught me took me to the station
tell me somethin
pulled up a chair just to think about my situation
i was trippin slippin labelled as a dummy
gettin paid peanuts in the burger shop
a devils land aint no black foe a black man
if you wanna get paid sell your people out
so i'ma do what i do cause he's makin all the motherfuckin
brothers on the block making bankroll
i'mma take a risk on the dis take a big dive
still dont nothing move but the money
right about now i'm gonna change the flow
if you dont make it then they treat you like trash
at times i find my mind can think fast
if so no mo' we'll play the big toe
people pick problems out and isolate
damn big 1970's jacksons afro and shit
knick knack patty's wack cause in her mind it's firm
kick em when they down and he'd steal they shoes and clothes
you aint steve austin elmo got paws in boots
bet george and bootsy never had funk like this
up a creek called shit light is lit on the situation
i'm trying not to lose
you wont be takin no sips from a milk carton
the genocidal funk so i'm a punk if i dont blast they ass
aight back it up
niko and the whole mau mau rhythm collective
problem child got my back with the piano
shit fuck with me all the time
cant come straight from fudge
see all my folks is broke
they knife my umbilical cord
coasting down fulton on the mississippi river
off to the war
cos aint no billionaires on the murder trial
the ruling class was cut throat since we fresh off the boat
my daddy dont be tripping
wasnt in my way
so im dropping the fourth grade
put on a video game sit some time
chorus
when that path im rolling on
ator
reminiscing in my seat
well let's see
the bullet had no name
i get it done
for them whose black folks ever came to here
while they got billions in the bank
and now the rocks is in my pockets
and the knowledge no longer will i waste my time
im spitting the game so close to you
can become a pimp up in this system
i stride to the ride
pass the nickle bag around and im looking at the street
less some caps is getting picked
dj pam cuts up fly lyrics from the bank of reality flavor flav
you tell me that a nigger's crazy or lazy
repeat 4x
without a doubt the coup gives me much clout
you know that i aint the nigga ice cube
until we change our mind to
repeat 4x
and it wasnt in a trip cause he's not a dealer or a pimp
you're in the hood and it's one more disaster
i know you motherfucker
aint got a choir so it sure aint one of salvation
cause i know you
i know you motherfucker my face prints in your knuckles
but i'm not laughing cause i'll take a bath in this one
stand in fear and guard your rear as we gather round
we know you motherfucker
got this block infected
but me i know the scoop i know the plan
you try looking up encyclopedia brown
no more questions in here so dont ask
you know the faces and names all your stories are polluted
i never did resist you're telling 4 smiths
im getting nervous you feel me point blank
asking me shit that would get my mother hung
and all cops watched like a pay per view
bopping in the ninety four to slide
now check it the topic of discussion
a sucker selling out for the sake of a scream and shout
brothers and sisters we must fight this slumlord
right between the eyes of my landlord
bored said we need a plot i comply let's leave the spot
thirty years ago jesus could pull a hoe quick
from the pen he would scribe on how to survive
i cant hear you oakland do you wanna ride tonight
and back at home she would cry into her pillow
you're much too beautiful for words 4x
wearin nothin but pumps bikini and fake mink
i was hysterically cryin all she could do was whine
boots
you know how bitches act shit exclamation points
put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em
me and jesus the pimp in a '79 granada last night
i got a mirror in my pocket and i practice lookin hard
up at the church they're tellin me it's because i live in sin
in the winter there's a splinter with the smell of the rain
now my dream and aspirations go from single to hoe
that's what little black boys are made of
assassination attempts i'd root for the snipers
b naw this is not yet freestyle cause we not yet free
but i think we need a goodbye for his ass
b ay what about pete wilson whassup that pete wilson motherfucker
semi automatic
e who else gun cocks
well anyway i said that's no burglar that my butler hahaha
well if you're blind as helen keller
motherfuckers like me got stocks bonds and securites
less you cutting it see im running shit
i
this is just like the straws
let you out like linoleum floors
well actually we were just leaving
because the money inna mi trunk dem wan fi come tek see
please please pass the bubbly
while you was eatin
vibrates from 808 quakes
never shoulda been put in the penitentiary
and die of malnutrition
play soccer wit' your brain
to give him dick sucks
kept washington dumpin 'em in ditches
and make rights then
tellin lies like a tweeker
boots nah i said i love it here in dc
chorus
cuz you aint never did work
to hustle up some mo' green
and that's almost like a sale
singers
now who's that motherfucker who rollin down my street
he took my color tv the dining room set
it's the repo man
i gives a fuck how much you bench press if you aint pushin up
cause most likely you one paycheck ahead
god damn it's the repo man
who is the motherfucker rollin through the hood
they see these drawers that im wearing
i guess i got to sit my black ass right there and get shot see
ali shook the world im gonna shake my homies hand
withca a snicker from my commisary bank
e 40
mistaken right suppose all blacks look alike
chorus
some here for having gacks
they calling me working on my third strike
now i calculate the beatin for approximated speakin
people screamin so loud they lungs got broke when
negotiatin with a guard out by the trailer
used to sneak in to the eastmont cinemas
now give me those minerals and those jewels
four hundred years ago fool where is my gold
cos this time all of your bowels gonna move
cheerio
where i live at
im get you if yo play my little sequel can
im gettting ammunition out the pinto hatchback
chorus
we got a gang of motherfuckas who done eat their wheaties
i see the po folks pull the trigger and flip the birdies 6 feet in the dirt
b man tragic for who
who will meet you with a fleet of brothers in the street
a hundred brothers taking factories warrens law is gutters
you're teaching lies we got wise now we realize
for what we really need we're gonna have to take mo'
i guess today they should've worn their clean drawers
are now used to serve and protect the brothers
you stole the shit from my great granddaddy anyway
now lonzo was armed with nuttin but a mean mug
here's a key there's a key but lonzo where's yours
cause lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
who's the fittest as i raise my fists up cant survive and not be ruthless
ahahaha what was i finished saying
we got a way to lick it gave him a book said here's the ticket
we'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels
yeah well er um mama's living on welfare
just say no to drugs but say yes to what
and oh goddamn here it come now
now we gotta come and get yo' shit
i dont care about your family dont hand me
collectin on your debts now you're losin a wad
fo fo' caliber shots aint discrete
see i was sleepin on the carpet in my apartment
when you pick up the receiver i'm sick with a fever
my tv was gone and out the window from my room
more strikes than a teachin staff's fight for pay hikes
but is you wearin canvasols or purple pinstripe suits
and we dont give a fuck if we missin a fender
i accuse you of nigga hating
and i slang rocks but palestinian style
dont stand and debate it get a mob and take it
green paper complications
pam cos the wrecker
pam the funkstress cuts i shot the sherriff
eternally you'll find information to be god sent
how bout some tanks doin a driveby
a cop to me could burn in hell
rich like 69 dollar shit

the peace they gotta make the bosses money increase
chorusthis is for my folkers who got bills overdue
thoughts of being homeless crying till you hyperventilate
you feel like crying but you think that you might never stop
then all your problems pile up about a mile up
they say this generation makes the harmony pray
arguements about money usually drown out the tec blasts
just hit me at the house so i know i aint alone
oh dough too cheap toupee
and they dont have the right answer like allen i
laugh flows crack on the stove
you got a watch you dead that's time to kill
40 caliber

but any other woman i see is in your likeness
chorus
some space to breathe a moment as friends
cuz i was kinda too shy to really get down
and who's counting but i know at least a thousand times
that's all the fraud shit got to gofake shit gots to go
stimulate you like the best sensimilla
even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
the implorer the universe explorer
that surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
old rhythm that's plain
wednesday they cover the grass
what i am what i love
i look around at my homies that's gettin old on me

critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
for my mellow my man

here on this agenda there is no pretenders
bad luck i walk under now show me where the ladder at
we all search for sanity but i think that it was lost again
verse two black thought

that's why the system's always tryin to pursue with a blemish
the bad lieuten ant
brother quest
i tried to tell him to stop cuz yo it's ghetto red hot
bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
black thought
yeah the square roots be the setters of examples
busy til the break of dawn
it's me the brother uest from the s q t square roots

black thought
prisoner g now you're free you can be all you wanna be
pass the what pass the popcorn 4x
flow in slow mo' and let the brother manifest
that be rugged it was the drumsticks and the buckets
knots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin
chase me and see if you catch the circular knot
ad libs to outro
til the train stop then a nigga hop
i wake up early in the morning i mean early afternoon
i laid them play like johnny hathaway and shake a hand shake a hand
johnny on the spot got the rhythm and the rhyme
word is perfect never ever shall you misinterpret
up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
within my brain foun tains over rugged moun tains
hark the name the fifth from the ill power hill at that
tryin to get it on the rhythm gettin shitted on
and push up ya lighter up ya lighter
the fifth chant you see the exhaust out
illicit because most cats will live corrupted
all my peoples that be knowin the time c'mon
derived from mindstates of cold crush tapes
and push up ya lighter up ya lighter
to all my peoples on the planet stimulatin the mind
verse one black thought
what we spit will leave your shit in utter amazement
experience is all that is i'm well established
withdrawal like darryl strawberry it figures
fifth supreme linguist a lyrical genious
i hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
thought known as the cure for cancer
chorus
2 1 5
slow up oc before you get dropped
rippin your sacks and
before when i have to trap ya
the street mentality mixed with the intellect
enter your zone with penetration
chorus 2x
cooler than peppermint
the swift extravagant
ya'll talk about bodies
blast your ass if you insist it
up in your flesh like plasma
all the way to takahwana and frankfurt they know the name
crack crack
singing softly
instead he spent hours at some corner spot
clouded his vision
with birth blood and quiet tears
although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate
found honor amongst thieves
first son plunged deep
nowdaddy and him twins in addiction
so eyes wide and glassy
so called friend runs for door
knowing
fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
it dont matter how your gates is latched
hello hello hello hello
you in trouble if you not an onasis
matter fact next pay check it's like that son
northside nigga southside
you know i'm hip to it and its hard to claim the land
we all oughta the scatter though
shits poppin off worldwide
she told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
the crown ruler is back
then clap then shake it without breaking your back
i got the everclear flow they mimosa with it
this is the trial and error era no co defendant
i'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap
you know its black thought and your boy the bro uest but
still in the trench buzzin off the killin dispense
new delian cat the fraggle rock skully is split it's black comin
man i remain lives ahead of the game
my niggas wraps give a slice
for tracey and tamika and for shelly and susan
chick likes riq you such a show off
eastside westside there's always beef x2
taking my name in vain mistaking license for freedom
the hands will fake the clapping
popping like crisco
pyro maniac like dr molotov
you dick smokers get no respect
then analyze this dime the main thing glitter
drastic it aint plastic it's pro blackness
or would it be the same for you like i was eric clapton huh
i tell you one lesson i learned
i fly higher than them dudes from off your block

limitless entrance paid to the order of the

but he told you if he cant work to make it
make you wanna holla 'bout it
written on a lega pad poetry that sizzle the clip board
with the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
so it's play dirty or die by the hand
of the doomed became my mission
silk sheets and money heaps
no time for playing with my coochie
loose lips flipped the script
plenty of fat uniformed rats with
minds haunted by our childrens faces

lubricatin my maridian points that was the summer easy to remember
that faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded

to make the story short me and my man soon ran
but if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental i never forgot it
with 555 souls from the streets

easy come easy gone
how many times you look 4 happy
take ur woman 4 she hit the front door
a consumer point of view
couldnt profit from the game
radical man
someone who stays high high
that is the destruction of the so called radical man
fool with the gold rush drinkin alize
i could really run that computer
we dont care whatever unknown
the flow is out of site
in a locker board of directors
take a stand radical man
through the gates
there's another turn on
like the wall of berlin
guitar
right now right now
the opera jill scott or the fair
eye just want 4ever
eye might go wild
if eye had a magic wand eye could turn back time
eye'll crawl on my belly and beg u
one hundred thousand million days
i'm feeling sad yeah
lost in the memory
much nostalgia keeps bouncing through
and i'm itching for the hood when i cross the states i roam
kicks my heels but my jordans wouldnt 'ize it
i'm feeling sad
there's no place like home
there was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese
now here come all the hugging
i'm feeling sad
happy thanksgiving and a merry christmas and a happy new year
i'm feeling sad
i wish that life wasnt always ending up this way
with heavens love at stake and hell to pay
moses
now i am home
all i ever wanted
because i turned my eye toward u
a threat to either 1 of us
with grace they've come and shown
all the midnights in the world
why walk around the center
be the one to change the meaning
a reason to hide babe
go go go with a smile
and where and where is the batman
i tried 2 avoid all this but i cant
i wanna bust that body
if a man is considered guilty 4 what goes on in his mind
let's do it sampled in bg
dont stop dont stop dont stop dancin
wake up
2 much desire
all u gotta do is just plant the seed
cause when u whispered in my ear
everytime i walk in faith that's good
and our heart just must confess
hey hey hey
still i must confess that i am
beautiful beautiful
how sharp the corners
repeat bridge
that eye never once believed
u get better with time
this might seem absurd
i dont want to dance too hard
you better take your woman and hide her
you can act hard if you want to
i love to love you baby
soothe my mind and set me free
eye heard a rumor that ur man he said he'd do u wrong
chorus
u call me on the day that u and him r just 2 through
way 2 fine he was 4 her
just 2 match the color of her hair
so prominent because in the dark it'd glow
she knew which fork 2 use but she couldnt dance
she shrugged her shoulders and said no harm
now dance
es war ein sch
she's no bitch she's far too rich
you wash yourself
i can rule the world six times over
never needs to be soiled
abort me cos i have to compete
such a perfect celebration
only needs to be said
eye've been waiting 4 u baby all night long
eye'ma want it all night long
eye've got something that u wont know how 2 handle
eye'm gonna make u scream my name as if it was divine prince
one scent alone make it worth ur while the price of prince's candle
eye've got something that u wont know how 2 handle
i am the boogey man i am
the kingdom of the worm
howling
he'll ever be fine
that mans not part of your wonder plan
if you test him unless you're ready to die
let me tell ya that you wouldnt believe
do you want me to continue with this or what
you think you worked it out
chorus
but dont forget it's just a ride
yeah we break down
it's just a ride
just gotta go with it
no need to run no need to hide
no need to run no need to hide
somethin kinda smooth you can bop your head to
tempo moderate this aint no marathon
just kickin it
the track design
with a hit that youre gonna get mentally locked to
all about effort yall
ya mind is the boat and my rhymes the captain
is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax
just kickin it
he he he ha
rather fear him thats able to destroy both body and soul in hell
i flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
i'm in my own world and this realm is great
is come on mum i'm just rockin
cause i'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
i'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
and as i verbalise to my dj's cut
adrenalin rushes my ego swells
all of a sudden i get another adrenalin rush
when i step off the stage that's when the stop
chorus
i'm ready 4 the crush
everytime
let's scream and shout your 'crush' repeated in bg
ah that's her
dont use it if you cant feel it
we're doing our own thing
all r welcome 2
puttin the i in fine
u better not come if u cant stay
come with the life of the party y'all
my voice is getting higher
wipe the salt from my eyes and ignore the pain
the law says i'm their property
guide us through the sea

my whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl
and they left 100 and a note by the phone
dressed in red leather tight to their booties
of course i was mad this type of thing can burn at you
they walked in looked like they seen a ghost
and in retrospect i had to laugh
but with all my strength i couldnt do it alone
i'm not exaggerating i said it and i meant it
well the reason that i brag and i boast the most
so you can dig your grave cause there no way

automatic pressure got to kill it
infested in the residence of pico union
drugs i need femine venoms in the system
when you got the fix get in the mix
had the proom queen scholarship brand new car
making me feel loose get nowhere turn to no one
we crooks get thrown big books
befriend the whole system
supply weapons coke crack and buddha
you cant find your way out the maze through purple haze
and anybody else that enforce the law
breaking through my storm sick weather
split seconds in time life become short
sets up the weather to splice us
who have patternized more than just mice
to unpulsate the black magic that breathes
it's out of hate oppressed revolt from feeling that they gotta take
fierce weapons speak for each side through open forum skies
the stage is set up the script is written so we get wet up
heat we feel on crazy
enemies of the state take center stage
we see through the plot
while they sit back and leave it all up to sonny
i planted two gaurds on the watch tower
but ther's no room for the two at the top
at first i thought it was a government scheme
when the boss dies he whole kingdom falls
it's my motherfuckin time to shine
have a seat and the boss will be right with you in five
i said why the fuck did i get sacrificed
joaquin
mr duke
terror strikes under streetlights and grow
i cant replace my home with peacefull silence
deadly sirens brings on violence
explain why i'm target to homicide
who said they was untouchable but instead
filled with narcotics
fight to survive something crazy has just happened
war between city blocks and cops
haters get ass we get the last laugh like bloodstone
all kinds of musical forms of confusion
employ those firing
statistics recording the growth of the bad seed
'til the end of the war has been won you've been warned
there's nothing you could do we're breaking through
we lose control confused in the midst of staged scenes
document the city routine with hard rhymes
survive or defeat concrete jungle
rolling deep headed for florence and normandy where all you see
we go to the streets at night
to be gun flashing blasting that's why we aint lasting
a coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
aint no love
and electric chairs marking you with the stamp
and cashless systems
but i refuse to believe we all go down in flames
leavin you confused dazed and what got you all amazed
you got your role i got mine dont cross paths
we rock 'til the cops come and rock non stop
we get stoned tripped or wired
you're out playin games dangerous with high aim
psyclones all you sorry mothafuckas runnin
the course of the psyclone is steady
man made diseases show traces of an assassain
teams are spread out all over your city
dont mention it to anybody who questions
violent sequels 'til the evil and death equal
look at the deep thought dwelling within your mind
can you succeed in leaving the other side bleeding
yell out utlize realize survival
destyruction elimination avoid the humiliation
secretly under battle lost inside mystery intaining nuclear actions
cycles encouraging survival
taking away kingdoms endless
show of force for harm it's main source
my bullets rams piercing the skin of other men
show of force we cross and aim higher
connection we bought this and sought this out
where you head at
scatter the chatter of every lop
rather be free or get buried
static kingdoms break you and your manhood shallow
lifestyles of the criminal be wild
for the showdown you better slow down
ass end scrapping illuminating the whole block
images of war weapons the psycho presence
criminal styles point blank
my strategy assault battery
sick dogs collide with your stride
sick dogs got one screw missing
look at you throw against somebody
some might stand and some might fall
to come inside my world they all fall
this jam right here is dedicated
jacken
end of the road were everybody goes but not forgotten
chorus jacken mr duke
break frames catch a smoking
but lives get took violently
with fresh souls under control no holdin back

you know what i'm saying that's it
chorus x1
mutha fuckas drive by world wide
la undercover shoot to kill
'hood rocking window glocking zone shocking
locked on dope no hope for growth that's why we're broke
to take control over your mind and body
on the verge of insanity
like somebody pulled the plug from my brain
which one am i to aid
you're crazy therefore you're making me go cyclone
was my mind being torn apart
the outcome of what you've done shook slums of rivals
they drive by your block and shot randomly
and that ass is mine
dont hesitate to shoot in the quest for dead residents
leave shook with no question and then break
and that ass is mine
real towns around you get killed
where sirens will pierce your ears like deaf tones
imprisoned until we give our lives as payment for bail
crooked action ration is camouflaged
the wind of revolution screams come on do it
earthquake weather forever
interest or the progress of society buying me
madness and online freedom bandits
they control it flood the market target the dormant
codes punched in produce storms
terrorists through e mail drop bombs

stop the music that's not a question
this rhyme doesnt require prime time
enough about myself i think it's time that i tell you

and that's just part of the message
stop putting your conscience on cease
i chill my homeboy said this was the daisy age

those who dont believe in what i'm saying
challenge me and you will burn
altough a taste of my body would soothe you

latifah loves to rip up the scenery
take six paces and begin to rhyme
took me kind of light said they wanted to fight
if you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say bo bo bo
and four words to the wack just stay the hell back
these are the pros coming now from queen latifah and daddy o
stepping to the right to the left
we wax floors with bums make mocks out of some
and i agreed because i already knew this
and dive into the wrath of my madness
while mine are growing yes you know like all the woman inside of me
and music is made by mark the 45 king
feel the wrath of my madness
for those who want to bite dont make me have to fuss
you understand i never will
you wouldnt walk out the door

and relax think of nothing tonight
mary magdalene
think while you still have me
apostles' wives
but i'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
they cant identify em leave the nametags
somebody give the president a call
and this is asia from where i came
whole generation left in doubt
when they call i'm going awol
no time to wonder somebody's going under
i change the pace to complete the beat
my underground sound vibrates the streets
my ideas are only for the audience's ears
but dont sweat the technique
they fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
bonsoir paris vous allez bien
it's so extraordinary to be here tonight
i can understand why france won the world cup
you seem to be in great shape tonight
beginning of s'il suffisait d'aimer
to which point we are happy that you could come here
i would do a dream of this world an eternity
end of on ne change pas
j'aimerais qu'on revienne dans le passe
but it's truly a gift for us too
luc plamondon and my parents and my brother jacques
it's a song called ce netait qu'un reve it was only a dream
that i had an extraordinary moment at the stade de france in paris
aurevoir merci

ladies nothing but the finest ones
cleveland b more

ha what's goin on yo c'mon you know it's on
now who the hottest is how can it not be this
and they know what i wanna do flow forever
so let's go the best show will explode
wherever rakim go it's the god temple
i'm at the free throw playin ball or cee lo i keep dough
melodies for mcs motivates the breaks
i was supposed to wait but let's motivate
planets as small as balls of clay
follow the leader
vision a prison all right listen
follow the leader yeah dope
since you was tricked i had to raise ya
hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
a fear if i freestyle lyrics a fury
soon as the beat is felt i'm ready to go
there's one r in the alphabet
follow the leader is a title they task
rakim'll say follow the leader rakim'll say follow the leader
rakim'll say follow the leader rakim'll say follow the leader
dj's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
equations are drawn up in paisley form
showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
microphones get clutched by the illustrious
align with the stars i come back to bless the mic
chuck d
put em on the lil plane til they cant claim no fame
at times it get deep but i never defeat the purpose
it's ra's habitat i'm like that czar arafat
the bonus is where the next open microphone is
pull in the ring repeatin and sayin the same thing
my vision sadicious and freestyle's ferocious
here come the getaway car
the getaway car no jaguar
there sits the getaway car
doors wide the getaway car
thinking of this you keep repeating you miss
when this is playing you cant get stuck wit
i got soul
rakim will begin when you make the mix
forget it and dont waste your time
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul
you listen to it the concept might break you
get off the mic before i get too hot
the rest is up to you rakim 'll say peace
in sight i see the whole world through a tight lens
give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor
last chance y'all even if you cant ball
and still get vicious for the thugs and the misses
3rd verse
cause something musical magician the ageiathic author
i am the genie of the mic and
trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
where the god at come back smellin like cognac
2nd verse
make you role in your bed when your thug aint there
i will always be there
timin is right get ready for the time of your life
i will always be there
i'm flowin like dom p so unpop the cork
without das i come with the real hip hop
when i paved the way for y'all punks to mc
poof behind the def squad come the truth
i hold it down so gimme that microphone
if i lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
from long island to queens light up the new york scenes
they said i was a head of my time or either here before
my sabotage is camaflouge and espionage
i managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
from new york to cali japan and i tali
it's been a long time
they said i changed the times from the rhymes that i thought of
rush with adrenaline how long has it been again
people see me stop and ask me when the album droppin
you know ra want property like mumar khadafi
it's been a long time
first to ever let a rhyme flow down the nile
so yo i'm online it's been a long time
extended scratch it's been a long time
get strong on the island recoupe and lay around
i get cock d liffin forty's of beer
bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
dead bodies are found throughout the town
i attract attention people like to peep
areas in fear but this here's a fear
keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
sprayed wit automatics they wet me up
all you hear is screams when i'm hit by the laser beams
rakim
and i keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt
peep em as i keep em eager to listen
live and direct on stage instead of the
rakim
cause they participate and applaud me since
i'm tied uptight by your china voice
that made it feel right being me
dont leave in this way
well i cant help thinking
forget depressive times
passed on from hand to hand
expression her posession of property skyrocket
ghetto disciplined could be your confidant beyond friend
i'm in effect mode i keep the ep sewed
studied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves
promise you wont do me wrong go ahead go ahead
we relaxin and you naggin me for the agony
promise you wont do me wrong
promise you'll stay all night long
track 7
bein bein gone for a while y'know
things of that nature so timing man timing is perfect
what you wanna say to make me wanna stay
smooth as jazz but more than a half ready for math
baby why dont you stay a little while
your secret recipes to your bear necessities
sometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited
then i open the door up and kiss her on the shoulder
repeat 2x
and on a steady path like betty shabazz
stayyayyyayy ayyyayyy stay a little while child
she real exotic body feel like lucile roberts
but she know i like it she know the deal like a psychic
she say i'm rollin like mr lover lover
and this aint as smooth as i'ma get
you're unsure on tour i explore
my truth is the strength and my thought wont break
still gettin paid and i still got soul
step back
for a trip through the mind so i can locate
cause here's the tempo i'ma regulate the pace
eric b cuts up the phrase
barbarian of the microphone
then developed a strong style on long isle
like any god loose on a spree for new degrees
rhymes got rougher til i was ready to blast off
where violence usually ends in sirens
now the whole world's whylin all the girls smilin
big up to dj maniac dj teddy tuff and dj cool breeze
towards the stars unseen
mens lifetime
war
women that look like actress the status of cleopatra's
determinely advance technology better than germany
they expectin the next testament by the god
it'll answer your questions if you understand the message
the r baby
and all the banners waving
but wont we all parade around and sing our songs and wave our flags
doing it wit the r
hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
a block party starts to form people start to swarm
here we go
if i decide we in sin then my prophesy ends
allow you that the chronicle has just begun
then commence as my daily events go by
yo the legacy lives let em see what the pedigree is
no stoppin this i'm droppin this with hip hop in this
'yo ra yo when you comin out you gotta come out'
remove this shell
never the same form every brain i rained on is warm
you dont want no kind of conflict
so when they read in between the lines it's filled in
labelled as art placed in a museum
put message on records that's graced with hard bass
put on my thinking cap pump the track
i'm a prophet you cant stop it when i drop it
is untouchable
the likes lethal the mics lead you
taunt cops with more props and we want not
ghetto alert let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
and earn money and watch the century turn 20
before a lot parish we got to cherish if allah let us
last chance to advance and stash grands
ghetto alert let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
and earn money and watch the century turn 20
some hug mics to the world hung like parasites
flont rocks like fort knox and hog blocks
levantore
aint nothing funny burn plenty and burn money
and it's shouldnt take death to appreciate life
connect set for certain total networking

aint nothing funny burn plenty and burn money
no matter how trife it get my sights is set
tallying slowly turnin into barbarians
i see destruc tion even little kids trust none

livin a sin of hitmen a sinister grin
and my reward wont be jewels or cheese it's even better

cuz when we in the club
those some blow
ask a pro
proper chick
until the earth collapsed
but first the outcome is income and then some
waitin for the main event

children at the harbor waitin to see
as he tried to mend the sails
after all these years love is still alive
hello good looking is this seat tooken
i was thinking of the rhymes i wrote last night
did she live in the area was she trying to find me
i wanna know what's on your mind
now how does it feel when my mental massage ya temple

'cause now i know what's on your mind
when i be on the mic
on dangerous blocks claiming spots
how about some hardcore yeah we like it raw for sure
nowadays deejays bags of tricks graphic
pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
like their chance to make money done came and gone
verse one rakim
freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
i take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
man i keep it goin damn i keep it flowin
leavin your periphereal vision in a zone
my lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
straight up rakim allah the fiend of the microphone still flowin
all of them live someone else's dream to be sold
all of them said to go nowhere is a disease so decide your fate at fourteen
sold did you hear it i'm sold
with the lights out about to be shut down
if not the white minority
e a e d a d a fm e d a d embellishment
could i redeem myself
now i'm not wise and i'm not old
until i satisfy
i want the truth to be said
take your seaside arms and write the next line
what's wrong with me
i'm all shook up
i'm all shook up
i'm all shook up
what will you dream of tonight lady rachel
we've all been expecting you to come

gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
as i'm lookin i stand like great buildings in brooklyn
i watch the kid rap

burns soon as it's felt see it's torchin scorchin
lets play a game of rhymin roulette
whats the science why cant ya quote
but i say hey hey hey hey
lord well see see rider see what you have done
proteins and minerals exist within specks of light
atoms by the millions til the numbers increasin
he gave birth to all planets inorganic and organic
so stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
see he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
we went according by the laws of the world above
it even tells us we are gods in the holy qu'ran
and the universe was always existed
aiyyo once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets you see stress
avenues to check boulevards to sweat
brooklyn
a lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
queens ya out there no doubt
the desert and the oasis new york the far east
who use walls and subway trains for marquees
neighborhood to support ya
try to concentrate maintain then elevate
competition is none i'm the soul survivor
three fourths of water makes seven seas
when i translate the situations straight
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
rainin on rappers there's no parade
next episode be smooth as a persian
but you wont strike cause you aint no match
to equalize try to disguise it
your book is over i ripped your last page
played up mc grand but pooh butt
then leave her restless cause a lot of women be
and why do y'all got to flaunt
moves in waves to my rhyme displays
if you wanna break then i'll reimburse you
i cant stop
i cant stop fades
but umm it's like y'know to live forever you you you gotta
but umm as far as the masses just remember my words
but umm it's like y'know to live forever you you you gotta

new ways for better displays for better days
reacts and projects and tracks and it get
so check the wreck up scale rhymes overload

dissin all of the opposition

more lethal than a laser if you wanna play rough

here we go again
look at all the people that you took advantage of
refocus causin time and time again backslide
die and become reborn
no more searchin for truth that was always wit' cha
i'm watchin changing times but like a changing tide
chorus keke wyatt
well it's the microphone ripper party rockin gift of gab
gift of gab
just rush
that the fire that you spit'll burn 'em
worldly like disasters
and years and decades and we still so fly
and even more so we exploring everything that they not
mayday mayday i used to listen to kday in my heydays
i start shit with rappers who cant rhyme
i'm feeling that the proof is in the pudding
i'm rhyming to keep an ill mind saddam type shit
i wrote this piece as just a little dedication
i whip and i dip shit
have to go after you jugular
verse one
plot a long time finally a plan has made it
put in hard work finally your living your dream
when i'm thinking things that make you feel that way
dead broke more appreciation for that grill
you know just you know just really really feeling
peace to everyone i know or who i go way back wit
for mental health see you're concious that your mind is free
educate keep learnin gotta question ask
cant develop biceps if you dont do curls
when the winter came around he was left outdoors
sample scratched by chief xcel
figured you stepped inside soon enough you said good bye
i keep on diggin deep tryin to find that kid in me
i want you back i want you back when it was here i slept on
gift of gab
i'm just today i'm just the way i am
so seize me i'm here to serve you if you serve me back
sample scratched by chief xcel
the sky's the limit watch i'm bout to ball
you think i aint just go ahead and watch me
there we are all finished
in new orleans french quarter
an open microphone can be dangerous
you've just arrived the quest is driven through
propaganda positive propositions
arrow arms zoning out my mind
rakaa gift of gab
passion
the journey the learnin the time turnin
i'm still here i've seen cats get killed here
rakaa gift of gab
passion
soul
yellin for a leader
passion
the fight for rights to love your life to rise
block shock thunderous beats uh huh
saw the bright light rappers caught a night night
feast on adrenaline master the way
gab'll bring the ness of the sun into your grey day
split lickety spit it could be lit
unpaid evictions charge penalties sent
battling rappers'll stagger right after the dagger is left in it
wake up if your lunging i'm something you're nothing release
unlimited flow unriveted inhibited vindited
i guess i'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
a metal ladder
a paint splattered wall
i surrender
released into wind
the tools of a trade
i stand in the middle of all that i have learned
but then who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
yes i am homeless
tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
i have seeded a forest of myself
lyrics born
it's mostly hustling
success at something
take hold and shift shape live a longer day
you never get no balance if you're crooked so play right snake
with the white motive motivation
crystal clear ear competition mere child's play
and then i'll rip off your arm and throw it in a stew
i'm gettin ya
put your rhyme in the towaway zone
let's get ill
word it well
rappers organizations get shut down
divine forces that refine men women
wich yo girl dressed in a g string she's swingin
it dont stop
rock ya from the top and to the bottom from the bottom to the top
the gift of gab dont stop the way i feel i have just got to rock
so that we can feel
who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
i said dont you know the powers that be
why dont you change your environment
let a brother be a brother
hardly ever them around brothers' necks no more
and mimic what you act like
i just keep movin on moving on
souls keeps burning
the melting pot of lavas seeping
degrading all women knock em up leave em now smack em up
and the sky keeps plummeting
now
the sky is falling no one is watching
we give a name
instead of leaving smiles leaven death inside of our living room
falling hurricanes
calm the fury
devastation
gives way to creatures lurking can hear the crickets chirping
chorus
a day of work completed a night of rest is needed
lateef the truth speaker
but even with a rifle your stylell get stifled
dont stop this marvelous three partners
dont condone viloence
together
the suffocation begins your soul it gets engulfed in
if it aint one thing its somethin something else
now if you want some you best come with a gun
the lyrics that we wrote again are sounding rather vicious
echo
i dedicate that line to shack from south central
a baller aint a baller if he aint got balls
shit to live for if you cant explore the
no skill displayed de shades gone now
a life with a plan nine acres on a land
mark volman vocals
bring me this morning
the next day to whatever
maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
chorus
but i i cant get much sleep
every single way of every single day
is love in the air
hail to the conquering hero
but he doesnt realize
i'll show that guy i'm just as smart
and then that conquerin hero is gonna be me
and making love is all there is to eat
file it under foreign affair
oh my sleeping child the world's so wild
they would learn to watch you play
let me tell ya i'm not insecure
repeat chorus
i simply didnt have a care
with our orange plastic button eyes
who forgot that it was sunday
sits the devil playing pocket pool
like this world's closing in on me
i can face the world
what the touch of your hand can do
lo que fuera por tenerte aqui
por favor
pero no sabes cuanto me afecta el corazon
yo te juro nunca quize verte llorar
te siento en las noches cuando estoy durmido
es que no puedo no puedono puedo estar
solo a ti puedo amar
country roads collection albums

she was doing lays before she started bleeding
honey got a problem with the bends
cause it aint the season
some go down in the dark bootleggin
but i dont cause i maintain you're just a common street peddler

verse two lord jamar

you and me in paradise
you'd understand if you were treated like me
should've known before we started
we dont want anybody to know
'cause to me love is worthless with no you and me
'cause i've been the same since we began
you would never leave
you never listen to me

it's getting out of hand
to dry my tears to calm my fears
