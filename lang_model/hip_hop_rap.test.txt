empty
to the groovin feel all right

love that song where you say that line about
slither spiraling banister down a hide
and i'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water my god
naw let's take naw let's aaah shit well i guess that about says it
i mean i'm only one servant ayo one hell of a diversion
carpet by my spearheading fink eye beretta
all y'all saw was aesop rock holding an empty book of matches
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
for breaking down their ropes ladders and stairs
free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
on a silver screen that throws gummy bears back attack
sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
it sucks it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
i was born in 1 9 7 6 at biosfet hospital located in long island ny
and ahhh i mean i could live to be a thousand years old and never re pay them
for ciggaretes and soda shook me to kasper
and i'd be lying if i said all of this
tony i know you know you crazy 'cause you told me
you listened to me brag about my issues for hours
so i guess this is my feeble way to thank you
i'ma get you back someday thank you
thank you for helping me to not die
aesop rock
aesop rock
either jump or run
aesop rock
mr lif
i'ma smoke it tomorrah
itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
aesop rock
some cats grow by the laws of the wild
jack fell
turns out i wasnt cast in the master plan anyway
i'll love you forever cuz you know me better
aesop rock el p mr lif
train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
like a flatline fetish had it's feathers fanned out
vicinity wander claim no soul
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks
another dark night
soldiers mold it where the jones is every grown up
chronicle the loading dock they crawl to lodge the colony
or waddle through this section where the natives feel murdery
mr lif talking
a pierced nose a model with a stalker cheap hooker jay walkers
a thug circus a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
a black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
there's a fun house ooh a sun spout
a carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
conditions of never blends science with religion
man patrick blockhead mr roper omega one my man hates one percy p
the give it get it never let it self pass the word eyeing stubborness
under a dusted angel heartstring big brother is watching
make a move pause make a move break cannon
sometimes i laugh at victory kissing these little question marks
but we hate jobs in general
everything i built burned yesterday
it's the year of the landshark
cockroach utter thug specimen
and i'ma let you think you won
but we'd rather be supporting ourselves
pour myself a cup of ambition and
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
when a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
bored lasso down polaris let the glow amuse me
pain combine cant even manage to tell what the swell is like
buckle the architecture til it fell through
'it's time to let go' the tin man bangin upon his chest to hear the echo
invade the town while village elders holler 'who the fuck's this'
abandon all hope y'all abandon all hope
i'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
you solar system is my condiment
aesop rock chorus
ah dirty dirty destiny
with a grin style stinger creeping out the basement
i dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
alchemy hold it from the colder sob story
rudely awoke
more postille and docile insubordinance your phylum
jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop
while slaves defy water start roofing paper bags
first time i bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain a
zipped lips clipped to my peaking
turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
empty
yeah yeah i rap tight like saran
and man i dunno if it was me or you
and we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers
one muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center housing style pagents
i fell asleep holding an appleseed woke up holding a tree
pardon cadaver had a legitimate pulse
bazooka tooth zoo keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
serpentine in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
somebody warped the message tried to pass it to the next next
have a mid life crisis when you're ten years young
teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra curricular flagpole scrapping
i used to think i'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber
if i'm not back in a week tell the crew i said peace and lay low
somebody's losing track of their flesh and bloods and arrests rests
it adds it up when a pioneer fall in comparison to your 99 bottle of beer wall
let a blue screen bruised dream canopy
blue be the propaganda banners well sure i'll be a marine
plug it in turn it on prop me up against the couch
deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
i can turn from toxicated visuals
i bond with a six string correspondence
so i can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance
your majesty i love you i despise you
and boomeranging' our harvest 51st area sickness
buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels
beautiful establishment you aint established shit i consider you foul
they shot me in the face
monkey here's elephant and it drops
knuckle in the mud hells bells in the chuckle
keeping me alive is the vibe with the vulcans hope
sir your right to the dawn of my day sir
t rex x ray with triple x hex give it up
all right
born clutching a fistful
amid your tireless bold
drink drum sip a snare to spit a rigid sequence
like chain gang escapees
exerted to color mavericks alerted
try to wallow down these yellow bricks with yesterdays appendix on hold
empty
and tainted curiosities allowed the freak show to continue
wait aint it the liquid soul therapy
know what i mean i scream
sick dictators haters
burst the threshold make the vessel capsize
at a hundred billion times
to jezebels to hellish felons
empty
still the thought of it intrigued me right
twisted pistons
operation capture flag by any means
walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up
to even make em buy the god forsaken single
walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
where there's crack whores and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases
but it also helps to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships
outro vast aire aesop conversing
sleepin with squirrels oh my god what are you doing with that squirrel
fantastic fathom the splicing of major league low lifes
see the freaks sucked out the bottom dropped 3 bears and a baby in a cottage
but you really cant do a thing with that
with seven deadly stains
houston we have a problem
maybe she didnt feel y'all shared any similar interests
i told him yeah i gave him one last look and smashed him
for want of a horse the rider was lost
dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
the punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
no coma tonight
coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
there is no secret handshake club i do not give a fuck
now the wild tribes
no city to guard
under the invaders
not a limelight
dino dna and cola straight no chaser
cute the way your little parasol spins
no batteries etc
for my seed up in flames
choke train buffers like a headlocked ed koch
and isnt that dope
c 4 to four chamber skips
rappin is my radio graffiti is my tv
for my seed up in flames
empty
jump motherfuckers
i can smell metal in the air tonight
there was joshua age 10
always said hello to passers by
well well one year passed
a b c
traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
so they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
cuz while they spread their rumors through the street
and sat and smiled looked each one over just to laugh at it all
empty
january i fell to the cobblestone
i got a lil something called a spirit crisis on my skull
i never felt so damn young
of i'm a fully animated life tree
i be the sword in the stone of the contemporary eclipse
i aint seen everything but i seen enough to talk
with the prefix of the abbot
jittery zeitgeist wither by the watering hole

doo wa diddy bust with the pre roll
the engine is the music and my nine's by my side
people come up to me and they try to talk shit man
'cause i'm running things like some mack motherfucker
give time for your mind it's hard to forget me
with the diamond stylus we cutting wax
que cosa fai come sta e
we're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
treat mcs like leaves go out and rake'em
i'm writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage
it's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you
predetermined destiny is who i am
empty
'cause i dont give a fuck who you're supposed to be
i've got the fonts you want to read
dont mess with crack or the baking soda
to all lifestyles sizes shapes and forms
pretty purdie on the drums with the beat relations
alright hear this
let me talk about back field in motion
a little something to affect a little taste of change
we create this world and the problems go on
writers prize fighters and wall street traders
and hit the fulton street mall for the sneakers on my feet
hippies at the band shell with the lsd
from 1010 wins to live at five
right next to high bridge across from harlem
were lookin pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust
my best friend's my own worst enemy
the rhymes are dope an mc you must listen to
pulling out knots pulling in residuals
dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
trench coat wing tip going to work
hot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin
year and a day
arrested bailed but cuffed and indicted
i drop the l when i'm skiing
dont need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
so once again the mirror raised and i see myself as clear as day
the bronx is up and i'm brooklyn down
keep keepin on i dont care what they say
i got the jammy but i dont got the permit
if your world was all black and if your world was all white
smokin much buddha and smokin much boots
cause i got more flavor than fruit striped gum
now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
i keep my friends around so i have someone to talk to
got fat bass lines like russel simmons steals money
mike d with the vinyl with the grooves so rare
and like the knicks i got game like i worked at hasbro
ah yea i like that shit is kind of rough
i'll grab the tee i'll tee off
all good in the zone
believe in me
and for this human body that i know i've earned
i'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
so we can work to release them until they're cleared
there is a path for the good for all
you will do this four times with the left
let your back bone flip but dont slip a disc
body movin body movin
puttin bodies in motion cause i got the notion
body movin body movin
so kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
you will do eight hops on the left eight on the right
between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes
while you were at a party your girlfriend fessed
the turntables up on the drum riser
i got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin
i'm in the pocket just like grady tate
a little puffy so you know what i'm doin right
it's no question life's been good to me
i ride around town on my low rider bicycle
i'll put the rug out under your ass as i talk on
you cant say shit because you're biting what i write y'all
but i've got the styles that are always in the pocket
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you've got
lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you've got
you be like hello nasty where you been
beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
but that wont change your situation
you never know yourself that much at all
but we all want to hold the remote control
sliding on down a hill
and when i start to rhyme well i rhyme the rhyme well
when i rock the crowd i rock the crowd well
down those hatches stop procrastin
the game of hiphop reprenting manhattan
and if you've got beef you'll get capped in the knees
taking out mc's with a big shotgun
robbin and raping busting two in the ceiling
black beard's weak moby dick's on the tick
'cause i'm bad gettin bolder cold getting colder
we got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
repeat chorus
repeat chorus
empty
what we do now is future moulding
when i get on you scream hoo tight
and oh yeah hey how about today
i wrote down human inside the space
keep the mind alert and not revert
it's not a put down
and if you want to battle me you're putting loot down
but when the snow is falling then i'm gone
the beastie boys you know we come to get down
it's kool moe d vs busy bee there's one you should know
for bringing me into this world and so on
so listen up 'cause you cant say nothin
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
you're scheming on a thing that's sabotage
i once was lost but now i'm found
music for all and not just one people
i dont get blue i gotta mean red streak
always go out dapper like harry s truman
and we love the hot butter on what the popcorn
shadrach mesach abednago
my man mca's got a beard like a billy goat

their father had envy so i shot him in the head
i got to the party and i did the smurf
got six girlies in my lincoln continental
twenty two automatic on my person
on the checkin at the party on the forty deuce
'cause things is wack and that's a fact
because you hide in broad day light a parasite
the cuff
stepping into the future again
so i'll say it like the group huggy bear
there aint no water so i guess i ought to
and look around now as it all unfurls
it's unreal how she is treated so unjust
no worries no fears and without any doubts
and the true key is a trust in self
someday i'm going to see us all joined as one
and the you're out talking shit like yosemite sam
taking care of my functions still smokin up the shrubery
but dont get souped mathew 'cause i'm a take ya
well i smoke a bag of rat weed 'cause i dont care

relentless with lyrics that be brutal hip hop i stay true to
your royal smoothness honeys out there know how it goes
face it truth of the matter is just that i'm too hard to get with
come mess with and end up with your chest split

so pick a vc date cause you're history
genuine for eighty nine you know what i'm sayin
wally d and the rest of the brothers
but then one day it was tooken away

thinking the thug status was supporting the claim
big scoob
rappers start shakin like the legs on elvis presley

so as i lay me down to sleep
i see the devil clear in my past it cant last

it's three strikes two tokes two times for the mind repeat 8x
the persona is to crush kill destroy the bad karma that
of they lp's try to tell me shit
speak your name if your lyrics hold sorrow aint that a damn shame
extra tight one hundred percent drama full armor
the particular way that i've kicked it
study facts my brother read all about it
giving it a steady a flow who's like dope you are
witness the presence of the two n e w
mc's clingin i bring on a new swing and they swung
is takin you to another dimension keepin you up to par
this is something new for you
five years later now i'm off to work
to be a jackass in the future then who's gonna shoot ya
we gotta organize
i year later i made demo cassettes with the monch
old snake shit hissin in the grass
empty
thirty two bit computer chip be slipped between my lips
all over the track
cling when i sing a song of sixpence if it makes sense then sing along
that i'm ahead of your time specifically right behind a dope rhyme
i'm mystical rip shit til the power blows
the pharoah usually go first but it dont matter
when i proceed to light the party
cause i'm poetry the psychic
i'd rather make the money bein on the cover of em
i hit the hook heavy
i figure the eight inches of me will be the remedy
tricky in a joust plus i'm down with mickey mouse
nigga political snitches abe me which is
when the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
empty
empty
i'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
so my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
lemon to a lime lime to a lemon
organized but at the same time konfusing
for crowds just like any body
i'm the prolific child these are
to wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
who share needles outside in the rain on kraftmatics
than to be scorned in this world of hate
the love with the hatred inviting friction
flow as a positive form to first step
from all that unprotected sex and cold ballantyne ales
glisten destined forever weather the storm
verse one prince poetry
lay it down for the south side sounds of blackness
forming like voltron and then attacking at dawn
migrating in the whole tri state area
on a passenger side this is what i'm asking her
chorus 1
for years tears shed it but never let it
with the big big o and you know
and blow up the spot and organize on that ass i'm hot
ryyyyyuuuu kick tiger tiger uppercut
raid your block blow your mind like fans
taste the bread i break off as i take it to your face whew
many claim masculine but sport garters
that elevates you like steps
niggas try to get over pressure on my shoulders
that's why i should be rapping and packing pistols on the bully
we gotta maintain repeat 8x
take a good look at what you fear ha
all you have to do is show some decency
prince poetry
mack 10 under seat for carjacking passenger 57's
on the corner of my block doin crime now i'm
it's love in the form of life as you know it
but i'm not not eighty six in the mind mind you
racin a 50 in my 380i
now just yesterday i couldnt took my last five heartbeats
when in the world 12 disciples in this life cycle
there's just too many rages
but the soul is uplifted
or maybe in the form of a man
hmmmmmmm and now i ask lord have mercy upon me
homicides over epidemics and crack vials
brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
you better get up and wipe to clear your eyes
ooooooh cold but yummy
i'm watchin you front
the chosen lyrical soldier who backs me up
stuck up and quite conceited
shredder of a competitor makin it better for
interrupting your braincells dilutin your thoughts
pharoahe monch
better figure the verbs are thick in you
wack style the critics are sore to crack smiles
when i roll offbeat offbeat again
down the sewer always knew i could do a brother
so dont ever despise
words of wisdom never abuse the lines
any man wearing a blindfold can be misled
releasin deadly gasses bodies deteriorating
as the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times
fifty two pick up a stick up so get on the floor facedown
pickin em stickin em up breakin em shakin em up and bashin
there is strength in my men tal bolism brains to spare
and enemy lines are crushed bumrushed
prince poetry
the niggas with skills
who rips shit
dont mean they got that flow
now your soul bubblin brown sugar so you remember it
as you look from whenceforth i come riding the wind
it's ironic when a demonic government
prince poetry
precision beams
johnny more grotesque
into dimensions to unlock new doorways
the intelligent one utilizing the mind third vision
from the slums of earth to center
round of poetical warfare energetically i walk with the flare
for god still is my upliftor
so i stretch like reed richards across the land
running upon the jagged edge fuck the rough life
playin the courts takin the loss to wherever
roosevelt felt staticky he knew things were shady
after takin aim and buckin and blowin the smoke away
so i dont give a two drip drops about what those have felt
i dont sleep at night time cause dimes i dont drop
i was abused they stripped the mind for amusement
in soda cans so dogs wont sniff me
damn i almost forgot yo yo i have to break out
empty
you know deep inside i wanna sex you like no other
into this elevator exotic world with the tall black
pharoahe monch
oh you smoke beedies see you go
believe me
with your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
but still hinted like i was self centered
my name is prince boo
empty
to throw up some heat
we buildin baby
i scatter data that i catapult to metaphor
all opticals are not inside the plan
and even when i'm gone
exquisite with the style that i be using
my termi ni ni ni ni ni nology
with the men of medicine
for salvation will perish
i bless souls thru the worldz second religion
was a 7 my steps and wit da few
empty
standin aloneit gets you tinimented
my physical form iz like nam and sane like sadaam hussein buit still calm
visualize the scene of a homicide a slaughter
a red range rover then i ricochet
crashin through the doors of projects hallways
nobody seen shit nobody heard it 4x
shall i bust ya liver faster blood pours bang
i flip up the hollow tipper and i'm not the one
yo o peep it oh shit o duck oh shit oh shit
figure i'm bigger takin your heart nigga at twenty years old
with dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
you will now consider me the apocalyptic one
my perception of poetical injection is ejactulation
the four cabs before didnt pick me up
hand to hand rap combat black
the trilogy of terror whatever i do i bring light
chorus repeat 2x
for my disposal to dispose of who are you kidding
when to say the least
check the metaphors make sure they're making sense and then
he fought back but the attack was brutal
and a glock 9 when he stops at the light
hoppin hopin to catch them all open girls scopin as you unlock
on the side of a slug damn it's bugged
cause the life of an illegal entrepeneur
to match the colors inside of your eightball sherling
thinkin about pickin up a convertible saab
piles up like drug cases in queens
then i take it's name and change it's religion
styles i file are not decaffinated i'm rough
for the periodical table of contents symbol au
with some more fat shit i tell your empty mind
with the crew that rolls deeper than the mediterranean
prince poetry
blue fields green
come in and he'll feel dumb if his son
we gotta walk into the sun ha hah
some smoke joints to annoint their brain
on a kaleidoscopic tree visually
we gotta get away we gotta do it now
of scratches that strike like sticky matches
in this particular era of darkness
prince poetry
round up the herbs at six flags we're on a mission
with the sum there were some who wasnt dumb
damn it really hurts my heart to remember these remember these
when i collect my thoughts i recollect
ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix
somebody stole my piece of chicken
prince poetry
pharoahe monch
little suzy may robinson used to play
i said to myself please oh please reverend now would
but there's not one piece of chicken on the table left
well i expect to find it when i get home or else
out like a sucker repeat 4x
sometimes i swear i think about robbing 'em
for her fing finger yes i used to bang her
just to stress a nigga quick young she's on a ego trip
loved to cover her neck for stress gave her a cat as a pet meow
out like a sucker repeat 4x
what can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club
that we get em confused
where sodomites get all the rights
the devil say the end is the beginning
told the truth to get what i want but shot it with no shame
where me and my niggaz surpassed the flow
something's gotta change
for the robbin crew thinkin they robbin you you must be cautious
as the candidate keeps flippin niggaz dippin
psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
friday's are tight but saturday just makes it old
trees bright and green turn yellow brown
by not bein ourself
i say stand up on deception of time all of revelations
just face this mindstate
them hooks like sellin dope to black folks
the southern slang figure ways and mojo chicken wangs
like memories of yesterday
you catchin the wrong vibe packin yo' shit and rollin yo' eyes back
like soap is to lather we come clean
like some eagles people dont understand
musical interlude 2x
feat big rube
nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get our meat
known as mankind
my memories of yesterday
my stomach cant digest it even when i bless it
so go 'head and diss it while real hop hippers listen

oh like liberty bells yes them bullets keep on rangin
in your raps mercedes benz and all your riches
voice of andre fades in
a bad note aint no bad note

in case of physical breakdowny'all can break now

put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
style that i'm doing they might ruin
when i'm see i'll keep a freestyle going steadily
no interruptions til the mic is broke
it's been a long time i shouldnt have left you
it's a 4 letter word when it's heard it control
i start to think and then i sink
grab the mic like i'm on soul train
take the mic make the people respond for
so upset that i'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
constant elevation causes expansion
i'm not bold just cuz i rock gold
it aint where you're from it's where you're at
the rough gets going the going gets rough
any stage i'm seen on i'm like a phenom
empty
and see all there is to see before
then i take a thought around the world twice
for miles i thought and i just fought the people
in every borough nobody's stopping me
be calm keep a low pro and play the background
when i had sex i left my name on necks
i'm from the ghetto
get strong on the island recoupe and lay around
i get cock d liffin forty's of beer
bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
dead bodies are found throughout the town
i attract attention people like to peep
areas in fear but this here's a fear
keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
sprayed wit automatics they wet me up
all you hear is screams when i'm hit by the laser beams
empty
and i keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt
peep em as i keep em eager to listen
live and direct on stage instead of the
empty
cause they participate and applaud me since
my voice is moist and plus mellow
high pitched like a tweeter deep beats start to beat her
to stay
you lay like sade it feels like paradise
empty
all i wanna hear is yea rakim go
almost complete
time to get it on kick along
put him on the floor let his heart feel the boom
the mic's a remote control and i'm pointing it at cha
a penll send adrendaline to ten
now kick it wit a beat
that gets visual
kick along x2
time to bulid my juice back up
here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
putting brothers to rest like elliot ness
tried to put shame in my game to make a name i'm a
so come say hi to the badguy
living life too close to the edge
read my resume she's know i'm 'ready cool
in a puddle of blood i lay close to the edge
now what the trigger say
while i'm lettin this fifi get wit me
'cause i'm real fast
i let the rhythm hit 'em
crippled ya third eye
i'm untouchable
when i see a crowd of
i line 'em up
so respect 'em
let it hit 'im
mc's grounds are neutral
attention follow directions real close
he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
'cause i prefixed it
then remain let it radiate
hold 'er mold 'er make 'er feel older
bring a bullet proof vest
lyrics let up when lady say dont lose me
they want the r hit
runnin out of ammunition
followers will become leaders
cut like a lumberjack
music is louder
educated punch lines that
why try to bar me
since he brought his main man wit' 'im
tonight if the rs on the mike
the prescriptions one every hour
ideas for the ear to fear
if i slow up they'll catch up hell no
ya hit the ground burnin and woke up frostbit'
whisper i wanna reach her intellect
i'm rated rthis is a warning ya better void
music's the clue when i come your warned
pumping lyrics of fury
then the beat is hysterical
i bless the child the earth the gods and bomb the rest
lyrics of fury
i'm a tear you apart but i'm a spare you a heart
i'm never dying terrifying results
seen a all world covered girl i said hey lady i'm
i said my name is ra and this is eric b
a pill that'll heal ya pain 'cause i'm real
and surprise her she's liver and much more wiser
fck around and miss the show
so i said let's go
wanted my agony agony ag on y in her bod y
i knew she was in the mood for somethin
they tried to take it and say that i'm too small
dont it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
spread the word 'cause i'm in
unawareness beware it's the reanamator
by any means neccesary this is what has to be done
ladies and gentleman you're about to see
so close your eyes and hold your breath
my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate
is this the best that you can make
microphone check the tone to get started
i'm the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise
when all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure
contact is compact when i bust
sumpin and pumpin and slobbin and droolin
maybe later youre gonna be
distance i kept ou better watch your step
embalmed with fluid
maybe what youll find somewhere over the rainbow
go manufacture a match send me after a blast
as i memorize advertise like a poet
and i'll break when i'm through breakin i'll leave you broke
you shouldnt have told me you said you controlled me
i wouldnt a came and said my name and run same weak shit
when i approach i exercise like a coach
extra event the grand finale like bonus
i take 7 mc's put 'em in a line
so many rhymes you wont have time to go for yours
eric b made a cut and advertised it
mc you'll beat the r i'll say oh never
neighborhood to support ya
try to concentrate maintain then elevate
competition is none i'm the soul survivor
three fourths of water makes seven seas
when i translate the situations straight
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
rainin on rappers there's no parade
eye inside no extended version
you bite like a parasite you attacks
check your engine and ask your engineers
and you'll remain backstage
sprayed up he said he was gonna do what
fill her with life until she burst with energy
not to be hot to trot by a haunt
that you dont scratch your cuts in the grave
no intermissions cause it aint commercial
i cant stop
i cant stop
check this out since we talking over
i need money i used to be a stick up kid
a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
'cause my girl is definitely mad
empty
more volts than a lightning bolt handle with care
they couldnt get warm gimme a cut
if you try this your response is tonsilitis
you cant destroy the decoys so detour
this is for thousands of people who came
sneak in the back door lookin for the stage
eric b clap your hands cut and scratched x8
soon as i stop you had enough of
i got a tip of my own and i dont sing
the chance to put actual facts on wax
rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
microphone your majesty no one's bad as me
instead of goin with the flow like you're supposed to go
women i give 'em pain and still soothe
the day is kind of off but i can get it on
no more crimes i got rhymes and it pays
to the max it's in depth it attacks but it's relax wit pep
blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
relax wit pep it's relax wit pep
pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
i said i'm tight from a real long flight could you soothe me
we wish you didnt have to leave no more
fly ladies in the house all screamin awww yeah
i set up hips like domino chips
double oh seven is back
better hope my mic dont blow again
so track the wack at the right and exact could
format collapse your lungs twist your tongues
no obituary and nothing left to bury
strategy that'll be tragic automatically
the days in the park when rap was an art then
then you've got seven minutes to vacate the
brother like me
empty
cause i already got light
so hand in your application
go 'head and flow cause i close the show
so bring a dictionary so you can look it up
cause sellin drugs is for handicaps
you got lost and couldnt go on
driftin up the creek without a beat or a paddle
see if you can step to this
so absorb the song til the rhyme's all gone
three hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
when we reach the top dont stop risin
with run on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
just step the rhymes create energy
dance without hopin that this come on next
eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab without a mic to grab
nature's balance is way off balance
but he dont want to hear it it's out of the question
i parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
understand the words in this song

but you're raggedy and i'll be glad to see
i've been waitin to dog you and now you're mine
but i'll play the awesome defense
nowadays on the radio man you call that shit hip hop
at times i feel like my back's against the wall

producers makin tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
i thank y'all for makin more room for us uhh

dj tommy hill he got positivity
ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman

we're kicking wannabes down cause we're gonna be down
knowledge wisdom and peace are what i'm true to
like a prophet i'll drop it premier will start to seal
cause you've been preparing to move you'll be certain to lose
verse 1 guru
i'm the reason why your aim is missed
this mic in my hand i'm rulin
youse a liar that's whack put up or shut up
we gettin love on y'all block
but i'm back ha fresh out of the max
young bodies in the coffin more often
the question remains which mc's will reign
this is a battle rhyme in case you havent noticed
they cant deal with the realism
so umm there's no need to worry
you can study for years and be the world's top scholar
ask yourself the same question
and yea though i walk through the valley from brooklyn to cali
the question remains which mc's will reign
riot act this is where we really prepare
put you under with one rap me and the brothers have come back
they got teargas helmets and clubs knahmean
they forgot so we gotta let 'em know again
reperations for us blacks hell yeah they need to come with that

so now you be lyin flat cause this is the riot act
shit it's that ol g flavor
it dont matter you dont have to be likin me man
d block gangstarr leave you right where you stand what
as soon as the chrome scope him right there two in the dome

about the situation for today's youth man the seeds man
then the sins of the father will visit the children
verse 1 guru
we're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
i meant to elevate at every venue
cause systematically they gettin greedier and greedier
for those who cant follow that spells guru when in my circle
gangstarr represent
products and puppets and pawns gettin played out
check it the ground be hot under our feet
wherever i go
my honey annoits me with oils g
and to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
i have to stand out from all the rest
i want the public to know what goes on
and ronnie's self interests had him livin in a different world
there aint nobody to trust
dissension can occur from within one's ranks
take you under my wing it dont matter god
premier scratching guru samples
as a little nigger broke thinking soda and coke
h staxx
i'm the truth give you proof and your video shoot
empty
the name the set you rep connects you get
since you aint wanna let niggers eat
and let's see if the gimmick last until the next season
and this is how the story goes
but sticking you and taking all of your money
it looks big but they aint staring
and one said yo you wanna make this to a homicide rap
it was nothing he did it just to get a rep
he could pop you in check without a getaway car
they got their eye on the gold chain
give up the rolex watch or you wont see another day
took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
he pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
desire to get you on up to step to
pure is my thought my spirit is my heart
if i dislike you i may not hate you
your hand and then i'll serve you like an infant
you're quite immature and you sound very boring
knowledge knowledge knowledge echoes
but hey i dont want to miss this
screamin that i spend more time with friends
how come our love isnt lasting
verse 2
stepped up and asked me to come to
about havin trust
i coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
you're crazy fake it's more than skills you be lackin in
my karma creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
slice precise like fenny hanas when i come to bring the dramas
size me up and you will find nothing's larger
tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
behind that gat that bust quiet ya with the silencer
ever since young krumb was taught to rap well
they will take you sedate you and i will stress upon
my fate is to be cold makin history
these are the words that i manifest i manifest
the brother who must live and give with much insight
with all the stress and the strife so god bless your life
hoped to be dope as me id you flee
no way you'll never make it
and all the suckers get pushed back when i'm kickin real facts
niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
and they all know how i feel
because i dont need gimmicks
we mus face de moment of trut baybe
or burn you lessons are blessings you should learn through
always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
it's best to step back and observe with couth
dark clouds over my head my heart's racin
my only crime was that i'm too damn kind
and the truth shall set you free
i reign as the articulator with the greater data
the king of monotone with my own throne
first chorus
sucka boy get off my shit
you're not a threat to myself and neither to my staff
bless my soul i control
they get sprung and most of them dont recover
then come back and people still know gangstarr
empty
and i'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
and never had no problems getting women
verse 2

yo yo gu rizzi yo

the dj's name is premier and i'm the guru echoes
that mind moldin brother
my celly rings often cuz i got the goods
it's just that we are here to adjust your phony attitude
the plot just thicken and you've been stricken like polio
chorus x2
switch up change up yo pull the range up
i pop your top off as if you were the bottle
that means a lot of rappers they should stay away from here
i've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
from new york straight talk america's best
you're just a scavenger you dont live this life everyday
but gangstarr could be a threat in new york we rep
chorus guru
just like some dutches now see i'm hard to define
yeah bring some real shit yo
my survival package as i deal with reality
cause it's never too late to set this fuckin record straight
you're just a nice girl in the wrong place
but something about you got me pushing up tight
you're just a nice girl in the wrong place
you're intelligent similar to angelo
remembering your face like this my henney chase like this
you holdin it down for your whole fam
what you doing in a place like this
big shug give a nigga pain
bustin heads body bags and toe tags
big shug give a nigga pain
with a lust for the gravy you know the god must be crazy
you're gonna need more than a lot of tattoos on y'all
freddie foxxx
i'm a warrior niggaz screamin bumpy shot cyrus
'cause your soul was bought for what they payin
i'm one of the best yet
so that's all for you i'm whiping out your whole team
save it and hold that you catch a hot one
full clip
since back in the day i held the weight and kept my head up
catchin rep off my name your bound to fry
face the consequence of your childish nonsense
i hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
had your girl on her knees give her a taste of life
how many albums i'ma have to drop
empty
why whassup i'm on my way to the airport now
but i'm too fly i'ma change this scenario
the da says they got me on a felony
what's the story what happened when i went to la
peace to my man hass and orange man payin the cost
whether you got naps braids waves or no hair
and as i sit feelin the pain in my wrist
plane lands
you stabbed me in the back you duck and now you're soon to be
he's shockin again this is the season for breezin with reason
in lame games with phony dames too busy buildin my fortress
no more mr nice guy
i never let up so get up i'm fed up and i dont care
ahun so think about it while you're messing up clown
'cause every second another dream is destroyed wit
accomplishments are achieved off lots of gifts
and i knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
and all the soft silly suckers i'ma wet them
making the suckers and weak brothers cower
you better get a job quick
and just how to get it word up
rejected oh well she aint goin to no hotel
she knows what she wants 2x
you best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
she knows what she wants 2x
four she was my cheri amore yeah right
i know what i want and just how to get it
she knows what she wants
shrimp and lobsters champagne and mobsters
she craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
it's the lesson well learned
why son she's trying to get paid check it
sizing up the situation keeping honies waiting
it's skills krs one
skills gang starr duelin again rulin again
we the gulliest fuck it then it's us against y'all
skills top rank point blank we vital
if your man left the joint in the whip then tell him go get it
most significant once again chuck d some old slick shit
skills it's the music that the street love
plus the road is tough especially when you roll with us
skills gang starr duelin again rulin again
i'm right in your streets like i'm urban outreach
my lines illuminate your whole spectrum
cause you aint my fuckin homeboy
you're faking making people think that you're a true mc
so i grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
mike rhone chillin like capone
for this was a night to remember
a riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
and if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
verse 1 jeru the damaja
peace new york hops it gets no rougher
so lil dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out
last year i was the man ripping up every jam
before i start to get in it better yet i just kick it
now i'ma touch on reality chumps cant fuck with me
and i know i break your back with my rap like smack
but yo you know they've got no voice
i'll break 'em all
i can take you there and then
think they got a reason that aint really sure
think about it and stay tuned
then dissolve like specs of dirt
fully clad and glad to find a cause i wont pause
battle drills and watch your bladder spill
quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
cause battles and wars and much fights i have been through
and suckers can jet cause i wreck once you step in the arena
is foolish utterly i mean but none'll be
dj premier cuts the phrase step inside my arena
before we all fall and get left far behind
mc's be fakin so now they get taken
one verse to coerce your girl to prostitution
until there's no fake chumps left
when i unleash my speech i'll have you punk rappers open
a few of my crew members like to pack guns
got more hoes in my dick than you can fit in the garden
i'm not a sucker so i dont need a bodyguard
positive is the mindstate but it could still mean that
you've got no leads so you shoot blanks
your song's boring and so i'm scoring
empty
mc's like me will rise like the enterprise
cause you thought your off brand jam was the best
as i roll uphill they roll downhill faster
cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
the pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
this aint no threat so take it personal
but bear in mind that you cant think as quick
you're like a daytime talk show and that's low
phillies are cool but they burn much quicker
empty
so the la la can enhance our minds
and around the way there aint no shame in our game
talkin bout i got a broken taillight
shit i know model citizens that aint squeaky clean
some prevail most see jail this happens always
the most influential men got influential friends
croocked cats that confiscate the gats they keepin 'em
i'm already in too deep so forget it dont try
gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
of their lives and that aint the way to go out
like i said i'm an ill kid so never dare test me
an example of hard times
it's like the good the bad and the ugly
but you gotta check the move cuz there's a reason
you try to flex muscle but you know you cant hang ha
cuz now i'm past the point and i aint gonna return
we'll be doin it at the mall
ballin cop some charles jordan and some icebergs
yo dont be mad at me i used to be
fightin four cases in north face of dolemite
got the movie rented if the crew be with it yo
victoria be whisperin mad secrets in my ear
stylin on the cell phone smilin it's my world
in this business of rep
the more lies you sell then by surprise you fell
full clip
learn that if you come against me son your gonna have to pray
more than a decade of hits that'll live forever
i dont know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
i'm ready to flip yeah i'm ready to get with all that cash
equations or phrases cause i begun some
and vocalizing techniques emcees are deadbeats
i gotch u
take it from me then you will see i got the g
dont sweat it sit down clown and just let it be
too gold too bold too fly for them to stop
and i've been out here and yes i've seen you
but you know i got things under control
if i dont get my way you're history
and i aint taking no shit from no sucker nigga
being broke nah i cant fuck wit it
in the shadows of the others gettin mellow with the brothers
but i'm still a peace seeker
come check me baby dont underrate me
and improve and bust a move
then go against me boy dont even tempt me
my man gots that gusto word
then if you want you can go call your people
you aint a writer nor a fighter you're just a biter
the truth exposer the hardcore composer
and here's some advice you cant rap this nice
just like a timberland it's the guru and premier
up to this level or should i say caliber
here and gone in a flash some made cash
but some find happiness while others find sorrow
the gameplan i will smartly take over
to cut up your butt up so what up you cant team
they're tight a brother's like the wack type
i'm on a mission you're in a mental prison
dj premier in deep concentration once again
in a meat freezer we'll seize you then sqeeze ya
think and take a drink i'm a lyrical brother
and put that monster in my hiney hi ney
i come through your block with that one eye whistle
imitating the beat when i bust a nut it say
yeah them studio pranksters lookin at the situation plainly
dj premier cuts and scratches
way to the waters of a motion
and fuck all the showbiz put up the he aligned divine save you
i say people people come on and check it out now
bust one round in the air for this here
i'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
so now now it is my duty to
yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man
everytime you riff
i guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
dead souls i greet
took heed to what he said
verse 3 jeru the damaja
but i incite a riot
dirty rotten scoundrel and my name is jeru
i'm not sure about any of these names
empty

and more than a gangster 'cause i kill wit a mic check
and when the mic stands free i then step to the
dissing the ones wit the fame and claiming they're hard
and me i got a treasure chest
and you better move 'cause the groove is like deadly
guru while they devise our demise we grow wise
with the will and the strength of a million men
come against me on the mic many and most will lose
verse 2 hannibal

baby show me the best time of my life
i saw her right there just the other night
when we lied about the beautiful time to come
prepare for the lowest standard
make no mistake
against the wind
when the beauty and the miracle of new life
lies of self indulgent pride
with so few actions so many words
there will be no peace
and look beyond
this useless praise
my existence will not be dictated like a reading from a book
take my arms that i might reach you
as blood to heart
flesh is predisposed to die
poured myself out
yet i want to be held by anyone
i was not born as what i have come to be
it is not who i am
in peace
breathe easy friend
i may very well be the strongest man
of impulse and self indulgence
born from this soil
let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams
there is a need for faith
i drink from the grail and war with the immortals
i must inspire while i live
where everything important to me
singin jibberish
the way you thought no one ever would
accept this pretty package named friend
friendships are weak and nothing is dear to me
staring at the reflection of failed attempts at love and a black heart
the act is contemptible
how i have learned to wield this scorched jet blood
may this blood pave the way to solution
developing an even more insatiable thirst for chaos
let this be my refusal to fit in
a product of conceit so absorbed and vain that he thinks himself divine he
will bring forth reparations of the most severe degree
my soul is free from weakness
my heart is open this slate is clean
empty
beggin for forgiveness and your sympathy
empty
fight without purpose
the beautiful moment of song and passion
to arms
for life is weary without song or sound of harps
only instead reflections of a rippled self
moving through self degradation
he has failed where others
suffering knows no end
why should time be any different than life
his endless misfortune
sway my temper's balance
the strings so carelessly attached to me
and i have a lifetime left to learn
indeed i have grown cold
we would truly know winter
i bang and let your fuckin brains hang snitches
pointed hollow point shit
pour the cristal on the way to trial rico law
my two cannons blast niggaz ass niggaz
bling bling it's a bad boy thing
make ya popular
what type of nigga stay in the trump for weeks bad boyz
prolific words i speak for the unheard
it is what is either graveyards or consecutive life bids shit
a couple of mils and good attorneys
verse 3
and all we got is sports entertainment or the streets
just walkin uh in ya chin chilla fur
and ya diamond cluster to much just to touch ya

eyes of lust and dreams of black

lost in the darkness strangers on the loose
some say yey some say no but in the end
sittin in a streetcafe in barcelona

everytime she gave me those eyes
in my little hide
maybe if i could see exactly what was in your way i'd move it for you
i am still afraid
i can only give you everything i've got
the final word in the final sentence you ever learned to me was love
first kiss and the first time that i felt connected to anything
i might be a little closer to you
to come through with a plan
with a spoon and a bowl
of the music in your soup
and the third encore
i am so too
just for a while want to
my body is aching it feels like it's wearing me
no one has hurt me so much you say
faces all screwed up like what i'd done
running away seemed like the easy thing to do because i wanted time
when you come would you please bring a knife
you left your door wide open
cause i love you so much
keep it with me always in my mind
fire light fire light fire little fire light
i only know it's a matter of time
to come into my life
only in dreams could it be this way
and a love that will survive
wont you come into my life

buried deep in the telegram
you would never know
your breakfast will get cold
just save your energy
the best thing that i have
empty
i wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it

whenever she's happy is worth every minute that we've saved ourselves
one song
one song
and i'm dreaming of
like saturns rings
are you beginning to get get my point
and it's beginning to get to me
cos i can carry you on my back
we need to feel breathless with love
it didnt even work
i do it alright in my own way
you've been the only thing that's right
louder louder
even if you cannot hear my voice
have heart my dear
the curtains drawn the winter sun
treat it as a test x2
i'm in love with you
and it's not her
i'm in love i'm in love i'm in love
there is no peace that i've found so far
and sets me down in your warm arms
i lay down on the cold gound
learn to wear each other well
and the world feels like graves of dirt
while i was rooted fast to the earth
you are my signal fire
we'll find our love anew
wage your war
you leave me numb and i'm not sure why
and i fell in love with everyone i saw
he can get any i'll bet
i watch him on tv each day
i dont give a toss about what he has to say for himself or anyone for that matter
it's like the finish line where everything just ends
thanks to julia james for submitting

sheeting tears for my peers and all this shit we facing
gangstas playing double dare aiming techs

in the days as a youngster at the quick snap
fuck pickle jars and mayonnaise too

formed from the candle light shadows
all of the things i been tryin to forget about
every single tear shed every single smile

time is toured not poured like on the concorde
with girls vip smoking

gunshots then car screeches off
and channels desert rats and camels reptiles and mammals

i meditate in the mere top of skyscrapers
beautiful virgin release every burden i travel when i preheated
from east to west and from north to south

ohh ma ma ma ma ma
it passed the moon to the earth then from the womb to nurse
from atoms to adams from atoms to adams
so i begin between the media right now walk like christ
ahhh enabled me to see the other galaxy released nora calories
i have the privilege the see the pyramids
walking from to saigon to lebanon to the walls of hong kong
as we glide through the windows of the far side
from atoms to adams
chorus repeat 2x
i searched for the truth since my youth
and dropped a jewel like solomon but never followed men
but we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
for years religion did nothing but divide
the earth is already in space the bible i embrace
before i converted i was perverted and knowledge was asserted
blessed with the tongue of hebrew
and wisdom is the principle thing for kings and queens
slaves to a mad pleasure building great architectures
dreams of a scholarship ended by a hollowtip
observin all the clinics and liquor spots
empty

and only showed bad taste
and you a toto doing promos along with the scarecrow
burn and break and intimidate
i look sinfully been doing this for centuries
yo i wanna know what's goin on
this whole week buildings with no heats
cold embraces
used to pass over brooks of qe'ron
in palestine there would drink ballentine
from then till now from then till now from then till now
what's the difference between the ghetto and death row
but now we spray paint initials on the wall
verse 1
i write pain
i do this shit for my thugs
raise a eyebrow at the child respectfully bow
clappin at the spaceship
masada bleedin in the hands of medics
dont say nothin pull my weapon and shoot
a mother pacing by her window pane
reminding d's of a classic mob hit
he like yo what the fuck
see my icon straight faced with a torn robe
killah priest
fightin for sovereignty
complaining that their handcuffs are too tight
killah priest
a dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch
the mind heavy mental jesus christ is heavy mental
from out the physical bondage the thought
now we searching for the mental treasure pleasure
and travel through a extreme draft
and explode through the mysterious black holes
repenting from our filthy ways replenish for our guilty days
that's supersonic passing the comets star clusters
meditating to the soft note of a violin
now the only time heavy mental
player mine faster than prayer or pass me the ozone layer
cause different ships mountains and cliffs planet shifts
armored tanks stay focused i get ferocious
chorus 2x
neglect the moon of a light turn the sun beige
from which i was made my bones rot and decay
protect my body from the tabernacle of robbers
kill 'em with torment let the beast rise that lies dorment
if we die of another mans ignorance
may i sleep with the ancient
lookin unusual may the earth choke and spit up my coffin
i move through the dark rages and wont stop
i give them a good night's rest
i blow your head off when i talk chop off your arms
debut not told to crawl so walk on by
tomorrow hopes based on the horoscopes
upon the brazen altar six men
days of violent standing in a haunted palace
my place to birth strong gave me the eye
if you dont know now you know
masada the beloved
flow melodic droppin coals gettin dough from out your pockets
chorus x2 killah priest
inside these damn near tore 'em apart
information literature thiefs on the run where ya gonna hide
watching us like we're squirting a suburban 666 database investigator
from deep within my wardrobe imbrase the cross road we once wore gold
out telephone conversations will be automatically wire taped
when the truth comes down upon you you will have to to decide
a man what's his name
i will go among the people
girl yo watch it yo what everybody runnin for
girl hey yo yo
people screaming
put whiskey in your soda or vodka
now deliver the vials fat found in the pile in the stack
but he was afraid of the height glazed at the light
let's take a trip travel through the mind
your career it's over
of the focus and roast energy toward the enemy
fill it with gunpowder came build sun power
it seem you wanted to cross to smitten
blood and crips be thuggin it
pack da gat for armageddon
cold in the night chasing the light
black p stone solider knows ya follow ya then fold ya hold ya
you dont know me i'm a og
throws his body in a deep hole
swinging a double edge sword trying to stay the beast
yo yo yo ugh ugh
supposed to be a man switch sides like cross faders

mans bargaining with fallen angels but he dies in his sin
the cosmic light of the slums
project hallways fulled with broke niggaz
project temples with shattered windows
priest modern day shakespeare
or line us up kill for the kindness
thee unconscious acts of the soul
where do we go from here things going on word shooting up
it's the end of the road it's like the red moon
screaming life is what you make it so called fake friends
my sword would drink the blood of an un believer
my home is where the physco rage spending long nights and cold days
where the air stays hot and misty i see crack fiends with rotten titties
i dropped the tek out my hand dropped to the earth
we love amongst the
intro killah priest killah priest in background of his intro
captured by some patriots and thrown on slave ships
down from under rose and fled to grow in hunger now it's cold in summer
your arms too short to box with god

the president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of haiti
understand the jewel brought to the 50 states

that flooded the project lobbys cold degrees
some say fuck it and start takin shit
killah priest
and keep sinnin till the game stop
you need your ass split maybe that will save you from that casket

niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion
and leave breadtracks
which is always competitive therefore

showing all teeth like a walrus began running through the forest
the greatest lyricist known to man or mankind
i give you static like a cellular with dead batteries

1 yo yo yo they got the lights on that's the cops

and it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
chorus 2x
nefrettiti's in the house
and like for real i never liked no superficial hero

then ask who's next and ask who wrecks
a quick blast for the buck
to all my people with the funk where ya at
steel
to the records on felts your earwax melts
the man at the top of the needle drop
new technic turntables the party i wreck
recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
on your radio pull out your aerial
marley yo that is
g how much it run you
a convertible porsche is what i'm striving to drive
operator your call cannot be completed at this time
tires made from pirelli getting all of the heinies
dope cars
started committin murder after murder
it's bout whose draw is quicker
started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
got back on crackin i let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
keep it real on the street
and he goes by the name of dj polo see
a professional performer wheels of steel trainer
my recital will form a musical brainstorm
fan fascinator i supply data
see it's a demo
the microphone fanatic cause i'm the asiatic
i take a scene to the extreme
cause my fury is scary
who macks the most shit smoke ya whole clique like roach spliffs
swift with the words well
the main crime wave
rackateerin prostitution and paid execution
pile this paper longer than malice from ney york to dallas
from out the darkest shadow
empty
to shake or bake or flake cause i never fry
cause i'mma get crazier than crazy eddie
nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
cant wait to peep my profile on paper mate
i might be cool but i'm far from a fan
and then build a skyscraper
my ideas overload
prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
sleep while you knock z's i'mma clock g's
for a strong foundation of wheels of steel
so take caution if you want to know the truth
empty
if you're still hard of hearing i'mma scrub them with ajax
mandatory for the auditory and its glory
get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
for reaching the goal and the dream wouldnt you want to be in it to win
yeah poison
i'll turn the mike's last name into tyson
g rap is a terror not a error and never will i stop reaching for better
biz markie dj cool v tj swan big daddy kane
you big fat sap sucker
receive my command and follow our orders
complete the beat and end it splendid
cause under x ray they are parkay
that's how the record starts motivating
record rotation forms a revolution
when i was five years old i realized there was a road
all my manpower for four bucks an hour
dreamed about it for five years straight
people hungry for the blast that dont even last
collecting scars from little neighborhood wars
a thug a mugs for drugs he eventually bugs
that means dead in other words deceased
plus caps to cops policeman drops
rough in the ghetto but in jail he's jello
not my lifestyle so i made a u turn
the things we used to do and how we used to act
given a chance for romance until the sunlight
if it is then god then bring it back again
but when i wake up i'm the same love slave
so i race in space and try to replace the pretty face
now all i got is total confusion
see what i'm saying
give me a pen a typa writer then
lyrics blast out or leave it will cast out
kool g rap makes you wonder
so called mc's will freeze so cold
their latest release x2
dj's relax kneecaps collapse
treat them like your son in the butcher shop
they reported his fins on 1010 west
horror terror errors zero
not a sinner or an mc beginner
m yo that is real real fonkee yo yo what up g rap
all what word
with a amg kit in his pockets a mitt
or traveled beyond the service area
all the seats are stitched and hemmed mcm and gold rims
i knew a youngster met him at 14 a very short scene
slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
died at the age of 17 brooklyn east new york legend
then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
when i found out another soldier died in the territory
people in the audience kool g rap is my name
i supply the data he's the wheel operator
the maker and creator of the lyrical line
the performer recites competitors ignite
i activate a musical device
better than a snicker when it comes to a snack
ly suffer as i suffocate then i start to alienate
so dont even quote what you write is dolt
go ahead and dare me if you think i'm joking or playing
no mo' shifts i hold enough chips to toast criss
kicked up enough dust to hurt cells
get your mind grazed
my corporations body casin watch where you pacin
bodies get dropped while i attend the opera
i'll spark this barrel
smoking so bad i'mma cause a pollution
silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
of course polo's the boss of the crossfader
give me a prince and i'mma a show you a g wiz
donate it to science to answer the unexplained
definitely def the five fingers of death
just enter the place to see the entertainer
rhymes like thieves will seize enemies
polo works the crossfader he's a bricklayer
listen to the sound dont dare look down
those who act courageous you will get nauseous
you're a slave to my sound wave
g speaks in a new technique of fury
shut the hell up man
biters are wanted like animals hunted
check it out
material stitch by stitch for decoration
g rap will make you feel the real deal
my manager fly ty mr magic my dj polo
musical outcome lyrical tantrum
this is hip hop your optical nerve
with the rhymes that i express
in no position to be official
poetical recital is vital and tragic
it corresponds to the message i've sent
never took a break never made a mistake
shoes are scoffed cos the road gets rough
the road aint yellow and there aint no witches
gettin richer and richer the police took my picture
and if provoked i let the pistol smoke
the squealers tells but the dealer still sells
bombs were planted the kids were kidnapped
troopers soldiers rollin like boulders
one court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate
pushin all buttons pullin all switches
because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
but now the reflection is gone and i cry out
i need a love mate so i can create
she loves me she loves me not
now i whisper how much i missed her
my life is bitter the memories glitter
yo sometimes you just gotta let go man
with diction sparked from friction
wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
effort for the method meditation
if you're a square you freeze into an ice cube
i'm hot as a tamale on fire
and the mind is the real main course
to handle a man
and yet i like 'em old fashioned
scintillating sultry stimulating sexy
but i'll always love a true fan
i'ma rapper but i dont rap
i'll give you something you can feel
since the day i was born i was on a mission
with arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
as a teen i was on the scene cleaner than clean
i wasnt diggin for niggas so brother dig deep
but i beat the game but it was war boy
i heard some brothers say he aint the best
on turntables i'm able to start a movement
other mc's i want you to know
y does the things that i do
yeah moe dee is coming moe dee is coming
just gimme a pound cause i'm a bad bad bad mutha
i'm cyanide deadly and lethal
ask em who's the best their shoulders start shruggin
some things i wont do and here's an example
expressing verbally or if it's
stimulating emmulating heat that's corally
now i was never solo i was always in a group
i could go on and on and on and on for days
ha ha ha this time it's over boy
you still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
you swallow it yea finish burp
how can one man be so dumb
your brain of fatigue you're out of your league
so who's got no style look at your profile
the man who lost one one too often
empty
i'm that type of guy oh my god
label ledger left the leper liar
yo tell 'em how you fell l hard as hell
talking to me like i'm a kindergartian
cause i'm a treat you like beaver on a basketball court
they're materialistic and unrealistic
like a mechanic all i do is bodywork
and i bet you think i'm fronting but i tell you i aint
all you ladies seem to sing the same old song
maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is
about a homeboy from back in the day
one thing went wrong rick got obsessed
d d d du dumb dumb
he'd hound em like a dog so we used to say fetch
i'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
he hustled on the streets cause he had no choice
the people on the streets he was workin for
funke funke funke
make a little money now you wanna tell me how you're livin
with or without money with funke funke wisdom
from birth to earth and earth to re birth
funke funke funke
take the 1st power elevate to the 3rd
funke funke funke
no matter who you are
the fu man chu
but if ya steppin watch ya step
trying to burn me
meanwhile laughin all the way to the bank
because the rhymes i made
and i aint sniffin nothing but
coming out of their pockets for me to rock it
i'll make apollo's ryhmes sound like
i aint a myth
lack of knowledge
telling you the truth
i aint a mandate cause
treating me like more
not only the youth
i was walking down the street rocking my beat
as soon as i finished i lost my poise
woke up fussing yelling and cussing
now i know why her ex boyfriend dave
he turned and said in a real deep voice
if i see another girl and i get an erection
kool moe dee's in the house again
i got a funky beat to let you know
it's hard to rock a party when you're lyrically advanced
verse 2
intellects get it and others want the beat
there's no need for the profane rap
to be known as the great
if you cant relate just clap your hands
i make miracles happen
that is so essential
if he's a sucker
just when i wanna
yo man
and check the clock
with each letter it becomes visibly better
the base and a taste of who's the ace
is anything short of stupendous
and if it's weak when i'm done
so hard it stops ya
like a flurry
so stay awake
if you're slow
must be new to this
i go to work
rhyme loaded
at my rate
boom and there goes ya
a zone that's hidden
am i a genius
to run for cover
me blowin up in your face
i'm blowin up
who yell out
you'll run out of gas
my reign is the longest
blow 'em up
empty
like a lame
where's your focus
how to get paid
i'm blowin up
i wont whip ya
because i said i was and always was
beyond nonsense
minds in limbo
you cant find your heart
cause i read minds
neurotic from a narcotic
i hit ya hard
bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
through overt overtures
the rhymes that cut like an uppercut
to mess your head up
then you fall in a dopefiend nod
you'll fail the exam
that you just cant live with
to make green so
with the rhyme i know
in that class
knowledge and wisdom
message divesting all men from
for the weak who seek power it'll bring
stop the music
party and dance
weak in the mind
so eject it
by the serpent's sound
and you're brain dead
to understand
instead of the prophets
stonger than any
empty
live bourgeios
lookin at the pretty girls and the things he'd love to have

he was little jon
homicide on 116th and eighth
it's alive and killin and the star is a villain
the feeling is high but the high dont last
he'll hook an innocent baby cause he dont care
your soul cause he'll take the rest
on life you're obsessed possessed and defective
and we're nowhere near the end this is only the beginning
ladies and gentlemen
a fight on the mic you dont want one
suicide wont do it either
hurt like the truth poetic justice
or you might miss the next rhyme ink

this is our ancestors' poetic justice

special shout to melodie
the rain is over and the sun is here
cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead

stand up tall get up and get up y'all
rise with the sun and think with a bird's eye
you see what you want to instead of what you been through
the sixth and seventh is how you elevate it
even though america kill di african
variations of chorus
got to make it know and to pass it down
that's right baby i run the yard
if the party's not enough and you still wanna rock say
i wanna see you at the party we can dance a bit first
you'll be soaken wet and drenched sweaty and ready
cause my rap is strong
and next time you'll bring a friend
turn the corner
i wear shades
better hop in while the light's still red
their daughter
but when i come home
if i'm walking and talking
she didnt want
couldnt drive his benz

execution of a feud formality
for instance
beats that meet the standard of a street credit
and yes i'm legendary also very very

with twenty cents in my pocket i saw the light
well anyway here i am chillin at the party

ghetto lifestyles keep watchin
next day we attend classes and gatherings

take heed to the word that i manifest
a mad crew that's of some benefit to you

redman you know you gots to understand hah whatup love
i rock jams like samsonites with mics
stick out like a tumor for the consumers
sike i can afford it less i slaughtered
so listen very close as i conduct this little study
emancipation is long over due
so in the case of slavery it aint hard
rip the title from off the front of the bible god dont live there
same scripture that whipped 'cha
whether you vote for the lesser of two evils you vote for evil
frankly if they knew you they would understand violence
if you dont repeat the actions of your own success
and that was great so in 1988
lookin back now of course it was bogus
they called me captain human another message was sent
if i play the bitch role they take my shoe
so i go back to the philosopher
1996 it really dont stop
so in 1998 i began to debate
how they gonna really see a hip hop temple
oh i cant forget icy ice lucky lou
so i picked up the mic and i quit my job
rap is something we do hip hop is something you live
street fashion street language street knowledge and street
uhh uhh the idea of living this culture out and taking responsibility
you're artificial by cripple rap is like your pistol
c'mon uhh
and your livest mc will get slain right here
verse three thor el krs one
alright here we go
at the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
area the gun is still hot that i hold
empty
in me but then i put him in a chokehold
the moral to the story isyour addiction to your needs and your
we're coming through
dont call the teacher hah you best be seated
i dont even go to these bullshit kiddie ass clubs
who opened up these thugs from compton to the bricks
they not hot all they do is talk a lot
think about that when you're spittin your raps
empty
uh huh whatchu thought yeah yeah

are you teachin yourself teachin yourself
they dont know that all they know is that show dat
word yeah yeah uh huh yo
throw on any beat i'll be quick to spit first
cause i can turn that red in a mintue a ight
a doo rag a platinum chain dont make you a thug

that tough guy talk dont make you a thug
on one you will be asleep
i'm dreaming about being a blunt ho
so im running and racing
now they lit it now im burning by the minute
room is proper im passed off to shabba
and passed me to de la soul

he got one big pull and passed me to smooth b
it's meant to be evidently
through the speaker you're weaker now sit your ass in the back
you know you gots to build just skills uh come on get down
hard is the texture
you listen to the sound well i think you know it's me
so listen very closely to the secret scientist
can i tell them that i really never had a gun
but they aint gettin money like that
you aint got nothin with your life you gamble
instead of following god's word be god's word
krs i create it
the power of your very word is highly underrated
hwc no one can make it
krs i will make it
hwc i will make it cause you're gonna make it
i'm hearing things like you'll be sleeping creeping behind my back
so i can hold you or cut you loose
is it true what they say
probably dead
know ye not that ye must be born again
teach your toddlers not to be thieves and robbers
god is the mother the father the friend
to all my true hip hoppers that pay bills and live proper
it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
so i'm here but are you really ready to face your fears
manifestin another lesson to them true believers
but what's the point if you're gettin locked up
we crush them and they click
what you bringin to the table if you not really able
many people really wanna know from me
and what's funny is that is if you'd just stay focused
others cant get down with it one two three break
all you want is the cash and a hoe in a see through
but a real teacher know when you scarred
like football you'll be runnin back
if you a woman you'll get respect

first and only verse
epedemic lies and deception

iniquity shapen in
an invisible war
the atom bomb is saddam and minister farakkhan
everything else is damned
everybody knows that they've guilty yes

his life so incomplete and nothing can replace it
and while the people sleep too comfortable to face it
wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
singing chorus
preventin me from freedom

everyday's another chance
dulled my senses blurred my sight
for something to happen that just wasnt fated
greater than planets deeper than oceans
verse 1
he's just like the water
spilling over into all i do
he causes my expression to remain
burning to be worthy of his land
he's bathing me
and around
you keep my feet on the ground
but that aint me next time around
kept my feelings underground
i just need you around
i know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
you might win some but you just lost one
i was hopeless now i'm on hope road
never want to face it when it's time for punishment
you just lost one it's so silly how come
trying to pretend like your word is your bond
you might win some but you just lost one
see the road to hell is paved with good intentions
oh ohhh ohh ohhh
exploiting ignorance in the name of love
except the truth about you
please dont entertain me mr intentional
all falls down
it all falls down
high profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
receiving the judge's favor
babylons benefactors
emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
dodging duty for years
blind leading the blind
both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
when the son of podition is commander in chief
internally they absent of light
let him who stole no longer steal
self interest broadway to death
where the majority remains caught
it's the mystery of inequity
'cause nothing even matters at all
nothing even matters at all
nothing even matters to me
i have no time for manicures
'cause nothing even matters no more
naked as the day that i was born i tried to hide
causing me to see only what pertains to me
focused on the shadow with my back turned to the light
submit to truth leave the deception of thy youth
perpetrating we're in covenant with him
oh so repressed so convinced that i was blessed
i am the vine ye are the branches he's in live in me
is an abomination to emmanuel
oh jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
on exactly what an artist should be
how come we aint getting no higher
everything you drop is so tired
writing rhymes my range with the frames slightly tinted
and put your pinky in it then taste it

golden days
just for you
and lies were lies

i've got this feeling down
just say you want to spend some time with me
just come on inside and make this dream reality
you know there's such a place
because i really need you baby
i wake up to the thought of you and i call your name
knowing that i'm not the one you want
with my tender heart
maybe i'll look back and understand some day
my tender heart

but i'm searching for an answer
but i dont want to stay
can you help me make it through

with you goodbye you can leave you can leave
it's time you know that all the things we had that felt so good
i'm putting this on tape baby you're wonderful
sometimes it slips my mind so in case i forget
and no man can ever say he does a woman better than i do you
and still have to ask the same question
now you want it back
why dont it feel like it felt on the first night
no longer got their respect for me
remember what we tripped like
i thought i had just a little more daylight
why dont it feel like it felt on the first night
when we were saying things like where have you been all my life
my love for you
you are the rain
i've got so much love
you need to know
empty
or so i thought
without you this aint a life
i stay up late at night 'cos
not for one year but forever and a day
our love is here
'cause i'm a woman
the love in me
chorus x 2

go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
but any season or reason we cant take it over
i'm patting down with the sound of a general
like a missle i probe and seek many cant critique
who got a life term working for the firm

pete rock on the boot knock on the boot knock
cl the mecca's sweet like nectar maybe 'cause you need it

off the wicked streets of new york trouble
kid from 'life sucks' to 'major bucks' while pete rocks

when the carmel melts you love spots in your poom poom shorts
style is comin sturdy any way you wanna work me
sextafied everyday you gotta know that this live

ever so dont even think about it
they label me a problem child who cant cope
i'm not that popular less than a dollar

pete rock scratches various on and on samples
agreed to meet the maker so i yelled hail mary's
nevertheless i bless follow me and see
mecca is a way of life
though the lyrical dynamo set the flow when i do so
from the whole agenda something to remember
the midnight wrecker return of the mecca
you're comin to me so therefore the program's mecca
and never to be lobotomized the flexin of the stanza
bound to see me swollen like a beethoven
like the new york philharmonic sent to blow melodic

with your sex appeal i'm telling you how i feel shit is real
i know how you want it now what you gonna do when you get it repeat 2x
i try to flex for sex and sex unless i'm sexing you

sending dwarfs back to birth
hail the ravenlord
he would soon be facing the lurkers of time life death
the lurker of time cried out blackheims fooling strategem
stormed over fields with might in hand
coloured my pictures so dusty and old
the oath i swore
i make sure evil will rise
with winds from our northstar striking shores oh so far
striking upon the hillsides
web of moonshine
through moonshine portals leatherwinged serpents fly
long gone spheres of dismal gleam
a landscape in ancient sleep of deathlike silence
to conquer time by possessing immortality
and so it's heardthis became the castle of blackheim
miracles of the undeserted
they are tearing you apart
the puzzling constellation of a deathrune
a darkened dungeon for the pale i seek
unentered and unseen
once there were spirits lurking like serpent tounges
this is the winter of an eternal season of doom
nowhere to hide your time has come
we slept in this room together
i never realized how much i was in love with you
there's a big hole where my heart is
and though sleep leaves me behind
is right here in this room
all you want
i hope you've found that
i'm only hurt by the blows that get withheld
empty
empty
empty
he drank there quietly for a while
i shall return for you my love on christmas day
they're happy for me
and the last words i heard him say
he feels her smile when he's afraid
still hears her key turn in the door
of the only part of life to him that's safe
you're probably doing too much again
you will find me standing by
if you should stop for a while
over here at the side of your life
i wanna go to bed
that says
you have to leave
i slip away and out of sight
when i dont believe in love
if i dont believe in love
so close the blinds and shut the door
when your heart is all i need
oh dont leave home oh dont leave home
a little angel beside you
when she lays in your warm arms
when she lays in your warm arms
when you see her sweet smile baby
'bout a month ago i am a careful hunter
i dont care about apartheid i wouldnt notice if it all get better
so please just for one day i wouldnt talk for you
so please just for one day i wouldnt guess for you
no more trips to grafton street
and leave us two alone
my love i know you're leaving but i will stand here by you
to hear you breathe by my side
all you want
oh you could come home and you would know that
send my regards to her
i wonder how am i still here
i wont leave
but i cant hide
i just want to feel safe in my own skin
with one light on in one room i know you're up when i get home
me go
well i'd be rich beyond my dreams i'm sorry for my weary life
i'm no angel but does that mean that i wont fly
i thought it was strange when your car was found
would he have loved you and not let you down
some days i wanna and some days i dont
that's when it feels and it takes what it needs and it leaves before i get to know
a move not made one made to late army's of words can not hope to contain
lets do the things we normally do
i'm feeling tired too
a fight to have
and say i'm far away
well i deserve nothing more than i get
cuz nothin i have is truly mine
cuz nothing i have is truly mine
but it's not as if i mind
i have no idea what's happened to that dream
while i am so afraid to fail so i wont even try
cos nothing i have is truly mine
been the one to end a war
'cause my heart has found its home
and look no further for happiness
danny's not eating he's drinking and sleeping
but as the sun sets on mary it's rising on him
i've got clothes in case it's hot
my cat at home thinks it's a dog
and a man at home who likes to think
it's my life
my lover's gone
or coming home to an empty house
well i've been gently drifting
and i'm settled now
i felt the same today
i never wanna say it's love
oh and i have returned to the somber grace
under these white northern skies
with you i feel i'm the meek leading the blind
one step too far
dont let no one guide you
i'm with you with you
it's always one step too far
i saw you
its been seven days without a word
i didnt know it would be the last time
and boy is it hard
additional dates they were plannin just fell through
and boy is it hard
but there's fifteen of us in a bus state to state
if these walls cant hold you
his boots no longer by my door
florida's out we fly september 22 to heathrow
the tm recommend sanatogen
god bless
we've done five gigs but we're only in our third state
wo wo
its hard enough to see the world as it is and hold on anything
and it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here
and i need you
to real life where i cant watch sunset
tomorrow's back to work down to sanitation
two weeks away all it takes to change in time around by falling
and you'll have to tell them again and again
and yes they'll ask you where you've been
but it's no more
see the sun again
i thought that i would give it just one more chance
being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know
even on a day like this when you're crawling on the floor
take time to catch your breathe and choose your moment
and it's high time you left it there
if you wont let me fall for you
and if you find one day find some freedom and relief
i'd feel like i belong
the summer's come too soon and i'm still missing you
touch my skinand tell me what you're thinking
give your trust to me and look into my heart and show me show me what you're doing
catch the snow on your tongue and show me how it tastes
it reminds me that it's not so bad
i want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
flowers wont be left in parks work will still be done
i didnt get to say goodbye the day before the day
the sweetest that i've heard
after all the battles and the wars
empty
you'll never fit in your long white dress
drinking beer moon on the left
where's the sense in that
i understand if you cant talk to me again
will be there still
and i wont put my hands up and surrender
what couldnt wait now waits and usually goes away
but listen and think when i say it
being sad and love's not alone
and it's lost to me
i will open my door
i dont need it no more
i want to tell you something
but in a written testimonial i'd say
you cant get inside someone
it's a matter of honour with me
it's just the end of a perfect day
he brought the clouds to my day
you got me over him
no dont let him worry you so
you got it all over him
all over him

penance in putrid decadence
vile tragedy
chastened are the sanguinary
so i say my prayers
cause it just went away
waiting patiently hoping you'll return
around an empty heart
then i promise i'll be there for you always
where there's no one else around me
then he'll send you right back to me
i'm gonna chill to myself
all alone
where i'm all alone
but right now i just think i need to dedicate this song
close your eyes kick your feet up and listen to this song right here
since you took your love away
only you can ease the pain i feel
just one more time for old times sake
and wipe my tears away
you're my angel
never take your love from me

and everybody bum rushing and i'm rushing to get a number
cause uh old man still drinkin his breath still stinkin
and as i reminisce i think about my ghetto bliss
cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
but it was hard cause rhymes dont pay the rent
i saw nothing but family straight up down for me
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
where did i go astray i'm hanging in the back streets
and you'd be crazy too
from the barrel of the smith wesson
aint no stoppin at the red lights i'm sideways
and you could walk a mile in my shoes
peepin out the window alone on my own
'cause all my life i was dirt broke
it was a what type nigga be a thug life nigga
i sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
so wicked that my tracks is wettin niggaz like it's water

chorus x 2
against the wind i'm crying
there's no living without love in my heart
i feel like the hours are there to kill
all night to know all night to know you well
it's gonna take all night to know
there's a chance that we can make it
and i think i got enough
winners take it all
the night beats the day
cant you hear my heartbeat
angel heart oh we'll never break apart
written by chip taylor
then slowly turn away from me
then slowly turn away from me
baby baby baby remember the love you gave me
baby baby baby remember the love you gave me
when we've made love completely
darling with you
closer than my heartbeat he comes
baby goodnight
and when the feeling's right it's right
when the feeling's right it's right
keep me away from where
back home
old folks that i have missed
and i see that home is where my heart belongs
the more she'd look the less she'd find
she's walking down an endless street
repeat chorus
you took me from the shelter of my lover i had never known
like you tried before
hoping soon
empty
before this night is through we're gonna get to the truth
they live their lives alone
before this night is through
before this night is through
it's sayonara tokyo
so many nameless faces and the places i've seen
ha uma porta que um de nos vai ter que abrir
sem limites pra sonhar
when the heat in a woman
oh i wish i could hold you in my arms again
send me your love straight from the heart
oh send me the pillow that you dream on
stood on the shore
he keeps sending me angels
to keep me from crying
so i'll never be blue
here they come a flying
to teach me to fly
sending me angels
i'm the howl at the window
be my sexual
no reservations
be my sexual device
well i wrote you a song played it many times
more than often when i'm with you
shy with you
shy with you
i want you
silent night holy night
you're tired of all the lies
you are just like an angel
you turn to hide in silence
repeat chorus
has everything gone
empty
before i met you
cause when i wake inside myself
with the words that made me stay
what you'll take away from me
i thought about you had to weep
where would you go when i'm not there
and if i had only one wish
someone like you someone like you
empty
some tenderness survives
and hold you endlessly
love was our treasure that no one could deny
look into my eyes for this is how i feel
written by j blake
dont go away
oh i know strange things happen everyday
cause we are strong
cause i know
if we dont make it no one can
a little old fashioned feel good
this girl and that man
landing in the ocean
i got so used to loving you baby
and baby i cant let go
i got so used to loving you honey
i just cant stand it
i put a spell on you because you're mine you're mine you're mine
if i sing you a love song
if i sing you a love song
empty
all my life not a single pearl
baby it's gotta be wrong
to hold you baby once in my arms
so baby if you ever need me again
how's it feel to be a man
if you were a woman and i was a man
if you were a woman and i was a man
would it be so hard to understand
taught me how to show it and it's deeper than the sea
what would i do if i lost you
i wont let you down
i really didnt see
my total dedication built me up to let me down
i'm just a puppet you make me dance and sing
i'm just a lover you walk along the way
i'm just a woman you are the only man
i'm just a woman
i'm just a woman you are the only man
so listen while i tell you
gonna even up the score
that a man could ever need
oh these tears will never dry
come take my heart tonight
in the city of the lost and found
time goes slowly with you only
time goes slowly with you only
islands from the first time we saw
and i need your light tonight
when the night's on fire will you keep the candlelight burning
standing in the cold rain
it's a heartache
it aint wise to need someone
love him till your arms break
if i aint got you
but what good does it do if i aint got you
to take me away
hearts beating like a drum
cant you see it's forever
together we will stand
i'll sail with you the seven seas
cant you see it's forever
baby know the way i feel
and then i see the look in your eyes
and i know i've got to get out and cry
we'll be holding on forever
i really need you tonight
a total eclipse of the heart
better and there's nothing i just wouldnt to do
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
once upon a time there was light in my life
never ever treats 'em honey like i should
to make your life a bed of ease
i'm not the kind of woman you can mess around
and maybe you can cry all night
i want you
but there aint no coupe de ville hiding at the bottom
and though i'll never get him out of my heart
i want you
baby we can talk all night
now dont be sad
i want a fine perfume a powdered blue corvette
give me some real rich food i want some succulant sweets
and what we're missing most are the real good times
i wanna show you what i want you to do where and when and how
he was strong as a bear and two yards long
little willy wee was the man for me
and i'll never have such loving again
before the sun sinks i'll lie there in their arms
but i wont take any chances i'm watching every mover you make
how could you forget all our plans and all our ambitions
what's wrong with a romantic whose soft
and i know i'll be up late again
our future from tonight is through
i'm talking to you
you know there's no turning back
written by scott and wolfe
ooh i dont want to let it end
empty
empty
what a way to treat my heart
what a way to treat my heart
and i know how you suffered
i admit
of what you got
and i can finally see
just a little bit
and i realize there's tomorrow
and i'll let you know
to help and humankind me
dont wait up for me
i'll let you know
well i'll let you know
but now i need something more
before we make any promises
before we two become us
two ships that pass in the night
than to find out too late it's not true
yeah see if i care
i wont miss your arms around me
dont turn around
wish i could say to you
written by scott and wolfe
oh why love did you treat me this way
goodbye to the island
paradise is you my love
no i'li never give it up
i'll cross every sea
i live for you
to capture your heart
to be with you
it's a jungle out there
it's a jungle out there
it's a jungle out there
you call it civilization
when trouble comes around there is no mystery
what they say they say is not what they mean
everybody running from a shadow today
not getting your name 4 times
i'm looking for forever always
make my phone start ringing
i was looking but too blind to see
never found that our hearts felt the same
and that's straight from the heart
i'll see you on the street some other time
give it to me straight from the heart
you know i'll never go
and now i start to live again
i had to learn to let you go
love tears it all apart
but you're the one that's always
this love will never die
whenever you want me just one call i'll be there
anytime anywhere i dont care
i know and it's been coming for sometime
till forever on it goes
have you ever seen the rainrepeat and fade
heaven let the sun shine upon our road
let the angels say hello
written by giorgio moroder and tom whitlock
i know nothing's forever
heaven is here in your arms
got a feeling and it just aint right
it's nothing like before
can tell by the way you touch me
i know i dont take you to heaven anymore
here am i there are you
clinging to your arms again
wondering why i wanted to be free
lyrics by pete bellotte
it's the moment you've been waiting for
trust my intuition dont rush into your decision
this lady's serious make no mistake
and the truth is just beginning
we came this far without once hurting others
and your face is in my eyes
he's got a hold on me
i wonder what name he answers to
but you all better keep your distance
have a hold on you
falling down from grace
he is he is the king
he is he is the king
no one else will be around
'cause while the world goes crazy
now i know what ti's like
hey love it's a feeling that i cant describe
hey love it's a feeling that i cant describe
tito he was ding of the streets
ah ah ah ah hey hey hey hey do do do do
johnny's holdin rosa on a rooftop in the night
written by jim steinman and dean pitchford
and he's gotta fast
there's someone reaching back for me
i can feel his approach
and whatever i am doing
i believe
empty
say that this love is a game come on and play along
i believe in my music
spreading his light into my room
there's no life without you
written by scott and wolfe
i'm always running for cover
empty
what you're doing to me
although the homeless man is there he knows he's all alone
all he wants is to be happy
i know love is always a sin
the doorway of a lifetime
take this loving from me
to that no good not good cheap talking crowd
empty
empty
that a woman like me just needs a man
my oh my
just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
she never noticed that he looked so good
blue eyes that gleam just like james dean
blue eyes that gleam just like james dean
oh she'll never see her baby again
gotta be careful when you're takin a chance
what better way to show you care for me
you'll be alive tomorrow if you're safe today
you whispered to me i'd be stupid not to follow
that holds the time to put in action what i told her
will secretly enjoy our time
will secretly enjoy our time
and i take all i can use
as i make my last promise to you
locked together
let the show begin
an old man told me
if we dont remember anything
we'll sure remember this
i could feel the breeze from below
cause i'm not alone anymore
like an ocean
of the distant sun
you were all i ever wanted since it all began
in a different light
shining on me
oh limelight
living just enough
his sister's black but she is sure nough pretty
'cause where he lives they dont use coloured people
living just enough for the city
i was lost in france in love
oo la la la dancing
to say baby i wont be home
that was when i was taken in
i may never be the same
running down my face
and chasing it with tea
the narrow and the winding ways
on the streets down in little italy
in every step i take alone
on the streets down in little italy
you're slipping away
take a chance the greatest love is in your hands
you're slipping away
written by desmond child and michael bolton
baby tell me you're not comin apart
i just want to love you
she cant give you what i've got
she gives you all the things i never could she's so good
but baby when it's dark and you're home at night
gotta start'em all over again
and she cant love you the way i do
take me back
nearly made me blind
near to you
empty
oh tears may go and years may come
it's written in my heart
time's on my side
oh baby i stay by your side
you'll come to me come to me
better than all the rest
and in your eyes i get lost
get on down but i'm staying at home
we'll sure have a good time
i've got the time if you've got the place
the eyes of a fool
what i need
dont let go
i've got nothing to lose but you've sure got a lot to gain
ooh yeah
the fire below
it takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below whoa
i'm gonna change the way i'm acting
i have been thinking again this is bad
i'm a natural born forgetter
i'm a natural born forgetter
and i'm feeling misplaced
can you tell me can you tell me baby
cause i need to know
can you tell me can you tell me baby
it will be alright
when the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
and the world starts tonight
baby oh baby i made a mistake
ooh the world starts tonight
finally find a way to say that we know the truth
i love you
reaching for the higher ground
swore if this day ever came
the sky above and the love of a rolling stone
and the one more thing that happened on the way
cause i only love bobby
billy me bobby and anne
cause a bobby loves anne
till you see that i'm
it's a matter of time
i know we'll be lovers again darling
did you ever call out to me i've never been gone
it doesnt make any sense
we wee flesh and blood and bone
there were times we had it all
both you got your head stuck in the sand
i guess you gotta go through it
there were times we had it all
there were times we were damn good liars
it's gonna take time for us to trust again
i'm hanging on
but you got to hold on tight as hell to your dream
looking back at out mistakes
just as soon as they find you
there's always another married man
as he's driving away
they he'll walk out of your life
they do it again and again
they do it they do it they do it
you know all that matters
till your blinded by the light
there's nothing you can do no
it's a matter of the heart
i know i believe it's the hardest part of love
baby it meant something to me
happy birthday christmas
come close to my heart
here comes the rain
half of me lies
lovers are like
empty
my guns are loaded
what it would be like
i'm hung up on you now
i should have known
when you sting
new york can wait cant you see that i care
in my heart you'll be the only one
you can sweet talk and lead me on
i could of sworn that you had a love
that aint no way to treat a woman in love
and i will hold you to all your promises
i'll come out and shout it loud there aint nothing better then my
girl i dont want nothing like boy where have you been
but for now i'm improvising
i'll make time for you
sometimes i wish that i was back
livin on the road again
i been up and down
i can feel you near whisperin my name
and how people can hurt each other
it aint got nothing to do with love
nothing to do with love
and i'll always remember
it's something i'll try
and i'll always remember
to every little thing she has to say
he should have let me take her in the first place and
she ties a ribbon to and with the stars
break another little piece of my heart now baby
but when ya hold me in your arms i'm singing again
make a fist and grab so fast he said
with bigger eyes that understand
cause love is never in the same place if you left her
maybe he's the man behind the wire
that's no lie my baby
race to the fire only the strong survive
race to the fire time is on his side
there's nobody down in the woods
ravishing ravishing
and this is the season i've got something to lose
we'll be ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
than anything i ever wanted was to see the light
and it's just my luck tonight i dont have anything to wear
ravishing ravishing
you shot me where you wanted
so hold me hold me in your arms
just a rebel without a clue
dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
there's nothing to it really i think they call it love
a rebel without a clue
so hold me baby hold me a little longer
i'm on a freeway to nowhere
i felt your passion
i dont know what to do
without the love i need to feel
so i make the move
and serve you in a real time movie
but days have been lucky
on this rolling home
your sleep's dreams gets corrupted
on this rolling home
and it's so hard to forget her past
oh when sally comes around
so hang on in dont you cry
oh when sally comes around
i need your arms to hold me tight
take me in your arms and save me
save me from this emptiness
i dont know where i'll sleep tonight
cause you'll be cryin over me
i wont wipe them away
written by jerry lynn williams
like it means the world to you
then maybe someday we'll be friends
come on save your love
dont throw away my love babe
breaking up is hard to do
oh darling i'm crazy after all these years
bitterblue bitterblue
proud to cry
oh hoh oh it aint what it seems
if you're wondering why i turned from you this morning
baby i'm sorry
empty
walk through a fire
oh there's no mountain high enough
you'll never grow old
there's no other say
ooh together we can win it all
you're taking on the world
like a cat on a hot tin roof
you're taking on the world
i'm on your side oh when times get rough
like a bridge over troubled water
i will ease your mind
and once or twice you've shown the face i like
and now and again when i dont feel so shy
feelings are the hardest words to say
that's no way to say goodbye oh
from the bottom of your heart
if there's one thing that i know
i had the world with you
if not for my careless heart
empty
as darkness crept over the ocean
you've torn me apart
just spaces where photographs were
i need you and it's getting late
i need to feel the loving flow
empty
come on come on and give your love to me
empty
he took her breath away
oh seasons change and so do we
i cant take these lonely nights
how does this love survive
there's nothing left to hide baby
there's no disgrace
it is so hard to try to forget
i know it sounds crazy baby let me try maybe maybe
forget to pick the clothes up accidentally break your cup
let's walk around the problems that i've made
dont blame me for something i cant change
you got to believe me and you got to have faith
tomorrow is more than a mile away from here
dont stop the music not now no no no no
dont stop the music not now
a vision in black no holding back
everyone loves a mystery
he couldnt wait to say goodbye
from the march 1991 san remo song contest
the light escapes
if i could take your hand and lead me to this place
to see me through this endless night
it's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace
faster than the speed of night
and all we'll ever need
empty
you're such a pretty boy
faster than the speed of night
written by steve benson
burning dont you know
just like a dream you are mine
no no this love will never die
baby when i lost you my heart stood still
oh i never meant to make you cry
oh baby take my heart let's heal the pain
forget her shake her free
forget her let her go
and i can see with different eyes
they say love is blind
every moment that we spend apart
i'll never never feel this way again
empty
someone's changing our lives
get out of my head and get into my heart
his handkerchief bulge slipping from the middle
the atmosphere erupts with the drunken liberators
the smoke mist clears to reveal drunken jimmy
they're getting so excited
just as long as i'm in there with you baby
oh baby i need you now
and as long as your the one that i believe in
left to dry in the rain
bring me in from the cold
i have given it all
and you will never see if for
the only one of 5 exception
which you dont have
choose the moods that you fake when you want
well arent you glad
tonight dont let forever fade
oh i need i need your loving
going through the motions 1234
but you can be anyone
you're so thinly disguise
you'll sometimes look
going through the motions
i was a careless fool
they laughed at all my jokes
please make that turn around
you've never seen me cry
there for me
the cut that hurts the most is your attitiude
written by dieter bohlen
how many tears can i hide
see what my love can do
darlin every night
for your wild love
what i'm not doing right
making love to you
wild love
or you might have known i'd never make a wife
what you wanted was another kind of angel
written by ronnie scott and steve wolfe
words whispered in the night
the kind that makes you sing along
tell me why they stay behind our lips
years my come and years may go
jealous words have no fear
i lost a feeling i cant explain
another place another time
yesterday dreams
pick up the pieces and let you live
yesterday dreams
were it not for a blue appearing
and though i said i was scared to die
and i wouldnt have loved you
non existence seemed like
answered my requesting
and though i said i was scared to die
feeling like there's no way out and without you no way in
to look up in the sky and see nothing but clouds
no matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies
because under the surface of friendly horizons
you are a women
are you happy
you're everything i hope for
your love was the key to my peace of mind
you make me feel
you make me feel
feel so sad and cold inside
baby please stay
you wont see me cry please baby baby come home
this time wont be the last time
this time wont be the last time
you're breaking my heart again and i cant get over you
there is no place to hide
just the thought of you it drives me wild
it breaks my heart

why do you call me when you know i cant answer the phone
but this new love cuts so deep
why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
na na na naana na naa na naa

for this is the night we ride

done my way cant say i'm sorry
and i'm saved by the light
i never should have gotten in the mix

is think of you
but what you need surger
dont ever let it end let it go on and on and on
i want you to be my only girl
but it's only the television kind
believe in sex and love in a dangerous time
hard when you realize that you'll never have what you're trying to find
i see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
every little bit of me baby
and ever since we first met i knew that
and ever since we first met i knew that
here we are we are we are we are we are
but i threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
and i've seen it for the first time
conscience has come its incest as always
i can feel it
i can feel it
they start to fade like footprints worn away
we may still get by
the scars and scrapes and scratches
we may still get by
cant fake a life so beautiful
is passing you by
maybe we can make a deal
we wont have to drive too far
i said somebody's got to take care of him
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
buy a big house and live in the suburbs

angels we have heard on high gloria
the neighbours might think baby it's bad out there
my sister will be suspicious
i really cant stay outthere it's cold outside
just be a man about it

though we dont know where it will lead
so be a man about it
but that's not all i need
and you're expecting me to believe
i betch never thought i'd break your heart
baby i've found another
we're better off now better off now
we're better off now better off now
if you ever think you need me
you're with me somehow
are you what you seem
can this be real
the essence of someone is constantly here
are you what you seem
are the people who look and think like you
come roll in all the riches all around you
how high does the sycamore grow
there we were and their just happening
and if one day you'll find
suave y despacio
tu corazon es donde yo vivo y muero

and i'll find someone
and i'll show you just how wrong you are
then you'll think about love all the good i gave to you
oh oh oh oh

and i'll find someone
sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
you go and save the best for last
isnt this world a crazy place
written by waldman
all i'm saying is
dont keep me hanging on
if what you want is me
that's what we need to keep our love strong
you cant keep playing with
lying in a mother's arms
and they really dont care if i do
and all of these snowflakes falling down around me
see how different i am i'm not one of them
why not the guy in the tie on the train
wings made of dreams made of love made of prayer
someone exactly like you
i've been up and down the highway
someone exactly like you
and day and night my castanets will click
her hips never quit
jose and carmen

and there are days when i know i should have told you
empty
still in love
no one around but i feel someone watching me
he looked into my eyes
i dont have much to do
that's when he came
never knew
fall like dust upon my shoes
that i found were only stones
never sure of what we see
this could be the thing to get you on your way
and life is all about your point of view
you'll see the beauty if you look at something right
i wonder as i wander outunder the sky
or all of gods angels in heaven to sing
i just cant seem to make him understand
you've got that certain kind of man
then make a way to show him what you really feel
it's the kind of love that guilds you through guilds you through
and you'll know just what to do
please have snow and mistletoe
if only in my dreams
empty
a start a fire i'll just come for you
empty
and i promise that i wont cry i wont ask you why
so for the sake of all that magic we made together

we had to save ourselves
all through the changes the soul never dies
all our times would bring
and i know you're there for me
but now we're so much wiser
let's make it better
why we couldnt give our all again
why we couldnt give our all again
but the feeling was much too much too strong

there's nothing else i could want more
to the power of love surrender
every everything
though i know i got to move on
so what could you do to assure me
if i hurt again and i cry again
dont need no one
feelings are far gone
these lonely nights without you
'cause i need more time
these lonely nights without you
said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
do you know what i know
he will bring us goodness and light
i never thought that it could be
every night
cause reality scares me
empty
cool notes and melodies harmonies
she's ellamental to the art
was it the smooth tones that was so much like butter
got the joint jumpin remembering you 'til the dawn
a little more giving
but sometimes i need you to show it
the first thing on your mind
that you loved me i'd say i know it
to every boy and girl
for all the children
voices arising all harmonizing
to all the children of the world
and let nothing turn your move around
freedom dance if you open up
get free
you dont have to worry naw naw
mary had a baby

faithful friends who adire to us
have yourself a merry little christmas
empty
like you need to be loved
it's not unusual to find that it's sensual
welcome to the comfort zone
suddenly there's meaning
yes the easiest thing is loving you
it's as simple and as natural as
breathing out and breathing in
on a cold winter's night that was so deep
noel noel
i dont wanna miss out on the right stuff
the other fellows dont compare
say it
warm against life's bitter cold
the sweetest days we'll know
empty
baby turn the lights down and we dont have to say a word
i like the way you set the mood with a little wine and candlelight
chorus 3x
try to embrace another view
though we dance to the beat
we can learn to live together
so bring him incense bring him gold
whom angels breed with anthems sweet
boy i was way out on a limb
that i find so damn appealing
empty
take it from us we paid an awful price
that we played the game from the start
but what can i tell my heart
written by tinturin

to make you want me to

and that there is no easy way
and now i know now i know
i know i should be there where you are
i got to get to where you are
strong enough to rock the world

and fill my nights with song
you light up my days
sweeter than any star you can reach

when somebody cares that you're alive
touched by someone
whatever way you go
along the way

i'llhold you when you cry
dont be scared you can just reach for me and i'll be there
in these arms of mine

a lonely place to be
i found the greatest love of all

here i sit trying not to cry

but he's worth it
love that man
never give in to a fight
somebody loves you heart and soul
i dont understand what's the master plan
searching for the truth
open up your heart
love will make things right
and it will come together
love will find a way

so for me stay sucka free cos you dont need that homie
empty
so who thought you could get paid with it
shootin hardcore rhymes through wack mc's chests
and get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
was worryin about a white boy gettin the fame
it's like me tellin johnny cash how to sing about his horse
get a lawyer and accountant just like i did

i'm tryin to tell you what's up
the rap game's hijacked

verse 1
this high powered music is truly unique
so listen very closely as the glove throws down
intro ice t
sometimes i sit and wonder
they stay up at nights waitin on a combat call
i can still see my fuckin boys' body jerkin
there's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
rally up the wolfpack attack relentless
we got your place ran up to a cop on the tick
i'll catch ya down south lay your ass out straight
i'm lettin off until my arms tired cut and scratched
you know these niggas out here been fakin for years man
four in your back and keep bailin
we crash clubs and security shits
you broke ill and you cold fucked up
than these here niggas
i go deep into the street life's anatomy
i take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
but most of the time you cant see a nigga
count your muthafuckin blessings and handcuff your hoe
without a sex drive
when i'm upon the microphone
the way you move i cant forget
the caress of the bestthe ice t chill
i move it in and outknow what i'm talkin about
feat jello biafra
anyone gaught outside of gates of their suveillance sectors after curfew
all port broadcasts will proceed as normal
coroless phoneeight or nine homes
but pimpin aint easy
livin my life is just so hard to do
because i wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
and there aint nothin in the word
swash buckler club king pull the gun to her
searched my possefound the uzi but missed the 12 gauge
i rap about the life that the city streets gave me
disrespected by snobsdamn near trampled by mobs
ban metry ityou might cause a riot
so dont diss me dont darei feel you should care
but no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
and no one went to jail when the court heard the case
but most mc's today aint got nothin to say
i'm a nigga not a colored man
i'm loud and proud
i'm a nigga in america
a low down shame
i'm a steak and lobster eatin
so i'm a say it
but there was no love there
i walked to crenshaw high shit was fly
i did three years in and made close friends
be all fucked you can be
bought a porsche and gear earn high streetrank
in one nite late i was in a carwreck
cause my time was gettin short
and we all worked together
yo kid you're sure you wanna be down with this right
cold max with the long dough
the fam accepts no mistakes
check your nuts
he tried to short me a buck
you're down with the syndicate but never admit it
columbian mexicano connect
they want you dead yo you're dead before the daylight ends
who was there when your wife had your first child
empty
went and met him quick hit him with a ice pick
aint no business untouched when it comes to cream
had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
this girl tried to kill me took me within a inch of my life
this girl tried to kill me took me within a inch of my life
and then she broke out a whip i said shit
oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
my dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
homeboy tried to kill me cos he had caught me fuckin his wife
the little girl had a burn
it's hard to stay awake
wont someone save these kids
i had a gun it's mine and i packed it
lapd says they're gonna capture me
i'm the hunted child
the hunted child
at christmas time i'd hate to hear the bells ring
this system has us geared to kill one another
i'm the hunted child
before my posse makes a move on your mom's crib
so he could get a charge when he begin
a 1989 type dolemite
but she said she never felt it
verse 4
and if we play cards dont let me be the dealer

my stature when you're in my rapture

new york city got it like that
somebody else got it like that
and not only that you'd be under my wing
a ittle moan and groan after some fuss and fight
i want to love you every moment i can
and then i'd proceed to make your nature rise
round and round upside down
looking out for the danger signs
found a new tab thought i'd take a grab
years slip away and i get older
and if they're willing sure i'll bring them
satelliting what i was writing
so instead of fighting out our problems
something something is not right
brother brother sister sister

i'm harder than the hardest hardest hard can get
struggle to live struggle to live struggle to survive
danger in the jungle the jungle means danger danger
with the morning of the fox that rocks the box
gather my leaves and all my minerals
negative vibes now i dont feel right
lah lahhhhhhh lah lah lahhhh
a shot rings out and a young girl hits the ground
the sun still shines but the day now feels gray
lah lahhhhhhh lah lah lahhhh
real serious
and you can kiss me where the sun dont shine
believe in yourself and nothin will go wrong
my dj spin the music down to the nitty gritty
my bone is grabbed this is what i mean

now what you thought was old and out of date
the class jester i was flunkin every semester

the purpose is clear
we appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
no rabbit in a hat tricks

rockin robbins hood
forever winning i'm in it
cooking the full dinner
cause we take it back like spinal tap
fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
i hope you got your shots cause this is lyrical malaria

what's your contribution to life
listen and witness the common tales
off of that gawk that made emack
that's just the way love goes hmmm lets rewind
and ultimately you know you aint feeling her so
you slapped me you cant attack me thinkin i'm be happy
but no woman can truly teach a boy to be a man
empty
or try thugs who perpotrate
you're equal measure to dirt dust grime and puss
my culture's screwed cause this word is misconstrued
imagine life without a choice at all
they would decapitate the tongue if you would mention the word freedom
release the hot ones and let freedom ring
cause there's not a lot of time to
the past depart the present cause the future is near
the struggle and the pain to maintain and continue
keep across your vision blurred from heat distortion
great expectations on our committee unified relations
that's right that's where we dwelled and the rhythm rebelled
expectations on our committee unified relations
and dont expect to try and guess if i'm mad or not

when it comes to love
when it comes to love shouldnt be no pressure
you cant be too careful when it comes to love
when the sun goes down and the moon shines bright
well step out of the shadows let the night begin
written by danny kirwan
when you say
la la la la la la
that i know
la la la la la la
but i know i wont always be that way
and what's left of a heartache
and if your memory finally leaves me too
now i'm so tired of thinking of you
the winds of change
if i had you near it would make it alright
'cause i feel like a child tonight
i wish you were here
found she was gone
found she was gone
to the sea and golden sand
and from the land
do they still admire your silvered ways
i let the next nigga date em cuz i dont hate em

now you know the world's all in a tangle man
i begin to feel so worried
that's why i'm gonna build myself a cave
now when i woke up early this morning
i've been worried all day long
dont say that she's pretty
oh no
but you would not let me
you'll never get away from the sound
hoping the daylight will never come
keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
for you and i
i never did believe in the ways of magic
can you trust him
all a sudden y'all exchanging numbers callin
and you think i'm picking with cha
you never know
verse 2 mac
but instead of informing you
and that she was only bitching
go to school with you
through the crystal like and clear water fountain
drove me like a magnet
do your ever wonder or worry about me
do your ever wonder or worry about me
just to take away a little pain
so we can be happy again
and without you what would i do
dissatisfied dissatisfied
if i have learned enough
i hope i will feel the same
can you try
can you try
they call me that lovin man
you just ask any woman in my neighborhood
and baby you dont have to take no pills
baby baby dont treat me this way
you'll see things in a different way
dont stop it'll soon be here
yesterday's gone yesterday's gone
although the garden is a lovely place
it's a place that i visit
and until you find
i'll be forever
like a heartbeat drives you mad
i keep my visions to myself
thunder only happens when it's raining
oh just like the way i miss my baby now
if i dont find her in mississippi
i aint gonna leave my baby
when we are dust when we are dust
to crumble in our separate light
her honest word is my only real thing
makes your day to day life easy
new york open your eyes to me
flying high on the empire state
cut that simply track off
i'm the one who slash rappers and be fucking they bitch
tampered with all the styles

hey you shouldnt keep back your thoughts and good ideas
hey you said it aint bad to unveil your politics
it's the burning inside
if you got talent baby let it shine
i want to see you dance
and your dreams come alive
a week mind gets high on bull sht
today is your day and it's time to shine
hey brother it's that fire we aint gotta do all that but pass it
high as a kite and i'm bout to choke
it gotta be good anytime that i can smoke it with my father
keep my fucking mind at ease
i aint about no trouble when i'm high
right now your children might grow up like this

verse 2
wild is cookin up these deadly drugs
like everyone who rhymes packs a gat with the silencer
man what i've been through is strife
and they're never in a slump
instead he was a bigot dig it
just as bad as bein shot in the groin
once a brother tried to take a leave
the umpires are the government
the bases are loaded
i'm just hangin out
which is the reason why i like to hang out and
i go over k cut's block cause raw cuts is what he blends
on the problems of the weak dumb and meek my mans deep
from flushing to the streets of new york in fact
nah but aint nuthin at your house
in this here field my foot equals yield
sir scratch and k cut the main source
on the constant truth of the main source crew
finessing the songs like this babblists get bust with the quickness
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
and wouldnt have so much hate
but regardless you shouldnt have to be so raw
but all i get is gray hairs and strife
the best looking girl in the whole us
sitting' in the chair just to stare set to sprint
to me it means the absence of all confusion
little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
set it off set it off set it off
they think i'm crazy nigga like a bag of dust
if it's a dealer the tec 9 will gun him quick
so i just pollute and kickin heads with the fuckin boot
i find a victim and stick him and move to the next one
yo watch the evil spirit rise when niggas get me fed
so all that shit you plan on talkin yo you wont be able
i got a crew of niggas waitin for the combat
i gotta get it off when i let it off
for a sandwich and selter so probablt sell the
cause i keep looking and you'll keep scheming
you sleeping in the end you get swept cause you slept
and tax and probably smoke cracks
false producers are telling lies why they're rolling snake eyes
rappers can dance sing and shake their thing at the same time
hey and i make em concentrate on the songs i create
y cucata estaba con grande como eso
we can work like strainers or filters
come and show your tactics asap let's rap
on to the meaning of a real rap song
que effe fiete hora tiende pero de la gente
and gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
attained a job as a manager at a bank
always in good spirits and money's never made
you're going to fail child
that's what an education can and might do
it's like i'm lifted out of time
will you return to love me
after tonight
empty
and pulled me closer
when the morning comes
when i stand here taking every breath with you
just the memory of your face

i hold you in the night
i figured out your style
empty

to shining sea
believing your lies
how we used to be in love

but i just cant walk away from paradise
all by ourselves
when you touch me
i should just hug you goodbye see i know i should but boy
i cant walk away
so i guess i'll sing you that sweet lullaby
and we can revisit us one more time
but still i had to keep on going
make it happen
if you throw your life away
but now i'm found
empty
anytime you come around
thoughts run wild as i sit and rhapsodize
mi todo yo te doy

guitar break

speed dial connecting me to rae rae hey

back to the back we fall flat girl
i cant stand in one place
if your and your coordinate
face body and lamborghini outside
i was too naive to love you right
it's irrelevant to dwell on the past
like way back then
maybe somehow we'll survive
the fire is burning
empty
this cold winters' night
in the springtime
you shine a light for me
empty
and take me to
'cause your by my side
i am thinking of you
i'd risk my life to feel
like a distant star
just as long as i believe
catching my every fall
until my saving grace shined on me
for delivering me
yes you are you're my every everything
every night
i'll never forget you
'cause i never said goodbye
but i'll never leave you behind
and be brave enough to love again
though we can never be
one bit of yesterday
never too far away
empty
if i could believe in you
that it was all a masquerade
so much love
o holy night
a new and glorious morn
for yonder breaks
and saying i'm the one you need
and i dont wanna fall back in
obviously procrastinating just to be
boy i'm so confused down deep inside
attached to the dream
downhearted again
if you really need me
once again effortlessly
if she hurts you or misleads you is call me and let love rush in
baby all you ever need to do
then you know i'm singing to you
if she hurts you or misleads you
although i'm aware you had doubts
strange to feel that proud strong man
you're always alive inside of me
now with a little love
we could share a storybook romance
you leave me at my door
repeat chorus
after so much suffering
my every wish and every dream
to ensure your happiness
my every wish and every dream every dream every dream
looking back i guess it shows
somehow became reality
my baby i'm so thankful
i was all by myself for the longest time
when you brought the sunlight
because without you beside me i cant survive
when you brought the sunlight brought the sunlight
after the rain to appreciate
completed my whole life whole life
empty
before i'd seperate myself from you
yeah yeah
mc joe
'cause without you beside me i cant survive
i was lost without you
mc joe
this way
empty
i'm overwhelmed with graditude
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
like it's nothin
now i'm broken hearted and shattering
oh oh oh oh
somebody say you know what i'm going thru
and i guess i only have myself to blame
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
cant you stay with me tonight
always everytime
or do you want me
the truth is all the hurt and the pain
that could be the one
see the problem with relationships
four could it actually be different this time
dont wanna be hurt anymore
dont wanna be hurt anymore
but i promised myself
that i wouldnt give in to love
finally found somebody
dont wanna be hurt anymore
my inner voice resounding
to taste my sadness
and i surrendered as you took me
and i was lifted
pretty baby how i'm missing you
looking downward
that you held inside
into the wind
someone more there for me there for me
you're always there for me there for me
a victim of society
come together to relieve the pain
some of us dont even care
some of us dont even wonder
get a little bit frightened
i can mend
believe you will prevail
live another day longer
yes i can yes i can
when you get caught in the rain with no where to run
and every time i feel afraid i hold tighter to my faith
and i live one more day and i make it through the rain
i can make it through the rain
because i feel the unconditional love
i need the strength of you by my side
sometimes i'm so despondant
i pray you'll come and carry me home
i pray you'll come and carry me home
but whatever
and i dont know
that look on your face
let's re write the end
like back in the day
i told you underneath the stars
thinking what it could've been like
thinking what it could've been like
all of my life
and i will reminisce
never be ashamed
strewn across the sky
on that fourth of july
and we floated away
ominously hovering
truly i have never felt the same inside
and go take you out
up in vip with all my ladies
can i get your number baby
what my intentions are for you
here's a little somethin about me
and go take you out
to save us all from satans power

i've always longed for undividedness
but it hurts me every time
i stayed so long but finally

unending passion
heaven took command
looking in someone else's eyes
in my life
what we dreamed

but now it's clear to me
and you keep on playing games

by the pool on the beach in the streets

shining like a chandelier
when i space am i still dreaming 'bout them violent times
once in awhile put up a fight

what can you prescribe for this
cause i knew if i started i'd keep crying
side effects oh oh
silent night
sleep in heavenly peace
baby i'm so afraid
that it's just a losing fight
your silence chills me to the bone
slipping away from what we had
lying beside you
shining completely
is all i need
dont ever leave me
something pulls me back baby
but something inside tells me you're where i belong
that things will get better
everytime we say goodbye
but you're irresistible
but it's just impossible
bitter tear drops fill my eyes
but you're irresistible

chasing the fantasies that filled our minds

somewhere in the shadows of your mind

and wakin up inside my arms

and i've got to be there
you probably havent got a clue
look into your eyes
when glory days turn to stormy nights
check proverbs 1929
still bruised still walk on eggshells
if my shows of gratitude are miniscule
but let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
surely god is my salvation
the word said it
he will keep them in perfect peace
empty

that the girl you was addicted to her name was crack
but it's nothing for y'all to compete with
i let my galant talent illuminate
so when you see me show respect
they try to keep it down because i talk to a beat
and stop lettin that bullshit slide for rap
so just close your eyes and just take my hand
a disgrace to rap and i'm not impressed
so yo pack your bags and skedaddle

i dont care about the other girls just be good to me
can it be i've stayed away too long
i said dont drive use your head
last week he took tests as the doctor told him
the story is not to say that i'm in sorrow
within the depths of this infinite community
where happiness comes in bundles
that they've been moved

now everything is withered
i thought we were close together
engraving our lecherous lust
the wounds wide open
hounds of love we were
all left are the scars it made
so three hundred and sixty five days i study and write
that were cut mastered and released under battleaxe
time flies lows and highs and that's no surprise
fears to overcome so i'ma give it my all
we'll keep it movin and go at it whole hearted
come along for the ride can you handle the drive
both from almost nothing
can you handle the drive
deep breath strike your lungs like a deadly pathogen let the assassins in loss of oxygen
crowd come to your town smash the door down trash the whole room kick the walls in night

abrasions face the day like a vacation chase of fun sun and money then its back to the
to morning let me do it again it's adrenaline
my mind frame contort tryin to hold down the fort

a prayer for the parish soucron affwaun

many want to mock and the honey dips clock
and reflect the black power project
the hardcore funk

the whole agenda is for me to decide the major hustle

i collect the loot and then i knock the boots
niggaz know the time i dont have to flex a muscle
here steps the one the answer to the riddle

taking my yards with no bodyguards

add the spice to make you shoop like salt n pepa

making me feel loose get nowhere turn to no one
we crooks get thrown big books
befriend the whole system
supply weapons coke crack and buddha
you cant find your way out the maze through purple haze
and anybody else that enforce the law
breaking through my storm sick weather
split seconds in time life become short
sets up the weather to splice us
who have patternized more than just mice
to unpulsate the black magic that breathes
it's out of hate oppressed revolt from feeling that they gotta take
fierce weapons speak for each side through open forum skies
the stage is set up the script is written so we get wet up
heat we feel on crazy
enemies of the state take center stage
we see through the plot
while they sit back and leave it all up to sonny
i planted two gaurds on the watch tower
but ther's no room for the two at the top

terror strikes under streetlights and grow
i cant replace my home with peacefull silence
deadly sirens brings on violence
explain why i'm target to homicide
who said they was untouchable but instead
filled with narcotics
fight to survive something crazy has just happened
war between city blocks and cops
haters get ass we get the last laugh like bloodstone
all kinds of musical forms of confusion
employ those firing
statistics recording the growth of the bad seed
'til the end of the war has been won you've been warned
there's nothing you could do we're breaking through
we lose control confused in the midst of staged scenes
document the city routine with hard rhymes
survive or defeat concrete jungle
rolling deep headed for florence and normandy where all you see
we go to the streets at night
to be gun flashing blasting that's why we aint lasting
a coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
aint no love
and electric chairs marking you with the stamp
and cashless systems
but i refuse to believe we all go down in flames
leavin you confused dazed and what got you all amazed
you got your role i got mine dont cross paths
we rock 'til the cops come and rock non stop
we get stoned tripped or wired
you're out playin games dangerous with high aim
psyclones all you sorry mothafuckas runnin
the course of the psyclone is steady
man made diseases show traces of an assassain
teams are spread out all over your city
dont mention it to anybody who questions
violent sequels 'til the evil and death equal
look at the deep thought dwelling within your mind
can you succeed in leaving the other side bleeding
yell out utlize realize survival
destyruction elimination avoid the humiliation
secretly under battle lost inside mystery intaining nuclear actions
cycles encouraging survival
taking away kingdoms endless
show of force for harm it's main source
my bullets rams piercing the skin of other men
show of force we cross and aim higher
connection we bought this and sought this out
where you head at
scatter the chatter of every lop
rather be free or get buried
static kingdoms break you and your manhood shallow
lifestyles of the criminal be wild
for the showdown you better slow down
ass end scrapping illuminating the whole block
images of war weapons the psycho presence
criminal styles point blank
my strategy assault battery
sick dogs collide with your stride
sick dogs got one screw missing
look at you throw against somebody
some might stand and some might fall
to come inside my world they all fall
this jam right here is dedicated
empty
end of the road were everybody goes but not forgotten

mutha fuckas drive by world wide
la undercover shoot to kill
'hood rocking window glocking zone shocking
locked on dope no hope for growth that's why we're broke
to take control over your mind and body
on the verge of insanity
like somebody pulled the plug from my brain
which one am i to aid
you're crazy therefore you're making me go cyclone
was my mind being torn apart
the outcome of what you've done shook slums of rivals
they drive by your block and shot randomly
and that ass is mine
dont hesitate to shoot in the quest for dead residents
leave shook with no question and then break
and that ass is mine
real towns around you get killed
where sirens will pierce your ears like deaf tones
imprisoned until we give our lives as payment for bail
crooked action ration is camouflaged
the wind of revolution screams come on do it
earthquake weather forever
interest or the progress of society buying me
madness and online freedom bandits
they control it flood the market target the dormant
codes punched in produce storms
terrorists through e mail drop bombs

and slowly drift
empty
of immense power
just when things seemed the same and the whole scene is lame
while you hit trees and coast i spit flows that be ferocious
from the ancient hieroglyphics to graffiti painted pictures

i'll say the words out loud
but i wont go down on what i said
thousand words or more
i believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you
i believe your most attractive features are your heart and soul
i believe that god does not endorse tv evangelists
whispering the magic and the compliments i need so badly
i want your perfume all around me
i want your perfume all around me
you're sleek velvet gold lame patent leather enchante
i like the way you move and do the funky groove
but straight away you just moved
will be alone
never known
'cause i used to move you in a way that
so wont you break me shake me
break me
in the moonlight
in the moonlight
carry on keep romancing
and i think about it all the time
that i think about you all the time
i've got to be chained to you
it's bringing me to my knees
when you feel all alone
i can mend a broken heart
if you jump i'll break your fall
and the world has turned its back on you

eager to be here or is it can see here i know all of all
and then i lied about my luxury lifestyle
then slipped a concoction in my drink
massive helicopters patrolled the rooftops strapped in
just then i pulled the sword and somehow
throwing an abnormal proportion of body blows karate chops
at that instance lo and behold the hidden scroll
i saw my whole life flash and the possibility of death

such as nowadays its fallin and splinterin just timber instead of

rode a mastodon out jurassic park
into the galaxy bus
tree another day up in this life under the sunspot
it's such a beautiful thing
tryin to make it 20 out of 15 pennies on the after
a hundred lifetimes in the hereafter and for the reincarnation tranform
a drop deposit in the drop embankment
when i can do it my way
seen a lot of freedom the feat amount to beat the drama
darker seasons
into the ground
this musical thing
see the matter of the fact is that i'm so gifted
i go abominable all up in you snow igloo
etchin poems in the stone with a wire cable
in an impaly with a dolly and her skirts skimpy
intuitive just like confusious in your next life

verse one
plot a long time finally a plan has made it
put in hard work finally your living your dream
when i'm thinking things that make you feel that way
dead broke more appreciation for that grill

peace to everyone i know or who i go way back wit
for mental health see you're concious that your mind is free

saw the bright light rappers caught a night night
feast on adrenaline master the way
gab'll bring the ness of the sun into your grey day
split lickety spit it could be lit
unpaid evictions charge penalties sent
battling rappers'll stagger right after the dagger is left in it
wake up if your lunging i'm something you're nothing release
unlimited flow unriveted inhibited vindited
i guess i'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
a metal ladder
a paint splattered wall
i surrender
released into wind
the tools of a trade
i stand in the middle of all that i have learned
but then who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
yes i am homeless
tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
i have seeded a forest of myself
lyrics born
it's mostly hustling
success at something
take hold and shift shape live a longer day
you never get no balance if you're crooked so play right snake
with the white motive motivation
crystal clear ear competition mere child's play
and then i'll rip off your arm and throw it in a stew
i'm gettin ya
put your rhyme in the towaway zone

word it well

so that we can feel
who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
i said dont you know the powers that be
why dont you change your environment
let a brother be a brother
hardly ever them around brothers' necks no more
and mimic what you act like
i just keep movin on moving on
souls keeps burning
the melting pot of lavas seeping
degrading all women knock em up leave em now smack em up
and the sky keeps plummeting
empty
the sky is falling no one is watching
we give a name
instead of leaving smiles leaven death inside of our living room
falling hurricanes
calm the fury
empty
gives way to creatures lurking can hear the crickets chirping
empty
a day of work completed a night of rest is needed
lateef the truth speaker
but even with a rifle your stylell get stifled
dont stop this marvelous three partners
dont condone viloence
empty
the suffocation begins your soul it gets engulfed in
if it aint one thing its somethin something else
now if you want some you best come with a gun
the lyrics that we wrote again are sounding rather vicious
empty
i dedicate that line to shack from south central
a baller aint a baller if he aint got balls
shit to live for if you cant explore the
no skill displayed de shades gone now
a life with a plan nine acres on a land
mark volman vocals
bring me this morning
the next day to whatever
maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
empty
but i i cant get much sleep
every single way of every single day
is love in the air
hail to the conquering hero
but he doesnt realize
i'll show that guy i'm just as smart
and then that conquerin hero is gonna be me
and making love is all there is to eat
file it under foreign affair
oh my sleeping child the world's so wild
they would learn to watch you play
let me tell ya i'm not insecure
repeat chorus
i simply didnt have a care
with our orange plastic button eyes
who forgot that it was sunday
sits the devil playing pocket pool
like this world's closing in on me
i can face the world
what the touch of your hand can do
lo que fuera por tenerte aqui
por favor
pero no sabes cuanto me afecta el corazon
yo te juro nunca quize verte llorar
te siento en las noches cuando estoy durmido
es que no puedo no puedono puedo estar
solo a ti puedo amar

then she goes along and writes another song
it would be cool
cause it's the path my heart will lead me too
all we need is understanding to prevail
i need shelter from the rain
no one to guide me
turn it 'round on you
who will be anything and everything
let a man who dont understand
to want a love
dont let him break your heart
cause we're together
ohhhh come over here and help me trim the tree
empty
so to honor him pa rum pum pum pum
mary nodded pa rum pum pum pum
when i wanted fancy things
the great things in your life sweetie
sometimes we get wrapped up
girl i'm sorry the love is gone
merely fade away
when you say it's not there
empty
with my arms above my head
dont make me wait too long
verse two shawn
empty

on bare feet arched like you got heels on
i could see how a man could fall in love with you
dear god it's me again
lord my love for you will never end
needing your knowledge your love and your guidance lord
do they know
do they know we should love one another
empty
we never had to care which party would win
everything in life was so much better then
and we were just too young to understand at all
one look and i'd break right down and cry
i dont need you in my life
you felt a change in the weather
there were times at night i couldnt sleep
cuz we're apart miles away
meet me in my dreams tonight
baby it's alright
oh cant wait to go to sleep
meet me in my dreams tonight
as you get a little older you start realizing things
big chains big cars big chips
my ego was my enemy
if i could turn back the hands of time
but it's true to say
and now i realize i realize
everything to show i appreciate you
now i know it
now i know it now i know it
and now i realize the spirit that lives in my soul
empty
its like sunshine on a cloudy day
i'm waiting right here for you
like a dazzling reflection in the sky
i want to know if that place
ill be waiting for the day
each prayer wishes new memories
glistening in the sun shine for everyone
that i've been once before
i try to fight this loneliness
the waves will crash the wind will blow but forever in my heart you will never know the blue skies will turn gray
the whispers of the wind
i fell in love with the girl in the picture
and she was all mine
and that's where i'd dream
and asked me if i'd be her man
she was always with me
at the market
and oh how she hated to go
says she's been looking for me
empty
and i've been trying to figure out
i get this feeling every time i think of you
you're the perfect love song
every time i'm with you
chorus 1 and 2
we belong together
our bond holds us close
my arms are open wide
buy your clothes
and i wanna be the only man

i'll cook your food

'cause your the strength i hold onto
to change these tears of pain
to break the walls down to journey on

and in this world a good man is hard to find
gave you all a man could give ya
and i tried to love you with all my might
injection fellas

with the moonlight shining on you through the shades

to hold you tonight

like some harmony over the hip hop tracks
and the feelin she's giving me
just take a minute and catch the vibe
cause we're feeling alright
a mad sensation a crew of women around sparks inspiration
life with my heart by all the beauty
confusion leaves while peace

know wisdom's the way to let it outcome
last longer than a duracell or a energizer
mr exquisite dressed in silk bally's made of lizard
so smile here comes the picture click
it's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock
like a crackhead but this black dread dont sell drugs
a butter verse over a beat that's pancake fat
cos i give strong blows to the hoes and my foes
my big brother was a slave but i'm like nat turner with two burners
his mantle is wigged you watch the pig squeel
lord jamar will live long
he drops when i peels his cap with the real rap
cos i give strong blows to the hoes and my foes
verse one grand puba
plus cats be in his hallways with the drugs and the gats

sometimes we do to lift the hardhead ones up to queens
and i'm sorry for that time that i hit you
like that frontin ass you know what i'm sayin
slow down repeat 3x
kids love to feel on you feds got a seal on you
cause i'll smack you with a hose filled with sand

marking off the goods you got going up another notch
what i am is what i am x2
she was doing lays before she started bleeding
honey got a problem with the bends
cause it aint the season
some go down in the dark bootleggin
but i dont cause i maintain you're just a common street peddler
everyone's got problems sellin my tape aint gonna solve em
verse two lord jamar
garth brooks aint bootlegged cause they'd never let it
best believe they got a trick up they sleeve
lord jamar

now ruler is where my burner gets the fueler
can y'all save what's left or at least make a claim
before i had a daughter and before they had sons

cats try they best to decipher the tape
that's why the gods check got at least 6 cypher

nobody do i need bitch back up
just health and well being through all eye seeing

chorus x2
the southpaw ask your ma i be the shinin star
now let's take time out to say peace to the gods peace
i told their ass to chill and they're still cold
i dont say it just to say love
i heard you whistling my favorite song
i felt it beat like a bass drum
empty
oh if the sun dont rise for weeks
boom clap 6x
and i aint even going nowhere
ooh ooh ooh ooh
feels like i'm leaving something behind
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
but when i'm not with you i'm missing my peace
you're the only one i'm needin
something this strong gotta be real
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
this time not from screaming but crying for you
love is a natural disaster
so i can take a stand
i'm dryin all up
when your hope is gone
when you think of me
'cause it's all in me
know that it was me
dont matter if it's a hope or dream
chorus out
you were finally free
of a heart that's never really sure
you only let me down
almost doesnt count
everyday i see you
and i just can seem to shake you
repeat 2
and now u see your angel was a fake
i found it quite strange
who was she foolin i had a clue what she was doin
chorus x2
is there somewhere you can tell me
he can see she's been crying
and me in paradise
you and me in paradise
you'd understand if you were treated like me
should've known before we started
we dont want anybody to know
'cause to me love is worthless with no you and me
'cause i've been the same since we began
you would never leave
you never listen to me
well i have had more than enough
no more no more
it's getting out of hand
to dry my tears to calm my fears
repeat 1 2x
it's beenlocating
what about we're gon be around
when you come to my mind
but that's all i can use to state my intentions
you're all i'm thinking of now
own damn hart is making fun of me

2nd verse

2x i'm a believer
empty
but we're stuck where we are
while i'm away way ayyyy

the melody of you and me
i try
on my side on my side
and more and more and more and more
tell me please what's happened baby
i believed in everything you said
i wonder why you hurt me
empty
how could it be that sweet memories would be all all that we have left
now that you're gone i can still feel you near
so if the role so if the role dont fit me
so i make sure everyday
and that aint' my thang
i gotta move
i'm hearing you
i'm so glad i got you
share romance to you
cause i'm lost without you
i'm crazy crazy about you
cause i'm lost
i take the time

when i sing you know what i do
i'll walk the desert
you'll see
i i i hope
pray that ya love me
i do
i do
in my heart happy quick take down this note
how much you mean to me
by trying to pull us down with such a mess
never said never
stop tryin to get the best of me
never say never
cause aint nobody perfect
cause theres no such thing as too late
whenever you get that chance to
cause love aint got no where to go
but until then we should be patient lets not start
when you really love somebody you can wait dont ya think
you cannot pretend that i dont even matter
nothing it's driving me crazy
empty
but it was true beyond description
to live in this world and still believe
sing is for everyone
one song one voice
how did u get me so open

and to hold you tight
but you front in front of your crew

repeat 2
she would apologize
she may have done those things
in front of them oh
never let you down
all you own
repeat 1 to fade
call up your friends to just cover your trail
cant keep creeping around
sweetest seduction that i've ever heard
can i get a witness
i wont believe it no
in the morning with the sun rise
not a word until the week goes by
cant be that other woman
you disappear and wont return my page
i understand
cant keep creepin around
have you ever been in love with another girls man
yes i want you bad
fade in chorus
empty
you got me thinkin of you
you know it
together constantly
you got me thinkin about you
the sun doesnt shine on those sunny days
thinkin about you
thinkin about you
thinkin about you
and i think of you
verse three cassandra
if your lost you can look
i will be waiting
and darkness has turned to grey
time after time
time after time after time if you should fall just call me
sittin here lonely
and make yourself comfortable
now you dont have to phone me first
the perfect night for company
see forever is a plan that i have for you
so much to talk about
and baby we can do some things
show the feelings i wanna hide
when i got a love that i'm supposed to love
so much more than what he's giving at home
