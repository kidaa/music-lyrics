by stab from sword steel
still winds knew where travel forthblown path
blackheim finally asked december since sentinels life death
cold blackened no sounds rejoice
twisted longing into caskets time
vision saw
bring terrible demise
into horizonlines spears so sharp daylight shines
when night comes down
glittering waters demonic daughters
web moonshinelong lost timeryhme
seven lonely spirits zaal
kingdom forever deserted since it's birth
center frozen burial ground
even winds rode colder stronger
riding winds harvest
empty
breathing rippeling rythm coldest night
breathing rythm coldest night
flamboyance burning an ancient deathcry
here where days were nights nights were magic nights
demons flying wings night
warriors death shall rise tonight
no more life sight
dreams are always deep
lyin alone darkness
i'd watch sleep at night
i'll let know
if those seeds had not been sown
can leave way just came
found no peace
empty
will come
you're one i've been calling
he asked drink by our fire
voice filled sweet beauty
sister knows

when see her sweet smile baby

does bother now all angry games played
'bout month ago i'd never seen face
wouldnt notice if wasnt there
well i'd get dressed i'd get out
you'd ask who you'd need kill make ok again

wondering when you'll home
no more saying goodbye last time again

oh if you'd come home
if only had slept alone
sin
hear breathe by side
cant breathe
oh am what am
until resting here
just want feel safe own skin
one long pause then begin oh look what cat's bought
take chance life again so let go
no angel but does mean cant live life
thought was funny when missed train
by loving more
when it's last day leaving helping pass
sometimes can feel suddenly it's gone
some days can tell truth some days just dont
but havent it's hard talk people all around
i'll tell every little detail day so will
man behind wire
dont try say goodbye if dont want
it's just thought only thought
dont learn buy
but if life rent dont learn buy
never stick around quite long enough make
travel world alone
cos nothing have truly mine

discovered something new
look no further happiness
i've let go
just dance just drink

auf einmal bin ich gar nicht mehr so gut gelaunt
er sagt er wohnt hamburg ich soll mit zu ihm nach haus
die tr geht auf heh doch das bist nicht du
den man ganz schnell hrt und dann wieder vergit
empty
nur fettes brot kommt auf den tisch
du ich hab' gehrt der winnetou der hat sich aufgehngt
als ich ein junger mann war sprang ich mal vom balkon
zwischen zombies und zyklopen verlor ich pltzlich den verstand
wir waren nicht darauf eingestellt auf ein kleines tchterlein
dann luft ein film seinem kopf whrend er den bleistift spitzt
alles klar alles klar
und das seid ihr wir und ihr
der urknall ist schon lange her
drum steig ein und sei dabei
durch raum und zeit
mehr hab ich nicht zu bieten was besond'res bin ich nicht
auf und davon einem raumschiff
ich hab die einzelteile stck fr stck im garten aufgebaut
auf und davon bin bald zurck
hast nie geduscht treibts keinen sprot und spa im bett macht's mit dir auch
du bist sogar zu bld um den rausschmi zu versteh'n
ich verzog mich mein zimmer und die ohren wurden rot
und immer bereit fr einen guten zweck
der egal wo er ist immer alleine aufwacht
ich frag mich natrlich wie du das schaffst
ich frag mich natrlich wie ich irgendwann mal
es ist nicht fair doch leider wahr
auf meiner zndapp weg von dir
blinker links
mit 45 km
volles rohr
und deine bilder an die wand zu schmeien
ich werde zukunft eben ohne dich leben
das ist die richtige nacht
der trinkt nur hopihalido und ist intelligent
ich komme nach hause
ich hab den schlssel verlor'n
du bist einfach gegangen
brachtest du licht hinein
pltzlich bist du nicht mehr da
trotzdem ist alles trostlos
das wei ich genau
doch du kannst mich nicht leiden
du hast garnichts kapiert ich sitz zu haus alleine rum
ich hab' alles probiert kino rote rosen
ich bin jahrelang wie blind durch mein leben gelaufen
einem menschen das zu geben was ich dir jetzt geben kann
uns mit 80 noch verliebt die augen zu schau'n
ich brauch dich wie 'ne droge jeden tag und jede nacht
drei fragezeichen und ein p steh'n mir im gesicht
denn einen personalausweis hat die kleine sicher nicht
fahrradprfung seepferdchen minigolfvereinsausweis zhlt alles nicht vor gericht
doch das ist mir zu wenig darum singe ich vom ficken
da es dinge gibt die sogar euch noch schockieren
hier geht es alles nur um's ficken hier geht es alles nur um's ficken
mal richtig zuzuhrn und mal zu berlegen
der zug fhrt nicht der schaffner sagt hier ist die endstation
da glaubt ich noch an dich und mich und unser groes glck
ich trum die ganze nacht sehr intensiv bis zum wecken
du ich wollte dir nicht weh tun nein das hatt' ich nicht im sinn
es ist zwei der frh die letzte bahn ging fnf vor eins
es ist zwei uhr der frh die letzte bahn ging fnf vor eins
wenn dich dein chef mit seiner frau erwischt
auf das dich das glck nie verlt
und was man nie vergessen darf ist ein blumenstrau
ne mundgeblas'ne waschmaschine aus propyethylen
und was sich sonst so wnschen lt
empty
immer nur woanders immer auf der flucht vor mir
ganz dicht bei dir die hand auf deinem bauch
ganz dicht bei dir die hand auf deinem bauch
gute nacht meine liebe
hat die nachbarin mich schon geseh'n
noch vor vierundzwanzig stunden
das wurde jetzt auch langsam zeit
das wurde jetzt auch langsam zeit
ohne rcksicht auf verluste
es gibt viel zuviele tage da kotzt ein alles an
du hast es selber der hand
halt dich fest
und stehen nach wie vor dazu auch wenn wir ihn nicht mehr spielen mgen ist er ein
den alle mchten gern auf heinzis heinzel schaun
jetzt singt er auch noch einer band und die heit
ohne dich wrde ich schlaftabletten fressen
du machst mich gro du machst mich klein
diese schlacht heute nacht wirst du verlier'n
ich liebe dich
ich liebe dich
und genau das wollt ich dir eigentlich immer schon mal sagen

er hat immer dran geglaubt da er alles richtig macht
hat keine freunde doch das ist so wenn du dir ein denkmal baust
irgendwann sind wir zu hause irgendwo gehr'n wir hin
du bist immer wunderschn ich hab 'ne fiese fratze
und es sieht nach kurzer zeit wie nach'm bombenangriff aus

marie traf klaus und klaus traf marie
sie schworen sich liebe und ich la dich nie allein

doch er sprhte ich lieb dich an die wand
von einem leben voller phantasie
als du angelaufen kamst um deinen prinzen anzubeten
wie es wohl wr' mit ihr zusammen im khlhaus zusammen zu kommen
ich ging auf's ganze und lud sie ein bei mir zu hause grilln bei kerzenschein
ihr freund stand auf und machte mir klar
hab' dabei nie geseh'n wer du wirklich bist
den hast du leider nur vor anderen gesehen
was hab ich dir genommen zuviel von deinem glck
du kriegst es nie mehr zurck
jetzt scheint mir die sonne brutal ins gesicht
dieser dummen sau
und auerdem die ganze nacht
spr' schon nervses zucken nicht nur im unterleib

die sicht auf uns hat nur die brandung
und hr' dem rauschen zu
spre mit den fingern wie auch du dir deine lippen leckst
der sturm klingt langsam aus
was das meer so alles sieht
weil er sich gleich darauf auf meine hose erbricht
endlich urlaub
auf der flucht vor der familie und der polizei

viel zuviel getrunken geraucht und gelacht
zu zweit einem schlafsack nem bett aus sand
bald bin ich alt heute verrckt und wenns nochmehr verrckte gibt
heute ist der erste tag vom rest unseres lebens
womit hab ich dich blo verdient du weit genau wie ich das mein
die liebe kommt die liebe geht doch leider merkt man oft zu spt
klangen ziemlich beschissen egal hauptsache laut
cd und clip produziert die fans die haben uns geliebt
der zeitung steht jeder kriegt was er verdient

stone serves as heart
eternal scheme act friendship means nothing
can only stand front broken mirror so long
even one word hatred
might withstand brutal scorching
all will bleed together
aging all while descending
let this act defiance
ignites swiftly
discontent vile wretched
am end am beginning life anew
as testament abstinence
why don t come back home everybody help sing now

as they toil without love
all beautiful
or trumpet call
or screamed words deaf
but did met no maker at all
kid myself
every word he speaks reeks failure
dark prophecy
time has been cruel
just were not gold enough
when cant catch breath
while sever regretful hands

why love did treat this way
where where mattered most
there's calm before storm
know been way all time
coming down sunny day
heaven has opened it's arms above our heads
heaven let love guide along way
let angels say hello
place where cool breezes blow
carry our heart's fantasy
middle sleepless night
can tell by way love
know dont take heaven anymore
it's nothing before
cant afford lose all again
here am love again
clinging arms again
