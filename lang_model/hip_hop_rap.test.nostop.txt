record rotation forms revolution
when was five years old realized there was road
all manpower four bucks an hour
dreamed about five years straight
people hungry blast dont even last
collecting scars from little neighborhood wars
thug mugs drugs he eventually bugs
means dead other words deceased
plus caps cops policeman drops
rough ghetto but jail he's jello
not lifestyle so made u turn
things used do how used act
given chance romance until sunlight
if then god then bring back again
but when wake up same love slave
so race space try replace pretty face
now all got total confusion
see what saying
give pen typa writer then
lyrics blast out or leave will cast out
kool g rap makes wonder
so called mc's will freeze so cold

horror terror errors zero
not sinner or an mc beginner
m yo real real fonkee yo yo what up g rap
all what word
amg kit his pockets mitt
or traveled beyond service area
all seats are stitched hemmed mcm gold rims
knew youngster met him at 14 very short scene
slipped became victim his own murder hunger

then crimey got locked up cookin rock up
when found out another soldier died territory
people audience kool g rap name

no mo' shifts hold enough chips toast criss
kicked up enough dust hurt cells
get mind grazed
corporations body casin watch where pacin
bodies get dropped while attend opera
i'll spark this barrel

silly ducks write rhymes feathers
developing pictures brain darkroom
rhymes so dope they're busting up virgin
course polo's boss crossfader
give prince i'mma show g wiz
donate science answer unexplained
definitely def five fingers death
just enter place see entertainer

listen sound dont dare look down
those who act courageous will get nauseous
you're slave sound wave
g speaks new technique fury
shut hell up man
biters are wanted animals hunted

g rap will make feel real deal
manager fly ty mr magic dj polo
musical outcome lyrical tantrum
this hip hop optical nerve
rhymes express
no position official
poetical recital vital tragic
corresponds message i've sent
never took break never made mistake
shoes are scoffed cos road gets rough
road aint yellow there aint no witches
gettin richer richer police took picture
if provoked let pistol smoke
squealers tells but dealer still sells
bombs were planted kids were kidnapped
troopers soldiers rollin boulders
one court date can turn an outlaw an inmate
pushin all buttons pullin all switches
because pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
but now reflection gone cry out
need love mate so can create
she loves she loves not
now whisper how much missed her
life bitter memories glitter
yo sometimes just gotta let go man
diction sparked from friction
wax vocal tracks all out whistles
effort method meditation
if you're square freeze into an ice cube
hot as tamale fire
mind real main course
handle man
yet 'em old fashioned
scintillating sultry stimulating sexy
but i'll always love true fan
i'ma rapper but dont rap
i'll give something can feel
since day was born was mission
arms open hopin kiss hug
as teen was scene cleaner than clean
wasnt diggin niggas so brother dig deep
but beat game but was war boy
heard some brothers say he aint best
turntables able start movement
other mc's want know
y does things do
yeah moe dee coming moe dee coming
just gimme pound cause bad bad bad mutha
cyanide deadly lethal
ask em who's best their shoulders start shruggin
some things wont do here's an example
expressing verbally or if it's
stimulating emmulating heat that's corally
now was never solo was always group
could go days
ha ha ha this time it's over boy
still got lock jock pitbull

long gone spheres dismal gleam
landscape ancient sleep deathlike silence
conquer time by possessing immortality
so it's heardthis became castle blackheim
miracles undeserted
they are tearing apart
puzzling constellation deathrune
darkened dungeon pale seek
unentered unseen
once there were spirits lurking serpent tounges
this winter an eternal season doom

lyrics by pete bellotte
it's moment you've been waiting
trust intuition dont rush into decision
this lady's serious make no mistake
truth just beginning
came this far without once hurting others
face eyes
he's got hold
wonder what name he answers
but all better keep distance
have hold
falling down from grace
he he king
he he king
no one else will around
'cause while world goes crazy
now know what ti's
hey love it's feeling cant describe
hey love it's feeling cant describe
tito he was ding streets
ah ah ah ah hey hey hey hey do do do do

what better way show care
you'll alive tomorrow if you're safe today
whispered i'd stupid not follow
holds time put action what told her
will secretly enjoy our time

take all can use
as make last promise
locked together
let show begin
an old man told
if dont remember anything
we'll sure remember this
could feel breeze from below
cause not alone anymore
an ocean
distant sun
were all ever wanted since all began
different light
shining
oh limelight

his sister's black but she sure nough pretty
'cause where he lives they dont use coloured people
living just enough city
was lost france love

may never same
running down face
chasing tea
narrow winding ways
streets down little italy
every step take alone

take chance greatest love hands

written by desmond child michael bolton

rebel without clue
so hold baby hold little longer

vision black no holding back
everyone loves mystery
he couldnt wait say goodbye
from march 1991 san remo song contest

forget her let her go
can see different eyes
they say love blind
every moment spend apart
i'll never never feel this way again
empty
someone's changing our lives
get out head get into heart
his handkerchief bulge slipping from middle
atmosphere erupts drunken liberators
smoke mist clears reveal drunken jimmy
they're getting so excited
just as long as there baby
oh baby need now
as long as one believe
left dry rain
bring from cold
have given all
will never see if
only one 5 exception
which dont have
choose moods fake when want
well arent glad
tonight dont let forever fade
oh need need loving
going through motions 1234
but can anyone
you're so thinly disguise
you'll sometimes look
going through motions

or might have known i'd never make wife
what wanted was another kind angel
written by ronnie scott steve wolfe
words whispered night
kind makes sing along
tell why they stay behind our lips
years come years may go
jealous words have no fear
lost feeling cant explain
another place another time
yesterday dreams
pick up pieces let live
yesterday dreams
were not blue appearing
though said was scared die
wouldnt have loved
non existence seemed
answered requesting
though said was scared die
feeling there's no way out without no way
look up sky see nothing but clouds
no matter how dark was always saw blue skies
because under surface friendly horizons
are women
are happy
you're everything hope
love was key peace mind
make feel
make feel
feel so sad cold inside

besoffen bin ich nur von dir

ich war schon viel viel zu lange hier ja
volles rohr
da du mich anrufst aber du rufst nicht an
oder ist da ein anderer der dir gefllt
das ist passiert das tu ich dir an
und er sagte lieber thomas es ist lang noch nicht zu spt
wenn es dir mal schlecht geht und du es noch nicht weit
ich steh vor der haustr
uh ich wnsch mir so da du mich einmal im schlaf berhrst
du warst mein sonnenschein
alles war wie ein traum
fr mich bist du unsterblich
die welt ist schlielich ganz schn
von groer liebe doch du kannst mich nicht leiden
denn du kannst mich nicht leiden

von einem leben voller phantasie
als du angelaufen kamst um deinen prinzen anzubeten
was wirklich von mir kommt hab' ich mich nie gefragt
der frage gefall ich dir der bin ich ausgewichen
was hab ich da vergeben was hab ich da gemacht
du kriegst es nie mehr zurck
ich hab zuviel gesoffen und ich hab zuviel gelacht
dafr geht's mir viel zu schlecht
du hast zuviel gesoffen
meine knie fhln sich an wie warmer babybrei
jetzt und hier mit ganzer kraft im siebten himmel loopings fliegen
ich nehm' mir meine cola chips und taschentcher
und jetzt bin ich traurig fhl mich verlassen
wahre liebe gibt es nur unter mnnern
wahrscheinlich kriegt sie jedesmal einen organismus
du kriechst wie ein wurm vor ihr blinder als du denkst
