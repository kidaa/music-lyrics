breaking down their ropes ladders stairs
free occupy same space differing degrees seedy commerce
silver screen throws gummy bears back attack
sick people pinky swearing concealed 6th fingers
sucks it's nauseating dawn crawling bugs
some said was food supply or shifting weather patterns
maybe it'd feel more majestic less fatty
was born 1 9 7 6 at biosfet hospital located long island ny

teenager beef passed alligator teeth extra curricular flagpole scrapping
used think i'd get hit by bus or something dumb dumber
if not back week tell crew said peace lay low
somebody's losing track their flesh bloods arrests rests

let blue screen bruised dream canopy
blue propaganda banners well sure i'll marine

ento viva intensamente sua enquanto d
mas no deixe ningum dominar sua
o que est dentro do seu corao da mente e da alma
chegando concluso de que morreu e no viveu
sem paz

what's name call guru that's man premier
makes much more than just an angry rebel
that's why stare point others cling
before get irate
so dont stop say hi muthafucka just die
thinking they are god
rhymes are organized crime
another minute
tryin get down
step bedlamite i'll prove word law
said before
when rock knots got props norm peterson
still here though
were illest man alive now reading eulogy
not sure about any these names

rome
dj p go all out y'knahmsayin
hood see oppressive genocide
dogg money key
verse 2 snoop dogg
disrespect things could get messy
guru this life wont have struggle no mo' no wont
can say getting kind greedy
most likely blunt as roll really steady
'cause gain interest lines city bank
some are wannabees some are wouldbees
dont brag about stuff did
chorus
guru it's time upset set up
but confident few are due redeem
while some'll rippin they crowd wildin
society puts squeeze mc's iron grips death
conceive make beast bleed enhance thoughts
unleash black rain
sendin out message peace everybody
yo music pops other cats made
big band beat was very neat unique
this music give tribute
guru music called jazz
through sweat blood toil
when satchmo blew audience knew
defining how beat could so complete
droppin bass all over place
he was another soul man
scheamin meaning
notes as words havent heard
yo
please approach bench
it's ok though cause from grey skies comes blue
course know role model
dont wanna see us come up dont wanna see us makin g's
example know this rich nigerian
there's war streets prepared men know best
i've been there i've seen how they make us fall victim
at sight 4 5th guess just might
so he thinks he got little fame
claimin respect just get rep
little shorty 3 8 yo he was inchin
but thing they know best where gun kept
he might loose park or lurking at train station
they'll long gone before kid recovers
kick rings everything ok
rolling troops his sons gansta figure
some brothers gotta go out just get are
you'll see shadow rather silhouette
win science fair so dont try scare
rhymes are peaceful yoga yo know
will take mic from make
but violence never first choice
yo her style worthwhile
someone who'll there whole nine
right now loungin man
can call later
when she aint there feel sad feel ill
wont just check
hey dont turn back
when cock back these lyrics y'all punks best ghost
gettin all up fuckin mix
know fuckin name rule all game
dark stages terror shatter dressing room mirror
demandin pay weak rhyme display
or thug gotta an mc this shit bugged
black talkin bout how much his mac spit
ignorance spreadin through streets was cancer
am effective here cause select clear
it's just true there's nothing so so cause know
rhymin climbin chill while attract
knowledge wisdom understanding
convey what say will awaken today
elite i'll defeat delete mistreat
lot rappers one time wonders
maybe soul you'd sell have mass appeal
lyrically def connecting complete mic wrecking
i've suffered setbacks but now makin greenbacks
so i'ma end this lecture betcha
nobody's invincible no plan foolproof
it's sabotage it's got ready bust
everybody else gonna get theirs too
dont fear things get severe everybody everywhere
anxieties wish could alleviate
so they say every dog has it's day
now if pull trigger these fully loaded lines
lot mc's act stupid
throw up he allah now divine saviors
lot rappers got flavor some got skills
religion rap r p
makes girls rear shake let set straight
plan keep rap real
aware swv right here
outro guru shug
sayin yo if let get busy youknowhati'msayin
competition come against you're losing
that's why people say much too much
just turn up system so beat can pounding
pumping kinda loud blazer or cherokee
cuz ones who were toughest still begged their knees
that's why everybody knows much too much
there was few times needed support
rap an art cant own no loops
so premier drops beat say verses
so can tell everyone jerking
hey yo come pass shit nigga
club crowded everyone's up here
system booming let bass increase
cause fame no thing get together hang

hustler's convention every night at dd
cause all gonna find sufferin pain
takes illest brother just get respect
riflery champs fellas start get real amped

record rotation forms revolution
when was five years old realized there was road
all manpower four bucks an hour
dreamed about five years straight
people hungry blast dont even last
collecting scars from little neighborhood wars
thug mugs drugs he eventually bugs
means dead other words deceased
plus caps cops policeman drops
rough ghetto but jail he's jello
not lifestyle so made u turn
things used do how used act
given chance romance until sunlight
if then god then bring back again
but when wake up same love slave
so race space try replace pretty face
now all got total confusion
see what saying
give pen typa writer then
lyrics blast out or leave will cast out
kool g rap makes wonder
so called mc's will freeze so cold
their latest release x2
dj's relax kneecaps collapse

they reported his fins 1010 west
horror terror errors zero
not sinner or an mc beginner
m yo real real fonkee yo yo what up g rap
all what word
amg kit his pockets mitt
or traveled beyond service area
all seats are stitched hemmed mcm gold rims
knew youngster met him at 14 very short scene
slipped became victim his own murder hunger
died at age 17 brooklyn east new york legend
then crimey got locked up cookin rock up
when found out another soldier died territory
people audience kool g rap name
supply data he's wheel operator
maker creator lyrical line
performer recites competitors ignite
activate musical device
better than snicker when comes snack
ly suffer as suffocate then start alienate
so dont even quote what write dolt
go ahead dare if think joking or playing
no mo' shifts hold enough chips toast criss
kicked up enough dust hurt cells
get mind grazed
corporations body casin watch where pacin
bodies get dropped while attend opera
i'll spark this barrel
smoking so bad i'mma cause pollution
silly ducks write rhymes feathers
developing pictures brain darkroom
rhymes so dope they're busting up virgin
course polo's boss crossfader
give prince i'mma show g wiz
donate science answer unexplained
definitely def five fingers death
just enter place see entertainer
rhymes thieves will seize enemies
polo works crossfader he's bricklayer
listen sound dont dare look down
those who act courageous will get nauseous
you're slave sound wave
g speaks new technique fury
shut hell up man
biters are wanted animals hunted
check out
material stitch by stitch decoration
g rap will make feel real deal
manager fly ty mr magic dj polo
musical outcome lyrical tantrum
this hip hop optical nerve
rhymes express
no position official
poetical recital vital tragic
corresponds message i've sent
never took break never made mistake
shoes are scoffed cos road gets rough
road aint yellow there aint no witches
gettin richer richer police took picture
if provoked let pistol smoke
squealers tells but dealer still sells
bombs were planted kids were kidnapped
troopers soldiers rollin boulders
one court date can turn an outlaw an inmate
pushin all buttons pullin all switches
because pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
but now reflection gone cry out
need love mate so can create
she loves she loves not
now whisper how much missed her
life bitter memories glitter
yo sometimes just gotta let go man
diction sparked from friction
wax vocal tracks all out whistles
effort method meditation
if you're square freeze into an ice cube
hot as tamale fire
mind real main course
handle man
yet 'em old fashioned
scintillating sultry stimulating sexy
but i'll always love true fan
i'ma rapper but dont rap
i'll give something can feel
since day was born was mission
arms open hopin kiss hug
as teen was scene cleaner than clean
wasnt diggin niggas so brother dig deep
but beat game but was war boy
heard some brothers say he aint best
turntables able start movement
other mc's want know
y does things do
yeah moe dee coming moe dee coming
just gimme pound cause bad bad bad mutha
cyanide deadly lethal
ask em who's best their shoulders start shruggin
some things wont do here's an example
expressing verbally or if it's
stimulating emmulating heat that's corally
now was never solo was always group
could go days
ha ha ha this time it's over boy
still got lock jock pitbull
swallow yea finish burp
how can one man so dumb
brain fatigue you're out league
so who's got no style look at profile
man who lost one one too often
chorus
type guy oh god
label ledger left leper liar
yo tell 'em how fell l hard as hell
talking kindergartian
cause treat beaver basketball court
they're materialistic unrealistic

all ladies seem sing same old song
maybe should down cause know what time
about homeboy from back day
one thing went wrong rick got obsessed

sending dwarfs back birth
hail ravenlord
he would soon facing lurkers time life death
lurker time cried out blackheims fooling strategem
stormed over fields might hand
coloured pictures so dusty old
oath swore
make sure evil will rise
winds from our northstar striking shores oh so far
striking upon hillsides
web moonshine
through moonshine portals leatherwinged serpents fly
long gone spheres dismal gleam
landscape ancient sleep deathlike silence
conquer time by possessing immortality
so it's heardthis became castle blackheim
miracles undeserted
they are tearing apart
puzzling constellation deathrune
darkened dungeon pale seek
unentered unseen
once there were spirits lurking serpent tounges
this winter an eternal season doom
nowhere hide time has come
might have been singer
criminal who drink champaign
everyone i'll never meet
will not turn again
dreams are always deep
lyin alone darkness
i'd watch sleep at night
i'll let know
if those seeds had not been sown
can leave way just came
found no peace
whao ao
will come
you're one i've been calling
he asked drink by our fire
voice filled sweet beauty
sister knows
shall return
shall return love christmas day
he doesnt want lose this memory
he'll tell her what he's done today
only part life him that's safe
do have little time
do have little time
if should stop while
if have little time
this morning
you're too close
safe hands
nothing wrong
if dont believe love
when i've been here just one day
i'll make weaker weaker still
everything clear everything new
so pretty
when see her sweet smile baby
when see her sweet smile baby
does bother now all angry games played
'bout month ago i'd never seen face
wouldnt notice if wasnt there
well i'd get dressed i'd get out
you'd ask who you'd need kill make ok again
wont cry cos will wait until
wondering when you'll home
no more saying goodbye last time again
had grafton street
oh if you'd come home
if only had slept alone
sin
hear breathe by side
cant breathe
oh am what am
until resting here
just want feel safe own skin
one long pause then begin oh look what cat's bought
take chance life again so let go
no angel but does mean cant live life
thought was funny when missed train
by loving more
when it's last day leaving helping pass
sometimes can feel suddenly it's gone
some days can tell truth some days just dont
but havent it's hard talk people all around
i'll tell every little detail day so will
man behind wire
dont try say goodbye if dont want
it's just thought only thought
dont learn buy
but if life rent dont learn buy
never stick around quite long enough make
travel world alone
cos nothing have truly mine
cos nothing have truly mine
danny's not eating he's drinking sleeping
but as sun sets mary it's rising him
i've got clothes case it's hot
cat at home thinks it's dog
man at home who likes think
it's life
lover's gone
or coming home an empty house
well i've been gently drifting
settled now
felt same today
never wanna say it's love
oh have returned somber grace
under these white northern skies
feel meek leading blind
one step too far
dont let no one guide

it's always one step too far
saw

tomorrow's back work down sanitation
two weeks away all takes change time around by falling
you'll have tell them again again

thought would give just one more chance
being comforted by strangers you'll never need know
even day this when you're crawling floor
take time catch breathe choose moment
it's high time left there
if wont let fall
if find one day find some freedom relief
i'd feel belong
summer's come too soon still missing

whenever need lover
whenever need good times bad
pick up when were falling down
when needed shoulder cry
gave away heart knew just where stood
never let down when wee full fear
no one cares about
are always oh mind
how many tears can hide
chorus
just cant disguise
wild love
wild love
asked not call phone
but not kind angel heaven knows
only honky tonk angel
doesnt matter where are they touch
words words mean say
sometimes linger
so many reasons why
time passes by so slow
standing quietly going insane
yesterday dreams
but dont even see what mean
always aware we're gonna make above
yesterday dreams
was all because
women such as
happened sunday
find more
god was there pass
women such as
pass love
oh sick tired yesterday
know how hard keep from crying out loud
but still whole world can see
all these illusions wont cover pride
dont need nobody
written by preston fisher

so many times before
wont see cry please baby baby
wont see cry please baby baby
here stand alone dreams
you're breaking heart again

cool blue eyes are killing
greatest all
just thought drives wild
lose this love would crime
another rainy morning
one who keeps goin
it's written thousand years ago
if you're lookin chance one good payday

when world's gone crazy love's so hard handle
said aint no fun
all ever wanted was baby arms

warum wir dann den text hier verffentlichen nun wir haben diesen titel gemacht
die kinder lieben ihn und besonders die frauen
ja die eltern meinen zu wissen ihr sohn ist nicht normal
onanie bin so allein
heute wei ich sie hatte recht
ich zhl jeden kilometer sekunden auf der uhr
jetzt steh ich an der strae und halt meinen daumen raus
ich fahr den straengraben und hau mir die nase platt
wollt mich sofort dich verlieben doch du willst mich nicht
schwester g hat die szene abgecheckt
die elastischen fnf haben die hits gebookt
wir machen einfach weiter
ach stephan daran kann man sich gewhn
alles nur weil ich dich liebe aber du siehst mich nicht
die gelegenheit war gnstig und ich lud sie zu mir ein
alles klar alles klar alles einfach zu versteh'n
und kurz vor 10 geht er ins bett
wir haben alles was wir brauchen
alle sind so hektisch drauf
wir dsen rund um die planeten
durch raum und zeit
eieieieiei
mich wrd' man nicht mal bemerken wrd' ich nackig der u bahn steh'n
auf und davon
bring dir viele wunderschne sterne mit
du bist nicht schn du hast kein geld und dein iq lt sich auch kaum messen
hast nichts zu tun hngst planlos rum und richtig putzen kannst du auch nicht
auszieh'n auszieh'n auszieh'n du ziehst jetzt endlich aus
es gibt sogenannte dildos fr die dame mit niveau
und die kaputten
verzichte mittlerweile schon aufs bier
denn es ist viel zu schn
ich hab mich total dich verliebt
oh blinker links und alles klar
wie es ihn ab und zu mal gibt
oh blinker links und ab dafr
oh blinker links
ja ich sitze hier und warte schon lang
hast du angst vor mir angst vor dir selbst
denn seit gestern bin ich wieder neu verschossen
mein vater war mal grtner ner universitt
das sind wohl die nebenwirkungen meiner geistigen potenz egal
obwohl ich wirklich viel getrunken hab
und ich hoffe da du das da oben sprst
ich vermisse dein lachen
uh ich wnsch mir so da du mich einmal im schlaf berhrst
der erinnerung
wr ja auch schade
ich trum von dir ich trum' von uns beiden
ich geh' doch zu mirko mist
ich wrde alles fr dich tun
dabei hab ich immer nur auf treibsand gebaut
einmal um die erde nur wir zwei
die zeit ist viel zu schade um sich falsch zu versteh'n
keine and're frau hat es jemals geschafft und hat mich so wie du abhngig gemacht
der laden die leute das bierchen am tresen
kneift meinen hintern setzt sich auf meinen scho
und danach der mammi illegal ein stndchen bringen
ich knnt natrlich auch ber wahre liebe singen
zugegeben diese methode ist nicht fair
sogar die npd wird deutschland akzeptiert
das einzige was euch auf die plame bringt
zuerst hat's mich geschockt denn ich hab dich geliebt
und ich tiger durch die straen ganz so als such ich dich
ja diese fotografie von dir aus meinem portemonnaie
ja diese fotografie von dir aus meinem portemonnaie
wenn du jetzt mit mir sauer bist dann hab ich wohl selber schuld
und jetzt steh ich auf'm bahnhof und du sitzt zuhaus und weinst
wenn du mit deiner ente einen lkw krachst
alles liebe alles gute
er geht zurck ins zimmer und ich warte vor der tr
dum da da
hipp hipp hurra du hast geburtstag
hipp hipp hurra du hast geburtstag
nie verlt
alle haben angst sich anzuschaun als nhme man ihnen etwas fort
ich werde niemals aufhr'n verliebt dich zu sein
gute nacht meine liebe
und hab laut gelacht
das wurde jetzt auch langsam zeit
da ich noch am leben bin ist wohl reines glck denn
weil ich gedanken ganz tief bei dir bin
achtung fertig gnadenlos
diese nacht wird gnadenlos
mach jetzt keine kompromisse
ein leben vor dem tod ist mglich
ohne dich knnt' ich mein ganzes leben vergessen
denn ich wei ganz genau es wird nie langeweile geben
ich drck auf den roten knopf dann wird sie explodier'n
oder besser gesagt ich liebe dich
ich liebe dich
ich liebe dich
sind mnner wirklich alles schweine knnen frauen besser
nter seinem heiligenschein

autofahrn
wirkt viagra auch bei frauen und hat uns gildo wirklich lieb
oh manchmal hab ich das gefhl ich lebe hier total verkehrt
ja gegen den groen hunger wird frisches obst organisert
wir haben endlich urlaub
auf der strae liegt ein mann er hat ne zukunft mal gehabt
da geht ein mann im grauen anzug mit nem koffer der faust
sicher wird sich alles finden vielleicht auch ein sinn
ich habe einen groen hund du hast 'ne kleine katze
ich putze und ich schrubbe und dann kommst du nach haus'
willst du eine neue nase haben
und lade nur noch promis ein
ja wenn ich gro bin werd' ich schnheitschirurg
dann nenn ich mich doktor frankenstein
und lade nur noch promis ein
die anderen frauen waren neidisch denn die wurden nie gefragt
es war ein groer anfang doch dann war der ofen aus
doch jede frau die mit mir im bett war die glaubt nicht da das stimmt
der fleischertresen das war ihre welt ich hab' mir immer vorgestellt
denn jedesmal wenn ich den laden betrat da fing' die hunde draussen an zu belln
ich griff ihr ganz frech an die brust
die reden zwar nur bldsinn doch sie wollen alles glauben
und auf gitarristen fliegen sie scharen
ihr seid arm das ist hart ich bin reich das ist fair
ich glaube nur an sachen die ich auch kaufen kann
mnner wie wir
mnner wie wir zeigen dem leben die zhne
oh mnner mnnermnnermnnermnnermnner
und heute suft er lieber bier
und jeder tag sollte der schnste sein
war ich schon lange hier und du bist auf mich draufgetreten
hab mich geqult mit fragen ob es das nun wirklich ist
meinen charme den ich hab den sahst du nur mit trnen
ich kann dich nie verlieren hab ich immer gedacht
nie mehr zurck
und auerdem hab' ich wieder mit roswitha rumgemacht
vielleicht bist du bei wolfgang
und du hast zuviel gelacht
ich hab dich am telefon ich wei es ist soweit
ich bin vllig aufgedreht ich glaub' ich liebe dich
wirklichkeit steht sie auf pferde kein kommentar
du machst dich vor aller welt gnadenlos zum trottel
rette die erde geheimer mission schie alle pferde am besten auf den mond
so eine wie die gisela so eine richtig nette
und du bist schuld daran
drei tage spter sagten wir vor'm priester ja
doch meine liebe das ist jetzt vorbei
ich wei genau mit dir werd ich nicht alt
fr sie war ich doch sowieso immer nur der letzte arsch
kannich endlich wieder rauchen im wohnzimmer
dann bist du ein frauenheld
jetzt schlgt dein mann dich grn und blau
und lade nur noch promis ein
ja wenn ich gro bin
manchmal bin ich etwas angestrengt vom leben
wo man nichts mehr wo man nichts mehr sagen kann
das leben ist manchmal hart blutige kmpfe und mieser verrat
ja so richtig nett ist es nur im bett nur im bett ist es so richtig nett
ein nackter rcken kann auch mcken entzcken
wir hassen jede arbeit und gammeln nur herum
wir zerschlagen eure werte und wollen anarchie
dann wrst du platt wie ne flunder und ich dein bezwinger
und dein bldes lachen verging dir auch
der sand auf deiner haut schmeckt nach meer
und ich ich hab dich lieb
das meer spielt
und hr' dem rauschen zu
das meer spielt unser lied
doch meine koffer sind afrika
u u urlaub
jajajaja ich habe urlaub
so herr ltsch fiebermessen hose 'runter popo hoch
tjaich dachte da ich als echter mann
oh wenns kommt dann kommt's
und war'n auch sonst sehr sprlich verhllt
da hast du keine chance
dann ging' sie beide lachend raus
da hast du keine chance
lalala
ich komm auch sehr gut ohne dich klar
und selbst im traum hab ich mich von dir befreit
ich war besser der schule doch du warst unser held
uns're trume sind lngst gro geworden doch lange nicht so wie wir dachten
wir ha'm uns wiedergefunden
und feierst einfach weiter und schaust nicht raus
und pltzlich singt der wind dieses kleine lied
heute ist der erste tag vom rest unseres lebens
schlafen knn wir immer noch wenn wir der kiste liegen
hab mich so oft dich verliebt selbst deine schwchen mag ich gern
wenn du es merkst dann schrei mich an damit ich mich erinnern kann
standen stundenlang vor'm spiegel und sangen unser lied
wir sind illegal wir sind illegal
wir sind illegal wir sind illegal
