a lover's complaint
from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
a plaintful story from a sistering vale
my spirits to attend this double voice accorded
and down i laid to list the sad tuned tale
ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
tearing of papers breaking rings a twain
storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain
upon her head a platted hive of straw
whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
the carcass of beauty spent and done
time had not scythed all that youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage
some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age
oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
which on it had conceited characters
laundering the silken figures in the brine
that seasond woe had pelleted in tears
as often shrieking undistinguish'd woe
in clamours of all size both high and low
sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
as they did battery to the spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
to the orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right on anon their gazes lend
to every place at once and nowhere fix'd
the mind and sight distractedly commix'd
proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
for some untuck'd descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
some in her threaden fillet still did bide
and true to bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided in loose negligence
a thousand favours from a maund she drew
of amber crystal and of beaded jet
which one by one she in a river threw
like usury applying wet to wet
or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
of folded schedules had she many a one
which she perused sigh'd tore and gave the flood
crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
found yet moe letters sadly pennd in blood
with sleided silk feat and affectedly
these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
and often kiss'd and often 'gan to tear
cried 'o false blood thou register of lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seem'd more black and damned here'
this said in top of rage the lines she rents
big discontent so breaking their contents
a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
the swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
and privileged by age desires to know
in brief the grounds and motives of her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
and comely distant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance with his hearing to divide
if that from him there may be aught applied
'tis promised in the charity of age
'father' she says 'though in me you behold
the injury of many a blasting hour
let it not tell your judgment i am old
not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower
fresh to myself if i had self applied
love to myself and to no love beside
'but woe is me too early i attended
of one by nature's outwards so commended
that maidens' eyes stuck over all his face
love lack'd a dwelling and made him her place
and when in his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged and newly deified
'his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
and every light occasion of the wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
what's sweet to do to do will aptly find
for on his visage was in little drawn
what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn
'small show of man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but to appear
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
whose bare out bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear
yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear
and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
if best were as it was or best without
for maiden tongued he was and thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such a storm
as oft 'twixt may and april is to see
when winds breathe sweet untidy though they be
his rudeness so with his authorized youth
did livery falseness in a pride of truth
'well could he ride and often men would say
'that horse his mettle from his rider takes
proud of subjection noble by the sway
he makes'
and controversy hence a question takes
whether the horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by the well doing steed
'but quickly on this side the verdict went
his real habitude gave life and grace
to appertainings and to ornament
accomplish'd in himself not in his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
pieced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so on the tip of his subduing tongue
all kinds of arguments and question deep
all replication prompt and reason strong
for his advantage still did wake and sleep
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
he had the dialect and different skill
catching all passions in his craft of will
'that he did in the general bosom reign
to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
in personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitch'd ere he desire have granted
and dialogued for him what he would say
ask'd their own wills and made their wills obey
'many there were that did his picture get
to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
like fools that in th' imagination set
the goodly objects which abroad they find
and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have that never touch'd his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
my woeful self that did in freedom stand
and was my own fee simple not in part
what with his art in youth and youth in art
threw my affections in his charmed power
reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
demand of him nor being desired yielded
finding myself in honour so forbid
with safest distance i mine honour shielded
experience for me many bulwarks builded
of proofs new bleeding which remaind the foil
of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunnd by precedent
the destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples 'gainst her own content
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
for when we rage advice is often seen
by blunting us to make our wits more keen
'nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
that we must curb it upon others' proof
to be forbod the sweets that seem so good
for fear of harms that preach in our behoof
o appetite from judgment stand aloof
the one a palate hath that needs will taste
'for further i could say 'this mans untrue'
and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
heard where his plants in others' orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
thought characters and words merely but art
and bastards of his foul adulterate heart
'and long upon these terms i held my city
till thus he gan besiege me 'gentle maid
and be not of my holy vows afraid
that's to ye sworn to none was ever said
for feasts of love i have been calld unto
till now did ne'er invite nor never woo
''all my offences that abroad you see
are errors of the blood none of the mind

where neither party is nor true nor kind
they sought their shame that so their shame did find
by how much of me their reproach contains
''among the many that mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd

''look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
of grief and blushes aptly understood
in bloodless white and the encrimsond mood
effects of terror and dear modesty
encamp'd in hearts but fighting outwardly
''and lo behold these talents of their hair
with twisted metal amorously impleach'd
i have received from many a several fair

whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
but kept cold distance and did thence remove
''but o my sweet what labour is't to leave
the thing we have not mastering what not strives
playing the place which did no form receive
playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves

''when thou impressest what are precepts worth
how coldly those impediments stand forth

w s
a funeral elegy
since time and his predestinated end
abridged the circuit of his hopeful days
the good endeavors of deserving praise
5 what memorable monument can last
whereon to build his never blemished name
but his own worth wherein his life was graced
sith as that ever he maintained the same
oblivion in the darkest day to come
10 when sin shall tread on merit in the dust
cannot rase out the lamentable tomb
of his short lived deserts but still they must
claim fit respect that they in every limb
15 remembering what he was with comfort then
may pattern out one truly good by him
for he was truly good if honest care
of harmless conversation may commend
a life free from such stains as follies are
20 ill recompensed only in his end
nor can the tongue of him who loved him least
if there can be minority of love
of many men in steady faith reprove
25 his constant temper in the equal weight
of thankfulness and kindness truth doth leave
sufficient proof he was in every right
as kind to give as thankful to receive
the curious eye of a quick brained survey
30 could scantly find a mote amidst the sun
of his too shortened days or make a prey
of any faulty errors he had done
and spite of malice but for that he had
35 warrant enough in his own innocence
against the sting of some in nature bad
yet who is he so absolutely blest
that lives encompassed in a mortal frame
sometime in reputation not oppressed
40 by some in nothing famous but defame
such in the bypath and the ridgeway lurk
that leads to ruin in a smooth pretense
of singleness not tending to offense
45 whose very virtues are not to detract
whiles hope remains of gain base fee of slaves
despising chiefly men in fortunes wracked
but death to such gives unremembered graves
now therein lived he happy if to be
50 free from detraction happiness it be
his younger years gave comfortable hope
to hope for comfort in his riper youth
of education bettered in his truth
55 those noble twins of heaven infused races
learning and wit refined in their kind
did jointly both in their peculiar graces
enrich the curious temple of his mind
indeed a temple in whose precious white
60 sat reason by religion overswayed
teaching his other senses with delight
how piety and zeal should be obeyed
wasting his best of time but so content
65 with reasons golden mean to make defense
against the assault of youth's encouragement
as not the tide of this surrounding age
when now his father's death had freed his will
could make him subject to the drunken rage
70 of such whose only glory is their ill
he from the happy knowledge of the wise
draws virtue to reprove secured fools
to spend his spring of days in sacred schools
75 here gave he diet to the sick desires
that day by day assault the weaker man
and with fit moderation still retires
from what doth batter virtue now and then
but that i not intend in full discourse
80 to progress out his life i could display
a good man in each part exact and force
the common voice to warrant what i say
that full of days he might have lived to see
85 the grave in peace the times that should succeed
had been best speaking witnesses with me
whose conversation so untouched did move
respect most in itself as who would scan
his honesty and worth by them might prove
90 he was a kind true perfect gentleman
not in the outside of disgraceful folly
courting opinion with unfit disguise
to unbeseeming blushless vanities
95 but suiting so his habit and desire
as that his virtue was his best attire
not in the waste of many idle words
cared he to be heard talk nor in the float
of fond conceit such as this age affords
100 by vain discourse upon himself to dote
for his becoming silence gave such grace
to his judicious parts as what he spake
than busy questions such as talkers make
105 and though his qualities might well deserve
just commendation yet his furnished mind
such harmony of goodness did preserve
as nature never built in better kind
knowing the best and therefore not presuming
110 in knowing but for that it was the best
ever within himself free choice resuming
of true perfection in a perfect breast
the one to lodge the other both like framed
115 for fair conditions guests that soonest win
applause in generality well famed
if trim behavior gestures mild discreet
endeavors modest speech beseeming mirth
true friendship active grace persuasion sweet
120 delightful love innated from his birth
acquaintance unfamiliar carriage just
offenseless resolution wished sobriety
unburthened conscience unfeigned piety
125 if these or all of these knit fast in one
can merit praise then justly may we say
not any from this frailer stage is gone
whose name is like to live a longer day
though not in eminent courts or places great
130 for popular concourse yet in that soil
where he enjoyed his birth life death and seat
which now sits mourning his untimely spoil
for private persons in their private home
135 as those descended from illustrious blood
in public view of greatness whence they come
though i rewarded with some sadder taste
of knowing shame by feeling it have proved
my country's thankless misconstruction cast
140 upon my name and credit both unloved
by some whose fortunes sunk into the wane
of plenty and desert have strove to win
my reputation with a witless sin
145 yet time the father of unblushing truth
may one day lay ope malice which hath crossed it
and right the hopes of my endangered youth
purchasing credit in the place i lost it
even in which place the subject of the verse
150 unhappy matter of a mourning style
which now that subject's merits doth rehearse
had education and new being while
amongst the all of all that lived there
155 for that his actions did so wholly suit
with worthiness still memorable here
the many hours till the day of doom
will not consume his life and hapless end
for should he lie obscured without a tomb
160 time would to time his honesty commend
whiles parents to their children will make known
and they to their posterity impart
by a hand guided by a cruel heart
165 whereof as many as shall hear that sadness
will blame the one's hard fate the other's madness
whiles such as do recount that tale of woe
told by remembrance of the wisest heads
will in the end conclude the matter so
170 as they will all go weeping to their beds
for when the world lies wintered in the storms
of fearful consummation and lays down
expecting ever to be overthrown
175 when the proud height of much affected sin
shall ripen to a head and in that pride
end in the miseries it did begin
and fall amidst the glory of his tide
then in a book where every work is writ
180 shall this mans actions be revealed to show
the gainful fruit of well employed wit
which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe
never untrue where once he love professed
185 which is a miracle in men one saith
long sought though rarely found and he is best
who can make friendship in those times of change
admired more for being firm than strange
when those weak houses of our brittle flesh
190 shall ruined be by death our grace and strength
youth memory and shape that made us fresh
cast down and utterly decayed at length
and we low leveled in a narrow grave
195 what can we leave behind us but a name
which by a life well led may honor have
such honor o thou youth untimely lost
thou didst deserve and hast for though thy soul
hath took her flight to a diviner coast
200 yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole
in every heart sealed up in every tongue
fit matter to discourse no day prevented
of all alike beloved and lamented
205 and i here to thy memorable worth
in this last act of friendship sacrifice
my love to thee which i could not set forth
in any other habit of disguise
although i could not learn whiles yet thou wert
210 to speak the language of a servile breath
my truth stole from my tongue into my heart
which shall not thence be sundered but in death
that had not made thee know how much i prized thee
215 but that mine error was as yet it is
to think love best in silence for i sized thee
by what i would have been not only ready
in telling i was thine but being so
by some effect to show it he is steady
220 who seems less than he is in open show
since then i still reserved to try the worst
which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me
while thou hadst life i took this task upon me
225 to register with mine unhappy pen
such duties as it owes to thy desert
and set thee as a president to men
and limn thee to the world but as thou wert
not hired as heaven can witness in my soul
230 by vain conceit to please such ones as know it
nor servile to be liked free from control
which pain to many men i do not owe it
fair lovely branch too soon cut off to thee
235 my constant and irrefragable vow
as had it chanced thou mightst have done to me
but that no merit strong enough of mine
had yielded store to thy well abled quill
whereby t' enroll my name as this of thine
240 how s'ere enriched by thy plenteous skill
here then i offer up to memory
the value of my talent precious man
though 't be not as i would 'tis as i can
245 in minds from whence endeavor doth proceed
a ready will is taken for the deed
yet ere i take my longest last farewell
from thee fair mark of sorrow let me frame
some ampler work of thank wherein to tell
250 what more thou didst deserve than in thy name
and free thee from the scandal of such senses
as in the rancor of unhappy spleen
comparing by thy death what thou hast been
255 so in his mischiefs is the world accursed
it picks out matter to inform the worst
the willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes
of men enwrapped in an earthy veil
makes them most ignorantly exercise
260 and yield to humor when it doth assail
whereby the candle and the body's light
darkens the inward eyesight of the mind
of that same ignorance which makes them blind
265 hence conster they with corrupt commentaries
proceeding from a nature as corrupt
the text of malice which so often varies
as 'tis by seeming reason underpropped
o whither tends the lamentable spite
270 of this world's teenful apprehension
which understands all things amiss whose light
shines not amidst the dark of their dissension
soothed not the current of besotted fashion
275 nor could disgest as some loose mimics can
an empty sound of overweening passion
so much to be made servant to the base
and sensual aptness of disunioned vices
to purchase commendation by disgrace
280 whereto the world and heat of sin entices
but in a safer contemplation
secure in what he knew he ever chose
by shunning all invitements strange of those
285 whose illness is the necessary praise
must wait upon their actions only rare
in being rare in shame which strives to raise
their name by doing what they do not care
as if the free commission of their ill
290 were even as boundless as their prompt desires
only like lords like subjects to their will
which their fond dotage ever more admires
ruling the little ordered commonwealth
295 of his own self with honor to the law
that gave peace to his bread bread to his health
which ever he maintained in sweet content
and pleasurable rest wherein he joyed
a monarchy of comfort's government
300 never until his last to be destroyed
for in the vineyard of heaven favored learning
where he was double honored in degree
had taught him in both fortunes to be free
305 whence now retired home to a home indeed
the home of his condition and estate
he well provided 'gainst the hand of need
whence young men sometime grow unfortunate
his disposition by the bonds of unity
310 so fastened to his reason that it strove
with understanding's grave immunity
to purchase from all hearts a steady love
proportionable note of what he was
315 than that he was so constant to his friends
as he would no occasion overpass
which might make known his unaffected care
in all respects of trial to unlock
his bosom and his store which did declare
320 that christ was his and he was friendship's rock
a rock of friendship figured in his name
foreshowing what he was and what should be
in every act of perfect amity
325 though in the complemental phrase of words
he never was addicted to the vain
of boast such as the common breath affords
he was in use most fast in tongue most plain
nor amongst all those virtues that forever
330 adorned his reputation will be found
one greater than his faith which did persever
where once it was protested alway sound
the rage which wrought his end for had he been
335 slacker in love he had been longer lived
and not oppressed by wrath's unhappy sin
by wrath's unhappy sin which unadvised
gave death for free good will and wounds for love
pity it was that blood had not been prized
340 at higher rate and reason set above
most unjust choler which untimely drew
destruction on itself and most unjust
as time can boast of both for love and trust
345 so henceforth all great glory to his blood
shall be but seconds to him being good
the wicked end their honor with their sin
in death which only then the good begin
lo here a lesson by experience taught
350 for men whose pure simplicity hath drawn
their trust to be betrayed by being caught
within the snares of making truth a pawn
without true proof and knowledge of a friend
355 sincere in singleness of heart adventers
to give fit cause ere love begin to end
his unfeigned friendship where it least was sought
him to a fatal timeless ruin brought
whereby the life that purity adorned
360 with real merit by this sudden end
is in the mouth of some in manner scorned
made questionable for they do intend
mistook if not observed writ long ago
365 when men were only led by reasons law
that such as is the end the life proves so
thus he who to the universal lapse
gave sweet redemption offering up his blood
to conquer death by death and loose the traps
370 of hell even in the triumph that it stood
he thus for that his guiltless life was spilt
by death which was made subject to the curse
in his pure life for that his end was worse
375 but o far be it our unholy lips
should so profane the deity above
as thereby to ordain revenging whips
against the day of judgment and of love
the hand that lends us honor in our days
380 may shorten when it please and justly take
our honor from us many sundry ways
as best becomes that wisdom did us make
of all that ever were begotten yet
385 was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot
sent innocent to be in heaven set
whose fame the angels in melodious choirs
still witness to the world then why should he
well profited in excellent desires
390 be more rebuked who had like destiny
those saints before the everlasting throne
who sit with crowns of glory on their heads
all to their joys in quiet on their beds
395 but tasted of the sour bitter scourge
of torture and affliction ere they gained
those blessings which their sufferance did urge
whereby the grace fore promised they attained
let then the false suggestions of the froward
400 building large castles in the empty air
by suppositions fond and thoughts untoward
issues of discontent and sick despair
that may disprove their malice and confound
405 uncivil loose opinions which insert
their souls into the roll that doth unsound
betraying policies and show their brains
unto their shame ridiculous whose scope
is envy whose endeavors fruitless pains
410 in nothing surely prosperous but hope
and that same hope so lame so unprevailing
it buries self conceit in weak opinion
their vain designs on whom want hath dominion
415 such and of such condition may devise
which way to wound with defamations spirit
close lurking whisper's hidden forgeries
his taintless goodness his desertful merit
but whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely
420 upon assured knowledge his repute
and estimation shall be rumored clearly
in equal worth time shall to time renew 't
forever closes up the unrespected
425 who when they die die all shall not entomb
his pleading best perfections as neglected
they to his notice in succeeding years
shall speak for him when he shall lie below
when nothing but his memory appears
430 of what he was then shall his virtues grow
his being but a private man in rank
and yet not ranked beneath a gentleman
which wise posterity shall give him then
435 for nature and his therein happy fate
ordained that by his quality of mind
t' ennoble that best part although his state
were to a lower blessedness confined
blood pomp state honor glory and command
440 without fit ornaments of disposition
are in themselves but heathenish and profaned
and much more peaceful is a mean condition
feeds on the bread of rest and takes delight
445 to look upon the labors it hath spent
for its own sustenance both day and night
whiles others plotting which way to be great
how to augment their portion and ambition
do toil their giddy brains and ever sweat
450 for popular applause and power's commission
but one in honors like a seeled dove
whose inward eyes are dimmed with dignity
and seeks to be secure by mounting high
455 whence when he falls who did erewhile aspire
falls deeper down for that he climbed higher
now men who in lower region live
exempt from danger of authority
have fittest times in reasons rules to thrive
460 not vexed with envy of priority
and those are much more noble in the mind
than many that have nobleness by kind
nor can we make a proper challenge to them
465 but virtues and perfections in our powers
proceed most truly from us if we do them
respective titles or a gracious style
with all what men in eminence possess
are without ornaments to praise them vile
470 the beauty of the mind is nobleness
and such as have that beauty well deserve
eternal characters that after death
so that their glory die not with their breath
475 else what avails it in a goodly strife
upon this face of earth here to contend
the good t' exceed the wicked in their life
should both be like obscured in their end
until which end there is none rightly can
480 be termed happy since the happiness
depends upon the goodness of the man
which afterwards his praises will express
of your best days and see how unexpected
485 death can betray your jollity to ruth
when death you think is least to be respected
the person of this model here set out
had all that youth and happy days could give him
yet could not all encompass him about
490 against th' assault of death who to relieve him
strook home but to the frail and mortal parts
of his humanity but could not touch
above fate's reach his singleness was such
495 so that he dies but once but doubly lives
once in his proper self then in his name
predestinated time who all deprives
could never yet deprive him of the same
and had the genius which attended on him
500 been possibilited to keep him safe
against the rigor that hath overgone him
he had been to the public use a staff
which guides to doing well wherein so few
505 the proneness of this age to error hath
informed rightly in the courses true
as then the loss of one whose inclination
stove to win love in general is sad
so specially his friends in soft compassion
510 do feel the greatest loss they could have had
amongst them all she who those nine of years
lived fellow to his counsels and his bed
feel what distemperature this chance hath bred
515 the chaste embracements of conjugal love
who in a mutual harmony consent
are so impatient of a strange remove
as meager death itself seems to lament
and weep upon those cheeks which nature framed
520 to be delightful orbs in whom the force
of lively sweetness plays so that ashamed
death often pities his unkind divorce
well worthy to be termed a rudeness rather
525 for in his life his love was so unfeigned
as he was both an husband and a father
the one in firm affection and the other
in careful providence which ever strove
with joint assistance to grace one another
530 with every helpful furtherance of love
but since the sum of all that can be said
can be but said that he was good which wholly
in praise of virtue and reproach of folly
535 his due deserts this sentence on him gives
he died in life yet in his death he lives
now runs the method of this doleful song
in accents brief to thee o thou deceased
to whom those pains do only all belong
540 as witnesses i did not love thee least
for could my worthless brain find out but how
to raise thee from the sepulcher of dust
of life with me and heaven be counted just
545 if to a supplicating soul it would
give life anew by giving life again
where life is missed whereby discomfort should
right his old griefs and former joys retain
which now with thee are leaped into thy tomb
550 and buried in that hollow vault of woe
expecting yet a more severer doom
than time's strict flinty hand will let 'em know
and reckoned up in a true measured score
555 those perfect graces which were ever wont
to wait on thee alive i ask no more
but shall hereafter in a poor content
immure those imputations i sustain
learning my days of youth so to prevent
560 as not to be cast down by them again
only those hopes which fate denies to grant
in full possession to a captive heart
before it may enjoy his better part
565 from which detained and banished in th' exile
of dim misfortune has none other prop
whereon to lean and rest itself the while
but the weak comfort of the hapless hope
and hope must in despite of fearful change
570 play in the strongest closet of my breast
although perhaps i ignorantly range
and court opinion in my deep'st unrest
drive me beyond myself fast friend soon lost
575 long may thy worthiness thy name advance
amongst the virtuous and deserving most
who herein hast forever happy proved
in life thou lived'st in death thou died'st beloved
to the
right honorable henry wriothesly
earl of southampton and baron of tichfield
the love i dedicate to your lordship is without end whereof this pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous moiety the warrant i have of your honourable disposition not the worth of my untutored lines makes it assured of acceptance what i have done is yours what i have to do is yours being part in all i have devoted yours were my worth greater my duty would show greater meantime as it is it is bound to your lordship to whom i wish long life still lengthened with all happiness

the rape of lucrece
the argument
lucius tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed superbus after he had caused his own father in law servius tullius to be cruelly murdered and contrary to the roman laws and customs not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages had possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of rome to besiege ardea during which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of sextus tarquinius the king's son in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife lucretia in that pleasant humour they posted to rome and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece' beauty yet smothering his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight hastily dispatcheth messengers one to rome for her father another to the camp for collatine they came the one accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause of her sorrow she first taking an oath of them for her revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and withal suddenly stabbed herself which done with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the people were so moved that with one consent and a general acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings to consuls
from the besieged ardea all in post
borne by the trustless wings of false desire
lust breathed tarquin leaves the roman host
and to collatium bears the lightless fire
which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
of collatine's fair love lucrece the chaste
haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
this bateless edge on his keen appetite
when collatine unwisely did not let
to praise the clear unmatched red and white
which triumph'd in that sky of his delight
where mortal stars as bright as heavens beauties
with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
for he the night before in tarquins tent
what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
in the possession of his beauteous mate
reckoning his fortune at such high proud rate
that kings might be espoused to more fame
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
o happiness enjoy'd but of a few
and if possess'd as soon decay'd and done
as is the morning's silver melting dew
against the golden splendor of the sun
honour and beauty in the owner's arms
are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms
beauty itself doth of itself persuade
the eyes of men without an orator
what needeth then apologies be made
to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher
of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because it is his own
suggested this proud issue of a king
for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
perchance that envy of so rich a thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his high pitch'd thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
that golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate
his all too timeless speed if none of those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp'd in repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts and ne'er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by the roman dame
within whose face beauty and virtue strived
which of them both should underprop her fame
when virtue bragg'd beauty would blush for shame
when beauty boasted blushes in despite
but beauty in that white intituled
from venus' doves doth challenge that fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red
which virtue gave the golden age to gild
their silver cheeks and calld it then their shield
teaching them thus to use it in the fight
when shame assaild the red should fence the white
this heraldry in lucrece' face was seen
argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
proving from world's minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still to fight
the sovereignty of either being so great
that oft they interchange each other's seat
their silent war of lilies and of roses
which tarquin view'd in her fair face's field
in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both it should be killd
the coward captive vanquished doth yield
rather than triumph in so false a foe
now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue
the niggard prodigal that praised her so
in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill to show
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
in silent wonder of still gazing eyes
this earthly saint adored by this devil
for unstaind thoughts do seldom dream on evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
and reverend welcome to her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm express'd
for that he colour'd with his high estate
hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
that nothing in him seem'd inordinate
save something too much wonder of his eye
but poorly rich so wanteth in his store
that cloy'd with much he pineth still for more
but she that never coped with stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read the subtle shining secrecies
writ in the glassy margents of such books
she touch'd no unknown baits nor fear'd no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were opend to the light
won in the fields of fruitful italy
and decks with praises collatine's high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
her joy with heaved up hand she doth express
and wordless so greets heaven for his success
far from the purpose of his coming hither
he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
till sable night mother of dread and fear
upon the world dim darkness doth display
and in her vaulty prison stows the day
for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness with heavy spright
for after supper long he questioned
with modest lucrece and wore out the night
now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight
and every one to rest themselves betake
as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
the sundry dangers of his wills obtaining
yet ever to obtain his will resolving
though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
and when great treasure is the meed proposed
though death be adjunct there's no death supposed
those that much covet are with gain so fond
for what they have not that which they possess
and so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more the profit of excess
is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain
the aim of all is but to nurse the life
with honour wealth and ease in waning age
and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
that one for all or all for one we gage
as life for honour in fell battle's rage
the death of all and all together lost
so that in venturing ill we leave to be
the things we are for that which we expect
and this ambitious foul infirmity
in having much torments us with defect
of that we have so then we do neglect
the thing we have and all for want of wit
make something nothing by augmenting it
such hazard now must doting tarquin make
and for himself himself be must forsake
then where is truth if there be no self trust
when shall he think to find a stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
now stole upon the time the dead of night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls' and wolves' death boding cries
the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
and now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm
is madly toss'd between desire and dread
th' one sweetly flatters th' other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitch'd with lust's foul charm
doth too too oft betake him to retire
beaten away by brain sick rude desire
that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must be lode star to his lustful eye
and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
'as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
so lucrece must i force to my desire'
here pale with fear he doth premeditate
the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
and in his inward mind he doth debate
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour of still slaughter'd lust
and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
'fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
to darken her whose light excelleth thine
and die unhallow'd thoughts before you blot
with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
let fair humanity abhor the deed
'o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my household's grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancy's slave
true valour still a true respect should have
then my digression is so vile so base
that it will live engraven in my face
'yea though i die the scandal will survive
and be an eye sore in my golden coat
to cipher me how fondly i did dote
that my posterity shamed with the note
shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
to wish that i their father had not bin
'what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy
who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
'if collatinus dream of my intent
will he not wake and in a desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an ever during blame
'o what excuse can my invention make
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but coward like with trembling terror die
'had collatinus killd my son or sire
or lain in ambush to betray my life
or were he not my dear friend this desire
might have excuse to work upon his wife
but as he is my kinsman my dear friend
the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
'shameful it is ay if the fact be known
hateful it is there is no hate in loving
i'll beg her love but she is own
the worst is but denial and reproving
my will is strong past reasons weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old mans saw
shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe'
'tween frozen conscience and hot burning will
and with good thoughts make dispensation
urging the worser sense for vantage still
which in a moment doth confound and kill
all pure effects and doth so far proceed
that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
quoth he 'she took me kindly by the hand
and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
fearing some hard news from the warlike band
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay
then white as lawn the roses took away
'and how her hand in my hand being lock'd
forced it to tremble with her loyal fear
which struck her sad and then it faster rock'd
until her husband's welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
that had narcissus seen her as she stood
'why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
affection is my captain and he leadeth
and when his gaudy banner is display'd
the coward fights and will not be dismay'd
'then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
my part is youth and beats these from the stage
desire my pilot is beauty my prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies'
as corn o'ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
is almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals with open listening ear
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
both which as servitors to the unjust
that now he vows a league and now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits
and in the self same seat sits collatine
that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
that eye which him beholds as more divine
unto a view so false will not incline
but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
which once corrupted takes the worser part
and therein heartens up his servile powers
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
the roman lord marcheth to lucrece' bed
the locks between her chamber and his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives the creeping thief to some regard
night wandering weasels shriek to see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents and crannies of the place
the wind wars with his torch to make him stay
and blows the smoke of it into his face
extinguishing his conduct in this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind that fires the torch
lucretia's glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes it from the rushes where it lies
and griping it the needle his finger pricks
as who should say 'this glove to wanton tricks
is not inured return again in haste
thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste'
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he in the worst sense construes their denial
the doors the wind the glove that did delay him
or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
who with a lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays the hour his debt
'so so' quoth he 'these lets attend the time
like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime
and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands
now is he come unto the chamber door
that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
which with a yielding latch and with no more
hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
that for his prey to pray he doth begin
as if the heavens should countenance his sin
but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th' eternal power
and they would stand auspicious to the hour
even there he starts quoth he 'i must deflower
the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist me in the act
'then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is back'd with resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
the blackest sin is clear'd with absolution
against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution
covers the shame that follows sweet delight'
this said his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch
and with his knee the door he opens wide
the dove sleeps fast that this night owl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
into the chamber wickedly he stalks
the curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
by their high treason is his heart misled
which gives the watch word to his hand full soon
to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
look as the fair and fiery pointed sun
rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight
even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
to wink being blinded with a greater light
that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed
o had they in that darksome prison died
then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece' side
in his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league to kill
and holy thoughted lucrece to their sight
must sell her joy her life her world's delight
cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
swelling on either side to want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed is
where like a virtuous monument she lies
to be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes
without the bed her other fair hand was
on the green coverlet whose perfect white
show'd like an april daisy on the grass
her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
till they might open to adorn the day
her hair like golden threads play'd with her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing life's triumph in the map of death
and death's dim look in life's mortality
each in her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
who like a foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne to heave the owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
and in his will his wilful eye he tired
with more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snow white dimpled chin
as the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage of lust by gazing qualified
slack'd not suppress'd for standing by her side
unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
in bloody death and ravishment delighting
nor childrens tears nor mothers' groans respecting
swell in their pride the onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his hand as proud of such a dignity
smoking with pride march'd on to make his stand
on her bare breast the heart of all her land
whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute and pale
they mustering to the quiet cabinet
where their dear governess and lady lies
do tell her she is dreadfully beset
and fright her with confusion of their cries
who peeping forth this tumult to behold
are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controlld
imagine her as one in dead of night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking
what terror or 'tis but she in worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
the sight which makes supposed terror true
like to a new killd bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quick shifting antics ugly in her eyes
such shadows are the weak brains forgeries
who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
his hand that yet remains upon her breast
rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heart poor citizen distress'd
beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity
to make the breach and enter this sweet city
first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
to sound a parley to his heartless foe
who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin
the reason of this rash alarm to know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show
but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
thus he replies 'the colour in thy face
that even for anger makes the lily pale
and the red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
under that colour am i come to scale
thy never conquer'd fort the fault is thine
for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
'thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
my will that marks thee for my earth's delight
which i to conquer sought with all my might
but as reproof and reason beat it dead
by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
'i see what crosses my attempt will bring
i know what thorns the growing rose defends
i think the honey guarded with a sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends
and dotes on what he looks 'gainst law or duty
'i have debated even in my soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed
but nothing can affections course control
or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed
reproach disdain and deadly enmity
yet strive i to embrace mine infamy'
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcons bells
'lucrece' quoth he'this night i must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work my way
for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
that done some worthless slave of thine i'll slay
and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him
'so thy surviving husband shall remain
the scornful mark of every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy
and thou the author of their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
and sung by children in succeeding times
the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
a little harm done to a great good end
for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
in a pure compound being so applied
his venom in effect is purified
'then for thy husband and thy childrens sake
tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
the shame that from them no device can take
worse than a slavish wipe or birth hour's blot
for marks descried in mens nativity
are nature's faults not their own infamy'
here with a cockatrice' dead killing eye
he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
while she the picture of pure piety
like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws
pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
but when a black faced cloud the world doth threat
in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallow'd haste her words delays
and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul night waking cat he doth but dally
while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth
a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance to her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear with raining
her pity pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd
which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place
that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship's oath
by her untimely tears her husband's love
by holy human law and common troth
by heaven and earth and all the power of both
that to his borrow'd bed he make retire
and stoop to honour not to foul desire
quoth she 'reward not hospitality
mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
mar not the thing that cannot be amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended
he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
to strike a poor unseasonable doe
'my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me
thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me
myself a weakling do not then ensnare me
thou look'st not like deceit do not deceive me
if ever man were moved with woman moans
be moved with my tears my sighs my groans
'all which together like a troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky and wreck threatening heart
to soften it with their continual motion
for stones dissolved to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art
melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me
thou wrong'st his honour wound'st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem'st and if the same
thou seem'st not what thou art a god a king
for kings like gods should govern everything
'how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage
o be remember'd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can be wiped away
then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
'this deed will make thee only loved for fear
but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love
with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they in thee the like offences prove
if but for fear of this thy will remove
for princes are the glass the school the book
'and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame
wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
authority for sin warrant for blame
to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou black'st reproach against long living laud
and makest fair reputation but a bawd
'hast thou command by him that gave it thee
from a pure heart command thy rebel will
for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when patternd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learnd to sin and thou didst teach the way
'think but how vile a spectacle it were
to view thy present trespass in another
mens faults do seldom to themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem death worthy in thy brother
that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes
'to thee to thee my heaved up hands appeal
not to seducing lust thy rash relier
i sue for exiled majesty's repeal
let him return and flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine'
'have done' quoth he 'my uncontrolled tide
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
and with the wind in greater fury fret
the petty streams that pay a daily debt
to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls' haste
add to his flow but alter not his taste'
'thou art' quoth she 'a sea a sovereign king
and lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed
and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed
'so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave
thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride
the lesser thing should not the greater hide
the cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot
but low shrubs wither at the cedar's root
no more' quoth he 'by heaven i will not hear thee
yield to my love if not enforced hate
instead of love's coy touch shall rudely tear thee
that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
unto the base bed of some rascal groom
to be thy partner in this shameful doom'
this said he sets his foot upon the light
for light and lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up in blind concealing night
the wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries
till with her own white fleece her voice controlld
entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold
for with the nightly linen that she wears
he pens her piteous clamours in her head
cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify
but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife
this momentary joy breeds months of pain
this hot desire converts to cold disdain
pure chastity is rifled of her store
and lust the thief far poorer than before
look as the full fed hound or gorged hawk
unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
the prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious in digestion souring
devours his will that lived by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation
till like a jade self will himself doth tire
and then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek
like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace
for there it revels and when that decays
the guilty rebel for remission prays
so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
for now against himself he sounds this doom
that through the length of times he stands disgraced
besides his souls fair temple is defaced
to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
to ask the spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects with foul insurrection
have batter'd down her consecrated wall
and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
her immortality and made her thrall
which in her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will
even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
a captive victor that hath lost in gain
bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
the scar that will despite of cure remain
leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain
she bears the load of lust he left behind
and he the burden of a guilty mind
she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls and hates himself for his offence
she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking with guilty fear
she stays exclaiming on the direful night
he runs and chides his vanish'd loathed delight
he thence departs a heavy convertite
she there remains a hopeless castaway
he in his speed looks for the morning light
'for day' quoth she 'nights scapes doth open lay
and my true eyes have never practised how
to cloak offences with a cunning brow
'they think not but that every eye can see
the same disgrace which they themselves behold
and therefore would they still in darkness be
to have their unseen sin remain untold
for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
and grave like water that doth eat in steel
here she exclaims against repose and rest
and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
and bids it leap from thence where it may find
some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against the unseen secrecy of night
'o comfort killing night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
vast sin concealing chaos nurse of blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame
grim cave of death whispering conspirator
with close tongued treason and the ravisher
'o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
make war against proportiond course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
'with rotten damps ravish the morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
the life of purity the supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noon tide prick
and let thy misty vapours march so thick
that in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
may set at noon and make perpetual night
'were tarquin night as he is but night's child
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through night's black bosom should not peep again
so should i have co partners in my pain
and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
as palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage
'where now i have no one to blush with me
to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
to mask their brows and hide their infamy
but i alone alone must sit and pine
mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans
poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
'o night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke
let not the jealous day behold that face
which underneath thy black all hiding cloak
immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place
that all the faults which in thy reign are made
may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
the light will show character'd in my brow
the story of sweet chastity's decay
the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
yea the illiterate that know not how
to cipher what is writ in learned books
will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
'the nurse to still her child will tell my story
and fright her crying babe with tarquins name
the orator to deck his oratory
feast finding minstrels tuning my defame
will tie the hearers to attend each line
how tarquin wronged me i collatine
'let my good name that senseless reputation
for collatine's dear love be kept unspotted
if that be made a theme for disputation
the branches of another root are rotted
and undeserved reproach to him allotted
that is as clear from this attaint of mine
'o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crest wounding private scar
reproach is stamp'd in collatinus' face
and tarquins eye may read the mot afar
how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he that gives them knows
'if collatine thine honour lay in me
from me by strong assault it is bereft
have no perfection of my summer left
but robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft
in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
and suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept
'yet am i guilty of thy honour's wrack
yet for thy honour did i entertain him
coming from thee i could not put him back
for it had been dishonour to disdain him
besides of weariness he did complain him
when virtue is profaned in such a devil
'why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute
that some impurity doth not pollute
'the aged man that coffers up his gold
and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
but like still pining tantalus he sits
and useless barns the harvest of his wits
having no other pleasure of his gain
but torment that it cannot cure his pain
'so then he hath it when he cannot use it
and leaves it to be master'd by his young
who in their pride do presently abuse it
their father was too weak and they too strong
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
even in the moment that we call them ours
'unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
what virtue breeds iniquity devours
we have no good that we can say is ours
but ill annexed opportunity
or kills his life or else his quality
'tis thou that executest the traitor's treason
thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get
whoever plots the sin thou 'point'st the season
'tis thou that spurnst at right at law at reason
and in thy shady cell where none may spy him
sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
'thou makest the vestal violate her oath
thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd
thou smother'st honesty thou murder'st troth
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief
thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief
'thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
thy private feasting to a public fast
thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste
thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity
'when wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend
and bring him where his suit may be obtaind
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chaind
give physic to the sick ease to the paind
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee
but they ne'er meet with opportunity
'the patient dies while the physician sleeps
the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
advice is sporting while infection breeds
thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds
wrath envy treason rape and murder's rages
thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
'when truth and virtue have to do with thee
a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
they buy thy help but sin ne'er gives a fee
he gratis comes and thou art well appaid
as well to hear as grant what he hath said
when tarquin did but he was stay'd by thee
guilty thou art of murder and of theft
guilty of perjury and subornation
guilty of treason forgery and shift
guilty of incest that abomination
an accessary by thine inclination
to all sins past and all that are to come
from the creation to the general doom
'mis shapen time copesmate of ugly night
eater of youth false slave to false delight
base watch of woes sins pack horse virtue's snare
thou nursest all and murder'st all that are
o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime
'why hath thy servant opportunity
betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose
cancelld my fortunes and enchained me
to endless date of never ending woes
to eat up errors by opinion bred
not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
'time's glory is to calm contending kings
to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light
to stamp the seal of time in aged things
to wake the morn and sentinel the night
to wrong the wronger till he render right
to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
and smear with dust their glittering golden towers
to feed oblivion with decay of things
to blot old books and alter their contents
to pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings
to dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs
to spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel
and turn the giddy round of fortune's wheel
'to show the beldam daughters of her daughter
to make the child a man the man a child
to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
to mock the subtle in themselves beguiled
to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
and waste huge stones with little water drops
'why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age
would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back
'thou ceaseless lackey to eternity
with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
devise extremes beyond extremity
to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
and the dire thought of his committed evil
shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
'disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
to make him moan but pity not his moans
stone him with hardend hearts harder than stones
and let mild women to him lose their mildness
wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
'let him have time to tear his curled hair
let him have time against himself to rave
let him have time of time's help to despair
let him have time to live a loathed slave
let him have time a beggar's orts to crave
disdain to him disdained scraps to give
'let him have time to see his friends his foes
and merry fools to mock at him resort
let him have time to mark how slow time goes
in time of sorrow and how swift and short
his time of folly and his time of sport
and ever let his unrecalling crime
have time to wail th' abusing of his time
'o time thou tutor both to good and bad
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
for who so base would such an office have
as slanderous death's man to so base a slave
'the baser is he coming from a king
to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing
that makes him honour'd or begets him hate
the moon being clouded presently is miss'd
but little stars may hide them when they list
'the crow may bathe his coal black wings in mire
and unperceived fly with the filth away
but if the like the snow white swan desire
the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day
gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly
but eagles gazed upon with every eye
unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators
busy yourselves in skill contending schools
debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
to trembling clients be you mediators
for me i force not argument a straw
since that my case is past the help of law
'in vain i rail at opportunity
at time at tarquin and uncheerful night
in vain i cavil with mine infamy
this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good
is to let forth my foul defiled blood
'poor hand why quiver'st thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame
for if i die my honour lives in thee
but if i live thou livest in my defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
and wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
this said from her be tumbled couch she starteth
to find some desperate instrument of death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
to make more vent for passage of her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna that in air consumes
or that which from discharged cannon fumes
'in vain' quoth she 'i live and seek in vain
some happy mean to end a hapless life
yet for the self same purpose seek a knife
but when i fear'd i was a loyal wife
so am i now o no that cannot be
of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
'o that is gone for which i sought to live
and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give
a badge of fame to slander's livery
a dying life to living infamy
to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
'well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
the stained taste of violated troth
i will not wrong thy true affection so
to flatter thee with an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come to growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
that thou art doting father of his fruit
'nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate
and with my trespass never will dispense
till life to death acquit my forced offence
'i will not poison thee with my attaint
nor fold my fault in cleanly coind excuses
my sable ground of sin i will not paint
to hide the truth of this false night's abuses
as from a mountain spring that feeds a dale
shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale'
by this lamenting philomel had ended
the well tuned warble of her nightly sorrow
and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow
lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
and therefore still in night would cloister'd be
and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
to whom she sobbing speaks 'o eye of eyes
why pry'st thou through my window leave thy peeping
mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
for day hath nought to do what's done by night'
thus cavils she with every thing she sees
true grief is fond and testy as a child
who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
continuance tames the one the other wild
like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
with too much labour drowns for want of skill
so she deep drenched in a sea of care
holds disputation with each thing she views
and to herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passions strength renews
and as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
the little birds that tune their morning's joy
make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
sad souls are slain in merry company
grief best is pleased with grief's society
true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
when with like semblance it is sympathized
'tis double death to drown in ken of shore
he ten times pines that pines beholding food
great grief grieves most at that would do it good
deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
who being stopp'd the bounding banks o'erflows
grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
'you mocking birds' quoth she 'your tunes entomb
within your hollow swelling feather'd breasts
and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
'come philomel that sing'st of ravishment
make thy sad grove in my dishevelld hair
as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
and with deep groans the diapason bear
for burden wise i'll hum on tarquin still
while thou on tereus descant'st better skill
'and whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part
to imitate thee well against my heart
will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heart strings to true languishment
'and for poor bird thou sing'st not in the day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from the way
that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds'
as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze
wildly determining which way to fly
or one encompass'd with a winding maze
that cannot tread the way out readily
so with herself is she in mutiny
to live or die which of the twain were better
when life is shamed and death reproach's debtor
but with my body my poor souls pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it
than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay the other and be nurse to none
'my body or my soul which was the dearer
when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
ay me the bark peeld from the lofty pine
his leaves will wither and his sap decay
so must my soul her bark being peeld away
'her house is sack'd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batter'd by the enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoild corrupted
grossly engirt with daring infamy
then let it not be calld impiety
if in this blemish'd fort i make some hole
'yet die i will not till my collatine
have heard the cause of my untimely death
that he may vow in that sad hour of mine
revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin i'll bequeath
which by him tainted shall for him be spent
and as his due writ in my testament
'my honour i'll bequeath unto the knife
that wounds my body so dishonoured
the one will live the other being dead
so of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred
for in my death i murder shameful scorn
my shame so dead mine honour is new born
'dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest be
how tarquin must be used read it in me
and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so
'this brief abridgement of my will i make
my soul and body to the skies and ground
my resolution husband do thou take
mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound
my shame be his that did my fame confound
and all my fame that lives disbursed be
to those that live and think no shame of me
'thou collatine shalt oversee this will
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
my life's foul deed my life's fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say 'so be it'
yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die and both shall victors be'
this plot of death when sadly she had laid
and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
poor lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure good morrow
with soft slow tongue true mark of modesty
and sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow
for why her face wore sorrow's livery
but durst not ask of her audaciously
why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks over wash'd with woe
each flower moistend like a melting eye
even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky
who in a salt waved ocean quench their light
which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps the other takes in hand
their gentle sex to weep are often willing
grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts
and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
for men have marble women waxen minds
and therefore are they form'd as marble will
the weak oppress'd the impression of strange kinds
is form'd in them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not the authors of their ill
no more than wax shall be accounted evil
their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
lays open all the little worms that creep
in men as in a rough grown grove remain
cave keeping evils that obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
poor womens faces are their own fault's books
no man inveigh against the wither'd flower
but chide rough winter that the flower hath killd
is worthy blame o let it not be hild
poor womens faults that they are so fulfilld
with mens abuses those proud lords to blame
make weak made women tenants to their shame
the precedent whereof in lucrece view
assaild by night with circumstances strong
of present death and shame that might ensue
by that her death to do her husband wrong
such danger to resistance did belong
and who cannot abuse a body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
'my girl' quoth she 'on what occasion break
those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are
raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
know gentle wench it small avails my mood
if tears could help mine own would do me good
till after a deep groan 'tarquin from hence'
'madam ere i was up' replied the maid
'the more to blame my sluggard negligence
yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere the break of day
and ere i rose was tarquin gone away
'but lady if your maid may be so bold
she would request to know your heaviness'
'o peace' quoth lucrece 'if it should be told
for more it is than i can well express
and that deep torture may be calld a hell
when more is felt than one hath power to tell
'go get me hither paper ink and pen
yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say one of my husband's men
bid thou be ready by and by to bear
a letter to my lord my love my dear
bid him with speed prepare to carry it
her maid is gone and she prepares to write
first hovering o'er the paper with her quill
conceit and grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
this is too curious good this blunt and ill
much like a press of people at a door
throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins 'thou worthy lord
of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed to come and visit me
so i commend me from our house in grief
my woes are tedious though my words are brief'
here folds she up the tenor of her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her grief's true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
ere she with blood had staind her staind excuse
besides the life and feeling of her passion
she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her
when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
of her disgrace the better so to clear her
from that suspicion which the world might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
with words till action might become them better
to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
the heavy motion that it doth behold
when every part a part of woe doth bear
'tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words
her letter now is seald and on it writ
'at ardea to my lord with more than haste'
the post attends and she delivers it
charging the sour faced groom to hie as fast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes
the homely villain court'sies to her low
and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
receives the scroll without or yea or no
and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
for lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame
of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect
to talk in deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do it leisurely
even so this pattern of the worn out age
pawnd honest looks but laid no words to gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
that two red fires in both their faces blazed
she thought he blush'd as knowing tarquins lust
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
the more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again
and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain
for now 'tis stale to sigh to weep and groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
that she her plaints a little while doth stay
at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
of skilful painting made for priam's troy
before the which is drawn the power of greece
for helens rape the city to destroy
threatening cloud kissing ilion with annoy
which the conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven it seem'd to kiss the turrets bow'd
a thousand lamentable objects there
in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life
shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife
the red blood reek'd to show the painter's strife
and dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights
like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
there might you see the labouring pioner
begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust
and from the towers of troy there would appear
the very eyes of men through loop holes thrust
gazing upon the greeks with little lust
that one might see those far off eyes look sad
in great commanders grace and majesty
you might behold triumphing in their faces
in youth quick bearing and dexterity
pale cowards marching on with trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
in ajax and ulysses o what art
of physiognomy might one behold
their face their manners most expressly told
in ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor rolld
but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
show'd deep regard and smiling government
there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
as 'twere encouraging the greeks to fight
making such sober action with his hand
that it beguiled attention charm'd the sight
in speech it seem'd his beard all silver white
thin winding breath which purld up to the sky
about him were a press of gaping faces
which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but with several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low the painter was so nice
the scalps of many almost hid behind
to jump up higher seem'd to mock the mind
here one mans hand leand on another's head
here one being throng'd bears back all bolln and
red
another smother'd seems to pelt and swear
and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
as but for loss of nestor's golden words
it seem'd they would debate with angry swords
for much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
that for achilles' image stood his spear
was left unseen save to the eye of mind
a hand a foot a face a leg a head
stood for the whole to be imagined
and from the walls of strong besieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector march'd to
field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
and to their hope they such odd action yield
like bright things staind a kind of heavy fear
and from the strand of dardan where they fought
to simois' reedy banks the red blood ran
whose waves to imitate the battle sought
with swelling ridges and their ranks began
to break upon the galled shore and than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join and shoot their foam at simois' banks
to this well painted piece is lucrece come
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress and dolour dwelld
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring on priam's wounds with her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus' proud foot lies
in her the painter had anatomized
time's ruin beauty's wreck and grim care's reign
her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised
of what she was no semblance did remain
wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
show'd life imprisond in a body dead
on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
and shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes
who nothing wants to answer her but cries
and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
the painter was no god to lend her those
and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
to give her so much grief and not a tongue
i'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
and drop sweet balm in priam's painted wound
and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
of all the greeks that are thine enemies
'show me the strumpet that began this stir
that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
and here in troy for trespass of thine eye
the sire the son the dame and daughter die
'why should the private pleasure of some one
become the public plague of many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
for one's offence why should so many fall
'lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
and one mans lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam cheque'd his sons desire
troy had been bright with fame and not with fire'
here feelingly she weeps troy's painted woes
for sorrow like a heavy hanging bell
then little strength rings out the doleful knell
so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell
to pencilld pensiveness and colour'd sorrow
she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about the painting round
and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees a wretched image bound
that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full of cares yet show'd content
so mild that patience seem'd to scorn his woes
in him the painter labour'd with his skill
to hide deceit and give the harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
a brow unbent that seem'd to welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
that blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
but like a constant and confirmed devil
and therein so ensconced his secret evil
that jealousy itself could not mistrust
false creeping craft and perjury should thrust
into so bright a day such black faced storms
or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms
the well skilld workman this mild image drew
for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
the credulous old priam after slew
whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
and little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces
this picture she advisedly perused
and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
saying some shape in sinons was abused
so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
and still on him she gazed and gazing still
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
that she concludes the picture was belied
she would have said 'can lurk in such a look'
but tarquins shape came in her mind the while
and from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took
'it cannot be' she in that sense forsook
and turnd it thus' it cannot be i find
but such a face should bear a wicked mind
'for even as subtle sinon here is painted
so sober sad so weary and so mild
as if with grief or travail he had fainted
with outward honesty but yet defiled
with inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did i tarquin so my troy did perish
'look look how listening priam wets his eyes
to see those borrow'd tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
'such devils steal effects from lightless hell
for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
and in that cold hot burning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only to flatter fools and make them bold
so priam's trust false sinons tears doth flatter
that he finds means to burn his troy with water'
here all enraged such passion her assails
that patience is quite beaten from her breast
comparing him to that unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly with this gives o'er
'fool fool' quoth she 'his wounds will not be sore'
thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow
and both she thinks too long with her remaining
short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining
and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought
that she with painted images hath spent
being from the feeling of her own grief brought
by deep surmise of others' detriment
losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cured
to think their dolour others have endured
but now the mindful messenger come back
who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
and round about her tear stained eye
blue circles stream'd like rainbows in the sky
these water galls in her dim element
foretell new storms to those already spent
which when her sad beholding husband saw
amazedly in her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod in tears look'd red and raw
her lively colour killd with deadly cares
both stood like old acquaintance in a trance
met far from home wondering each other's chance
at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
and thus begins 'what uncouth ill event
hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
and tell thy grief that we may give redress'
ere once she can discharge one word of woe
at length address'd to answer his desire
she modestly prepares to let them know
her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe
while collatine and his consorted lords
with sad attention long to hear her words
and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
'few words' quoth she 'shall fit the trespass best
in me moe woes than words are now depending
and my laments would be drawn out too long
to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
'then be this all the task it hath to say
dear husband in the interest of thy bed
a stranger came and on that pillow lay
where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
and what wrong else may be imagined
by foul enforcement might be done to me
'for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
with shining falchion in my chamber came
a creeping creature with a flaming light
and softly cried 'awake thou roman dame
and entertain my love else lasting shame
on thee and thine this night i will inflict
if thou my love's desire do contradict
' 'for some hard favour'd groom of thine' quoth he
'unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
and swear i found you where you did fulfil
the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
the lechers in their deed this act will be
my fame and thy perpetual infamy'
'with this i did begin to start and cry
and then against my heart he sets his sword
swearing unless i took all patiently
i should not live to speak another word
so should my shame still rest upon record
th' adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
'mine enemy was strong my poor self weak
and far the weaker with so strong a fear
my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
no rightful plea might plead for justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
that my poor beauty had purloind his eyes
and when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies
'o teach me how to make mine own excuse
though my gross blood be staind with this abuse
immaculate and spotless is my mind
that was not forced that never was inclined
to accessary yieldings but still pure
doth in her poisond closet yet endure'
lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss
with head declined and voice damm'd up with woe
with sad set eyes and wretched arms across
from lips new waxen pale begins to blow
but wretched as he is he strives in vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch the violent roaring tide
outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
back to the strait that forced him on so fast
in rage sent out recalld in rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw
and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
'dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feeling painful let it then suffice
to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes
'and for my sake when i might charm thee so
for she that was thy lucrece now attend me
be suddenly revenged on my foe
from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
comes all too late yet let the traitor die
for sparing justice feeds iniquity
'but ere i name him you fair lords' quoth she
speaking to those that came with collatine
'shall plight your honourable faiths to me
with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
for 'tis a meritorious fair design
to chase injustice with revengeful arms
at this request with noble disposition
each present lord began to promise aid
as bound in knighthood to her imposition
longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd
but she that yet her sad task hath not said
the protestation stops 'o speak ' quoth she
'how may this forced stain be wiped from me
'what is the quality of mine offence
being constraind with dreadful circumstance
my low declined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poisond fountain clears itself again
and why not i from this compelled stain'
with this they all at once began to say
her body's stain her mind untainted clears
while with a joyless smile she turns away
the face that map which deep impression bears
of hard misfortune carved in it with tears
by my excuse shall claim excuse's giving'
here with a sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquins name 'he he' she says
but more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents and delays
untimely breathings sick and short assays
she utters this 'he he fair lords 'tis he
that guides this hand to give this wound to me'
even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
that blow did that it from the deep unrest
of that polluted prison where it breathed
her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
life's lasting date from cancelld destiny
stone still astonish'd with this deadly deed
stood collatine and all his lordly crew
till lucrece' father that beholds her bleed
himself on her self slaughter'd body threw
the murderous knife and as it left the place
her blood in poor revenge held it in chase
and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
circles her body in on every side
who like a late sack'd island vastly stood
bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remaind
and some look'd black and that false tarquin staind
of that black blood a watery rigol goes
which seems to weep upon the tainted place
and ever since as pitying lucrece' woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
and blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at that which is so putrified
'daughter dear daughter' old lucretius cries
'that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if in the child the father's image lies
thou wast not to this end from me derived
if children predecease progenitors
we are their offspring and they none of ours
'poor broken glass i often did behold
in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
but now that fresh fair mirror dim and old
shows me a bare boned death by time out worn
o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shivered all the beauty of my glass
'o time cease thou thy course and last no longer
if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again and see
thy father die and not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from a dream
and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face
and counterfeits to die with her a space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
and live to be revenged on her death
the deep vexation of his inward soul
hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad that sorrow should his use control
or keep him from heart easing words so long
begins to talk but through his lips do throng
that no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime 'tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain
held back his sorrow's tide to make it more
at last it rains and busy winds give o'er
then son and father weep with equal strife
who should weep most for daughter or for wife
the one doth call her his the other his
the father says 'she's mine' 'o mine she is'
replies her husband 'do not take away
my sorrow's interest let no mourner say
he weeps for her for she was only mine
and only must be waild by collatine'
'o' quoth lucretius' i did give that life
which she too early and too late hath spilld'
'woe woe' quoth collatine 'she was my wife
i owed her and 'tis mine that she hath killd'
the dispersed air who holding lucrece' life
answer'd their cries 'my daughter' and 'my wife'
brutus who pluck'd the knife from lucrece' side
seeing such emulation in their woe
began to clothe his wit in state and pride
burying in lucrece' wound his folly's show
he with the romans was esteemed so
as silly jeering idiots are with kings
for sportive words and uttering foolish things
wherein deep policy did him disguise
and arm'd his long hid wits advisedly
to cheque the tears in collatinus' eyes
'thou wronged lord of rome' quoth be 'arise
let my unsounded self supposed a fool
now set thy long experienced wit to school
'why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
to slay herself that should have slain her foe
'courageous roman do not steep thy heart
in such relenting dew of lamentations
but kneel with me and help to bear thy part
to rouse our roman gods with invocations
that they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
'now by the capitol that we adore
and by this chaste blood so unjustly staind
by heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earth's
store
by all our country rights in rome maintaind
and by chaste lucrece' soul that late complaind
her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife
we will revenge the death of this true wife'
this said he struck his hand upon his breast
and to his protestation urged the rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
and that deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat and that they swore
when they had sworn to this advised doom
they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
to show her bleeding body thorough rome
and so to publish tarquins foul offence
the romans plausibly did give consent
to tarquins everlasting banishment
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantise of skill
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee
love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a be
cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dians this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
which borrowed from this holy fire of love
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress' eye love's brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distempered guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress' eyes
the little love god lying once asleep
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
came there for cure and this by that i prove
love's fire heats water water cools not love
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify your self in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live your self in eyes of men
to give away your self keeps your self still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age
be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
a womans face with nature's own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven it self for ornament doth use
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
with aprils first born flowers and all things rare
that heavens air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heavens air
let them say more that like of hearsay well
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gav'st me thine not to give back again
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
my body is the frame wherein 'tis held
and perspective it is best painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast where through the sun
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the suns eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for my self no quiet find
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarred the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressed
and each though enemies to either's reign
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please him thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart complexioned night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon my self and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessed
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
if thou survive my well contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bett'ring of the time
and though they be outstripped by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
my self corrupting salving thy amiss
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is't but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
which used lives th' executor to be
take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste of what thy self refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but here's the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend time's leisure with my moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of either's woe
the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impanelled
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
and my heart's right thy inward love of heart
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
against that time if ever that time come
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against my self uprear
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that case and that repose to say
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lacked to hope
what is your substance whereof are you made
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helens cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwooed and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that your self arise
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to day by feeding is allayed
to morrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
to morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
or call it winter which being full of care
makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill
that god forbid that made me first your slave
or at your hand th' account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
th' imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you your self may privilage your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amis
the second burthen of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
that's for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self willed for thou art much too fair
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near
sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for my self mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
mine own self love quite contrary i read
'tis thee my self that for my self i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days
against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to age's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanished out of sight
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thy self at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved
thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack
when i consider every thing that grows
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and checked even by the self same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me
how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down rased
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'er read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright
tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and gilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and art made tongue tied by authority
and folly doctor like controlling skill
and simple truth miscalled simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone
ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeming of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
making no summer of another's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore
those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the soil is this that thou dost common grow
lo in the orient when the gracious light
doth homage to his new appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
so thou thy self out going in thy noon
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wooed of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long
but be contented when that fell arrest
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains
so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others' works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
but now my gracious numbers are decayed
and my sick muse doth give an other place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behaviour beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wrecked i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light's flame with self substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the world's due by the grave and thee
i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
i never saw that you did painting need
i found or thought i found you did exceed
that barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you your self being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise
who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polished form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so 'tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filled up his line
then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgement making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
upon thy side against my self i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to my self i do
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right my self will bear all wrong
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i'll my self disgrace knowing thy will
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wronk
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against my self i'll vow debate
for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consum'st thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ah do not when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune's might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their body's force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
of more delight than hawks and horses be
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretchcd make
but do thy worst to steal thy self away
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
but what's so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though altered new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many's looks the false heart's history
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to it self it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turns to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemed
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report
how like a winter hath my absence been
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness everywhere
and yet this time removed was summer's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowed wombs after their lords' decease
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud pied april dressed in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemed it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stoln of both
and to his robbery had annexed thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee

right honorable henry wriothesly

right honorable
i know not how i shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burden only if your honour seem but pleased i account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle hours till i have honoured you with some graver labour but if the first heir of my invention prove deformed i shall be sorry it had so noble a god father and never after ear so barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest i leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your heart's content which i wish may always answer your own wish and the world's hopeful expectation
william shakespeare
even as the sun with purple colour'd face
had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn
rose cheek'd adonis hied him to the chase
hunting he loved but love he laugh'd to scorn
sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him
and like a bold faced suitor 'gins to woo him
'thrice fairer than myself' thus she began
'the field's chief flower sweet above compare
more white and red than doves or roses are
nature that made thee with herself at strife
saith that the world hath ending with thy life
'vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
and rein his proud head to the saddle bow
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come and sit where never serpent hisses
and being set i'll smother thee with kisses
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red and pale with fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
a summer's day will seem an hour but short
being wasted in such time beguiling sport'
with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
the precedent of pith and livelihood
and trembling in her passion calls it balm
earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good
courageously to pluck him from his horse
over one arm the lusty courser's rein
under her other was the tender boy
who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain
with leaden appetite unapt to toy
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
he red for shame but frosty in desire
the studded bridle on a ragged bough
nimbly she fastens o how quick is love
to tie the rider she begins to prove
backward she push'd him as she would be thrust
and governd him in strength though not in lust
so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning on their elbows and their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
and 'gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
and kissing speaks with lustful language broken
'if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open'
doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
he saith she is immodest blames her 'miss
what follows more she murders with a kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone
shaking her wings devouring all in haste
till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone
and where she ends she doth anew begin
forced to content but never to obey
panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey
and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
so they were dew'd with such distilling showers
look how a bird lies tangled in a net
so fastend in her arms adonis lies
which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
rain added to a river that is rank
perforce will force it overflow the bank
still she entreats and prettily entreats
for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
'twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale
being red she loves him best and being white
her best is better'd with a more delight
and by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never to remove
till he take truce with her contending tears
which long have raind making her cheeks all wet
and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin
like a dive dapper peering through a wave
who being look'd on ducks as quickly in
so offers he to give what she did crave
he winks and turns his lips another way
never did passenger in summer's heat
more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes in water yet her fire must burn
'o pity' 'gan she cry 'flint hearted boy
'tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy
'i have been woo'd as i entreat thee now
even by the stern and direful god of war
who conquers where he comes in every jar
yet hath he been my captive and my slave
and begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have
'over my altars hath he hung his lance
his batter'd shield his uncontrolled crest
and for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance
to toy to wanton dally smile and jest
scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
making my arms his field his tent my bed
leading him prisoner in a red rose chain
strong tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd
yet was he servile to my coy disdain
o be not proud nor brag not of thy might
for mastering her that foild the god of fight
'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
though mine be not so fair yet are they red
the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes
'art thou ashamed to kiss then wink again
and i will wink so shall the day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
be bold to play our sport is not in sight
these blue veind violets whereon we lean
never can blab nor know not what we mean
'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
beauty within itself should not be wasted
fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
rot and consume themselves in little time
'were i hard favour'd foul or wrinkled old
ill nurtured crooked churlish harsh in voice
o'erworn despised rheumatic and cold
thick sighted barren lean and lacking juice
then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee
but having no defects why dost abhor me
mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning
my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt
'bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
or like a fairy trip upon the green
or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair
dance on the sands and yet no footing seen
not gross to sink but light and will aspire
'witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
'is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
'torches are made to light jewels to wear
dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
things growing to themselves are growth's abuse
seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot to get it is thy duty
unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
and so in spite of death thou dost survive
in that thy likeness still is left alive'
by this the love sick queen began to sweat
for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
and titan tired in the mid day heat
with burning eye did hotly overlook them
so he were like him and by venus' side
and now adonis with a lazy spright
and with a heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight
like misty vapours when they blot the sky
souring his cheeks cries 'fie no more of love
the sun doth burn my face i must remove'
'ay me' quoth venus 'young and so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou to be gone
shall cool the heat of this descending sun
i'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
if they burn too i'll quench them with my tears
'the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
and lo i lie between that sun and thee
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
and were i not immortal life were done
between this heavenly and earthly sun
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth
art thou a womans son and canst not feel
what 'tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
'what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
and one for interest if thou wilt have twain
'fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
well painted idol image dun and dead
statue contenting but the eye alone
thing like a man but of no woman bred
thou art no man though of a mans complexion
for men will kiss even by their own direction'
this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
being judge in love she cannot right her cause
and now she weeps and now she fain would speak
and now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
now gazeth she on him now on the ground
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
she would he will not in her arms be bound
and when from thence he struggles to be gone
she locks her lily fingers one in one
within the circuit of this ivory pale
i'll be a park and thou shalt be my deer
feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
within this limit is relief enough
sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark'
at this adonis smiles as in disdain
that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might be buried in a tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
why there love lived and there he could not die
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
opend their mouths to swallow venus' liking
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
the time is spent her object will away
and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
'pity' she cries 'some favour some remorse'
away he springs and hasteth to his horse
a breeding jennet lusty young and proud
adonis' trampling courser doth espy
and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
the strong neck'd steed being tied unto a tree
breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder
controlling what he was controlled with
his ears up prick'd his braided hanging mane
upon his compass'd crest now stand on end
his nostrils drink the air and forth again
as from a furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
shows his hot courage and his high desire
sometime he trots as if he told the steps
with gentle majesty and modest pride
as who should say 'lo thus my strength is tried
and this i do to captivate the eye
of the fair breeder that is standing by'
what recketh he his rider's angry stir
his flattering 'holla' or his 'stand i say'
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees
for nothing else with his proud sight agrees
in limning out a well proportiond steed
his art with nature's workmanship at strife
as if the dead the living should exceed
so did this horse excel a common one
in shape in courage colour pace and bone
round hoof'd short jointed fetlocks shag and long
broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
save a proud rider on so proud a back
sometime he scuds far off and there he stares
anon he starts at stirring of a feather
to bid the wind a base he now prepares
and whether he run or fly they know not whether
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
fanning the hairs who wave like feather'd wings
he looks upon his love and neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
beating his kind embracements with her heels
then like a melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail that like a falling plume
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
his love perceiving how he is enraged
grew kinder and his fury was assuaged
when lo the unback'd breeder full of fear
jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
with her the horse and left adonis there
as they were mad unto the wood they hie them
out stripping crows that strive to over fly them
all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous and unruly beast
and now the happy season once more fits
that love sick love by pleading may be blest
when it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue
an oven that is stopp'd or river stay'd
burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage
so of concealed sorrow may be said
free vent of words love's fire doth assuage
but when the heart's attorney once is mute
the client breaks as desperate in his suit
he sees her coming and begins to glow
even as a dying coal revives with wind
looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
taking no notice that she is so nigh
for all askance he holds her in his eye
o what a sight it was wistly to view
how she came stealing to the wayward boy
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
how white and red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale and by and by
it flash'd forth fire as lightning from the sky
and like a lowly lover down she kneels
with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print
as apt as new falln snow takes any dint
o what a war of looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes woo'd still his eyes disdaind the wooing
with tears which chorus like her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by the hand
a lily prisond in a gaol of snow
or ivory in an alabaster band
so white a friend engirts so white a foe
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
show'd like two silver doves that sit a billing
once more the engine of her thoughts began
'o fairest mover on this mortal round
my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee
'give me my hand' saith he 'why dost thou feel it'
'give me my heart' saith she 'and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
and being steeld soft sighs can never grave it
then love's deep groans i never shall regard
because adonis' heart hath made mine hard'
my day's delight is past my horse is gone
and 'tis your fault i am bereft him so
i pray you hence and leave me here alone
for all my mind my thought my busy care
is how to get my palfrey from the mare'
thus she replies 'thy palfrey as he should
welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
affection is a coal that must be coold
else suffer'd it will set the heart on fire
therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone
'how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
servilely master'd with a leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youth's fair fee
he held such petty bondage in disdain
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
'who sees his true love in her naked bed
teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
his other agents aim at like delight
who is so faint that dare not be so bold
to touch the fire the weather being cold
'let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
and learn of him i heartily beseech thee
to take advantage on presented joy
though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain
and once made perfect never lost again'
unless it be a boar and then i chase it
'tis much to borrow and i will not owe it
my love to love is love but to disgrace it
for i have heard it is a life in death
that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath
'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things be any jot diminish'd
they wither in their prime prove nothing worth
loseth his pride and never waxeth strong
'you hurt my hand with wringing let us part
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove your siege from my unyielding heart
to love's alarms it will not ope the gate
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
for where a heart is hard they make no battery'
'what canst thou talk' quoth she 'hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing
i had my load before now press'd with bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ear's deep sweet music and heart's deep sore wounding
'had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
that inward beauty and invisible
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
each part in me that were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
yet should i be in love by touching thee
and that i could not see nor hear nor touch
and nothing but the very smell were left me
yet would my love to thee be still as much
for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
smelling
'but o what banquet wert thou to the taste
being nurse and feeder of the other four
would they not wish the feast might ever last
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing in disturb the feast'
once more the ruby colour'd portal opend
which to his speech did honey passage yield
like a red morn that ever yet betokend
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
this ill presage advisedly she marketh
or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as the berry breaks before it staineth
or like the deadly bullet of a gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun
and at his look she flatly falleth down
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
a smile recures the wounding of a frown
but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead
and all amazed brake off his late intent
for sharply he did think to reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
for on the grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life in her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
he kisses her and she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still
the night of sorrow now is turnd to day
her two blue windows faintly she up heaveth
like the fair sun when in his fresh array
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
so is her face illumined with her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd
were never four such lamps together mix'd
had not his clouded with his brow's repine
but hers which through the crystal tears gave light
shone like the moon in water seen by night
'o where am i' quoth she 'in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drench'd or in the fire
what hour is this or morn or weary even
do i delight to die or life desire
but now i lived and life was death's annoy
'o thou didst kill me kill me once again
thy eyes' shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine
hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
that they have murder'd this poor heart of mine
and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
'long may they kiss each other for this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
and as they last their verdure still endure
that the star gazers having writ on death
may say the plague is banish'd by thy breath
'pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
what bargains may i make still to be sealing
to sell myself i can be well contented
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
set thy seal manual on my wax red lips
'a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
say for non payment that the debt should double
is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble
'fair queen' quoth he 'if any love you owe me
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
before i know myself seek not to know me
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
'look the world's comforter with weary gait
his day's hot task hath ended in the west
the owl night's herald shrieks ''tis very late'
the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest
and coal black clouds that shadow heavens light
do summon us to part and bid good night
'now let me say 'good night' and so say you
if you will say so you shall have a kiss'
'good night' quoth she and ere he says 'adieu'
her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows to face
till breathless he disjoind and backward drew
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
he with her plenty press'd she faint with dearth
their lips together glued fall to the earth
now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom the insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
that she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry
and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling
or as the fleet foot roe that's tired with chasing
or like the froward infant stilld with dandling
he now obeys and now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing
affection faints not like a pale faced coward
but then woos best when most his choice is froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd
foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
what though the rose have prickles yet 'tis pluck'd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through and picks them all at last
for pity now she can no more detain him
she is resolved no longer to restrain him
bids him farewell and look well to her heart
the which by cupid's bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged in his breast
'sweet boy' she says 'this night i'll waste in sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me love's master shall we meet to morrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match'
he tells her no to morrow he intends
'the boar' quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter
all is imaginary she doth prove
that worse than tantalus' is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy
even as poor birds deceived with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all in vain good queen it will not be
her pleading hath deserved a greater fee
she's love she loves and yet she is not loved
'fie fie' he says 'you crush me let me go
you have no reason to withhold me so'
'thou hadst been gone' quoth she 'sweet boy ere this
but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
o be advised thou know'st not what it is
with javelins point a churlish swine to gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
'on his bow back he hath a battle set
of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes
his eyes like glow worms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes
being moved he strikes whate'er is in his way
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
'his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm'd
are better proof than thy spear's point can enter
his short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd
the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
as fearful of him part through whom he rushes
'alas he nought esteems that face of thine
to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
whose full perfection all the world amazes
but having thee at vantage wondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead
'o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
come not within his danger by thy will
they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
i fear'd thy fortune and my joints did tremble
'didst thou not mark my face was it not white
saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
'for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affections sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
and in a peaceful hour doth cry 'kill kill'
distempering gentle love in his desire
as air and water do abate the fire
'this sour informer this bate breeding spy
this canker that eats up love's tender spring
this carry tale dissentious jealousy
knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
that if i love thee i thy death should fear
'and more than so presenteth to mine eye
the picture of an angry chafing boar
under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
an image like thyself all staind with gore
whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
'what should i do seeing thee so indeed
the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
and fear doth teach it divination
i prophesy thy death my living sorrow
if thou encounter with the boar to morrow
'but if thou needs wilt hunt be ruled by me
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
or at the fox which lives by subtlety
or at the roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs
hounds
'and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
how he outruns the wind and with what care
he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
the many musets through the which he goes
are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
'sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
'for there his smell with others being mingled
the hot scent snuffing hounds are driven to doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were in the skies
stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
to harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
and now his grief may be compared well
to one sore sick that hears the passing bell
'then shalt thou see the dew bedabbled wretch
turn and return indenting with the way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
and being low never relieved by any
'lie quietly and hear a little more
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize
applying this to that and so to so
for love can comment upon every woe
'where did i leave' 'no matter where' quoth he
'leave me and then the story aptly ends
'i am' quoth he 'expected of my friends
and now 'tis dark and going i shall fall'
'in night' quoth she 'desire sees best of all
'but if thou fall o then imagine this
the earth in love with thee thy footing trips
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature be condemnd of treason
for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
wherein she framed thee in high heavens despite
to shame the sun by day and her by night
'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
to cross the curious workmanship of nature
to mingle beauty with infirmities
and pure perfection with impure defeature
of mad mischances and much misery
'as burning fevers agues pale and faint
life poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
the marrow eating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating of the blood
surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair
swear nature's death for framing thee so fair
'and not the least of all these maladies
but in one minute's fight brings beauty under
whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder
are on the sudden wasted thaw'd and done
as mountain snow melts with the midday sun
'therefore despite of fruitless chastity
love lacking vestals and self loving nuns
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
dries up his oil to lend the world his light
seeming to bury that posterity
which by the rights of time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
if so the world will hold thee in disdain
sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
'so in thyself thyself art made away
a mischief worse than civil home bred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butcher sire that reaves his son of life
but gold that's put to use more gold begets'
'nay then' quoth adon 'you will fall again
into your idle over handled theme
the kiss i gave you is bestow'd in vain
and all in vain you strive against the stream
for by this black faced night desire's foul nurse
your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
'if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
and every tongue more moving than your own
yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
for know my heart stands armed in mine ear
and will not let a false sound enter there
'lest the deceiving harmony should run
into the quiet closure of my breast
and then my little heart were quite undone
in his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest
no lady no my heart longs not to groan
but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
i hate not love but your device in love
that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lust's abuse
'call it not love for love to heaven is fled
since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame
as caterpillars do the tender leaves
'love comforteth like sunshine after rain
but lust's effect is tempest after sun
love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lust's winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
love is all truth lust full of forged lies
'more i could tell but more i dare not say
the text is old the orator too green
my face is full of shame my heart of teen
mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
do burn themselves for having so offended'
with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus' eye
gazing upon a late embarked friend
till the wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
so did the merciless and pitchy night
fold in the object that did feed her sight
whereat amazed as one that unaware
hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood
or stonish'd as night wanderers often are
their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
having lost the fair discovery of her way
and now she beats her heart whereat it groans
that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition of her moans
passion on passion deeply is redoubled
'ay me' she cries and twenty times 'woe woe'
and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins a wailing note
and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
how love is wise in folly foolish witty
her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
and still the choir of echoes answer so
her song was tedious and outwore the night
for lovers' hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
in such like circumstance with suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience and are never done
but idle sounds resembling parasites
like shrill tongued tapsters answering every call
soothing the humour of fantastic wits
she says ''tis so' they answer all ''tis so'
and would say after her if she said 'no'
lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty
that cedar tops and hills seem burnish'd gold
venus salutes him with this fair good morrow
'o thou clear god and patron of all light
from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
the beauteous influence that makes him bright
there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other'
this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove
musing the morning is so much o'erworn
she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
anon she hears them chant it lustily
and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
and as she runs the bushes in the way
some catch her by the neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way
the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
appals her senses and her spirit confounds
for now she knows it is no gentle chase
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because the cry remaineth in one place
where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first
this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
through which it enters to surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
with cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly and dare not stay the field
thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismay'd
and childish error that they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
and with that word she spied the hunted boar
whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
like milk and blood being mingled both together
a second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs and now she will no further
but back retires to rate the boar for murther
she treads the path that she untreads again
her more than haste is mated with delays
like the proceedings of a drunken brain
full of respects yet nought at all respecting
in hand with all things nought at all effecting
here kennelld in a brake she finds a hound
and asks the weary caitiff for his master
and there another licking of his wound
'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster
to whom she speaks and he replies with howling
when he hath ceased his ill resounding noise
another flap mouth'd mourner black and grim
against the welkin volleys out his voice
another and another answer him
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
shaking their scratch'd ears bleeding as they go
look how the world's poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs and prodigies
infusing them with dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
and sighing it again exclaims on death
'hard favour'd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce of love' thus chides she death
'grim grinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
who when he lived his breath and beauty set
gloss on the rose smell to the violet
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
and hearing him thy power had lost his power
the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck'st a flower
and not death's ebon dart to strike dead
'dost thou drink tears that thou provokest such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
since her best work is ruind with thy rigour'
here overcome as one full of despair
she vaild her eyelids who like sluices stopt
in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt
but through the flood gates breaks the silver rain
and with his strong course opens them again
o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
but like a stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertaind each passion labours so
that every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none is best then join they all together
like many clouds consulting for foul weather
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well
the dire imagination she did follow
this sound of hope doth labour to expel
and flatters her it is adonis' voice
whereat her tears began to turn their tide
being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd
o hard believing love how strange it seems
not to believe and yet too credulous
despair and hope makes thee ridiculous
the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
adonis lives and death is not to blame
it was not she that calld him all to naught
now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
imperious supreme of all mortal things
yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
when as i met the boar that bloody beast
which knows no pity but is still severe
then gentle shadow truth i must confess
i raild on thee fearing my love's decease
''tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
be wreak'd on him invisible commander
'tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
i did but act he's author of thy slander
could rule them both without ten womens wit'
thus hoping that adonis is alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
and that his beauty may the better thrive
with death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
his victories his triumphs and his glories
'o jove' quoth she 'how much a fool was i
to be of such a weak and silly mind
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
for he being dead with him is beauty slain
and beauty dead black chaos comes again
'fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
as one with treasure laden hemm'd thieves
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves'
even at this word she hears a merry horn
whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
the grass stoops not she treads on it so light
and in her haste unfortunately spies
the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murder'd with the view
like stars ashamed of day themselves withdrew
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
and there all smother'd up in shade doth sit
long after fearing to creep forth again
into the deep dark cabins of her head
where they resign their office and their light
to the disposing of her troubled brain
who bids them still consort with ugly night
and never wound the heart with looks again
who like a king perplexed in his throne
by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when the wind imprisond in the ground
which with cold terror doth mens minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
and being opend threw unwilling light
upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
with purple tears that his wound wept was drench'd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he is not dead
her voice is stopt her joints forget to bow
her eyes are mad that they have wept til now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
and then she reprehends her mangling eye
that makes more gashes where no breach should be
for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled
'my tongue cannot express my grief for one
and yet' quoth she 'behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes' red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire
'alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that's worth the viewing
of things long since or any thing ensuing
the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
but true sweet beauty lived and died with him
'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
having no fair to lose you need not fear
the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis lived sun and sharp air
lurk'd like two thieves to rob him of his fair
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
the wind would blow it off and being gone
play with his locks then would adonis weep
and straight in pity of his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears
'to see his face the lion walk'd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
to recreate himself when he hath sung
the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
and never fright the silly lamb that day
'when he beheld his shadow in the brook
the fishes spread on it their golden gills
when he was by the birds such pleasure took
that some would sing some other in their bills
would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries
he fed them with his sight they him with berries
'but this foul grim and urchin snouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
witness the entertainment that he gave
if he did see his face why then i know
he thought to kiss him and hath killd him so
''tis true 'tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin
with kissing him i should have killd him first
but he is dead and never did he bless
my youth with his the more am i accurst'
with this she falleth in the place she stood
and stains her face with his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips and they are pale
she takes him by the hand and that is cold
she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
as if they heard the woeful words she told
where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld
a thousand times and now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excelld
and every beauty robb'd of his effect
'wonder of time' quoth she 'this is my spite
that thou being dead the day should yet be light
'since thou art dead lo here i prophesy
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
ne'er settled equally but high or low
that all love's pleasure shall not match his woe
'it shall be fickle false and full of fraud
bud and be blasted in a breathing while
the bottom poison and the top o'erstraw'd
with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
the strongest body shall it make most weak
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak
teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
it shall be raging mad and silly mild
make the young old the old become a child
'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
it shall be merciful and too severe
and most deceiving when it seems most just
put fear to valour courage to the coward
'it shall be cause of war and dire events
and set dissension 'twixt the son and sire
subject and servile to all discontents
as dry combustious matter is to fire
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
they that love best their loves shall not enjoy'
by this the boy that by her side lay killd
was melted like a vapour from her sight
a purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white
resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
which in round drops upon their whiteness stood
she bows her head the new sprung flower to smell
comparing it to her adonis' breath
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
since he himself is reft from her by death
she crops the stalk and in the breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares to tears
sweet issue of a more sweet smelling sire
for every little grief to wet his eyes
to grow unto himself was his desire
and so 'tis thine but know it is as good
to wither in my breast as in his blood
'here was thy father's bed here in my breast
thou art the next of blood and 'tis thy right
lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
wherein i will not kiss my sweet love's flower'
thus weary of the world away she hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is convey'd
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen
where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised everywhere
so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixed'
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now
my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers' pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
in process of the seasons have i seen
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
let not my love be called idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to day to morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
which three till now never kept seat in one
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressed
even such a beauty as you master now
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they looked but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what now to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemed my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
so that my self bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reigned
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stained
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
in one of thine from that which thou departest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
alas 'tis true i have gone here and there
and made my self a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renewed
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'er green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others' voices that my adder's sense
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead
since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose millioned accidents
creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
might i not then say 'now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow
accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakened hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love t' anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw my self to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
and sable curls all silvered o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours y'have passed a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tendered
the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
not by our feeling but by others' seeing
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign
full charactered with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missed
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wond'ring at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short numbered hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
which die for goodness who have lived for crime
were't aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou suborned informer a true soul
when most impeached stands least in thy control
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit though delayed answered must be
and her quietus is to render thee
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power
fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
that every tongue says beauty should look so
how oft when thou my music music play'st
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowed bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
no longer yours than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
your self again after your self's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so
my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damasked red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to my self alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
and thence this slander as i think proceeds
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed
of him my self and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me
so now i have confessed that he is thine
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will
my self i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learned but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fist doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free
and 'will to boot and 'will in over plus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one 'will'
if thy soul check thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
among a number one is reckoned none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy store's account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lov'st me for my name is will
thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchored in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
and to this false plague are they now transferred
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutored youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flattered be
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be
that she that makes me sin awards me pain
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied
lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
one of her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runst thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman coloured ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
i guess one angel in another's hell
yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate'
to me that languished for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate' she altered with an end
that followed it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
'i hate' from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying 'not you'
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
my sinful earth these rebel powers array
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
and death once dead there's no more dying then
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
th' uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are
at random from the truth vainly expressed
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all mens no
how can it o how can love's eye be true
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun it self sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
when i against my self with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon my self with present moan
what merit do i in my self respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lov'st and i am blind
