which fortified her visage from the sun
and often reading what contents it bears
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
upon whose weeping margent she was set
enswathed and seald to curious secrecy
of court of city and had let go by
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
a youthful suit it was to gain my grace
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
came for additions yet their purposed trim
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd
'yet did i not as some my equals did
to put the by past perils in her way
though reason weep and cry 'it is thy last'
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and so much less of shame in me remains
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
with the annexions of fair gems enrich'd
''lo all these trophies of affections hot
hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
to spend her living in eternal love
upon the moment did her force subdue
must for your victory us all congest
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
to leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine
that flame through water which their hue encloses
there my white stole of chastity i daff'd
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
the naked and concealed fiend he cover'd
o all that borrow'd motion seeming owed
whiles both his youth and virtue did intend
even in the hearts and memories of men
to one superlative above the rest
not that he was above the spleenful sense
of what they do to be a special work
which harvest like did yield again the crop
not fruitlessly in prodigal expense
and shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice
for if his fate and heaven had decreed
affecting fashions nor addicted wholly
seemed rather answers which the wise embrace
so that his mind and body made an inn
clean tempered moderation steady trust
and as much glory is it to be good
justice by wrong and sifted to embane
by fair demeanor he had won repute
how such a man was sadly overthrown
th' unsteady change of his fantastic forms
here shall be reckoned up the constant faith
when all shall turn to dust from whence we came
that pities not thy sad and sudden wrong
and i confess my love was too remiss
t' enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first
but here i trust i have discharged now
whereby if thou live to posterity
measure thy course of life with false pretenses
presuming still it sees even in the night
true 'tis this man whiles yet he was a man
the ready way to commendation
he was not so but in a serious awe
his observation and discreet discerning
wherein not any one thing comprehends
most true presage and he discharged the same
hence sprung the deadly fuel that revived
robbed virtue of a follower so true
whiles it not doubting whereinto it enters
according to the tenor of the saw
might in like manner be reproved of guilt
the second brother who was next begot
washed white in blood from earth hence have not gone
rebound gross arguments upon their heart
which being crossed gives matter of bewailing
the grave that in his ever empty womb
shall not abridge the commendable thank
which underneath the roof of safe content
does think most safety doth remain above
birth blood and ancestors are none of ours
remembrance of their worth we may preserve
look hither then you that enjoy the youth
his flourishing and fair long lived deserts
leading by his example in the path
hath the most share in loss for i in hers
such was the separation here constrained
includes all excellence can be displayed
undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now
and now if i have leveled mine account
who if it were in plenty still would want
but whether doth the stream of my mischance
your lordship's in all duty
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
unlock'd the treasure of his happy state
an expired date cancelld ere well begun
perchance his boast of lucrece' sovereignty
neglected all with swift intent he goes
virtue would stain that o'er with silver white
of either's colour was the other queen
to those two armies that would let him go
little suspecteth the false worshipper
which having all all could not satisfy
he stories to her ears her husband's fame
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
now serves the season that they may surprise
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
what following sorrow may on this arise
that spots and stains love's modest snow white weed
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
thus graceless holds he disputation
where her beloved collatinus lies
self love had never drownd him in the flood
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
and being lighted by the light he spies
he takes for accidental things of trial
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
whether it is that she reflects so bright
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
but that life lived in death and death in life
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
his eye commends the leading to his hand
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'd up eyes
wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
under what colour he commits this ill
where thou with patience must my will abide
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
which like a falcon towering in the skies
to kill thine honour with thy life's decay
'but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the blemish that will never be forgot
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
'in tarquins likeness i did entertain thee
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
where subjects' eyes do learn do read do look
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
o how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
turns not but swells the higher by this let
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
'so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state'
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
her tears should drop on them perpetually
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
to living death and pain perpetual
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she prays she never may behold the day
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel'
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
the silver shining queen he would distain
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
'make me not object to the tell tale day
will couple my reproach to tarquins shame
as i ere this was pure to collatine
my honour lost and i a drone like bee
and talk'd of virtue o unlook'd for evil
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
to hold their cursed blessed fortune long
'o opportunity thy guilt is great
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
being so bad such numbers seek for thee
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
my collatine would else have come to me
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
time's office is to fine the hate of foes
'to fill with worm holes stately monuments
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
and time to see one that by alms doth live
teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
'out idle words servants to shallow fools
in vain i spurn at my confirm'd despite
kill both thyself and her for yielding so'
i fear'd by tarquins falchion to be slain
poor helpless help the treasure stoln away
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
revealing day through every cranny spies
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
will we find out and there we will unfold
'to kill myself' quoth she 'alack what were it
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
through which i may convey this troubled soul
'tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
for fleet wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
no cause but company of her drops spilling
wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil
not that devour'd but that which doth devour
that dying fear through all her body spread
'but tell me girl when went' and there she stay'd
the repetition cannot make it less
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ'
health to thy person next vouchsafe t' afford
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
for then eye interprets to the ear
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
when silly groom god wot it was defect
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
pausing for means to mourn some newer way
many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear
such sweet observance in this work was had
the face of either cipher'd either's heart
wagg'd up and down and from his lips did fly
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
that through their light joy seemed to appear
to find a face where all distress is stelld
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
'poor instrument' quoth she'without a sound
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
to plague a private sin in general
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
he entertaind a show so seeming just
of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry
'it cannot be' quoth she'that so much guile'
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
brings home his lord and other company
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
where no excuse can give the fault amending
from that alas thy lucrece is not free
i'll murder straight and then i'll slaughter thee
and never be forgot in mighty rome
or at the least this refuge let me find
the grief away that stops his answer so
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies' harms'
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
'no no' quoth she 'no dame hereafter living
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
about the mourning and congealed face
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
that i no more can see what once i was
and then in key cold lucrece' bleeding stream
weak words so thick come in his poor heart's aid
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
'my daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours filld
but now he throws that shallow habit by
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
and kiss'd the fatal knife to end his vow
which being done with speedy diligence
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
a dateless lively heat still to endure
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
for men discased but i my mistress' thrall
much liker than your painted counterfeit
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
proving his beauty by succession thine
which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
i will not praise that purpose not to sell
as i not for my self but for thee will
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
for at a frown they in their glory die
to witness duty not to show my wit
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
do in consent shake hands to torture me
i all alone beweep my outcast state
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
of his self love to stop posterity
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
all losses are restored and sorrows end
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
without thy help by me be borne alone
as thou being mine mine is thy good report
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
when thou art all the better part of me
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her
for all the day they view things unrespected
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
as soon as think the place where he would be
these present absent with swift motion slide
i send them back again and straight grow sad
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
beauty o'er snowed and bareness every where
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
my grief lies onward and my joy behind
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
since seldom coming in that long year set
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
and you in every blessed shape we know
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes
which parts the shore where two contracted new
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
your self to pardon of self doing crime
since mind at first in character was done
with beauty's treasure ere it be self killed
to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
so far from home into my deeds to pry
and all my soul and all my every part
self so self loving were iniquity
stealing away the treasure of his spring
but that thou none lov'st is most evident
that beauty still may live in thine or thee
within his bending sickle's compass come
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
holds in perfection but a little moment
to change your day of youth to sullied night
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
or state it self confounded to decay
though i once gone to all the world must die
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
and strength by limping sway disabled
and lace it self with his society
in days long since before these last so bad
without all ornament it self and true
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
lifts up his burning head each under eye
from his low tract and look another way
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
and mock you with me after i am gone
that you for love speak well of me untrue
as after sunset fadeth in the west
without all bail shall carry me away
too base of thee to be remembered
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
to new found methods and to compounds strange
so is my love still telling what is told
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
the worst was this my love was my decay
and only herald to the gaudy spring
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore to your fair no painting set
when others would give life and bring a tomb
that you are you so dignifies his story
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
and for that riches where is my deserving
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
doing thee vantage double vantage me
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
that on himself such murd'rous shame commits
when other petty griefs have done their spite
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
for term of life thou art assured mine
happy to have thy love happy to die
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
which for their habitation chose out thee
the basest jewel will be well esteemed
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
and thou away the very birds are mute
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
your honour's in all duty
stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
'and yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
the steed is stalled up and even now
he burns with bashful shame she with her tears
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
pure shame and awed resistance made him fret
look how he can she cannot choose but love
but when her lips were ready for his pay
whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow
'thus he that overruled i oversway'd
look in mine eye balls there thy beauty lies
make use of time let not advantage slip
'thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
love is a spirit all compact of fire
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
'upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed
wishing adonis had his team to guide
i'll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
'art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
give me one kiss i'll give it thee again
red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
'fondling' she saith 'since i have hemm'd thee here
then be my deer since i am such a park
being mad before how doth she now for wits
but lo from forth a copse that neighbors by
the iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth
anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
look when a painter would surpass the life
look what a horse should have he did not lack
being proud as females are to see him woo her
his testy master goeth about to take him
for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
now was she just before him as he sat
and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
would thou wert as i am and i a man
'for shame' he cries 'let go and let me go
the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
i know not love' quoth he 'nor will not know it
the colt that's back'd and burdend being young
thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong
'say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
and bid suspicion double lock the door
even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red
to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd
as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine
but now i died and death was lively joy
to drive infection from the dangerous year
and pay them at thy leisure one by one
or being early pluck'd is sour to taste
the honey fee of parting tender'd is
and glutton like she feeds yet never filleth
forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack
chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission
the poor fool prays her that he may depart
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
he will not manage her although he mount her
she hath assay'd as much as may be proved
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill
being ireful on the lion he will venture
beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring
that tremble at the imagination
and on thy well breath'd horse keep with thy
and sometime where earth delving conies keep
'by this poor wat far off upon a hill
for misery is trodden on by many
the night is spent' 'why what of that' quoth she
'now of this dark night i perceive the reason
making it subject to the tyranny
both favour savour hue and qualities
'what is thy body but a swallowing grave
foul cankering rust the hidden treasure frets
bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs
'what have you urged that i cannot reprove
which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
therefore in sadness now i will away
which after him she darts as one on shore
even so confounded in the dark she lay
how love makes young men thrall and old men dote
for who hath she to spend the night withal
who doth the world so gloriously behold
and yet she hears no tidings of her love
by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
finding their enemy to be so curst
she tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy
a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
and here she meets another sadly scowling
whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
'if he be dead o no it cannot be
love's golden arrow at him should have fled
the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
variable passions throng her constant woe
for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
'no no' quoth she 'sweet death i did but jest
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
to wail his death who lives and must not die
as falcon to the lure away she flies
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
struggling for passage earth's foundation shakes
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
his face seems twain each several limb is doubled
whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
'and therefore would he put his bonnet on
if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore
'had i been tooth'd like him i must confess
she lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes
it shall be waited on with jealousy
'it shall be sparing and too full of riot
perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
and in his blood that on the ground lay spilld
'poor flower' quoth she 'this was thy fathers guise
there shall not be one minute in an hour
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
our love was new and then but in the spring
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
for to no other pass my verses tend
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned
since all alike my songs and praises be
fair kind and true have often lived alone
so all their praises are but prophecies
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
what's in the brain that ink may character
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
just to the time not with the time exchanged
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
now all is done have what shall have no end
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
your love and pity doth th' impression fill
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
if it be poisoned 'tis the lesser sin
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
like as to make our appetite more keen
and brought to medicine a healthful state
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
when i behold the violet past prime
and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
o that our night of woe might have remembered
for why should others' false adulterate eyes
thy gift thy tables are within my brain
therefore to give them from me was i bold
and rather make them born to our desire
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
to this i witness call the fools of time
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
but now is black beauty's successive heir
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
to be so tickled they would change their state
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
o that you were your self but love you are
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and in some perfumes is there more delight
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
in things of great receipt with case we prove
they know what beauty is see where it lies
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight
not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
only my plague thus far i count my gain
be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
two loves i have of comfort and despair
but being both from me both to each friend
was used in giving gentle doom
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
past cure i am now reason is past care
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when all my best doth worship thy defect
