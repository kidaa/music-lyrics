lover's complaint
from off hill whose concave womb reworded
plaintful story from sistering vale
spirits attend this double voice accorded
down laid list sad tuned tale
ere long espied fickle maid full pale
tearing papers breaking rings twain
storming her world sorrow's wind rain
upon her head platted hive straw
whereon thought might think sometime saw
carcass beauty spent done
time had not scythed all youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite heavens fell rage
some beauty peep'd through lattice sear'd age
oft did she heave her napkin her eyne
which had conceited characters
laundering silken figures brine
seasond woe had pelleted tears
as often shrieking undistinguish'd woe
clamours all size both high low
sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
as they did battery spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right anon their gazes lend
every place at once nowhere fix'd
mind sight distractedly commix'd
proclaim'd her careless hand pride
some untuck'd descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale pined cheek beside
some her threaden fillet still did bide
true bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided loose negligence
thousand favours from maund she drew
amber crystal beaded jet
which one by one she river threw
usury applying wet wet
or monarch's hands let not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
folded schedules had she many one
which she perused sigh'd tore gave flood
crack'd many ring posied gold bone
bidding them find their sepulchres mud
found yet moe letters sadly pennd blood
sleided silk feat affectedly
these often bathed she her fluxive eyes
often kiss'd often 'gan tear
cried 'o false blood thou register lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seem'd more black damned here'
this said top rage lines she rents
big discontent so breaking their contents
reverend man grazed his cattle nigh
sometime blusterer ruffle knew
swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
privileged by age desires know
brief grounds motives her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
comely distant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance his hearing divide
if from him there may aught applied
'tis promised charity age
'father' she says 'though behold
injury many blasting hour
let not tell judgment am old
not age but sorrow over hath power
might as yet have been spreading flower
fresh myself if had self applied
love myself no love beside
'but woe too early attended
one by nature's outwards so commended
maidens' eyes stuck over all his face
love lack'd dwelling made him her place
when his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged newly deified
'his browny locks did hang crooked curls
every light occasion wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
what's sweet do do will aptly find
his visage was little drawn
what largeness thinks paradise was sawn
'small show man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but appear
unshorn velvet termless skin
whose bare out bragg'd web seem'd wear
yet show'd his visage by cost more dear
nice affections wavering stood doubt
if best were as was or best without
maiden tongued he was thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such storm
as oft 'twixt may april see
when winds breathe sweet untidy though they
his rudeness so his authorized youth
did livery falseness pride truth
'well could he ride often men would say
'that horse his mettle from his rider takes
proud subjection noble by sway
he makes'
controversy hence question takes
whether horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by well doing steed
'but quickly this side verdict went
his real habitude gave life grace
appertainings ornament
accomplish'd himself not his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
pieced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so tip his subduing tongue
all kinds arguments question deep
all replication prompt reason strong
his advantage still did wake sleep
make weeper laugh laugher weep
he had dialect different skill
catching all passions his craft will
'that he did general bosom reign
dwell him thoughts or remain
personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitch'd ere he desire have granted
dialogued him what he would say
ask'd their own wills made their wills obey
'many there were did his picture get
serve their eyes put their mind
fools th' imagination set
goodly objects which abroad they find
labouring moe pleasures bestow them
than true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have never touch'd his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress his heart
woeful self did freedom stand
was own fee simple not part
what his art youth youth art
threw affections his charmed power
reserved stalk gave him all flower
demand him nor being desired yielded
finding myself honour so forbid
safest distance mine honour shielded
experience many bulwarks builded
proofs new bleeding which remaind foil
this false jewel his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunnd by precedent
destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples 'gainst her own content
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
when rage advice often seen
by blunting us make our wits more keen
'nor gives satisfaction our blood
must curb upon others' proof
forbod sweets seem so good

o appetite from judgment stand aloof

'for further could say 'this mans untrue'
knew patterns his foul beguiling
heard where his plants others' orchards grew

funeral elegy
since time his predestinated end
abridged circuit his hopeful days
good endeavors deserving praise
5 what memorable monument can last
whereon build his never blemished name
but his own worth wherein his life was graced
sith as ever he maintained same
oblivion darkest day come
10 when sin shall tread merit dust
cannot rase out lamentable tomb
his short lived deserts but still they must
claim fit respect they every limb
15 remembering what he was comfort then
may pattern out one truly good by him
he was truly good if honest care
harmless conversation may commend
life free from such stains as follies are
20 ill recompensed only his end
nor can tongue him who loved him least
if there can minority love
many men steady faith reprove
25 his constant temper equal weight
thankfulness kindness truth doth leave
sufficient proof he was every right
as kind give as thankful receive
curious eye quick brained survey
30 could scantly find mote amidst sun
his too shortened days or make prey
any faulty errors he had done
spite malice but he had
35 warrant enough his own innocence
against sting some nature bad
yet who he so absolutely blest
lives encompassed mortal frame
sometime reputation not oppressed
40 by some nothing famous but defame
such bypath ridgeway lurk
leads ruin smooth pretense
singleness not tending offense
45 whose very virtues are not detract
whiles hope remains gain base fee slaves
despising chiefly men fortunes wracked
but death such gives unremembered graves
now therein lived he happy if
50 free from detraction happiness
his younger years gave comfortable hope
hope comfort his riper youth
education bettered his truth
55 those noble twins heaven infused races
learning wit refined their kind
did jointly both their peculiar graces
enrich curious temple his mind
indeed temple whose precious white
60 sat reason by religion overswayed
teaching his other senses delight
how piety zeal should obeyed
wasting his best time but so content
65 reasons golden mean make defense
against assault youth's encouragement
as not tide this surrounding age
when now his father's death had freed his will
could make him subject drunken rage
70 such whose only glory their ill
he from happy knowledge wise
draws virtue reprove secured fools
spend his spring days sacred schools
75 here gave he diet sick desires
day by day assault weaker man
fit moderation still retires
from what doth batter virtue now then
but not intend full discourse
80 progress out his life could display
good man each part exact force
common voice warrant what say
full days he might have lived see
85 grave peace times should succeed
had been best speaking witnesses
whose conversation so untouched did move
respect most itself as who would scan
his honesty worth by them might prove
90 he was kind true perfect gentleman
not outside disgraceful folly
courting opinion unfit disguise
unbeseeming blushless vanities
95 but suiting so his habit desire
as his virtue was his best attire
not waste many idle words
cared he heard talk nor float
fond conceit such as this age affords
100 by vain discourse upon himself dote
his becoming silence gave such grace
his judicious parts as what he spake
than busy questions such as talkers make
105 though his qualities might well deserve
just commendation yet his furnished mind
such harmony goodness did preserve
as nature never built better kind
knowing best therefore not presuming
110 knowing but was best
ever within himself free choice resuming
true perfection perfect breast
one lodge other both framed
115 fair conditions guests soonest win
applause generality well famed
if trim behavior gestures mild discreet
endeavors modest speech beseeming mirth
true friendship active grace persuasion sweet
120 delightful love innated from his birth
acquaintance unfamiliar carriage just
offenseless resolution wished sobriety
unburthened conscience unfeigned piety
125 if these or all these knit fast one
can merit praise then justly may say
not any from this frailer stage gone
whose name live longer day
though not eminent courts or places great
130 popular concourse yet soil
where he enjoyed his birth life death seat
which now sits mourning his untimely spoil
private persons their private home
135 as those descended from illustrious blood
public view greatness whence they come
though rewarded some sadder taste
knowing shame by feeling have proved
country's thankless misconstruction cast
140 upon name credit both unloved
by some whose fortunes sunk into wane
plenty desert have strove win
reputation witless sin
145 yet time father unblushing truth
may one day lay ope malice which hath crossed
right hopes endangered youth
purchasing credit place lost
even which place subject verse
150 unhappy matter mourning style
which now subject's merits doth rehearse
had education new being while
amongst all all lived there
155 his actions did so wholly suit
worthiness still memorable here
many hours till day doom
will not consume his life hapless end
should he lie obscured without tomb
160 time would time his honesty commend
whiles parents their children will make known
they their posterity impart
by hand guided by cruel heart
165 whereof as many as shall hear sadness
will blame one's hard fate other's madness
whiles such as do recount tale woe
told by remembrance wisest heads
will end conclude matter so
170 as they will all go weeping their beds
when world lies wintered storms
fearful consummation lays down
expecting ever overthrown
175 when proud height much affected sin
shall ripen head pride
end miseries did begin
fall amidst glory his tide
then book where every work writ
180 shall this mans actions revealed show
gainful fruit well employed wit
which paid heaven debt did owe
never untrue where once he love professed
185 which miracle men one saith
long sought though rarely found he best
who can make friendship those times change
admired more being firm than strange
when those weak houses our brittle flesh
190 shall ruined by death our grace strength
youth memory shape made us fresh
cast down utterly decayed at length
low leveled narrow grave
195 what can leave behind us but name
which by life well led may honor have
such honor o thou youth untimely lost
thou didst deserve hast though thy soul
hath took her flight diviner coast
200 yet here earth thy fame lives ever whole
every heart sealed up every tongue
fit matter discourse no day prevented
all alike beloved lamented
205 here thy memorable worth
this last act friendship sacrifice
love thee which could not set forth
any other habit disguise
although could not learn whiles yet thou wert
210 speak language servile breath
truth stole from tongue into heart
which shall not thence sundered but death
had not made thee know how much prized thee
215 but mine error was as yet
think love best silence sized thee
by what would have been not only ready
telling was thine but being so
by some effect show he steady
220 who seems less than he open show
since then still reserved try worst
which hardest fate time thus can lay
while thou hadst life took this task upon
225 register mine unhappy pen
such duties as owes thy desert
set thee as president men
limn thee world but as thou wert
not hired as heaven can witness soul
230 by vain conceit please such ones as know
nor servile liked free from control
which pain many men do not owe
fair lovely branch too soon cut off thee
235 constant irrefragable vow
as had chanced thou mightst have done
but no merit strong enough mine
had yielded store thy well abled quill
whereby t' enroll name as this thine
240 how s'ere enriched by thy plenteous skill
here then offer up memory
value talent precious man
though 't not as would 'tis as can
245 minds from whence endeavor doth proceed
ready will taken deed
yet ere take longest last farewell
from thee fair mark sorrow let frame
some ampler work thank wherein tell
250 what more thou didst deserve than thy name
free thee from scandal such senses
as rancor unhappy spleen
comparing by thy death what thou hast been
255 so his mischiefs world accursed
picks out matter inform worst
willful blindness hoodwinks eyes
men enwrapped an earthy veil
makes them most ignorantly exercise
260 yield humor when doth assail
whereby candle body's light
darkens inward eyesight mind
same ignorance which makes them blind
265 hence conster they corrupt commentaries
proceeding from nature as corrupt
text malice which so often varies
as 'tis by seeming reason underpropped
o whither tends lamentable spite
270 this world's teenful apprehension
which understands all things amiss whose light
shines not amidst dark their dissension
soothed not current besotted fashion
275 nor could disgest as some loose mimics can
an empty sound overweening passion
so much made servant base
sensual aptness disunioned vices
purchase commendation by disgrace
280 whereto world heat sin entices
but safer contemplation
secure what he knew he ever chose
by shunning all invitements strange those
285 whose illness necessary praise
must wait upon their actions only rare
being rare shame which strives raise
their name by doing what they do not care
as if free commission their ill
290 were even as boundless as their prompt desires
only lords subjects their will
which their fond dotage ever more admires
ruling little ordered commonwealth
295 his own self honor law
gave peace his bread bread his health
which ever he maintained sweet content
pleasurable rest wherein he joyed
monarchy comfort's government
300 never until his last destroyed
vineyard heaven favored learning
where he was double honored degree
had taught him both fortunes free
305 whence now retired home home indeed
home his condition estate
he well provided 'gainst hand need
whence young men sometime grow unfortunate
his disposition by bonds unity
310 so fastened his reason strove
understanding's grave immunity
purchase from all hearts steady love
proportionable note what he was
315 than he was so constant his friends
as he would no occasion overpass
which might make known his unaffected care
all respects trial unlock
his bosom his store which did declare
320 christ was his he was friendship's rock
rock friendship figured his name
foreshowing what he was what should
every act perfect amity
325 though complemental phrase words
he never was addicted vain
boast such as common breath affords
he was use most fast tongue most plain
nor amongst all those virtues forever
330 adorned his reputation will found
one greater than his faith which did persever
where once was protested alway sound
rage which wrought his end had he been
335 slacker love he had been longer lived
not oppressed by wrath's unhappy sin
by wrath's unhappy sin which unadvised
gave death free good will wounds love
pity was blood had not been prized
340 at higher rate reason set above
most unjust choler which untimely drew
destruction itself most unjust
as time can boast both love trust
345 so henceforth all great glory his blood
shall but seconds him being good
wicked end their honor their sin
death which only then good begin
lo here lesson by experience taught
350 men whose pure simplicity hath drawn
their trust betrayed by being caught
within snares making truth pawn
without true proof knowledge friend
355 sincere singleness heart adventers
give fit cause ere love begin end
his unfeigned friendship where least was sought
him fatal timeless ruin brought
whereby life purity adorned
360 real merit by this sudden end
mouth some manner scorned
made questionable they do intend
mistook if not observed writ long ago
365 when men were only led by reasons law
such as end life proves so
thus he who universal lapse
gave sweet redemption offering up his blood
conquer death by death loose traps
370 hell even triumph stood
he thus his guiltless life was spilt
by death which was made subject curse
his pure life his end was worse
375 but o far our unholy lips
should so profane deity above
as thereby ordain revenging whips
against day judgment love
hand lends us honor our days
380 may shorten when please justly take
our honor from us many sundry ways
as best becomes wisdom did us make
all ever were begotten yet
385 was by hand vengeance rude hot
sent innocent heaven set
whose fame angels melodious choirs
still witness world then why should he
well profited excellent desires
390 more rebuked who had destiny
those saints before everlasting throne
who sit crowns glory their heads
all their joys quiet their beds
395 but tasted sour bitter scourge
torture affliction ere they gained
those blessings which their sufferance did urge
whereby grace fore promised they attained
let then false suggestions froward
400 building large castles empty air
by suppositions fond thoughts untoward
issues discontent sick despair
may disprove their malice confound
405 uncivil loose opinions which insert
their souls into roll doth unsound
betraying policies show their brains
unto their shame ridiculous whose scope
envy whose endeavors fruitless pains
410 nothing surely prosperous but hope
same hope so lame so unprevailing
buries self conceit weak opinion
their vain designs whom want hath dominion
415 such such condition may devise
which way wound defamations spirit
close lurking whisper's hidden forgeries
his taintless goodness his desertful merit
but whiles minds men can judge sincerely
420 upon assured knowledge his repute
estimation shall rumored clearly
equal worth time shall time renew 't
forever closes up unrespected
425 who when they die die all shall not entomb
his pleading best perfections as neglected
they his notice succeeding years
shall speak him when he shall lie below
when nothing but his memory appears
430 what he was then shall his virtues grow
his being but private man rank
yet not ranked beneath gentleman
which wise posterity shall give him then
435 nature his therein happy fate
ordained by his quality mind
t' ennoble best part although his state
were lower blessedness confined
blood pomp state honor glory command
440 without fit ornaments disposition
are themselves but heathenish profaned
much more peaceful mean condition
feeds bread rest takes delight
445 look upon labors hath spent
its own sustenance both day night
whiles others plotting which way great
how augment their portion ambition
do toil their giddy brains ever sweat
450 popular applause power's commission
but one honors seeled dove
whose inward eyes are dimmed dignity
seeks secure by mounting high
455 whence when he falls who did erewhile aspire
falls deeper down he climbed higher
now men who lower region live
exempt from danger authority
have fittest times reasons rules thrive
460 not vexed envy priority
those are much more noble mind
than many have nobleness by kind
nor can make proper challenge them
465 but virtues perfections our powers
proceed most truly from us if do them
respective titles or gracious style
all what men eminence possess
are without ornaments praise them vile
470 beauty mind nobleness
such as have beauty well deserve
eternal characters after death
so their glory die not their breath
475 else what avails goodly strife
upon this face earth here contend
good t' exceed wicked their life
should both obscured their end
until which end there none rightly can
480 termed happy since happiness
depends upon goodness man
which afterwards his praises will express
best days see how unexpected
485 death can betray jollity ruth
when death think least respected
person this model here set out
had all youth happy days could give him
yet could not all encompass him about
490 against th' assault death who relieve him
strook home but frail mortal parts
his humanity but could not touch
above fate's reach his singleness was such
495 so he dies but once but doubly lives
once his proper self then his name
predestinated time who all deprives
could never yet deprive him same
had genius which attended him
500 been possibilited keep him safe
against rigor hath overgone him
he had been public use staff
which guides doing well wherein so few
505 proneness this age error hath
informed rightly courses true
as then loss one whose inclination
stove win love general sad
so specially his friends soft compassion
510 do feel greatest loss they could have had
amongst them all she who those nine years
lived fellow his counsels his bed
feel what distemperature this chance hath bred
515 chaste embracements conjugal love
who mutual harmony consent
are so impatient strange remove
as meager death itself seems lament
weep upon those cheeks which nature framed
520 delightful orbs whom force
lively sweetness plays so ashamed
death often pities his unkind divorce
well worthy termed rudeness rather
525 his life his love was so unfeigned
as he was both an husband father
one firm affection other
careful providence which ever strove
joint assistance grace one another
530 every helpful furtherance love
but since sum all can said
can but said he was good which wholly
praise virtue reproach folly
535 his due deserts this sentence him gives
he died life yet his death he lives
now runs method this doleful song
accents brief thee o thou deceased
whom those pains do only all belong
540 as witnesses did not love thee least
could worthless brain find out but how
raise thee from sepulcher dust
life heaven counted just
545 if supplicating soul would
give life anew by giving life again
where life missed whereby discomfort should
right his old griefs former joys retain
which now thee are leaped into thy tomb
550 buried hollow vault woe
expecting yet more severer doom
than time's strict flinty hand will let 'em know
reckoned up true measured score
555 those perfect graces which were ever wont
wait thee alive ask no more
but shall hereafter poor content
immure those imputations sustain
learning days youth so prevent
560 as not cast down by them again
only those hopes which fate denies grant
full possession captive heart
before may enjoy his better part
565 from which detained banished th' exile
dim misfortune has none other prop
whereon lean rest itself while
but weak comfort hapless hope
hope must despite fearful change
570 play strongest closet breast
although perhaps ignorantly range
court opinion deep'st unrest
drive beyond myself fast friend soon lost
575 long may thy worthiness thy name advance
amongst virtuous deserving most
who herein hast forever happy proved
life thou lived'st death thou died'st beloved

rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because his own
suggested this proud issue king
by our ears our hearts oft tainted
perchance envy so rich thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his high pitch'd thoughts meaner men should vaunt
golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate
his all too timeless speed if none those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
quench coal which his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp'd repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts ne'er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by roman dame
within whose face beauty virtue strived
which them both should underprop her fame
when virtue bragg'd beauty would blush shame
when beauty boasted blushes despite
but beauty white intituled
from venus' doves doth challenge fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red
which virtue gave golden age gild
their silver cheeks calld then their shield
teaching them thus use fight
when shame assaild red should fence white
this heraldry lucrece' face was seen
argued by beauty's red virtue's white
proving from world's minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still fight
sovereignty either being so great
oft they interchange each other's seat
their silent war lilies roses
which tarquin view'd her fair face's field
their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both should killd
coward captive vanquished doth yield
rather than triumph so false foe
now thinks he her husband's shallow tongue
niggard prodigal praised her so
high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill show
therefore praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers surmise
silent wonder still gazing eyes
this earthly saint adored by this devil
unstaind thoughts do seldom dream evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
reverend welcome her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm express'd
he colour'd his high estate
hiding base sin plaits majesty
nothing him seem'd inordinate
save something too much wonder his eye
but poorly rich so wanteth his store
cloy'd much he pineth still more
but she never coped stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read subtle shining secrecies
writ glassy margents such books
she touch'd no unknown baits nor fear'd no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were opend light
won fields fruitful italy
decks praises collatine's high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
bruised arms wreaths victory
her joy heaved up hand she doth express
wordless so greets heaven his success
far from purpose his coming hither
he makes excuses his being there
no cloudy show stormy blustering weather
till sable night mother dread fear
upon world dim darkness doth display
her vaulty prison stows day
then tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness heavy spright
after supper long he questioned
modest lucrece wore out night
now leaden slumber life's strength doth fight
every one rest themselves betake
as one which doth tarquin lie revolving
sundry dangers his wills obtaining
yet ever obtain his will resolving
though weak built hopes persuade him abstaining
despair gain doth traffic oft gaining
when great treasure meed proposed
though death adjunct there's no death supposed
those much covet are gain so fond
what they have not which they possess
so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more profit excess
but surfeit such griefs sustain
they prove bankrupt this poor rich gain
aim all but nurse life
honour wealth ease waning age
this aim there such thwarting strife
one all or all one gage
as life honour fell battle's rage
death all all together lost
so venturing ill leave
things are which expect
this ambitious foul infirmity
having much torments us defect
have so then do neglect
thing have all want wit
make something nothing by augmenting
such hazard now must doting tarquin make
himself himself must forsake
then where truth if there no self trust
when shall he think find stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
slanderous tongues wretched hateful days
now stole upon time dead night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls' wolves' death boding cries
silly lambs pure thoughts are dead still
while lust murder wake stain kill
now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm
madly toss'd between desire dread
th' one sweetly flatters th' other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitch'd lust's foul charm
doth too too oft betake him retire
beaten away by brain sick rude desire
from cold stone sparks fire do fly
whereat waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must lode star his lustful eye
flame thus speaks advisedly
'as from this cold flint enforced this fire
so lucrece must force desire'
here pale fear he doth premeditate
dangers his loathsome enterprise
his inward mind he doth debate
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour still slaughter'd lust
justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
'fair torch burn out thy light lend not
darken her whose light excelleth thine
die unhallow'd thoughts before blot
uncleanness which divine
offer pure incense so pure shrine
let fair humanity abhor deed
'o shame knighthood shining arms
o foul dishonour household's grave
o impious act including all foul harms
martial man soft fancy's slave
true valour still true respect should have
then digression so vile so base
will live engraven face
'yea though die scandal will survive
an eye sore golden coat
cipher how fondly did dote
posterity shamed note
shall curse bones hold no sin
wish their father had not bin
'what win if gain thing seek
dream breath froth fleeting joy
who buys minute's mirth wail week
or sells eternity get toy
one sweet grape who will vine destroy
would sceptre straight strucken down
'if collatinus dream intent
will he not wake desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose prevent
this siege hath engirt his marriage
this blur youth this sorrow sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an ever during blame
'o what excuse can invention make
will not tongue mute frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light false heart bleed
guilt being great fear doth still exceed
extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but coward trembling terror die
'had collatinus killd son or sire
or lain ambush betray life
or were he not dear friend this desire
might have excuse work upon his wife
but as he kinsman dear friend
shame fault finds no excuse nor end
'shameful ay if fact known
hateful there no hate loving
i'll beg her love but she own
worst but denial reproving
will strong past reasons weak removing
who fears sentence or an old mans saw
shall by painted cloth kept awe'
'tween frozen conscience hot burning will
good thoughts make dispensation
urging worser sense vantage still
which moment doth confound kill
all pure effects doth so far proceed
what vile shows virtuous deed
quoth he 'she took kindly by hand
gazed tidings eager eyes
fearing some hard news from warlike band
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses lawn lay
then white as lawn roses took away
'and how her hand hand being lock'd
forced tremble her loyal fear
which struck her sad then faster rock'd
until her husband's welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled so sweet cheer
had narcissus seen her as she stood
'why hunt then colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse poor abuses
love thrives not heart shadows dreadeth
affection captain he leadeth
when his gaudy banner display'd
coward fights will not dismay'd
'then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect reason wait wrinkled age
sad pause deep regard beseem sage
part youth beats these from stage
desire pilot beauty prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies'
as corn o'ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals open listening ear
full foul hope full fond mistrust
both which as servitors unjust
now he vows league now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits
self same seat sits collatine
eye which looks her confounds his wits
eye which him beholds as more divine
unto view so false will not incline
but pure appeal seeks heart
which once corrupted takes worser part
therein heartens up his servile powers
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
roman lord marcheth lucrece' bed
locks between her chamber his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives creeping thief some regard
night wandering weasels shriek see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents crannies place
wind wars his torch make him stay
blows smoke into his face
extinguishing his conduct this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind fires torch
lucretia's glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes from rushes where lies
griping needle his finger pricks
as who should say 'this glove wanton tricks
not inured return again haste
thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste'
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he worst sense construes their denial
doors wind glove did delay him
or as those bars which stop hourly dial
who lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays hour his debt
'so so' quoth he 'these lets attend time
little frosts sometime threat spring
add more rejoicing prime
give sneaped birds more cause sing
pain pays income each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves sands
now he come unto chamber door
shuts him from heaven his thought
which yielding latch no more
hath barr'd him from blessed thing sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
his prey pray he doth begin
as if heavens should countenance his sin
but midst his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th' eternal power
they would stand auspicious hour
even there he starts quoth he 'i must deflower
powers whom pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist act
'then love fortune gods guide
will back'd resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects tried
blackest sin clear'd absolution
against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution
covers shame follows sweet delight'
this said his guilty hand pluck'd up latch
his knee door he opens wide
dove sleeps fast this night owl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors espied
who sees lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at mercy his mortal sting
into chamber wickedly he stalks
curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs his head
by their high treason his heart misled
which gives watch word his hand full soon
draw cloud hides silver moon
look as fair fiery pointed sun
rushing from forth cloud bereaves our sight
even so curtain drawn his eyes begun
wink being blinded greater light
dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are keep themselves enclosed
o had they darksome prison died
then had they seen period their ill
then collatine again by lucrece' side
his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league kill
holy thoughted lucrece their sight
must sell her joy her life her world's delight
cozening pillow lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems part sunder
swelling either side want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed
where virtuous monument she lies
admired lewd unhallow'd eyes
without bed her other fair hand was
green coverlet whose perfect white
show'd an april daisy grass
her eyes marigolds had sheathed their light
canopied darkness sweetly lay
till they might open adorn day
her hair golden threads play'd her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing life's triumph map death
death's dim look life's mortality
each her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
her breasts ivory globes circled blue
pair maiden worlds unconquered
save their lord no bearing yoke they knew
him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds tarquin new ambition bred
who foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne heave owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
his will his wilful eye he tired
more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snow white dimpled chin
as grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
sharp hunger by conquest satisfied
so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage lust by gazing qualified
slack'd not suppress'd standing by her side
unto greater uproar tempts his veins
they straggling slaves pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
bloody death ravishment delighting
nor childrens tears nor mothers' groans respecting
swell their pride onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives hot charge bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his hand as proud such dignity
smoking pride march'd make his stand
her bare breast heart all her land
whose ranks blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute pale
they mustering quiet cabinet
where their dear governess lady lies
do tell her she dreadfully beset
fright her confusion their cries
who peeping forth this tumult behold
are by his flaming torch dimm'd controlld
imagine her as one dead night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint shaking
what terror or 'tis but she worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
sight which makes supposed terror true
new killd bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quick shifting antics ugly her eyes
such shadows are weak brains forgeries
who angry eyes fly from their lights
darkness daunts them more dreadful sights
his hand yet remains upon her breast
rude ram batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heart poor citizen distress'd
beating her bulk his hand shakes withal
this moves him more rage lesser pity
make breach enter this sweet city
first trumpet doth his tongue begin
sound parley his heartless foe
who o'er white sheet peers her whiter chin
reason this rash alarm know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks show
but she vehement prayers urgeth still
thus he replies 'the colour thy face
even anger makes lily pale
red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead tell loving tale
under colour am come scale
thy never conquer'd fort fault thine
those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
'thus forestall thee if thou mean chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee this night
will marks thee earth's delight
which conquer sought all might
but as reproof reason beat dead
by thy bright beauty was newly bred
'i see what crosses attempt will bring
know what thorns growing rose defends
think honey guarded sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will deaf hears no heedful friends
dotes what he looks 'gainst law or duty
'i have debated even soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow shall breed
but nothing can affections course control
or stop headlong fury his speed
know repentant tears ensue deed
reproach disdain deadly enmity
yet strive embrace mine infamy'
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
coucheth fowl below his wings' shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
trembling fear as fowl hear falcons bells
'lucrece' quoth he'this night must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work way
thy bed purpose destroy thee
done some worthless slave thine i'll slay
thy dead arms do mean place him
swearing slew him seeing thee embrace him
'so thy surviving husband shall remain
scornful mark every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurr'd nameless bastardy
thou author their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up rhymes
sung by children succeeding times
fault unknown as thought unacted
little harm done great good end
lawful policy remains enacted
poisonous simple sometimes compacted
pure compound being so applied
his venom effect purified
'then thy husband thy childrens sake
tender suit bequeath not their lot
shame from them no device can take
worse than slavish wipe or birth hour's blot
marks descried mens nativity
are nature's faults not their own infamy'
here cockatrice' dead killing eye
he rouseth up himself makes pause
while she picture pure piety
white hind under gripe's sharp claws
pleads wilderness where are no laws
rough beast knows no gentle right
but when black faced cloud world doth threat
his dim mist aspiring mountains hiding
from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallow'd haste her words delays
moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul night waking cat he doth but dally
while his hold fast foot weak mouse panteth
swallowing gulf even plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear raining
her pity pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
remorseless wrinkles his face
her modest eloquence sighs mix'd
which her oratory adds more grace
she puts period often from his place
twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry sweet friendship's oath
by her untimely tears her husband's love
by holy human law common troth
by heaven earth all power both
his borrow'd bed he make retire
stoop honour not foul desire
quoth she 'reward not hospitality
mud not fountain gave drink thee
mar not thing cannot amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot ended
he no woodman doth bend his bow
strike poor unseasonable doe
'my husband thy friend his sake spare
thyself art mighty thine own sake leave
myself weakling do not then ensnare
thou look'st not deceit do not deceive
if ever man were moved woman moans
moved tears sighs groans
'all which together troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky wreck threatening heart
soften their continual motion
stones dissolved water do convert
o if no harder than stone thou art
melt at tears compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
hast thou put his shape do him shame
all host heaven complain
thou wrong'st his honour wound'st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem'st if same
thou seem'st not what thou art god king
kings gods should govern everything
'how will thy shame seeded thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if thy hope thou darest do such outrage
o remember'd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can wiped away
then kings' misdeeds cannot hid clay
'this deed will make thee only loved fear
but happy monarchs still are fear'd love
foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they thee offences prove
if but fear this thy will remove
princes are glass school book
'and wilt thou school where lust shall learn
must he thee read lectures such shame
wilt thou glass wherein shall discern
authority sin warrant blame
privilege dishonour thy name
thou black'st reproach against long living laud
makest fair reputation but bawd
'hast thou command by him gave thee
from pure heart command thy rebel will
was lent thee all brood kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when patternd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learnd sin thou didst teach way
'think but how vile spectacle were
view thy present trespass another
mens faults do seldom themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem death worthy thy brother
from their own misdeeds askance their eyes
'to thee thee heaved up hands appeal
not seducing lust thy rash relier
sue exiled majesty's repeal
let him return flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
wipe dim mist from thy doting eyne
thou shalt see thy state pity mine'
'have done' quoth he 'my uncontrolled tide
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
wind greater fury fret
petty streams pay daily debt
their salt sovereign their fresh falls' haste
add his flow but alter not his taste'
'thou art' quoth she 'a sea sovereign king
lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek stain ocean thy blood
thy sea within puddle's womb hearsed
not puddle thy sea dispersed
'so shall these slaves king thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life they thy fouler grave
thou loathed their shame they thy pride
lesser thing should not greater hide
cedar stoops not base shrub's foot
but low shrubs wither at cedar's root
no more' quoth he 'by heaven will not hear thee
yield love if not enforced hate
instead love's coy touch shall rudely tear thee
done despitefully mean bear thee
unto base bed some rascal groom
thy partner this shameful doom'
this said he sets his foot upon light
light lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up blind concealing night
wolf hath seized his prey poor lamb cries
till her own white fleece her voice controlld
entombs her outcry her lips' sweet fold
nightly linen she wears
he pens her piteous clamours her head
cooling his hot face chastest tears
ever modest eyes sorrow shed
o prone lust should stain so pure bed
spots whereof could weeping purify
but she hath lost dearer thing than life
he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force further strife
this momentary joy breeds months pain
this hot desire converts cold disdain
pure chastity rifled her store
lust thief far poorer than before
look as full fed hound or gorged hawk
unapt tender smell or speedy flight
prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious digestion souring
devours his will lived by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust his pride no exclamation
till jade self will himself doth tire
then lank lean discolour'd cheek
heavy eye knit brow strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor meek
bankrupt beggar wails his case
flesh being proud desire doth fight grace
there revels when decays
guilty rebel remission prays
so fares this faultful lord rome
now against himself he sounds this doom
through length times he stands disgraced
besides his souls fair temple defaced
whose weak ruins muster troops cares
ask spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects foul insurrection
have batter'd down her consecrated wall
by their mortal fault brought subjection
her immortality made her thrall
which her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will
even this thought through dark night he stealeth
captive victor hath lost gain
bearing away wound nothing healeth
scar will despite cure remain
leaving his spoil perplex'd greater pain
she bears load lust he left behind
he burden guilty mind
she wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls hates himself his offence
she desperate her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking guilty fear
she stays exclaiming direful night
he runs chides his vanish'd loathed delight
he thence departs heavy convertite
she there remains hopeless castaway
he his speed looks morning light
'for day' quoth she 'nights scapes doth open lay
true eyes have never practised how
cloak offences cunning brow
'they think not but every eye can see
same disgrace which they themselves behold
therefore would they still darkness
have their unseen sin remain untold
they their guilt weeping will unfold
grave water doth eat steel
here she exclaims against repose rest
bids her eyes hereafter still blind
she wakes her heart by beating her breast
bids leap from thence where may find
some purer chest close so pure mind
frantic grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against unseen secrecy night
'o comfort killing night image hell
dim register notary shame
vast sin concealing chaos nurse blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour defame
grim cave death whispering conspirator
close tongued treason ravisher
'o hateful vaporous foggy night
since thou art guilty cureless crime
muster thy mists meet eastern light
make war against proportiond course time
or if thou wilt permit sun climb
knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
'with rotten damps ravish morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
life purity supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noon tide prick
let thy misty vapours march so thick
their smoky ranks his smother'd light
may set at noon make perpetual night
'were tarquin night as he but night's child
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through night's black bosom should not peep again
so should have co partners pain
fellowship woe doth woe assuage
as palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage
'where now have no one blush
cross their arms hang their heads mine
mask their brows hide their infamy
but alone alone must sit pine
mingling talk tears grief groans
poor wasting monuments lasting moans
'o night thou furnace foul reeking smoke
let not jealous day behold face
which underneath thy black all hiding cloak
immodestly lies martyr'd disgrace
keep still possession thy gloomy place
all faults which thy reign are made
may likewise sepulchred thy shade
light will show character'd brow
story sweet chastity's decay
impious breach holy wedlock vow
yea illiterate know not how
cipher what writ learned books
will quote loathsome trespass looks
'the nurse still her child will tell story
fright her crying babe tarquins name
orator deck his oratory
feast finding minstrels tuning defame
will tie hearers attend each line
how tarquin wronged collatine
'let good name senseless reputation
collatine's dear love kept unspotted
if made theme disputation
branches another root are rotted
undeserved reproach him allotted
as clear from this attaint mine
'o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crest wounding private scar
reproach stamp'd collatinus' face
tarquins eye may read mot afar
how he peace wounded not war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he gives them knows
'if collatine thine honour lay
from by strong assault bereft
have no perfection summer left
but robb'd ransack'd by injurious theft
thy weak hive wandering wasp hath crept
suck'd honey which thy chaste bee kept
'yet am guilty thy honour's wrack
yet thy honour did entertain him
coming from thee could not put him back
had been dishonour disdain him
besides weariness he did complain him
when virtue profaned such devil
'why should worm intrude maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch sparrows' nests
or toads infect fair founts venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk gentle breasts
or kings breakers their own behests
but no perfection so absolute
some impurity doth not pollute
'the aged man coffers up his gold
scarce hath eyes his treasure behold
but still pining tantalus he sits
useless barns harvest his wits
having no other pleasure his gain
but torment cannot cure his pain
'so then he hath when he cannot use

'poor hand why quiver'st thou at this decree
honour thyself rid this shame
if die honour lives thee
but if live thou livest defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
wast afeard scratch her wicked foe
this said from her tumbled couch she starteth
find some desperate instrument death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
make more vent passage her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna air consumes
or which from discharged cannon fumes
'in vain' quoth she 'i live seek vain
some happy mean end hapless life
yet self same purpose seek knife
but when fear'd was loyal wife
so am now o no cannot
true type hath tarquin rifled
'o gone which sought live
therefore now need not fear die
clear this spot by death at least give
badge fame slander's livery
dying life living infamy
burn guiltless casket where lay
'well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
stained taste violated troth
will not wrong thy true affection so
flatter thee an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
thou art doting father his fruit
'nor shall he smile at thee secret thought
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely gold but stoln from forth thy gate
am mistress fate
trespass never will dispense
till life death acquit forced offence
'i will not poison thee attaint
nor fold fault cleanly coind excuses
sable ground sin will not paint
hide truth this false night's abuses
as from mountain spring feeds dale
shall gush pure streams purge impure tale'
by this lamenting philomel had ended
well tuned warble her nightly sorrow
solemn night slow sad gait descended
ugly hell when lo blushing morrow
lends light all fair eyes light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself see
therefore still night would cloister'd
seems point her out where she sits weeping
whom she sobbing speaks 'o eye eyes
why pry'st thou through window leave thy peeping
mock thy tickling beams eyes are sleeping
brand not forehead thy piercing light
day hath nought do what's done by night'
thus cavils she every thing she sees
true grief fond testy as child
who wayward once his mood nought agrees
continuance tames one other wild
an unpractised swimmer plunging still
too much labour drowns want skill
so she deep drenched sea care
holds disputation each thing she views
herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passions strength renews
as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief dumb hath no words
little birds tune their morning's joy
make her moans mad their sweet melody
mirth doth search bottom annoy
sad souls are slain merry company
grief best pleased grief's society
true sorrow then feelingly sufficed
when semblance sympathized
'tis double death drown ken shore
he ten times pines pines beholding food
great grief grieves most at would do good
deep woes roll forward gentle flood
who being stopp'd bounding banks o'erflows
grief dallied nor law nor limit knows
'you mocking birds' quoth she 'your tunes entomb
within hollow swelling feather'd breasts
hearing mute dumb
restless discord loves no stops nor rests
woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
distress likes dumps when time kept tears
'come philomel sing'st ravishment
make thy sad grove dishevelld hair
as dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so at each sad strain will strain tear
deep groans diapason bear
burden wise i'll hum tarquin still
while thou tereus descant'st better skill
'and whiles against thorn thou bear'st thy part
imitate thee well against heart
will fix sharp knife affright mine eye
who if wink shall thereon fall die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heart strings true languishment
'and poor bird thou sing'st not day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from way
knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
creatures stern sad tunes change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds'
as poor frighted deer stands at gaze
wildly determining which way fly
or one encompass'd winding maze
cannot tread way out readily
so herself she mutiny
live or die which twain were better
when life shamed death reproach's debtor
but body poor souls pollution
they lose half greater patience bear
than they whose whole swallow'd confusion
mother tries merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay other nurse none
'my body or soul which was dearer
when one pure other made divine
whose love either myself was nearer
ay bark peeld from lofty pine
his leaves will wither his sap decay
so must soul her bark being peeld away
'her house sack'd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batter'd by enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoild corrupted
grossly engirt daring infamy
then let not calld impiety
if this blemish'd fort make some hole
'yet die will not till collatine
have heard cause untimely death
he may vow sad hour mine
revenge him made stop breath
stained blood tarquin i'll bequeath
which by him tainted shall him spent
as his due writ testament
'my honour i'll bequeath unto knife
wounds body so dishonoured
one will live other being dead
so shame's ashes shall fame bred
death murder shameful scorn
shame so dead mine honour new born
'dear lord dear jewel have lost
what legacy shall bequeath thee
resolution love shall thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest
how tarquin must used read
sake serve thou false tarquin so
'this brief abridgement will make
soul body skies ground
resolution husband do thou take
mine honour knife's makes wound
shame his did fame confound
all fame lives disbursed
those live think no shame
'thou collatine shalt oversee this will
blood shall wash slander mine ill
life's foul deed life's fair end shall free
faint not faint heart but stoutly say 'so it'
yield hand hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die both shall victors be'
this plot death when sadly she had laid
wiped brinish pearl from her bright eyes
untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience her mistress hies
poor lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure good morrow
soft slow tongue true mark modesty
sorts sad look her lady's sorrow
why her face wore sorrow's livery
but durst not ask her audaciously
why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks over wash'd woe
each flower moistend melting eye
even so maid swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
those fair suns set her mistress' sky
who salt waved ocean quench their light
which makes maid weep dewy night
pretty while these pretty creatures stand
ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps other takes hand
their gentle sex weep are often willing
grieving themselves guess at others' smarts
then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
men have marble women waxen minds
therefore are they form'd as marble will
weak oppress'd impression strange kinds
form'd them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not authors their ill
no more than wax shall accounted evil
their smoothness goodly champaign plain
lays open all little worms creep
men as rough grown grove remain
cave keeping evils obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes bold stern looks
poor womens faces are their own fault's books
no man inveigh against wither'd flower
but chide rough winter flower hath killd
worthy blame o let not hild
poor womens faults they are so fulfilld
mens abuses those proud lords blame
make weak made women tenants their shame
precedent whereof lucrece view
assaild by night circumstances strong
present death shame might ensue
by her death do her husband wrong
such danger resistance did belong
who cannot abuse body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
poor counterfeit her complaining
'my girl' quoth she 'on what occasion break
those tears from thee down thy cheeks are
raining
if thou dost weep grief sustaining
know gentle wench small avails mood
if tears could help mine own would do good
till after deep groan 'tarquin from hence'
'madam ere was up' replied maid
'the more blame sluggard negligence
yet fault thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere break day
ere rose was tarquin gone away
'but lady if maid may so bold
she would request know heaviness'
'o peace' quoth lucrece 'if should told
more than can well express
deep torture may calld hell
when more felt than one hath power tell
'go get hither paper ink pen
yet save labour have them here
what should say one husband's men
bid thou ready by by bear
letter lord love dear
bid him speed prepare carry
her maid gone she prepares write
first hovering o'er paper her quill
conceit grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down blotted straight will
this too curious good this blunt ill
much press people at door
throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins 'thou worthy lord
unworthy wife greeteth thee
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed come visit
so commend from our house grief
woes are tedious though words are brief'
here folds she up tenor her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her grief's true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
ere she blood had staind her staind excuse
besides life feeling her passion
she hoards spend when he by hear her
when sighs groans tears may grace fashion
her disgrace better so clear her
from suspicion which world might bear her
shun this blot she would not blot letter
words till action might become them better
see sad sights moves more than hear them told
heavy motion doth behold
when every part part woe doth bear
'tis but part sorrow hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
sorrow ebbs being blown wind words
her letter now seald writ
'at ardea lord more than haste'
post attends she delivers
charging sour faced groom hie as fast
speed more than speed but dull slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes
homely villain court'sies her low
blushing her steadfast eye
receives scroll without or yea or no
forth bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
lucrece thought he blush'd her see shame
spirit life bold audacity
such harmless creatures have true respect
talk deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do leisurely
even so this pattern worn out age
pawnd honest looks but laid no words gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
two red fires both their faces blazed
she thought he blush'd as knowing tarquins lust
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
more she saw blood his cheeks replenish
more she thought he spied her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again
yet duteous vassal scarce gone
weary time she cannot entertain
now 'tis stale sigh weep groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
she her plaints little while doth stay
at last she calls mind where hangs piece
skilful painting made priam's troy
before which drawn power greece
helens rape city destroy
threatening cloud kissing ilion annoy
which conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven seem'd kiss turrets bow'd
thousand lamentable objects there
scorn nature art gave lifeless life
shed slaughter'd husband by wife
red blood reek'd show painter's strife
dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights
dying coals burnt out tedious nights
there might see labouring pioner
begrimed sweat smeared all dust
from towers troy there would appear
very eyes men through loop holes thrust
gazing upon greeks little lust
one might see those far off eyes look sad
great commanders grace majesty
might behold triumphing their faces
youth quick bearing dexterity
pale cowards marching trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
one would swear he saw them quake tremble
ajax ulysses o what art
physiognomy might one behold
their face their manners most expressly told
ajax' eyes blunt rage rigor rolld
but mild glance sly ulysses lent
show'd deep regard smiling government
there pleading might see grave nestor stand
as 'twere encouraging greeks fight
making such sober action his hand
beguiled attention charm'd sight
speech seem'd his beard all silver white
thin winding breath which purld up sky
about him were press gaping faces
which seem'd swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low painter was so nice
scalps many almost hid behind
jump up higher seem'd mock mind
here one mans hand leand another's head
here one being throng'd bears back all bolln
red
another smother'd seems pelt swear
their rage such signs rage they bear
as but loss nestor's golden words
seem'd they would debate angry swords
much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
achilles' image stood his spear
was left unseen save eye mind
hand foot face leg head
stood whole imagined
from walls strong besieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector march'd
field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
their hope they such odd action yield
bright things staind kind heavy fear
from strand dardan where they fought
simois' reedy banks red blood ran
whose waves imitate battle sought
swelling ridges their ranks began
break upon galled shore than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join shoot their foam at simois' banks
this well painted piece lucrece come
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress dolour dwelld
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring priam's wounds her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus' proud foot lies
her painter had anatomized
time's ruin beauty's wreck grim care's reign
her cheeks chaps wrinkles were disguised
what she was no semblance did remain
wanting spring those shrunk pipes had fed
show'd life imprisond body dead
this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
shapes her sorrow beldam's woes
who nothing wants answer her but cries
bitter words ban her cruel foes
painter was no god lend her those
therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
give her so much grief not tongue
i'll tune thy woes lamenting tongue
drop sweet balm priam's painted wound
rail pyrrhus hath done him wrong
tears quench troy burns so long
knife scratch out angry eyes
all greeks are thine enemies
'show strumpet began this stir
nails her beauty may tear
thy heat lust fond paris did incur
thy eye kindled fire burneth here
here troy trespass thine eye
sire son dame daughter die
'why should private pleasure some one
become public plague many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls freed from guilty woe
one's offence why should so many fall
'lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend bloody channel lies
friend friend gives unadvised wounds
one mans lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam cheque'd his sons desire
troy had been bright fame not fire'
here feelingly she weeps troy's painted woes
sorrow heavy hanging bell
then little strength rings out doleful knell
so lucrece set work sad tales doth tell
pencilld pensiveness colour'd sorrow
she lends them words she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about painting round
whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees wretched image bound
piteous looks phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full cares yet show'd content
so mild patience seem'd scorn his woes
him painter labour'd his skill
hide deceit give harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
brow unbent seem'd welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale fear false hearts have
but constant confirmed devil
therein so ensconced his secret evil
jealousy itself could not mistrust
false creeping craft perjury should thrust
into so bright day such black faced storms
or blot hell born sin such saint forms
well skilld workman this mild image drew
perjured sinon whose enchanting story
credulous old priam after slew
whose words wildfire burnt shining glory
little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces
this picture she advisedly perused
chid painter his wondrous skill
saying some shape sinons was abused
so fair form lodged not mind so ill
still him she gazed gazing still
such signs truth his plain face she spied
she concludes picture was belied
she would have said 'can lurk such look'
but tarquins shape came her mind while
from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took
'it cannot be' she sense forsook
turnd thus' cannot find
but such face should bear wicked mind
'for even as subtle sinon here painted
so sober sad so weary so mild
as if grief or travail he had fainted
outward honesty but yet defiled
inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did tarquin so troy did perish
'look look how listening priam wets his eyes
see those borrow'd tears sinon sheds
priam why art thou old yet not wise
every tear he falls trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls his move thy pity
'such devils steal effects from lightless hell
sinon his fire doth quake cold
cold hot burning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only flatter fools make them bold
so priam's trust false sinons tears doth flatter
he finds means burn his troy water'
here all enraged such passion her assails
patience quite beaten from her breast
comparing him unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly this gives o'er
'fool fool' quoth she 'his wounds will not sore'
thus ebbs flows current her sorrow
time doth weary time her complaining
she looks night then she longs morrow
both she thinks too long her remaining
short time seems long sorrow's sharp sustaining
they watch see time how slow creeps
which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought
she painted images hath spent
being from feeling her own grief brought
by deep surmise others' detriment
losing her woes shows discontent
easeth some though none ever cured
think their dolour others have endured
but now mindful messenger come back
who finds his lucrece clad mourning black
round about her tear stained eye
blue circles stream'd rainbows sky
these water galls her dim element
foretell new storms those already spent
which when her sad beholding husband saw
amazedly her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod tears look'd red raw
her lively colour killd deadly cares
both stood old acquaintance trance
met far from home wondering each other's chance
at last he takes her by bloodless hand
thus begins 'what uncouth ill event
hath thee befalln thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
tell thy grief may give redress'
ere once she can discharge one word woe
at length address'd answer his desire
she modestly prepares let them know
her honour ta'en prisoner by foe
while collatine his consorted lords
sad attention long hear her words
now this pale swan her watery nest
begins sad dirge her certain ending
'few words' quoth she 'shall fit trespass best
moe woes than words are now depending
laments would drawn out too long
tell them all one poor tired tongue
'then this all task hath say
dear husband interest thy bed
stranger came pillow lay
where thou was wont rest thy weary head
what wrong else may imagined
by foul enforcement might done
'for dreadful dead dark midnight
shining falchion chamber came
creeping creature flaming light
softly cried 'awake thou roman dame
entertain love else lasting shame
thee thine this night will inflict
if thou love's desire do contradict
' 'for some hard favour'd groom thine' quoth he
'unless thou yoke thy liking will
swear found where did fulfil
loathsome act lust so did kill
lechers their deed this act will
fame thy perpetual infamy'
'with this did begin start cry
then against heart he sets his sword
swearing unless took all patiently
should not live speak another word
so should shame still rest upon record
th' adulterate death lucrece her groom
'mine enemy was strong poor self weak
far weaker so strong fear
bloody judge forbade tongue speak
no rightful plea might plead justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence swear
poor beauty had purloind his eyes
when judge robb'd prisoner dies
'o teach how make mine own excuse
though gross blood staind this abuse
immaculate spotless mind
was not forced never was inclined
accessary yieldings but still pure
doth her poisond closet yet endure'
lo here hopeless merchant this loss
head declined voice damm'd up woe
sad set eyes wretched arms across
from lips new waxen pale begins blow
but wretched as he he strives vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch violent roaring tide
outruns eye doth behold his haste
yet eddy boundeth his pride
back strait forced him so fast
rage sent out recalld rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make saw
push grief back same grief draw
his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
'dear lord thy sorrow sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feeling painful let then suffice
drown one woe one pair weeping eyes
'and sake when might charm thee so
she was thy lucrece now attend
suddenly revenged foe
from what past help thou shalt lend
comes all too late yet let traitor die
sparing justice feeds iniquity
'but ere name him fair lords' quoth she
speaking those came collatine
'shall plight honourable faiths
swift pursuit venge this wrong mine
'tis meritorious fair design
chase injustice revengeful arms
at this request noble disposition
each present lord began promise aid
as bound knighthood her imposition
longing hear hateful foe bewray'd
but she yet her sad task hath not said
protestation stops 'o speak ' quoth she
'how may this forced stain wiped from
'what quality mine offence
being constraind dreadful circumstance
low declined honour advance
may any terms acquit from this chance
poisond fountain clears itself again
why not from this compelled stain'
this they all at once began say
her body's stain her mind untainted clears
while joyless smile she turns away
face map which deep impression bears
hard misfortune carved tears
by excuse shall claim excuse's giving'
here sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquins name 'he he' she says
but more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents delays
untimely breathings sick short assays
she utters this 'he he fair lords 'tis he
guides this hand give this wound me'
even here she sheathed her harmless breast
blow did from deep unrest
polluted prison where breathed
her contrite sighs unto clouds bequeath'd
her winged sprite through her wounds doth fly
life's lasting date from cancelld destiny
stone still astonish'd this deadly deed
stood collatine all his lordly crew
till lucrece' father beholds her bleed
himself her self slaughter'd body threw
murderous knife as left place
her blood poor revenge held chase
bubbling from her breast doth divide
two slow rivers crimson blood
circles her body every side
who late sack'd island vastly stood
bare unpeopled this fearful flood
some her blood still pure red remaind
some look'd black false tarquin staind
black blood watery rigol goes
which seems weep upon tainted place
ever since as pitying lucrece' woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at which so putrified
'daughter dear daughter' old lucretius cries
'that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if child father's image lies
thou wast not this end from derived
if children predecease progenitors
are their offspring they none ours
'poor broken glass often did behold
thy sweet semblance old age new born
but now fresh fair mirror dim old
shows bare boned death by time out worn
o from thy cheeks image thou hast torn
shivered all beauty glass
'o time cease thou thy course last no longer
if they surcease should survive
shall rotten death make conquest stronger
leave faltering feeble souls alive
old bees die young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again see
thy father die not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from dream
bids lucretius give his sorrow place
he falls bathes pale fear his face
counterfeits die her space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
live revenged her death
deep vexation his inward soul
hath served dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad sorrow should his use control
or keep him from heart easing words so long
begins talk but through his lips do throng
no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime 'tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if name he tore
this windy tempest till blow up rain
held back his sorrow's tide make more
at last rains busy winds give o'er
then son father weep equal strife
who should weep most daughter or wife
one doth call her his other his
father says 'she's mine' 'o mine she is'
replies her husband 'do not take away
sorrow's interest let no mourner say
he weeps her she was only mine
only must waild by collatine'
'o' quoth lucretius' did give life
which she too early too late hath spilld'
'woe woe' quoth collatine 'she was wife
owed her 'tis mine she hath killd'
dispersed air who holding lucrece' life
answer'd their cries 'my daughter' 'my wife'
brutus who pluck'd knife from lucrece' side
seeing such emulation their woe
began clothe his wit state pride
burying lucrece' wound his folly's show
he romans was esteemed so
as silly jeering idiots are kings
sportive words uttering foolish things
wherein deep policy did him disguise
arm'd his long hid wits advisedly
cheque tears collatinus' eyes
'thou wronged lord rome' quoth 'arise
let unsounded self supposed fool
now set thy long experienced wit school
'why collatine woe cure woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
revenge give thyself blow
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook matter so
slay herself should have slain her foe
'courageous roman do not steep thy heart
such relenting dew lamentations
but kneel help bear thy part
rouse our roman gods invocations
they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself them doth stand disgraced
'now by capitol adore
by this chaste blood so unjustly staind
by heavens fair sun breeds fat earth's
store
by all our country rights rome maintaind
by chaste lucrece' soul late complaind
her wrongs us by this bloody knife
will revenge death this true wife'
this said he struck his hand upon his breast
his protestation urged rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly ground their knees they bow
deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat they swore
when they had sworn this advised doom
they did conclude bear dead lucrece thence
show her bleeding body thorough rome
so publish tarquins foul offence
romans plausibly did give consent
tarquins everlasting banishment
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
insufficiency heart sway
make give lie true sight
swear brightness doth not grace day
whence hast thou this becoming things ill
very refuse thy deeds
there such strength warrantise skill
who taught thee how make love thee more
more hear see just cause hate
o though love what others do abhor
others thou shouldst not abhor state
if thy unworthiness raised love
more worthy beloved thee
love too young know what conscience
yet who knows not conscience born love
then gentle cheater urge not amiss
thou betraying do betray
nobler part gross body's treason
soul doth tell body he may
triumph love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud this pride
he contented thy poor drudge
stand thy affairs fall by thy side
no want conscience hold call
loving thee thou know'st am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn love swearing
act thy bed vow broke new faith torn
vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why two oaths' breach do accuse thee
when break twenty am perjured most
all vows are oaths but misuse thee
all honest faith thee lost
have sworn deep oaths thy deep kindness
enlighten thee gave eyes blindness
or made them swear against thing they see
have sworn thee fair more perjured
swear against truth so foul
cupid laid by his brand fell asleep
maid dians this advantage found
his love kindling fire did quickly steep
cold valley fountain ground
which borrowed from this holy fire love
grew seeting bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies sovereign cure
but at mistress' eye love's brand new fired
boy trial needs would touch breast
sick withal help bath desired
thither hied sad distempered guest
but found no cure bath help lies
where cupid got new fire mistress' eyes
little love god lying once asleep
whilst many nymphs vowed chaste life keep
came tripping by but her maiden hand
fairest votary took up fire
which many legions true hearts had warmed
so general hot desire
was sleeping by virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing bath healthful remedy
came there cure this by prove
love's fire heats water water cools not love
but wherefore do not mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
fortify self decay
means more blessed than barren rhyme
now stand top happy hours
many maiden gardens yet unset
virtuous wish would bear living flowers
so should lines life life repair
which this time's pencil or pupil pen
neither inward worth nor outward fair
can make live self eyes men
give away self keeps self still
must live drawn by own sweet skill
who will believe verse time come
if were filled most high deserts
though yet heaven knows but as tomb
if could write beauty eyes
fresh numbers number all graces
age come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
so should papers yellowed their age
scorned old men less truth than tongue
true rights termed poet's rage
stretched metre an antique song
but were some child yours alive time
shall compare thee summer's day
thou art more lovely more temperate
rough winds do shake darling buds may
summer's lease hath all too short date
sometime too hot eye heaven shines
often his gold complexion dimmed
every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest his shade
when eternal lines time thou grow'st
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this this gives life thee
devouring time blunt thou lions paws
make earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck keen teeth from fierce tiger's jaws
burn long lived phoenix her blood
make glad sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
wide world all her fading sweets
but forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not thy hours love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there thine antique pen
him thy course untainted do allow
beauty's pattern succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
love shall verse ever live young
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
thy youth's proud livery so gazed now
will tattered weed small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all treasure thy lusty days
say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer 'this fair child mine
shall sum count make old excuse'
this were new made when thou art old
see thy blood warm when thou feelst cold
womans face nature's own hand painted
hast thou master mistress passion
womans gentle heart but not acquainted
shifting change as false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false rolling
gilding object whereupon gazeth
man hue all hues his controlling
woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell doting
by addition thee defeated
by adding one thing purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out womens pleasure
mine thy love thy love's use their treasure
so not as muse
stirred by painted beauty his verse
who heaven self ornament doth use
making couplement proud compare
sun moon earth sea's rich gems
aprils first born flowers all things rare
heavens air this huge rondure hems
o let true love but truly write
then believe love as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed heavens air
let them say more hearsay well
glass shall not persuade am old
so long as youth thou are one date
but when thee time's furrows behold
then look death days should expiate
all beauty doth cover thee
but seemly raiment heart
which thy breast doth live as thine
how can then elder than thou art
o therefore love thyself so wary
bearing thy heart which will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not thy heart when mine slain
thou gav'st thine not give back again
as an unperfect actor stage
who his fear put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so fear trust forget say
mine own love's strength seem decay
o'ercharged burthen mine own love's might
o let looks then eloquence
dumb presagers speaking breast
who plead love look recompense
more than tongue more hath more expressed
o learn read what silent love hath writ
hear eyes belongs love's fine wit
mine eye hath played painter hath stelled
body frame wherein 'tis held
perspective best painter's art
through painter must see his skill
find where true image pictured lies
which bosom's shop hanging still
hath his windows glazed thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape thine
are windows breast where through sun
yet eyes this cunning want grace their art
they draw but what they see know not heart
let those who are favour their stars
public honour proud titles boast
whilst whom fortune such triumph bars
unlooked joy honour most
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
but as marigold at suns eye
themselves their pride lies buried
painful warrior famoused fight
after thousand victories once foiled
from book honour razed quite
all rest forgot which he toiled
then happy love am beloved
where may not remove nor removed
lord love whom vassalage
thy merit hath duty strongly knit
thee send this written embassage
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare wanting words show
but hope some good conceit thine
thy souls thought all naked will bestow
till whatsoever star guides moving
points graciously fair aspect
puts apparel tattered loving
show worthy thy sweet respect
then may dare boast how do love thee
weary toil haste bed
dear respose limbs travel tired
but then begins journey head
work mind when body's work's expired
then thoughts from far where abide
intend zealous pilgrimage thee
keep drooping eyelids open wide
looking darkness which blind do see
save souls imaginary sight
which jewel hung ghastly night
makes black night beauteous her old face new
lo thus by day limbs by night mind
thee self no quiet find
how can then return happy plight
am debarred benefit rest
when day's oppression not eased by night
but day by night night by day oppressed
each though enemies either's reign
one by toil other complain
how far toil still farther off from thee
tell day please him thou art bright
dost him grace when clouds do blot heaven
so flatter swart complexioned night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st even
but day doth daily draw sorrows longer
night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
when disgrace fortune mens eyes
trouble deaf heaven bootless cries
look upon self curse fate
wishing one more rich hope
featured him him friends possessed
desiring this mans art mans scope
what most enjoy contented least
yet these thoughts self almost despising
haply think thee then state
lark at break day arising
thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
then scorn change state kings
look thy glass tell face thou viewest
now time face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile world unbless some mother
where she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains tillage thy husbandry
or who he so fond will tomb
thou art thy mother's glass she thee
calls back lovely april her prime
so thou through windows thine age shalt see
despite wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not
die single thine image dies thee
when sessions sweet silent thought
summon up remembrance things past
sigh lack many thing sought
then can drown an eye unused flow
precious friends hid death's dateless night
weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
moan th' expense many vanished sight
then can grieve at grievances foregone
heavily from woe woe tell o'er
sad account fore bemoaned moan
which new pay as if not paid before
but if while think thee dear friend
if thou survive well contented day
when churl death bones dust shall cover
shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines thy deceased lover
compare them bett'ring time
though they outstripped by every pen
reserve them love not their rhyme
exceeded by height happier men
o then vouchsafe but this loving thought
dearer birth than this his love had brought
march ranks better equipage
but since he died poets better prove
theirs their style i'll read his his love'
full many glorious morning have seen
flatter mountain tops sovereign eye
kissing golden face meadows green
gilding pale streams heavenly alchemy
anon permit basest clouds ride
from forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen west this disgrace
even so sun one early morn did shine
all triumphant splendour brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
region cloud hath masked him from now
yet him this love no whit disdaineth
suns world may stain when heavens sun staineth
why didst thou promise such beauteous day
let base clouds o'ertake way
hiding thy brav'ry their rotten smoke
'tis not enough through cloud thou break
dry rain storm beaten face
no man well such salve can speak
heals wound cures not disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic grief
though thou repent yet have still loss
th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
they are rich ransom all ill deeds
no more grieved at which thou hast done
roses have thorns silver fountains mud
clouds eclipses stain both moon sun
loathsome canker lives sweetest bud
all men make faults even this
authorizing thy trespass compare
self corrupting salving thy amiss
thy sensual fault bring sense
thy adverse party thy advocate
'gainst self lawful plea commence
such civil war love hate
an accessary needs must
sweet thief which sourly robs from
let confess two must twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots do remain
our two loves there but one respect
though our lives separable spite
which though alter not love's sole effect
yet doth steal sweet hours from love's delight
may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou public kindness honour
unless thou take honour from thy name
but do not so love thee such sort
as decrepit father takes delight
see his active child do deeds youth
so made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all comfort thy worth truth
whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any these all or all or more
entitled thy parts do crowned sit
make love engrafted this store
so then am not lame poor nor despised
thy abundance am sufficed
by part all thy glory live
look what best best wish thee
this wish have then ten times happy
how can muse want subject invent
while thou dost breathe pour'st into verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
every vulgar paper rehearse
o give thy self thanks if aught
who's so dumb cannot write thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
thou tenth muse ten times more worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
he calls thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers outlive long date
if slight muse do please these curious days
pain mine but thine shall praise
o how thy worth manners may sing
what can mine own praise mine own self bring
what is't but mine own when praise thee
even this let us divided live
our dear love lose name single one
by this separation may give
due thee which thou deserv'st alone
o absence what torment wouldst thou prove
were not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
entertain time thoughts love
thou teachest how make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
being frank she lends those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
bounteous largess given thee give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
having traffic thy self alone
thou thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must tombed thee
which used lives th' executor
take all loves love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love love thou mayst true love call
then if love thou love receivest
cannot blame thee love thou usest
but yet blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste what thy self refusest
do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all poverty
yet love knows greater grief
bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
lascivious grace whom all ill well shows
those pretty wrongs liberty commits
when am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty thy years full well befits
still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art therefore won
beauteous thou art therefore assailed
when woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay but yet thou mightst seat forbear
who lead thee their riot even there
where thou art forced break twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her thee
thine by thy beauty being false
thou hast her not all grief
yet may said loved her dearly
she hath thee wailing chief
loss love touches more nearly
loving offenders thus will excuse ye
sake even so doth she abuse
suff'ring friend sake approve her
if lose thee loss love's gain
losing her friend hath found loss
both find each other lose both twain
both sake lay this cross
but here's joy friend are one
sweet flattery then she loves but alone
when most wink then do mine eyes best see
but when sleep dreams they look thee
darkly bright are bright dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
clear day thy much clearer light
when unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would say mine eyes blessed made
by looking thee living day
when dead night thy fair imperfect shade
all days are nights see till see thee
nights bright days when dreams do show thee
if dull substance flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop way
then despite space would brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although foot did stand
upon farthest earth removed from thee
nimble thought can jump both sea land
but ah thought kills am not thought
leap large lengths miles when thou art gone
but so much earth water wrought
must attend time's leisure moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges either's woe
other two slight air purging fire
are both thee wherever abide
first thought other desire
when these quicker elements are gone
tender embassy love thee
life being made four two alone
sinks down death oppressed melancholy
until life's composition recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
thy fair health recounting
this told joy but then no longer glad
mine eye heart are at mortal war
how divide conquest thy sight
mine eye heart thy picture's sight would bar
heart mine eye freedom right
heart doth plead thou him dost lie
closet never pierced crystal eyes
but defendant doth plea deny
says him thy fair appearance lies
side this title impanelled
by their verdict determined
clear eye's moiety dear heart's part
as thus mine eye's due thy outward part
heart's right thy inward love heart
betwixt mine eye heart league took
each doth good turns now unto other
when mine eye famished look
or heart love sighs himself doth smother
love's picture then eye doth feast
another time mine eye heart's guest
his thoughts love doth share part
so either by thy picture or love
thy self away art present still
thou not farther than thoughts canst move
am still them they thee
or if they sleep thy picture sight
awakes heart heart's eye's delight
against time if ever time come
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called audit by advised respects
against time when thou shalt strangely pass
scarcely greet sun thine eye
when love converted from thing was
shall reasons find settled gravity
against time do ensconce here
within knowledge mine own desert
this hand against self uprear
leave poor thou hast strength laws
since why love can allege no cause
those hours gentle work did frame
lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play tyrants very same
unfair which fairly doth excel
never resting time leads summer
hideous winter confounds him there
sap checked frost lusty leaves quite gone
then were not summer's distillation left
liquid prisoner pent walls glass
beauty's effect beauty were bereft
nor nor no remembrance what was
but flowers distilled though they winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
how heavy do journey way
when what seek weary travels end
doth teach case repose say
beast bears tired woe
plods dully bear weight
as if by some instinct wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
bloody spur cannot provoke him
sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers groan
more sharp than spurring his side
same groan doth put this mind
thus can love excuse slow offence
dull bearer when from thee speed
from where thou art why should haste thence
till return posting no need
o what excuse will poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should spur though mounted wind
winged speed no motion shall know
then can no horse desire keep pace
shall neigh no dull flesh his fiery race
but love love thus shall excuse jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee i'll run give him leave go
so am as rich whose blessed key
can bring him his sweet up locked treasure
which he will not every hour survey
blunting fine point seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn so rare
stones worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels carcanet
so time keeps as chest
or as wardrobe which robe doth hide
make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are whose worthiness gives scope
being had triumph being lacked hope
what substance whereof are made
since every one hath every one one shade
but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis counterfeit
poorly imitated after
helens cheek all art beauty set
grecian tires are painted new
speak spring foison year
one doth shadow beauty show
other as bounty doth appear
all external grace have some part
but none none constant heart
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by sweet ornament which truth doth give
rose looks fair but fairer deem
sweet odour which doth live
canker blooms have full as deep dye
as perfumed tincture roses
hang such thorns play as wantonly
but their virtue only their show
they live unwooed unrespected fade
die themselves sweet roses do not so
their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
so beauteous lovely youth
when shall fade verse distills truth
not marble nor gilded monuments
princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but shall shine more bright these contents
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
broils root out work masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
living record memory
'gainst death all oblivious enmity
shall pace forth praise shall still find room
even eyes all posterity
wear this world out ending doom
so till judgment self arise
sweet love renew thy force not said
thy edge should blunter than appetite
which but day by feeding allayed
morrow sharpened his former might
so love thou although day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink fulness
morrow see again do not kill
spirit love perpetual dulness
let this sad interim ocean
come daily banks when they see
return love more blest may view
or call winter which being full care
makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
being slave what should do but tend
upon hours times desire
have no precious time at all spend
nor services do till require
nor dare chide world without end hour
nor think bitterness absence sour
when have bid servant once adieu
nor dare question jealous thought
where may or affairs suppose
but sad slave stay think nought
save where are how happy make those
so true fool love will
though do any thing he thinks no ill
god forbid made first slave
or at hand th' account hours crave
being vassal bound stay leisure
o let suffer being at beck
th' imprisoned absence liberty
patience tame sufferance bide each check
without accusing injury
where list charter so strong
self may privilage time
what will doth belong
am wait though waiting so hell
not blame pleasure ill or well
if there nothing new but which
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring invention bear amis
second burthen former child
o record could backward look
even five hundred courses sun
show image some antique book
might see what old world could say
this composed wonder frame
whether are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution same
o sure am wits former days
subjects worse have given admiring praise
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
thee thy summer ere thou distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
use not forbidden usury
which happies those pay willing loan
that's thy self breed another thee
or ten times happier ten one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living posterity
not self willed thou art much too fair
as waves make towards pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten their end
each changing place which goes before
sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once main light
crawls maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
time gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix flourish set youth
feeds rarities nature's truth
nothing stands but his scythe mow
yet times hope verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
thy will thy image should keep open
heavy eyelids weary night
dost thou desire slumbers should broken
while shadows thee do mock sight
thy spirit thou send'st from thee
find out shames idle hours
scope tenure thy jealousy
o no thy love though much not so great
love keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love doth rest defeat
play watchman ever thy sake
thee watch whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from far off others all too near
sin self love possesseth all mine eye
this sin there no remedy
so grounded inward heart
methinks no face so gracious as mine
no shape so true no truth such account
self mine own worth do define
as all other all worths surmount
but when glass shows self indeed
beated chopt tanned antiquity
mine own self love quite contrary read
'tis thee self self praise
painting age beauty thy days
against love shall as am now
time's injurious hand crushed o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood filled his brow
lines wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled age's steepy night
all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanished out sight
such time do now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
he shall never cut from memory
sweet love's beauty though lover's life
his beauty shall these black lines seen
they shall live he them still green
shame deny thou bear'st love any
who thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved many
thou art so possessed murd'rous hate
'gainst thy self thou stick'st not conspire
seeking beauteous roof ruinate
which repair should thy chief desire
o change thy thought may change mind
shall hate fairer lodged than gentle love
as thy presence gracious kind
or thy self at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self love
let not marriage true minds
admit impediments love not love
which alters when alteration finds
or bends remover remove
o no an ever fixed mark
looks tempests never shaken
star every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips cheeks
love alters not his brief hours weeks
but bears out even edge doom
if this error upon proved
never writ nor no man ever loved
thine eyes love they as pitying
knowing thy heart torment disdain
have put black loving mourners
looking pretty ruth upon pain
truly not morning sun heaven
nor full star ushers even
doth half glory sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let then as well beseem thy heart
mourn since mourning doth thee grace
suit thy pity every part
then will swear beauty herself black
all they foul thy complexion lack
when consider every thing grows
this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon stars secret influence comment
when perceive men as plants increase
cheered checked even by self same sky
vaunt their youthful sap at height decrease
wear their brave state out memory
then conceit this inconstant stay
sets most rich youth before sight
where wasteful time debateth decay
all war time love
as he takes from engraft new
thy bosom endeared all hearts
which by lacking have supposed dead
there reigns love all love's loving parts
all those friends which thought buried
how many holy obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
as interest dead which now appear
thou art grave where buried love doth live
hung trophies lovers gone
who all their parts thee did give
due many now thine alone
their images loved view thee
thou all they hast all all
how careful was when took way
each trifle under truest bars thrust
use might unused stay
but thou whom jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now greatest grief
thou best dearest mine only care
art left prey every vulgar thief
thee have not locked up any chest
save where thou art not though feel thou art
within gentle closure breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come part
even thence thou wilt stoln fear
when have seen by time's fell hand defaced
rich proud cost outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers see down rased
brass eternal slave mortal rage
when have seen hungry ocean gain
advantage kingdom shore
firm soil win watery main
increasing store loss loss store
when have seen such interchange state
ruin hath taught thus ruminate
time will come take love away
this thought as death which cannot choose
but weep have which fears lose
or shall live epitaph make
or survive when earth am rotten
from hence memory death cannot take
although each part will forgotten
name from hence immortal life shall have
earth can yield but common grave
when entombed mens eyes shall lie
monument shall gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'er read
tongues being shall rehearse
when all breathers this world are dead
still shall live such virtue hath pen
where breath most breathes even mouths men
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
how this rage shall beauty hold plea
whose action no stronger than flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against wrackful siege batt'ring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
o none unless this miracle have might
black ink love may still shine bright
tired all these restful death cry
as behold desert beggar born
needy nothing trimmed jollity
purest faith unhappily forsworn
gilded honour shamefully misplaced
maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
right perfection wrongfully disgraced
art made tongue tied by authority
folly doctor controlling skill
simple truth miscalled simplicity
captive good attending captain ill
tired all these from these would gone
save die leave love alone
ah wherefore infection should he live
his presence grace impiety
sin by him advantage should achieve
why should false painting imitate his cheek
steal dead seeming his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses shadow since his rose true
why should he live now nature bankrupt
beggared blood blush through lively veins
she hath no exchequer now but his
proud many lives upon his gains
o him she stores show what wealth she had
thus his cheek map days outworn
when beauty lived died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs fair were born
or durst inhabit living brow
before golden tresses dead
right sepulchres were shorn away
live second life second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
him those holy antique hours are seen
making no summer another's green
robbing no old dress his beauty new
him as map doth nature store
show false art what beauty was yore
those parts thee world's eye doth view
want nothing thought hearts can mend
all tongues voice souls give thee due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus outward praise crowned
other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than eye hath shown
they look into beauty thy mind
guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
thy fair flower add rank smell weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
soil this thou dost common grow
lo orient when gracious light
doth homage his new appearing sight
serving looks his sacred majesty
having climbed steep up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch weary car
feeble age he reeleth from day
eyes fore duteous now converted are
so thou thy self out going thy noon
unlooked diest unless thou get son
thou art blamed shall not thy defect
slander's mark was ever yet fair
ornament beauty suspect
crow flies heavens sweetest air
so thou good slander doth but approve
thy worth greater being wooed time
canker vice sweetest buds doth love
thou hast passed by ambush young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot so thy praise
tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms hearts shouldst owe
no longer mourn when am dead
than shall hear surly sullen bell
give warning world am fled
nay if read this line remember not
hand writ love so
sweet thoughts would forgot
if thinking then should make woe
o if say look upon this verse
when perhaps compounded am clay
do not so much as poor name rehearse
but let love even life decay
lest wise world should look into moan
o lest world should task recite
what merit lived should love
after death dear love forget quite
can nothing worthy prove
unless would devise some virtuous lie
do more than mine own desert
hang more praise upon deceased
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest true love may seem false this
name buried where body
live no more shame nor nor
am shamed by which bring forth
so should love things nothing worth
time year thou mayst behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against cold
bare ruined choirs where late sweet birds sang
thou seest twilight such day
which by by black night doth take away
death's second self seals up all rest
thou seest glowing such fire
ashes his youth doth lie
as death bed whereon must expire
consumed which was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
love well which thou must leave ere long
but contented when fell arrest
life hath this line some interest
which memorial still thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
very part was consecrate thee
earth can have but earth which his due
spirit thine better part
so then thou hast but lost dregs life
prey worms body being dead
coward conquest wretch's knife
worth which contains
this this thee remains
so are thoughts as food life
or as sweet seasoned showers are ground
peace hold such strife
as 'twixt miser his wealth found
now proud as an enjoyer anon
doubting filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best alone
sometime all full feasting sight
by by clean starved look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what had or must from took
thus do pine surfeit day by day
or gluttoning all or all away
why verse so barren new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why time do not glance aside
why write still all one ever same
keep invention noted weed
every word doth almost tell name
showing their birth where they did proceed
o know sweet love always write
love are still argument
so all best dressing old words new
spending again what already spent
as sun daily new old
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
this book this learning mayst thou taste
wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
take new acquaintance thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee much enrich thy book
so oft have invoked thee muse
found such fair assistance verse
as every alien pen hath got use
under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes taught dumb high sing
have added feathers learned's wing
given grace double majesty
yet most proud which compile
whose influence thine born thee
others' works thou dost but mend style
arts thy sweet graces graced
but thou art all art dost advance
as high as learning rude ignorance
whilst alone did call upon thy aid
but now gracious numbers are decayed
sick muse doth give an other place
grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves travail worthier pen
yet what thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee pays thee again
he lends thee virtue he stole word
from thy behaviour beauty doth he give
found thy cheek he can afford
then thank him not which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
music hear why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets sweets war not joy delights joy
why lov'st thou which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st pleasure thine annoy
if true concord well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
mark how one string sweet husband another
strikes each each by mutual ordering
resembling sire child happy mother
who all one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
o how faint when do write
knowing better spirit doth use name
praise thereof spends all his might
but since worth wide as ocean
humble as proudest sail doth bear
saucy bark inferior far his
broad main doth wilfully appear
shallowest help will hold up afloat
whilst he upon soundless deep doth ride
or being wrecked am worthless boat
he tall building goodly pride
then if he thrive cast away
from fairest creatures desire increase
thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light's flame self substantial fuel
making famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe thy sweet self too cruel
thou art now world's fresh ornament
within thine own bud buriest thy content
tender churl mak'st waste niggarding
pity world or else this glutton
eat world's due by grave thee
grant thou wert not married muse
therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
dedicated words which writers use
their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair knowledge as hue
therefore art enforced seek anew
some fresher stamp time bettering days
do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
true plain words by thy true telling friend
their gross painting might better used
where cheeks need blood thee abused
never saw did painting need
found or thought found did exceed
barren tender poet's debt
therefore have slept report
self being extant well might show
how far modern quill doth come too short
speaking worth what worth doth grow
this silence sin did impute
which shall most glory being dumb
impair not beauty being mute
there lives more life one fair eyes
than both poets can praise devise
who says most which can say more
than this rich praise alone are
whose confine immured store
which should example where equal grew
lean penury within pen doth dwell
his subject lends not some small glory
but he writes if he can tell
let him but copy what writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
such counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
beauteous blessings add curse
being fond praise which makes praises worse
tongue tied muse manners holds her still
while comments praise richly compiled
reserve their character golden quill
think good thoughts whilst other write good words
unlettered clerk still cry amen
every hymn able spirit affords
polished form well refined pen
hearing praised say 'tis so 'tis true
most praise add something more
but thought whose love
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others breath words respect
was proud full sail his great verse
bound prize all too precious
did ripe thoughts brain inhearse
making their tomb womb wherein they grew
was his spirit by spirits taught write
above mortal pitch struck dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid verse astonished
he nor affable familiar ghost
as victors silence cannot boast
was not sick any fear from thence
but when countenance filled up his line
then lacked matter enfeebled mine
farewell thou art too dear possessing
enough thou know'st thy estimate
charter thy worth gives thee releasing
bonds thee are all determinate
how do hold thee but by thy granting
cause this fair gift wanting
so patent back again swerving
thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
or whom thou gav'st else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again better judgement making
thus have had thee as dream doth flatter
sleep king but waking no such matter
when thou shalt disposed set light
upon thy side against self i'll fight
prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part can set down story
faults concealed wherein am attainted
thou losing shalt win much glory
by this will gainer too
bending all loving thoughts thee
injuries self do
such love thee so belong
thy right self will bear all wrong
say thou didst forsake some fault
will comment upon offence
speak lameness straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace half so ill
set form upon desired change
as i'll self disgrace knowing thy will
absent from thy walks tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest too much profane should do wronk
haply our old acquaintance tell
thee against self i'll vow debate
must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
fear wet widow's eye
thou consum'st thy self single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap die
world will thy widow still weep
thou no form thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husband's shape mind
look what an unthrift world doth spend
shifts but his place still world enjoys
but beauty's waste hath world an end
kept unused user so destroys
no love toward others bosom sits
then hate when thou wilt if ever now
now while world bent deeds cross
join spite fortune make bow
do not drop an after loss
ah do not when heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
come rearward conquered woe
give not windy night rainy morrow
linger out purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave do not leave last
but onset come so shall taste
at first very worst fortune's might
other strains woe which now seem woe
compared loss thee will not seem so
some glory their birth some their skill
some their wealth some their body's force
some their garments though new fangled ill
some their hawks hounds some their horse
every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
but these particulars are not measure
all these better one general best
thy love better than high birth
richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
more delight than hawks horses
having thee all mens pride boast
wretched this alone thou mayst take
all this away most wretchcd make
but do thy worst steal thy self away
life no longer than thy love will stay
depends upon love thine
then need not fear worst wrongs
when least them life hath end
see better state belongs
than which thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex inconstant mind
since life thy revolt doth lie
o what happy title do find
but what's so blessed fair fears no blot
thou mayst false yet know not
so shall live supposing thou art true
deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love though altered new
thy looks thy heart other place
there can live no hatred thine eye
therefore cannot know thy change
many's looks false heart's history
but heaven thy creation did decree
thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
they have power hurt will do none
do not do thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
husband nature's riches from expense
tibey are lords owners their faces
others but stewards their excellence
summer's flower summer sweet
though self only live die
but if flower base infection meet
basest weed outbraves his dignity
sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
how sweet lovely dost thou make shame
which canker fragrant rose
doth spot beauty thy budding name
o what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
tongue tells story thy days
making lascivious comments thy sport
cannot dispraise but kind praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what mansion have those vices got
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
all things turns fair eyes can see
take heed dear heart this large privilege
hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
some say thy fault youth some wantonness
some say thy grace youth gentle sport
both grace faults are loved more less
thou mak'st faults graces thee resort
as finger throned queen
so are those errors thee are seen
truths translated true things deemed
how many lambs might stern wolf betray
if lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use strength all thy state
but do not so love thee such sort
as thou being mine mine thy good report
how winter hath absence been
what freezings have felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness everywhere
yet this time removed was summer's time
teeming autumn big rich increase
bearing wanton burden prime
widowed wombs after their lords' decease
yet this abundant issue seemed
but hope orphans unfathered fruit
summer his pleasures wait thee
or if they sing 'tis so dull cheer
leaves look pale dreading winter's near
from have been absent spring
when proud pied april dressed all his trim
hath put spirit youth every thing
heavy saturn laughed leaped him
yet nor lays birds nor sweet smell
different flowers odour hue
could make any summer's story tell
nor did wonder at lily's white
nor praise deep vermilion rose
they were but sweet but figures delight
drawn after pattern all those
yet seemed winter still away
as shadow these did play
forward violet thus did chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet smells
if not from love's breath purple pride
love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
lily condemned thy hand
buds marjoram had stoln thy hair
roses fearfully thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
third nor red nor white had stoln both
his robbery had annexed thy breath
but his theft pride all his growth
vengeful canker eat him up death
but sweet or colour had stoln from thee

william shakespeare
even as sun purple colour'd face
had ta'en his last leave weeping morn
rose cheek'd adonis hied him chase
hunting he loved but love he laugh'd scorn
sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him
bold faced suitor 'gins woo him
'thrice fairer than myself' thus she began
'the field's chief flower sweet above compare
more white red than doves or roses are
nature made thee herself at strife
saith world hath ending thy life
'vouchsafe thou wonder alight thy steed
rein his proud head saddle bow
if thou wilt deign this favour thy meed
thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come sit where never serpent hisses
being set i'll smother thee kisses
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red pale fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
summer's day will seem an hour but short
being wasted such time beguiling sport'
this she seizeth his sweating palm
precedent pith livelihood
trembling her passion calls balm
earth's sovereign salve do goddess good
courageously pluck him from his horse
over one arm lusty courser's rein
under her other was tender boy
who blush'd pouted dull disdain
leaden appetite unapt toy
she red hot as coals glowing fire
he red shame but frosty desire
studded bridle ragged bough
nimbly she fastens o how quick love
tie rider she begins prove
backward she push'd him as she would thrust
governd him strength though not lust
so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning their elbows their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
'gins chide but soon she stops his lips
kissing speaks lustful language broken
'if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open'
doth quench maiden burning his cheeks
then her windy sighs golden hairs
fan blow them dry again she seeks
he saith she immodest blames her 'miss
what follows more she murders kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires her beak feathers flesh bone
shaking her wings devouring all haste
till either gorge stuff'd or prey gone
where she ends she doth anew begin
forced content but never obey
panting he lies breatheth her face
she feedeth steam as prey
calls heavenly moisture air grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full flowers
so they were dew'd such distilling showers
look how bird lies tangled net
so fastend her arms adonis lies
which bred more beauty his angry eyes
rain added river rank
perforce will force overflow bank
still she entreats prettily entreats
pretty ear she tunes her tale
still he sullen still he lours frets
'twixt crimson shame anger ashy pale
being red she loves him best being white
her best better'd more delight
by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never remove
till he take truce her contending tears
which long have raind making her cheeks all wet
one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin
dive dapper peering through wave
who being look'd ducks as quickly
so offers he give what she did crave
he winks turns his lips another way
never did passenger summer's heat
more thirst drink than she this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes water yet her fire must burn
'o pity' 'gan she cry 'flint hearted boy
'tis but kiss beg why art thou coy
'i have been woo'd as entreat thee now
even by stern direful god war
who conquers where he comes every jar
yet hath he been captive slave
begg'd which thou unask'd shalt have
'over altars hath he hung his lance
his batter'd shield his uncontrolled crest
sake hath learnd sport dance
toy wanton dally smile jest
scorning his churlish drum ensign red
making arms his field his tent bed
leading him prisoner red rose chain
strong tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd
yet was he servile coy disdain
o not proud nor brag not thy might
mastering her foild god fight
'touch but lips those fair lips thine
though mine not so fair yet are they red
kiss shall thine own as well as mine
what seest thou ground hold up thy head
then why not lips lips since eyes eyes
'art thou ashamed kiss then wink again
will wink so shall day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
bold play our sport not sight
these blue veind violets whereon lean
never can blab nor know not what mean
'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well tasted
beauty within itself should not wasted
fair flowers are not gather'd their prime
rot consume themselves little time
'were hard favour'd foul or wrinkled old
ill nurtured crooked churlish harsh voice
o'erworn despised rheumatic cold
thick sighted barren lean lacking juice
then mightst thou pause then were not thee
but having no defects why dost abhor
mine eyes are gray bright quick turning
beauty as spring doth yearly grow
flesh soft plump marrow burning
smooth moist hand were thy hand felt
would thy palm dissolve or seem melt
'bid discourse will enchant thine ear
or fairy trip upon green
or nymph long dishevelld hair
dance sands yet no footing seen
not gross sink but light will aspire
'witness this primrose bank whereon lie
these forceless flowers sturdy trees support
two strengthless doves will draw through sky
from morn till night even where list sport
love so light sweet boy may
thou shouldst think heavy unto thee
'is thine own heart thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
steal thine own freedom complain theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
died kiss his shadow brook
'torches are made light jewels wear
dainties taste fresh beauty use
herbs their smell sappy plants bear
things growing themselves are growth's abuse
seeds spring from seeds beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot get thy duty
unless earth thy increase fed
by law nature thou art bound breed
thine may live when thou thyself art dead
so spite death thou dost survive
thy likeness still left alive'
by this love sick queen began sweat
where they lay shadow had forsook them
titan tired mid day heat
burning eye did hotly overlook them
so he were him by venus' side
now adonis lazy spright
heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight
misty vapours when they blot sky
souring his cheeks cries 'fie no more love
sun doth burn face must remove'
'ay me' quoth venus 'young so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou gone
shall cool heat this descending sun
i'll make shadow thee hairs
if they burn too i'll quench them tears
'the sun shines from heaven shines but warm
lo lie between sun thee
heat have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth fire burneth
were not immortal life were done
between this heavenly earthly sun
nay more than flint stone at rain relenteth
art thou womans son canst not feel
what 'tis love how want love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
'what am thou shouldst contemn this
or what great danger dwells upon suit
what were thy lips worse one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else mute
one interest if thou wilt have twain
'fie lifeless picture cold senseless stone
well painted idol image dun dead
statue contenting but eye alone
thing man but no woman bred
thou art no man though mans complexion
men will kiss even by their own direction'
this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
swelling passion doth provoke pause
being judge love she cannot right her cause
now she weeps now she fain would speak
now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head then his hand
now gazeth she him now ground
sometimes her arms infold him band
she would he will not her arms bound
when from thence he struggles gone
she locks her lily fingers one one
within circuit this ivory pale
i'll park thou shalt deer
feed where thou wilt mountain or dale
graze lips if those hills dry
stray lower where pleasant fountains lie
within this limit relief enough
sweet bottom grass high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure rough
shelter thee from tempest from rain
no dog shall rouse thee though thousand bark'
at this adonis smiles as disdain
each cheek appears pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might buried tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came lie
why there love lived there he could not die
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
opend their mouths swallow venus' liking
struck dead at first what needs second striking
poor queen love thine own law forlorn
love cheek smiles at thee scorn
now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
time spent her object will away
from her twining arms doth urge releasing
'pity' she cries 'some favour some remorse'
away he springs hasteth his horse
breeding jennet lusty young proud
adonis' trampling courser doth espy
forth she rushes snorts neighs aloud
strong neck'd steed being tied unto tree
breaketh his rein her straight goes he
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
now his woven girths he breaks asunder
bearing earth his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds heavens thunder
controlling what he was controlled
his ears up prick'd his braided hanging mane
upon his compass'd crest now stand end
his nostrils drink air forth again
as from furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters fire
shows his hot courage his high desire
sometime he trots as if he told steps
gentle majesty modest pride
as who should say 'lo thus strength tried
this do captivate eye
fair breeder standing by'
what recketh he his rider's angry stir
his flattering 'holla' or his 'stand say'
what cares he now curb or pricking spur
rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love nothing else he sees
nothing else his proud sight agrees
limning out well proportiond steed
his art nature's workmanship at strife
as if dead living should exceed
so did this horse excel common one
shape courage colour pace bone
round hoof'd short jointed fetlocks shag long
broad breast full eye small head nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
save proud rider so proud back
sometime he scuds far off there he stares
anon he starts at stirring feather
bid wind base he now prepares
whether he run or fly they know not whether
through his mane tail high wind sings
fanning hairs who wave feather'd wings
he looks upon his love neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
she puts outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love scorns heat he feels
beating his kind embracements her heels
then melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail falling plume
cool shadow his melting buttock lent
he stamps bites poor flies his fume
his love perceiving how he enraged
grew kinder his fury was assuaged
when lo unback'd breeder full fear
jealous catching swiftly doth forsake him
her horse left adonis there
as they were mad unto wood they hie them
out stripping crows strive over fly them
all swoln chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous unruly beast
now happy season once more fits
love sick love by pleading may blest
when barr'd aidance tongue
an oven stopp'd or river stay'd
burneth more hotly swelleth more rage
so concealed sorrow may said
free vent words love's fire doth assuage
but when heart's attorney once mute
client breaks as desperate his suit
he sees her coming begins glow
even as dying coal revives wind
looks dull earth disturbed mind
taking no notice she so nigh
all askance he holds her his eye
o what sight was wistly view
how she came stealing wayward boy
note fighting conflict her hue
how white red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale by by
flash'd forth fire as lightning from sky
lowly lover down she kneels
one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print
as apt as new falln snow takes any dint
o what war looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes woo'd still his eyes disdaind wooing
tears which chorus her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by hand
lily prisond gaol snow
or ivory an alabaster band
so white friend engirts so white foe
this beauteous combat wilful unwilling
show'd two silver doves sit billing
once more engine her thoughts began
'o fairest mover this mortal round
heart all whole as thine thy heart wound
one sweet look thy help would assure thee
though nothing but body's bane would cure thee
'give hand' saith he 'why dost thou feel it'
'give heart' saith she 'and thou shalt have
o give lest thy hard heart do steel
being steeld soft sighs can never grave
then love's deep groans never shall regard
because adonis' heart hath made mine hard'
day's delight past horse gone
'tis fault am bereft him so
pray hence leave here alone
all mind thought busy care
how get palfrey from mare'
thus she replies 'thy palfrey as he should
welcomes warm approach sweet desire
affection coal must coold
else suffer'd will set heart fire
therefore no marvel though thy horse gone
'how jade he stood tied tree
servilely master'd leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youth's fair fee
he held such petty bondage disdain
throwing base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
'who sees his true love her naked bed
teaching sheets whiter hue than white
his other agents aim at delight
who so faint dare not so bold
touch fire weather being cold
'let excuse thy courser gentle boy
learn him heartily beseech thee
take advantage presented joy
though were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn love lesson but plain
once made perfect never lost again'
unless boar then chase
'tis much borrow will not owe
love love love but disgrace
have heard life death
laughs weeps all but breath
'who wears garment shapeless unfinish'd
who plucks bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things any jot diminish'd
they wither their prime prove nothing worth
loseth his pride never waxeth strong
'you hurt hand wringing let us part
leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove siege from unyielding heart
love's alarms will not ope gate
dismiss vows feigned tears flattery
where heart hard they make no battery'
'what canst thou talk' quoth she 'hast thou tongue
o would thou hadst not or had no hearing
had load before now press'd bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ear's deep sweet music heart's deep sore wounding
'had no eyes but ears ears would love
inward beauty invisible
or were deaf thy outward parts would move
each part were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears hear nor see
yet should love by touching thee
could not see nor hear nor touch
nothing but very smell were left
yet would love thee still as much
from stillitory thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed breedeth love by
smelling
'but o what banquet wert thou taste
being nurse feeder other four
would they not wish feast might ever last
lest jealousy sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing disturb feast'
once more ruby colour'd portal opend
which his speech did honey passage yield
red morn ever yet betokend
wreck seaman tempest field
sorrow shepherds woe unto birds
gusts foul flaws herdmen herds
this ill presage advisedly she marketh
or as wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as berry breaks before staineth
or deadly bullet gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun
at his look she flatly falleth down
looks kill love love by looks reviveth
smile recures wounding frown
but blessed bankrupt by love so thriveth
silly boy believing she dead
all amazed brake off his late intent
sharply he did think reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall wit can so well defend her
grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips thousand ways he seeks
he kisses her she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still
night sorrow now turnd day
her two blue windows faintly she up heaveth
fair sun when his fresh array
he cheers morn all earth relieveth
as bright sun glorifies sky
so her face illumined her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd
were never four such lamps together mix'd
had not his clouded his brow's repine
but hers which through crystal tears gave light
shone moon water seen by night
'o where am i' quoth she 'in earth or heaven
or ocean drench'd or fire
what hour this or morn or weary even
do delight die or life desire
but now lived life was death's annoy
'o thou didst kill kill once again
thy eyes' shrewd tutor hard heart thine
hath taught them scornful tricks such disdain
they have murder'd this poor heart mine
these mine eyes true leaders their queen
but thy piteous lips no more had seen
'long may they kiss each other this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
as they last their verdure still endure
star gazers having writ death
may say plague banish'd by thy breath
'pure lips sweet seals soft lips imprinted
what bargains may make still sealing
sell myself can well contented
so thou wilt buy pay use good dealing
which purchase if thou make fear slips
set thy seal manual wax red lips
'a thousand kisses buys heart from
what ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told quickly gone
say non payment debt should double
twenty hundred kisses such trouble
'fair queen' quoth he 'if any love owe
measure strangeness unripe years
before know myself seek not know
no fisher but ungrown fry forbears
mellow plum doth fall green sticks fast
'look world's comforter weary gait
his day's hot task hath ended west
owl night's herald shrieks ''tis very late'
sheep are gone fold birds their nest
coal black clouds shadow heavens light
do summon us part bid good night
'now let say 'good night' so say
if will say so shall have kiss'
'good night' quoth she ere he says 'adieu'
her arms do lend his neck sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows face
till breathless he disjoind backward drew
heavenly moisture sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain drouth
he her plenty press'd she faint dearth
their lips together glued fall earth
now quick desire hath caught yielding prey
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch price so high
she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry
having felt sweetness spoil
blindfold fury she begins forage
her face doth reek smoke her blood doth boil
careless lust stirs up desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
hot faint weary her hard embracing
wild bird being tamed too much handling
or as fleet foot roe that's tired chasing
or froward infant stilld dandling
he now obeys now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what wax so frozen but dissolves tempering
yields at last every light impression
things out hope are compass'd oft venturing
affection faints not pale faced coward
but then woos best when most his choice froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd
foul words frowns must not repel lover
what though rose have prickles yet 'tis pluck'd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through picks them all at last
pity now she can no more detain him
she resolved no longer restrain him
bids him farewell look well her heart
which by cupid's bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged his breast
'sweet boy' she says 'this night i'll waste sorrow
sick heart commands mine eyes watch
tell love's master shall meet morrow
say shall shall wilt thou make match'
he tells her no morrow he intends
'the boar' quoth she whereat sudden pale
lawn being spread upon blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he her belly falls she her back
now she very lists love
her champion mounted hot encounter
all imaginary she doth prove
worse than tantalus' her annoy
clip elysium lack her joy
even as poor birds deceived painted grapes
do surfeit by eye pine maw
even so she languisheth her mishaps
as those poor birds helpless berries saw
warm effects which she him finds missing
she seeks kindle continual kissing
but all vain good queen will not
her pleading hath deserved greater fee
she's love she loves yet she not loved
'fie fie' he says 'you crush let go
have no reason withhold so'
'thou hadst been gone' quoth she 'sweet boy ere this
but thou told'st thou wouldst hunt boar
o advised thou know'st not what
javelins point churlish swine gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
'on his bow back he hath battle set
bristly pikes ever threat his foes
his eyes glow worms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes
being moved he strikes whate'er his way
whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
'his brawny sides hairy bristles arm'd
are better proof than thy spear's point can enter
his short thick neck cannot easily harm'd
thorny brambles embracing bushes
as fearful him part through whom he rushes
'alas he nought esteems face thine
which love's eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips crystal eyne
whose full perfection all world amazes
but having thee at vantage wondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots mead
'o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
come not within his danger by thy will
they thrive well take counsel their friends
when thou didst name boar not dissemble
fear'd thy fortune joints did tremble
'didst thou not mark face was not white
saw'st thou not signs fear lurk mine eye
grew not faint fell not downright
within bosom whereon thou dost lie
boding heart pants beats takes no rest
'for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affections sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
peaceful hour doth cry 'kill kill'
distempering gentle love his desire
as air water do abate fire
'this sour informer this bate breeding spy
this canker eats up love's tender spring
this carry tale dissentious jealousy
knocks at heat whispers mine ear
if love thee thy death should fear
'and more than so presenteth mine eye
picture an angry chafing boar
under whose sharp fangs his back doth lie
an image thyself all staind gore
whose blood upon fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop grief hang head
'what should do seeing thee so indeed
thought doth make faint heart bleed
fear doth teach divination
prophesy thy death living sorrow
if thou encounter boar morrow
'but if thou needs wilt hunt ruled by
uncouple at timorous flying hare
or at fox which lives by subtlety
or at roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures o'er downs
hounds
'and when thou hast foot purblind hare
mark poor wretch overshoot his troubles
how he outruns wind what care
he cranks crosses thousand doubles
many musets through which he goes
are labyrinth amaze his foes
'sometime he runs among flock sheep
make cunning hounds mistake their smell
stop loud pursuers their yell
sometime sorteth herd deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits fear
'for there his smell others being mingled
hot scent snuffing hounds are driven doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
much ado cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were skies
stands his hinder legs listening ear
harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
now his grief may compared well
one sore sick hears passing bell
'then shalt thou see dew bedabbled wretch
turn return indenting way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
being low never relieved by any
'lie quietly hear little more
nay do not struggle thou shalt not rise
make thee hate hunting boar
unlike myself thou hear'st moralize
applying this so so
love can comment upon every woe
'where did leave' 'no matter where' quoth he
'leave then story aptly ends
'i am' quoth he 'expected friends
now 'tis dark going shall fall'
'in night' quoth she 'desire sees best all
'but if thou fall o then imagine this
earth love thee thy footing trips
all but rob thee kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy forlorn
lest she should steal kiss die forsworn
cynthia shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature condemnd treason
stealing moulds from heaven were divine
wherein she framed thee high heavens despite
shame sun by day her by night
'and therefore hath she bribed destinies
cross curious workmanship nature
mingle beauty infirmities
pure perfection impure defeature
mad mischances much misery
'as burning fevers agues pale faint
life poisoning pestilence frenzies wood
marrow eating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating blood
surfeits imposthumes grief damnd despair
swear nature's death framing thee so fair
'and not least all these maladies
but one minute's fight brings beauty under
whereat impartial gazer late did wonder
are sudden wasted thaw'd done
as mountain snow melts midday sun
'therefore despite fruitless chastity
love lacking vestals self loving nuns
earth would breed scarcity
barren dearth daughters sons
prodigal lamp burns by night
dries up his oil lend world his light
seeming bury posterity
which by rights time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not dark obscurity
if so world will hold thee disdain
sith thy pride so fair hope slain
'so thyself thyself art made away
mischief worse than civil home bred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butcher sire reaves his son life
but gold that's put use more gold begets'
'nay then' quoth adon 'you will fall again
into idle over handled theme
kiss gave bestow'd vain
all vain strive against stream
by this black faced night desire's foul nurse
treatise makes worse worse
'if love have lent twenty thousand tongues
every tongue more moving than own
yet from mine ear tempting tune blown
know heart stands armed mine ear
will not let false sound enter there
'lest deceiving harmony should run
into quiet closure breast
then little heart were quite undone
his bedchamber barr'd rest
no lady no heart longs not groan
but soundly sleeps while now sleeps alone
path smooth leadeth danger
hate not love but device love
lends embracements unto every stranger
do increase o strange excuse
when reason bawd lust's abuse
'call not love love heaven fled
since sweating lust earth usurp'd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting blame
as caterpillars do tender leaves
'love comforteth sunshine after rain
but lust's effect tempest after sun
love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lust's winter comes ere summer half done
love surfeits not lust glutton dies
love all truth lust full forged lies
'more could tell but more dare not say
text old orator too green
face full shame heart teen
mine ears wanton talk attended
do burn themselves having so offended'
this he breaketh from sweet embrace
those fair arms which bound him her breast
homeward through dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd
look how bright star shooteth from sky
so glides he night from venus' eye
gazing upon late embarked friend
till wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges meeting clouds contend
so did merciless pitchy night
fold object did feed her sight
whereat amazed as one unaware
hath dropp'd precious jewel flood
or stonish'd as night wanderers often are
their light blown out some mistrustful wood
having lost fair discovery her way
now she beats her heart whereat groans
all neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition her moans
passion passion deeply redoubled
'ay me' she cries twenty times 'woe woe'
twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins wailing note
sings extemporally woeful ditty
how love wise folly foolish witty
her heavy anthem still concludes woe
still choir echoes answer so
her song was tedious outwore night
lovers' hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
such circumstance suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience are never done
but idle sounds resembling parasites
shrill tongued tapsters answering every call
soothing humour fantastic wits
she says ''tis so' they answer all ''tis so'
would say after her if she said 'no'
lo here gentle lark weary rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up high
wakes morning from whose silver breast
sun ariseth his majesty
cedar tops hills seem burnish'd gold
venus salutes him this fair good morrow
'o thou clear god patron all light
from whom each lamp shining star doth borrow
beauteous influence makes him bright
there lives son suck'd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend other'
this said she hasteth myrtle grove
musing morning so much o'erworn
she hearkens his hounds his horn
anon she hears them chant lustily
all haste she coasteth cry
as she runs bushes way
some catch her by neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting feed her fawn hid some brake
whereat she starts one spies an adder
wreathed up fatal folds just his way
fear whereof doth make him shake shudder
even so timorous yelping hounds
appals her senses her spirit confounds
now she knows no gentle chase
but blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because cry remaineth one place
where fearfully dogs exclaim aloud
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first
this dismal cry rings sadly her ear
through which enters surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt bloodless fear
cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part
soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly dare not stay field
thus stands she trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismay'd
childish error they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
word she spied hunted boar
whose frothy mouth bepainted all red
milk blood being mingled both together
second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs now she will no further
but back retires rate boar murther
she treads path she untreads again
her more than haste mated delays
proceedings drunken brain
full respects yet nought at all respecting
hand all things nought at all effecting
here kennelld brake she finds hound
asks weary caitiff his master
there another licking his wound
'gainst venom'd sores only sovereign plaster
whom she speaks he replies howling
when he hath ceased his ill resounding noise
another flap mouth'd mourner black grim
against welkin volleys out his voice
another another answer him
clapping their proud tails ground below
shaking their scratch'd ears bleeding as they go
look how world's poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs prodigies
infusing them dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
sighing again exclaims death
'hard favour'd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce love' thus chides she death
'grim grinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
stifle beauty steal his breath
who when he lived his breath beauty set
gloss rose smell violet
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at
o yes may thou hast no eyes see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes aim cleaves an infant's heart
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
hearing him thy power had lost his power
destinies will curse thee this stroke
they bid thee crop weed thou pluck'st flower
not death's ebon dart strike dead
'dost thou drink tears thou provokest such weeping
what may heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes taught all other eyes see
now nature cares not thy mortal vigour
since her best work ruind thy rigour'
here overcome as one full despair
she vaild her eyelids who sluices stopt
sweet channel her bosom dropt
but through flood gates breaks silver rain
his strong course opens them again
o how her eyes tears did lend borrow
her eyes seen tears tears her eye
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
sorrow friendly sighs sought still dry
but stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertaind each passion labours so
every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none best then join they all together
many clouds consulting foul weather
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well
dire imagination she did follow
this sound hope doth labour expel
flatters her adonis' voice
whereat her tears began turn their tide
being prisond her eye pearls glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning should pass
wash foul face sluttish ground
who but drunken when she seemeth drownd
o hard believing love how strange seems
not believe yet too credulous
despair hope makes thee ridiculous
one doth flatter thee thoughts unlikely
likely thoughts other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves web she hath wrought
adonis lives death not blame
was not she calld him all naught
now she adds honours his hateful name
she clepes him king graves grave kings
imperious supreme all mortal things
yet pardon felt kind fear
when as met boar bloody beast
which knows no pity but still severe
then gentle shadow truth must confess
raild thee fearing love's decease
''tis not fault boar provoked tongue
wreak'd him invisible commander
'tis he foul creature hath done thee wrong
did but act he's author thy slander
could rule them both without ten womens wit'
thus hoping adonis alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
his beauty may better thrive
death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him trophies statues tombs stories
his victories his triumphs his glories
'o jove' quoth she 'how much fool was
such weak silly mind
till mutual overthrow mortal kind
he being dead him beauty slain
beauty dead black chaos comes again
'fie fie fond love thou art so full fear
as one treasure laden hemm'd thieves
trifles unwitnessed eye or ear
thy coward heart false bethinking grieves'
even at this word she hears merry horn
whereat she leaps was but late forlorn
grass stoops not she treads so light
her haste unfortunately spies
foul boar's conquest her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murder'd view
stars ashamed day themselves withdrew
or as snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward his shelly cave pain
there all smother'd up shade doth sit
long after fearing creep forth again
into deep dark cabins her head
where they resign their office their light
disposing her troubled brain
who bids them still consort ugly night
never wound heart looks again
who king perplexed his throne
by their suggestion gives deadly groan
whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when wind imprisond ground
which cold terror doth mens minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
being opend threw unwilling light
upon wide wound boar had trench'd
his soft flank whose wonted lily white
purple tears his wound wept was drench'd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood seem'd him bleed
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he not dead
her voice stopt her joints forget bow
her eyes are mad they have wept til now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
her sight dazzling makes wound seem three
then she reprehends her mangling eye
makes more gashes where no breach should
oft eye mistakes brain being troubled
'my tongue cannot express grief one
yet' quoth she 'behold two adons dead
sighs are blown away salt tears gone
mine eyes are turnd fire heart lead
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes' red fire
so shall die by drops hot desire
'alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that's worth viewing
things long since or any thing ensuing
flowers are sweet their colours fresh trim
but true sweet beauty lived died him
'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive kiss
having no fair lose need not fear
sun doth scorn wind doth hiss
but when adonis lived sun sharp air
lurk'd two thieves rob him his fair
under whose brim gaudy sun would peep
wind would blow off being gone
play his locks then would adonis weep
straight pity his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears
'to see his face lion walk'd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
recreate himself when he hath sung
tiger would tame gently hear him
never fright silly lamb day
'when he beheld his shadow brook
fishes spread their golden gills
when he was by birds such pleasure took
some would sing some other their bills
would bring him mulberries ripe red cherries
he fed them his sight they him berries
'but this foul grim urchin snouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh grave
witness entertainment he gave
if he did see his face why then know
he thought kiss him hath killd him so
''tis true 'tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon boar his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by kiss thought persuade him there
nuzzling his flank loving swine
sheathed unaware tusk his soft groin
kissing him should have killd him first
but he dead never did he bless
youth his more am accurst'
this she falleth place she stood
stains her face his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips they are pale
she takes him by hand cold
she whispers his ears heavy tale
as if they heard woeful words she told
where lo two lamps burnt out darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld
thousand times now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excelld
every beauty robb'd his effect
'wonder time' quoth she 'this spite
thou being dead day should yet light
'since thou art dead lo here prophesy
sorrow love hereafter shall attend
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
ne'er settled equally but high or low
all love's pleasure shall not match his woe
'it shall fickle false full fraud
bud blasted breathing while
bottom poison top o'erstraw'd
sweets shall truest sight beguile
strongest body shall make most weak
strike wise dumb teach fool speak
teaching decrepit age tread measures
staring ruffian shall keep quiet
pluck down rich enrich poor treasures
shall raging mad silly mild
make young old old become child
'it shall suspect where no cause fear
shall not fear where should most mistrust
shall merciful too severe
most deceiving when seems most just
put fear valour courage coward
'it shall cause war dire events
set dissension 'twixt son sire
subject servile all discontents
as dry combustious matter fire
sith his prime death doth love destroy
they love best their loves shall not enjoy'
by this boy by her side lay killd
was melted vapour from her sight
purple flower sprung up chequer'd white
resembling well his pale cheeks blood
which round drops upon their whiteness stood
she bows her head new sprung flower smell
comparing her adonis' breath
says within her bosom shall dwell
since he himself reft from her by death
she crops stalk breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares tears
sweet issue more sweet smelling sire
every little grief wet his eyes
grow unto himself was his desire
so 'tis thine but know as good
wither breast as his blood
'here was thy father's bed here breast
thou art next blood 'tis thy right
lo this hollow cradle take thy rest
throbbing heart shall rock thee day night
wherein will not kiss sweet love's flower'
thus weary world away she hies
yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through empty skies
her light chariot quickly convey'd
holding their course paphos where their queen
means immure herself not seen
where art thou muse thou forget'st so long
speak which gives thee all thy might
darkening thy power lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse straight redeem
gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing ear doth thy lays esteem
gives thy pen both skill argument
rise resty muse love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any satire decay
make time's spoils despised everywhere
so thou prevent'st his scythe crooked knife
o truant muse what shall thy amends
thy neglect truth beauty dyed
both truth beauty love depends
so dost thou too therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour his colour fixed
beauty no pencil beauty's truth lay
but best best if never intermixed'
excuse not silence so for't lies thee
make him much outlive gilded tomb
praised ages yet
then do thy office muse teach thee how
make him seem long hence as he shows now
love strengthened though more weak seeming
love not less though less show appear
love merchandized whose rich esteeming
owner's tongue doth publish every where
when was wont greet lays
as philomel summer's front doth sing
stops her pipe growth riper days
not summer less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush night
but wild music burthens every bough
sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore her sometime hold tongue
because would not dull song
having such scope show her pride
argument all bare more worth
than when hath added praise beside
o blame not if no more can write
look glass there appears face
over goes blunt invention quite
dulling lines doing disgrace
were not sinful then striving mend
mar subject before was well
than graces gifts tell
more much more than verse can sit
own glass shows when look
fair friend never can old
as were when first eye eyed
such seems beauty still three winters cold
have from forests shook three summers' pride
three beauteous springs yellow autumn turned
process seasons have seen
since first saw fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty dial hand
steal from his figure no pace perceived
so sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion mine eye may deceived
fear which hear this thou age unbred
ere were born was beauty's summer dead
let not love called idolatry
nor beloved as an idol show
one one still such ever so
kind love day morrow kind
still constant wondrous excellence
therefore verse constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind true all argument
fair kind true varying other words
this change invention spent
three themes one which wondrous scope affords
which three till now never kept seat one
when chronicle wasted time
see descriptions fairest wights
beauty making beautiful old rhyme
praise ladies dead lovely knights
then blazon sweet beauty's best
hand foot lip eye brow
see their antique pen would have expressed
even such beauty as master now
this our time all prefiguring
they looked but divining eyes
they had not skill enough worth sing
which now behold these present days
have eyes wonder but lack tongues praise
not mine own fears nor prophetic soul
wide world dreaming things come
can yet lease true love control
supposed as forfeit confined doom
sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
peace proclaims olives endless age
now drops this most balmy time
love looks fresh death subscribes
since spite him i'll live this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull speechless tribes
thou this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants' crests tombs brass are spent
which hath not figured thee true spirit
what's new speak what now register
may express love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet prayers divine
must each day say o'er very same
counting no old thing old thou mine thine
even as when first hallowed thy fair name
so eternal love love's fresh case
weighs not dust injury age
but makes antiquity aye his page
finding first conceit love there bred
where time outward form would show dead
o never say was false heart
though absence seemed flame qualify
as easy might from self depart
as from soul which thy breast doth lie
home love if have ranged
him travels return again
so self bring water stain
never believe though nature reigned
all frailties besiege all kinds blood
could so preposterously stained
leave nothing all thy sum good
nothing this wide universe call
save thou rose thou art all
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
one thine from which thou departest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty increase
without this folly age cold decay
if all were minded so times should cease
threescore year would make world away
let those whom nature hath not made store
harsh featureless rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst bounty cherish
thou shouldst print more not let copy die
alas 'tis true have gone here there
made self motley view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what most dear
made old offences affections new
most true have looked truth
askance strangely but by all above
these blenches gave heart another youth
worse essays proved thee best love
mine appetite never more will grind
newer proof try an older friend
god love whom am confined
then give welcome next heaven best
even thy pure most most loving breast
o sake do fortune chide
guilty goddess harmful deeds
did not better life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
almost thence nature subdued
what works dyer's hand
pity then wish were renewed
whilst willing patient will drink
potions eisel 'gainst strong infection
no bitterness will bitter think
nor double penance correct correction
pity then dear friend assure ye
even pity enough cure
which vulgar scandal stamped upon brow
what care who calls well or ill
so o'er green bad good allow
are all world must strive
know shames praises from tongue
none else nor none alive
steeled sense or changes right or wrong
so profound abysm throw all care
others' voices adder's sense
mark how neglect do dispense
are so strongly purpose bred
all world besides methinks are dead
since left mine eye mind
which governs go about
doth part his function partly blind
seems seeing but effectually out
no form delivers heart
bird flower or shape which doth latch
nor his own vision holds what doth catch
if see rud'st or gentlest sight
most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
mountain or sea day or night
crow or dove shapes them feature
incapable more replete
most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
or whether doth mind being crowned
drink up monarch's plague this flattery
love taught this alchemy
make monsters things indigest
such cherubins as sweet self resemble
creating every bad perfect best
as fast as objects his beams assemble
o 'tis first 'tis flattery seeing
great mind most kingly drinks up
mine eye well knows what his gust 'greeing
his palate doth prepare cup
mine eye loves doth first begin
those lines before have writ do lie
even those said could not love dearer
yet then judgment knew no reason why
most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose millioned accidents
creep 'twixt vows change decrees kings
tan sacred beauty blunt sharp'st intents
divert strong minds course alt'ring things
might not then say 'now love best'
when was certain o'er incertainty
crowning present doubting rest
love babe then might not say so
give full growth which still doth grow
accuse thus have scanted all
wherein should great deserts repay
forgot upon dearest love call
whereto all bonds do tie day by day
given time own dear purchased right
have hoisted sail all winds
which should transport farthest from sight
book both wilfulness errors down
just proof surmise accumulate
bring within level frown
but shoot not at wakened hate
since appeal says did strive prove
constancy virtue love
eager compounds our palate urge
as prevent our maladies unseen
sicken shun sickness when purge
even so being full ne'er cloying sweetness
bitter sauces did frame feeding
sick welfare found kind meetness
diseased ere there was true needing
thus policy love t' anticipate
ills were not grew faults assured
which rank goodness would by ill cured
but thence learn find lesson true
drugs poison him so feil sick
what potions have drunk siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears hopes hopes fears
still losing when saw self win
what wretched errors hath heart committed
whilst hath thought self so blessed never
distraction this madding fever
o benefit ill now find true
better by evil still made better
ruined love when built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so return rebuked content
gain by ills thrice more than have spent
when do count clock tells time
see brave day sunk hideous night
sable curls all silvered o'er white
when lofty trees see barren leaves
which erst from heat did canopy herd
summer's green all girded up sheaves
borne bier white bristly beard
then thy beauty do question make
thou among wastes time must go
since sweets beauties do themselves forsake
die as fast as they see others grow
save breed brave him when he takes thee hence
were once unkind befriends now
sorrow which then did feel
needs must under transgression bow
unless nerves were brass or hammered steel
if were by unkindness shaken
as by yours y'have passed hell time
tyrant have no leisure taken
weigh how once suffered crime
deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
soon as then tendered
humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but trespass now becomes fee
mine ransoms yours yours must ransom
'tis better vile than vile esteemed
when not receives reproach being
just pleasure lost which so deemed
not by our feeling but by others' seeing
give salutation sportive blood
or frailties why are frailer spies
which their wills count bad what think good
no am am they level
at abuses reckon up their own
may straight though they themselves bevel
by their rank thoughts deeds must not shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad their badness reign
full charactered lasting memory
which shall above idle rank remain
beyond all date even eternity
or at least so long as brain heart
have faculty by nature subsist
till each razed oblivion yield his part
thee thy record never can missed
poor retention could not so much hold
nor need tallies thy dear love score
trust those tables receive thee more
keep an adjunct remember thee
were import forgetfulness
no time thou shalt not boast do change
thy pyramids built up newer might
are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings former sight
our dates are brief therefore admire
what thou dost foist upon us old
than think before have heard them told
thy registers thee both defy
not wond'ring at present nor past
thy records what see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this do vow this shall ever
will true despite thy scythe thee
if dear love were but child state
might fortune's bastard unfathered
weeds among weeds or flowers flowers gathered
no was builded far from accident
suffers not smiling pomp nor falls
under blow thralled discontent
whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
fears not policy heretic
which works leases short numbered hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
nor grows heat nor drowns showers
which die goodness who have lived crime
were't aught bore canopy
extern outward honouring
or laid great bases eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
have not seen dwellers form favour
lose all more by paying too much rent
compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers their gazing spent
take thou oblation poor but free
which not mixed seconds knows no art
but mutual render only thee
hence thou suborned informer true soul
when most impeached stands least thy control
o thou lovely boy who thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee this purpose her skill
may time disgrace wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit though delayed answered must
her quietus render thee
old age black was not counted fair
or if were bore not beauty's name
beauty slandered bastard shame
since each hand hath put nature's power
fairing foul art's false borrowed face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but profaned if not lives disgrace
therefore mistress' eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation false esteem
every tongue says beauty should look so
how oft when thou music music play'st
upon blessed wood whose motion sounds
thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
wiry concord mine ear confounds
do envy those jacks nimble leap
kiss tender inward thy hand
whilst poor lips which should harvest reap
at wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
situation those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are this
give them thy fingers thy lips kiss
th' expense spirit waste shame
lust action till action lust
perjured murd'rous bloody full blame
savage extreme rude cruel not trust
past reason hunted no sooner had
past reason hated as swallowed bait
purpose laid make taker mad
mad pursuit possession so
had having quest have extreme
bliss proof proved very woe
before joy proposed behind dream
all this world well knows yet none knows well
shun heaven leads men this hell
no longer yours than self here live
against this coming end should prepare
sweet semblance some other give
so should beauty which hold lease
find no determination then were
self again after self's decease
when sweet issue sweet form should bear
who lets so fair house fall decay
which husbandry honour might uphold
barren rage death's eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear love know
had father let son say so
mistress' eyes are nothing sun
coral far more red than her lips red
if snow white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs wires black wires grow her head
have seen roses damasked red white
but no such roses see her cheeks
than breath from mistress reeks
love hear her speak yet well know
music hath far more pleasing sound
grant never saw goddess go
mistress when she walks treads ground
yet by heaven think love as rare
as any she belied false compare
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
thou art fairest most precious jewel
yet good faith some say thee behold
thy face hath not power make love groan
say they err dare not so bold
although swear self alone
sure not false swear
thousand groans but thinking thy face
one another's neck do witness bear
thy black fairest judgment's place
thence this slander as think proceeds
beshrew heart makes heart groan
deep wound gives friend
is't not enough torture alone
but slave slavery sweet'st friend must
from self thy cruel eye hath taken
next self thou harder hast engrossed
him self thee am forsaken
torment thrice three fold thus crossed
but then friend's heart let poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps let heart his guard
thou canst not then use rigour gaol
yet thou wilt being pent thee
perforce am thine all
so now have confessed he thine
self am mortgaged thy will
self i'll forfeit so other mine
thou wilt restore comfort still
thou art covetous he kind
he learned but surety write
under bond him as fist doth bind
statute thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer put'st forth all use
sue friend came debtor sake
so him lose through unkind abuse
him have lost thou hast both him
he pays whole yet am not free
'will boot 'will over plus
more than enough am vex thee still
thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will large spacious
not once vouchsafe hide will thine
shall will others seem right gracious
will no fair acceptance shine
sea all water yet receives rain still
abundance addeth his store
one will mine make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one one 'will'
if thy soul check thee come so near
swear thy blind soul was thy 'will
will thy soul knows admitted there
thus far love love suit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil treasure thy love
ay fill full wills will one
among number one reckoned none
then number let pass untold
though thy store's account one must
nothing hold so please thee hold
nothing something sweet thee
make but name thy love love still
then thou lov'st name will
thou blind fool love what dost thou mine eyes
they behold see not what they see
yet what best take worst
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
anchored bay where all men ride
why eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto judgment heart tied
why should heart think several plot
which heart knows wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this not
put fair truth upon so foul face
this false plague are they now transferred
when love swears she made truth
do believe her though know she lies
she might think some untutored youth
unlearned world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking she thinks young
although she knows days are past best
simply credit her false speaking tongue
both sides thus simple truth suppressed
wherefore say not am old
o love's best habit seeming trust
age love loves not have years told
therefore lie her she
our faults by lies flattered
o call not justify wrong
thy unkindness lays upon heart
wound not thine eye but thy tongue
use power power slay not by art
dear heart forbear glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound cunning when thy might
more than o'erpressed defence can bide
let excuse thee ah love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
therefore from face she turns foes
they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since am near slain
kill outright looks rid pain
yet methinks have astronomy
but not tell good or evil luck
plagues dearths or seasons' quality
nor can fortune brief minutes tell
pointing each his thunder rain wind
or say princes if shall go well
by oft predict heaven find
but from thine eyes knowledge derive
constant stars them read such art
if from thy self store thou wouldst convert
or else thee this prognosticate
thy end truth's beauty's doom date
wise as thou art cruel do not press
tongue tied patience too much disdain
lest sorrow lend words words express
manner pity wanting pain
if might teach thee wit better were
though not love yet love tell so
no news but health from their physicians know
if should despair should grow mad
madness might speak ill thee
now this ill wresting world grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed
may not so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
faith do not love thee mine eyes
they thee thousand errors note
who despite view pleased dote
nor are mine cars thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire invited
any sensual feast thee alone
but five wits nor five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed likeness man
thy proud heart's slave vassal wretch
she makes sin awards pain
love sin thy dear virtue hate
hate sin grounded sinful loving
o but mine compare thou thine own state
thou shalt find merits not reproving
or if do not from those lips thine
have profaned their scarlet ornaments
sealed false bonds love as oft as mine
robbed others' beds' revenues their rents
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity thy heart when grows
thy pity may deserve pitied
if thou dost seek have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou denied
lo as careful huswife runs catch
one her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe makes all swift dispatch
pursuit thing she would have stay
cries catch her whose busy care bent
follow which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runst thou after which flies from thee
whilst thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back
play mother's part kiss kind
so will pray thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back loud crying still
which two spirits do suggest still
better angel man right fair
worser spirit woman coloured ill
win soon hell female evil
tempteth better angel from side
would corrupt saint devil
wooing his purity her foul pride
whether angel turned fiend
suspect may yet not directly tell
guess one angel another's hell
yet this shall ne'er know but live doubt
till bad angel fire good one out
those lips love's own hand did make
breathed forth sound said 'i hate'
languished her sake
but when she saw woeful state
straight her heart did mercy come
chiding tongue ever sweet
taught thus anew greet
'i hate' she altered an end
followed as gentle day
doth follow night who fiend
from heaven hell flown away
'i hate' from hate away she threw
saved life saying 'not you'
poor soul centre sinful earth
sinful earth these rebel powers array
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors this excess
eat up thy charge this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
let pine aggravate thy store
buy terms divine selling hours dross
within fed without rich no more
death once dead there's no more dying then
love as fever longing still
which longer nurseth disease
feeding which doth preserve ill
th' uncertain sickly appetite please
reason physician love
angry his prescriptions are not kept
hath left desperate now approve
desire death which physic did except
frantic mad evermore unrest
thoughts discourse as mad mens are
at random from truth vainly expressed
have sworn thee fair thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night
o what eyes hath love put head
which have no correspondence true sight
or if they have where judgment fled
censures falsely what they see aright
what means world say not so
if not then love doth well denote
love's eye not so true as all mens no
how can o how can love's eye true
so vexed watching tears
no marvel then though mistake view
sun self sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love tears thou keep'st blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
when against self thee partake
do not think thee when forgot
am self all tyrant thy sake
who hateth thee do call friend
whom frownst thou do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st do not spend
revenge upon self present moan
what merit do self respect
so proud thy service despise
commanded by motion thine eyes
but love hate now know thy mind
those can see thou lov'st am blind
