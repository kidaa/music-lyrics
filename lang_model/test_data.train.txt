death row
that's where motherfuckers is endin up
dear mama i'm caught up in this sickness
i robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
wonder if they'll catch me or will this nigga snitch
should i shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
dont wanna commit murder but damn they got me trapped
hawkin while i'm walkin and talkin behind my back
i'm kind of schizophrenic i'm in this shit to win it
got no time for cops who trip and try to catch me
too fuckin trigger happy to let them suckers snatch me
niggaz gettin jealous jealous tryin to find my stash
whip out the nine now i'ma dive and pump your ass
peter picked a pepper but i can pick a punk
snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
the punk thought i was bluffin but swear i'm nothin nice
before i take your life first wrestle with these mics
i listen to him scream tray deee went insane
new rovers pull me over i'm sentenced to the pen
remember that little bird he snitched and told a friend
it's trouble on my mind i'm with the old timers
and fuck five oh blaow blaow turn em into forty niners
tupac sings
bye bye i was never meant to live
cant be positive when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye i was never meant to be
livin like a thief runnin through the streets
where they find me 16 on death row
dear mama these cops dont understand me
i turned to a life of crime cause i came from a broken family
my uncle used to touch me i never told you that
scared what you might do i couldnt hold you back
i kept it deep inside i done let it fuel my anger
i'm down for all my homies no mercy for a stranger
the brother in my cell is 16 as well
it's hard to adapt when you're black and you're trapped in a livin hell
instead of livin sad in jail i coulda died free and happy
and my cellmate's raped on the norm
and passed around the dorm you can hear his asshole gettin torn
they made me an animal
cant sleep instead of countin sheep niggaz countin cannibals
and that's how it is in the pen
turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
my mama prayed for me
tell the lord to make way for me prepare any day for me why
to the death i take the breath from your jugular
the trick is to never lose hope
i found my buddy hangin dead from a rope 16 on death row
tupac sings
bye bye i was never meant to live
cant be positive when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye i was never meant to be
livin like a thief runnin through the streets
bye bye and i got no place to go
dear mama they sentenced me to death
today's my final day i'm countin every breath
i'm bitter cause i'm dyin so much i havent seen
i know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
i got beef with a sick society that doesnt give a shit
and they too quick to say goodbye to me
they tell me the preacher's there for me
he's a crook with a book that motherfucker never cared for me
he's only here to be sure
on the poor and how can these people judge me
they aint my peers and in all these years they aint never love me
i never got to be a man must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
and to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
steer clear of these aryan motherfuckers
cause once they got you locked up
they got you trapped you're better off gettin shot up
i'm convinced self defense is the way
i wish i woulda known while i was out there
now i'm straight headin for the chair
tupac sings
bye bye i was never meant to live
cant be positive when the ghetto's where we live
bye bye i was never meant to be
livin like a thief runnin through the streets
bye bye and i got no place to go
where you find me 16 on death row
it's to all my partners in the penitentiaries
16 on death row

and only we can change

verse 1 tupac
she was
born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
a heart full of gold
still it wont change the world
though she could never understand why
some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
should have been a beauty queen
still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
little girl dont cry
'coz even though they died
you can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
never asked for this misery
but look at what you gettin
it's a blessing in disguise
when you find out your pregnant
and even though you all alone
you'se got to do this on your own
so baby go on
i wish you luck
and if you need me call
just come to me and let me feed you all
i can understand
the way it feels when you fighting the world
facing all this drama
chorus
mama
dont know why
mama's just a little girl
given that she's a
time aint on her side
mama's just a little girl
mama's just a little girl
she gotta hold her head up high
at 16 what a beautiful thing
the very essence of a jet black ebony queen
and who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
she didnt listen had sex
watch her belly raise hey
got violated by someone she dated
if this is fate i hate to see the seed she created
so we wait though it takes time to build the body and the mind
she reclines 9 months
what do we find
a little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul
addicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage
he learned his values on the streets at an early age
watch for police
dont come home why
'coz mammas acting crazy
at the hospital
'bout to have another baby
grown within
blessed with twins
how the hell can mamma raise 3 men
so we began a closest family
such insanity
a happy home
for one act inhumanity
plus mammas said the seed was corrupted
used the rubber belly
now mamma sits quiet
sipping peppermint schnapps
turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops hey
how could mamma bring a thug like me into this world
she aint the cause of all the drama
cause mommas just a little girl
chorus
mama
dont know why
liven if she is or not
time aint on her side
cause ama's just a little girl
mama's just a little girl
she gotta hold her head up high
how could she raise us
verse 3 tupac
now
would she remain in the same spot
now look here
i see her clutching her son
in her arms she hurt
her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
fulfill prophecy
but who could stop the grief
i walk around trying to hold the world up on top me
probably be an innocent man
but still i'm the victim of a curse
nothing but pain
since my birth taught me functions at the pen
cause everybody's in paying back society
i'm guilty of a life of sin
i watched the drama occur
my eyes blurred 'fore i jet it
i wonder why we all have to die for we get it
though we shed tears
so many peers i done buried
knowing i'ma see the cemetery
must be prepared in this cold world
no one cares
no it aint fair
but we all there
and do our share
in this land of underhanded schemes and plans
vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
mamma told me not to be a punk
what you niggas want
hey
they aint a thing i wouldnt do for my mamma in this world
cause you know i aint mad at cha
you' just a little girl
see mammas just a little girl
hey hey
chorus
repeat until fade
dont know why
mama's just a little girl
given that she is or not
time aint on here side
mama's just a little girl
mama's just a little girl
she gotta hold her head up high
tupac talking
they ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
facing all this drama
but to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
is to ignore from which we came
you see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
on the contrary
we would all celebrate its tenacity
we would all love its will to reach the sun
well
we are the roses echo
and these are my damaged petals echo
dont ask me why echo
thank god nigga echo
ask me how echo
hahaha
you see mama's just a little girl

maybe he'll listen in his casket the aftermath
more bodies being buried i'm losing my homies in a hurry
they're relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
i'm headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever i'm feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
what's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth

always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen

f'real on my motherfuckin block
verse one
they got a nigga
sheddin tears reminiscin on my past fears
cause shit was hectic for me last year
it appears that i've been marked for death my heartless breath
and no rest forever weary my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
shit is scary how black on black crime legendary
but at times unnessecary i'm gettin worried
teardrops and closed caskets the three strikes law is drastic
and certain death for us ghetto bastards
what can we do when we're arrested but open fire
life in the pen aint for me cause i'd rather die
but dont cry through your despair
and who cares if we survive
the only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin on a four five
my neighborhood aint the same
cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
and i swear it's like a trap
but i aint given up on the hood it's all good when i go back
hoes show me love niggaz give me props
forever hop cause it dont stop on my block
chorus a bunch of kids see the liner notes
hard times is all we see on my block
every block is kinda mean
but on our block we still playyyyyy
but on our block we still playyyyyy
verse two
now shit's constantly hot on my block it never fails to be gunshots
cant explain a mother's pain when her son drops
black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
god help me cause i'm starvin cant get a job
so i resort to violent robberies my life is hard
cant sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
mislead from childhood where i went astray
till this day i still pray for a better way
cant help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
from the start i felt the racism cause i'm dark
hit the bar and played the star everywhere i went
in my heart i felt alone out here on my own
i close my eyes and picture home on my block
chorus w minor variations
verse three
and i cant help but wonder why so many young kids had to die
caught strays from ak's and the driveby
swollen pride and homicide dont coincide
brothers cry for broken lives mama come inside
used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
time changes us to stone them crack pipes
all up and down the block exterminatin black life
but i cant blame the dealers
my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
shit's real i know ya feel my tragedy
a single mother with a problem child daddy free
hangin out pickin up game sippin cheap liquor
gamin the hoochies hopin i can get to sleep with her
fantasies of a nigga livin phat but held back
pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
wide eyed and losin focus on my block
chorus w minor variations
verse four
and block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
a young nigga learned to break night
used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
i send them ends but it's tough on a friend in my mind
alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall miss his call
i know the young niggaz understand this
growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
i reminisce on tha fast times past crimes
tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
cant explain just what attracts me to this dirty game
gold chains some extra change and the street fame
and what's strange is everybod knows my name swear they all know me
and lots of cash make a nigga change
for all the niggaz that i lost to the game from my block
chorus w minor variations kids repeat last line over and over
2pac speaking over chorus

evil spirits hide at total strangers yo' life's in danger
prepare nigga be aware cause we aint scared
mob 'til i die when we ride niggaz disappear
fill 'em up with pistol smoke
for leakin information to the feds
the burnin bed was the tellin sign

bleedin like a stuck hog me and my closest road dogz
chorus
2pac
fuck they feelings that's what they get for squealin
that's the pressures of a gangsta dangerous this drug dealin
take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggaz 'til they purple
simon says take they heads homies
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
fishin for fake niggaz observe and shake niggaz
the only way to see six figures is break niggaz
me and musolini set to ride we high
big bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way

chorus 2x
verse 1 tupac
now of course i want peace on the streets
but realistically
painting perfect pictures aint never work
my misery was so deep
in my quest for cash
i learned fast
using violent measures
memories of adolescent years
their was unity
but after puberty we brought war
to our community
so many bodies dropping
its gotta stop
but still i'm stepping
keeping my weapon
must protect myself
the promise of a better tomorrow
aint never reach me
plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me
sipping thunderbird
and grape kool aid
calling earl since my stomach was empty
watch my 'lil homies
lose there childhood to guns
nobody cries no more
cause we all die for fun
so why you ask me if i want peace
if you cant grant it
niggas fighting across the whole planet
so we can never be peace
chorus
or all we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the beefs
and i know there never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
cause there can never be peace
verse 2 kastro
somebody owes me
will they control me nah
i aint a hater playa
your babies have babies
now we fighting each other
my dogs got rabies
they biting each other
'n it aint hard to find a friend like mine
big fully is a bully
and he dont mind dying
and i gotta be bright
miss sign after sign
after time after time
and i dont like nobody
they dont like me more
and i'm cool with that finally
but they heard it before
dog
we living in a prison
losing our religion on em
thanks given when thankful just for living in hell
but it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart
and if we make it up out
we still stuck in the dark
will there ever be peace
just the peace in my heart
never
kastro talking
the only peace we got
is the peace in our heart
right there in piece that we hold in our waste line
feel me dog
cm'on
chorus
will there ever be peace
or all we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the beefs
and i know there never be peace never
thats why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
verse 3 napolean
things are changing
nigga you better fantasize
i'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
the world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it
we all goin need god if we plan to get out of this
niggas spending too much time hating on each other
niggas buyin guns
load em up
and the victim is you and me
the secret is true indeed
the good die
mostly over bullshit
repeatedly
deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love
but the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us
so i stays ready
keep my pay heavy and boss up
never rely on luck
asking god to point out the imposters
never let no weapon formed against me prosper
cause they'll never be peace
so dont rely on it
soldiers die for
and in the ghetto they trying for it
fuck peace
chorus x3
or all we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the beefs
and i know there never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walks the streets
cause there can never be peace
tupac talking

equipped with ski masks

at thug mansion
verse one 2pac
a place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
but when i held that 9 all i could see was my momma's eyes
not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we g's
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion
chorus j phoenix nas
every corner every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy laid back and cool
every hour cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright i wanna go
nothin but peace i wanna go love i wanna go nigga
verse two nas
a place where death doesnt reside just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees no cops rollin by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for nobody's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy i'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis gray hair maybe
i'm just twenty some odd years i done lost my mother
and i cried tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldnt feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together sippin heavnly champagne
what angels saw with golden wings in thug's mansion

verse three 2pac
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they aint got hoods

drippin peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sittin there kickin it with malcolm 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
that passed on they in heaven found peace at last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what i'm askin
remember this face save me a place in thug's mansion

for multiple years witness peers catch gunshots
nobody cares seen the politicians ban us
why they cant stand us is there a way for me to change
or am i just a victim of things i did to maintain
i need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains cause all the rest dead
is there a spot for us to roll if you find it
i'll be right behind ya show me and i'll go
how can i be peaceful i'm comin from the bottom
watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him

c bo the bald head nut what
you know what time it is
you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what tha streets do
to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
i'll hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against tha wall
didnt do a thing at all
i'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
bang bang down another casualty
but it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
who do you blame
it's a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
it's time i lett'em suffer tha payback
i'm tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a 'g' and somewhere safe to stay
cant use tha phone
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now he's tha devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
started steppin in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or you'll be dead today
dark and i couldnt see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do
live my life in a prison cell
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell

the brother with tattoos and no fears
runnin my fingers through your hair if you call me
chorus

no love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
my unknown tendencies to mash my car
getting wicked with my ski mask find the stash and dump
why niggaz run i'm the last one standin the rest die
victims of my lethal chrome cannon westside
though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
five shots changed my whole life throats were slit
though we go back like wild knights at latin quarters
niggaz tried to kill me and i fed they wife and they daughters
blazed the weed draped they seeds gave 'em cash
pass the fame and let the game go rollin past
why you change it's a cold world taught me life
retaliation proves niggaz never caught me right
say they shot me in my nuts out of luck quick
bullshit nigga cause i'm still fuckin yo' bitch
niggaz got me twisted in a bad way why you change
young noble

chorus

another fake nigga usin my strengths to get credit
i mean face sound scared but your heartbeat said it
chorus
young noble

and i think i'm goin crazy cause my hair is gettin thiner
i've been drinkin on the daily i can hardly remember

but dont twist it cause none of y'all niggaz worry me
outlawz

chorus
let the punks know repeat 3x
what y'all want
unconditional love no doubt
talking bout the stuff that dont wear off
it dont fade
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
i'm a still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what hehe
you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love
verse one
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see it's hard to live
this life without god so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why god deserved to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes
before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv show cartoons in my living room hey
a player in this game
mama dont cry long as we try
maybe things change
perhaps it's just a fantasy
a life where we dont need no welfare
shit with our whole family
maybe it's me that caused it
the fighting and the hurting
in my room crying cause i didnt want to be a burden
and i aint worried bout a damn thang with unconditionl love
chorus 2x
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
verse two
just got the message you've been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets aint had a chance to speak
we could never be enemies cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard
cause it aint easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician
the elevation of today's generation
if could make 'em listen
time to play and strategize my family's gotta eat
when we make somethin out of nothing
no pleasure in the suffering neighborhood would be good
if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing
sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops unconditional love
chorus
verse three
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same eyes
something inside please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures and all the currency
this fast life soon shatter us
cause after all the lights and screams
nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days
maybe a peaceful night baby dont cry
cause everythang gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
dont worry bout a thang baby
girl i'm a soldier huh
you still came with that unconditional love
chorus 3x until fade

chorus sung by rl on disc one richard page on disc two
2pac
somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be through the misery that came to pass
the hard times made a true friend afraid to ask for currency
but you could run to me when you need me and i'll never leave
i just need someone to believe in as you can see
it's a small thang to a true what could i do
real homies help you get through
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
and half the times we be actin up call the cops
bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block
it never stop when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah but it's clear i'll always be the same
until the end of time
chorus
so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
so i can fly away until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
2pac

my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know i dont hang around the house much
this all night money making got me outta touch shit
aint flashed a smile in a long while
my attitude got me walkin solo ride out alone in my lo lo
watchin the whole world move in slow mo
for quiet times disappear listen to the ocean

but i aint trippin i'm a player i aint sweatin him

his next of kin no remorse it was meant to happen
until the end of time
chorus 2x
2pac

young brother buried
was it me the weed or this life i lead
if daytime is for suckas then
tonight we bleed
out for all that
knowing that this world brings drawbacks
once i deliver these war raps
meet me at the cemetary
dressed in black
tonight we
follow the dead
and those who wont be back
so if i die
to the same for me
shed no tear
for years
why worry
hope to god
get me high
when i'm burried
knowing deep inside me
only if yah love
come rush me to the gates of heaven
let me picture for a while
i wonder now
how do we outlast always get cash
stay strong if we all mash
hold your head
chorus
how do we keep the music playing
how do we get ahead
to many young black brothers are dying
living fast too fast
begging me to stop
cuz these lawyers getting money
everytime they knock us
slashing pockets lyrically
suckas fleed when they notice
switched my name to makaveli

expose foes with my hocus pocus flows
they froze
more money mean litigating
more playa hating
got a cell at the penn for me waiting

to many young black brothers are dying
living fast too fast
god bless the child that can hold is own
indeed
enemies bleed when i hold my chrome
to my unborn seeds

in this world of greed
currency means nothing if you still aint free
money breeds jealousy

i hope for better days
trouble comes naturally
running from authorities
and my aim is to spread more smiles than tears
utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
maybe mama had it all right

verse 1
ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
niggas strapped with 45's and aint smiling
and i'm driving to a place they're all warrin
the lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
in the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
we focused on the dollar bill still
the outsiders tend to disrespect the place
surviving under conditions demons dinin
you can run it but cant hide it so step aside
its the nigga that makes music for the streets
cause i love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets
cause its deep
some niggas make it out the neighborhood and wont surface
and let the money make them nervous what's the purpose
a motherfucker sitting on fat
he came up in the hood but he cant come back
on a mission to maintian me and take aim
in position to let my opposition know my life
cause off in these streets i keep it real but what's right
surviving sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
i'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
fuck being a nigga in your army though i'm a killer
enter the ghetto so that you can see
what i mean when i say i love this cause it love me
and talking 'bout a motherfucking change
this is for my thug niggas
chorus x6
this is for my homies and my thug niggas uuuuugh
verse 2
'face picture us working at mcdonald's

gold slug a car full of thug niggas
twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers

we ghetto niggas cant be stopped
got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap a lot
my phone tapped the feds on my tail
got me paying luxury taxes on everything i build
true to the ghetto that's my life
you see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
you can test me if you wanna
cause i be dumping niggas off from new orleans to california
independant black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
you used to see c in a suit and tie
but we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
executive street millionaires
niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair
chorus x6
verse 3

niggas coming out from california to represent them niggas from

to put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
until the day i die you catch a nigga high off weed the police cant
find me
my shit will drop and i'll sell five million
while all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
how can i fall how can i ball how can i catch my enemies and murder
my word of flame burn niggas inside thier brain
niggas cant hang with me and like it changes uh
scarface got me on this shit
we laced it motherfuckers in thier body and face uh

mob and the leaf keep me weeded
them niggas dont wanna see me when i got weed in my system
catch another victim capture bodies

and to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
'till these bitches understand nigga my song pay cause i'm the man

verse two 2pac
we used to be like distant cousins fightin playin dozens
whole neighborhood buzzin knowin that we wasnt
used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
besides bumpin n grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
in time we learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
and even though we seperated you said that you'd wait
dont give nobody no coochie while i be locked up state
i kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said i'll return but i gotta fight the fate's arrived
dont shed a tear cause mama i aint happy here
they got me goin mad i'm knockin busters on they backs
in my cell thinkin hell i know one day i'll be back
as soon as i touch down
i told my girl i'll be there so prepare to get fucked down
the homies wanna kick it but i'm just laughin at cha
cause youse a down ass bitch and i aint mad at cha
chorus danny boy
i aint mad at cha 2pac i aint mad at cha
i aint mad at cha 2pac a true down ass bitch and i aint mad at cha
well guess who's movin up this nigga's ballin now
bitches be callin to get it hookers keep fallin down
he went from nuttin to lots ten carots to rock
went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
he's mister local celebrity addicted to move a key
most hated by enemy escape in the luxury
see first you was our nigga but you made it so the choice is made
now we gotta slay you why you faded in the younger days
so full of pain while the weapons blaze
cause crime pays and in time you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
you'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
so many changed on me so many tried to plot
that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop
til god return me to my essence
cause even as a adolescents i refuse to be a convalescent
so many questions and they ask me if i'm still down
i moved up out of the ghetto so i aint real now
they got so much to say but i'm just laughin at cha
chorus danny boy

they done push me to the limit the more i live
now i'm in the back of the paddy wagon
while this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin
i see no justice
all i see is niggas dying fast
the sound of a gun blast
then watch the hurst past
just another day in the life 'g'
gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me
the catch they dont wanna stop at the brother man
i went to the bank to cash my cheque
i get more respect from the mutha fuckin dope man
the grammy's and the american music shows pimp us like hoes
they got dough but they hate us though
you better keep your mind on the real shit
and fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
they way they see it we was meant to be keep down
just cant understand why we getting respect now
mama told me they're be days like this
and now they trying to send me off to kuwait
gimme a break

fuck bailin hate i bail and spray with my a k
and even if they shoot me down

before the wrath and aftermath
who's that behind the trigger
who'd do yah figure

niggas isnt just the blacks
also a gang of mutha fuckas dressed in blue slacks
they say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
tell me who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city
they say niggas like to do niggas
throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
a street walkin nigga and a beat walkin nigga with a badge
i had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash
and that's just his luck
cause a nigga like me
dont really give a fuck
walked in the store what's everybody staring at
they act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black
following a nigga and shit
aint this a bitch
all i wanted was some chips
i wanna take my business else where
cause who in the hell cares
about a black man with a black need
they wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
i wonder if knows that my income is more than
his pension salary and then some
your daughter is my number one fan
and your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
so who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
sit back and get fat off the fat cat
i bust a move as smooth as casanova
and count another quick meal
i'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
and if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
as strong as a fuckin nine
mail stacked up niggas wanna act up

i couldnt take it had to make a profit
down the block got a glock and i clock grip
makin g's was my mission
movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
why must i sock a fella just to live large like rockefeller
first you didnt give a fuck but you're learnin now
if you dont respect the town then we'll burn you down
god damn it's a motherfuckin riot
if you're not from the town then dont pass through
cause some og fools might blast you
it aint right but it's long overdue
we cant have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
i want g's so you label me a criminal
and if i die i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
chorus
verse two 2pac
here on earth tell me what's a blick life worth
and even when you take the shit
move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
ask rodney latasha and many more
it's been goin on for years there's plenty more
when they ask me when will the violence cease
when your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
niggaz had enough time to make a difference
bear witness own our own business
word to god cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
so we loot please dont shoot when you see
i'm takin from the cause for years they would take it from me
now the tables have turned around
you didnt listen until the niggaz burned it down
and now bush cant stop the hit
predicted the shit in 2pacalypse
and for once i was down with niggaz felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz yeah
and for the first time everybody let go
chorus
verse three 2pac
i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under i wonder what it take to make this
one better place let's erase the wait state
take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
and only time we deal is when we kill each other
and though it seems heaven sent
we aint ready to have a black president huh
it aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
i wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth living should i blast myself
i'm tired of being poor and even worse i'm black
my stomach hurts so i'm lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a ne gro
mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
i'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
let the lord judge the criminals
if i die i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
chorus to 27 from fade
just think if niggaz decide to retaliate
soldier in the house
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto 4x to fade
a coward dies a thousand deaths
verse one
they say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
puffin weed as i position myself to clock g's
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evadin the playa hatin tricks while hittin switches
but y'all some hoes the game should be sewed
i'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldnt raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
i run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
i'm duckin the cop i hit the weed as i'm clutchin my glock
niggaz is hot when i hit the block what if i die tonight
chorus
if i die tonight repeat 3x
verse two
polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
when i get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
he got it by killer preoccuppied with bein boss
revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
i'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
conversatin like they still here if i die tonight
chorus
verse three
plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
pray to the heavens three fifty sevens to the sky
and i hope i'm forgiven for thug livin when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggaz
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
overdose of a dick while drinkin liquor when i lay her
pistol whippin these simps for bein petrified and lame
disrespectin the game prayin for punishment and pain
dont shed a tear for me nigga i aint happy hear
i hope they bury me and send me to my rest
headlines readin murdered to death my last breath
take a look picture a crook on his last stand
motherfuckers dont understand if i die tonight
chorus
verse one
ever since you was a pee wee down by my knee with a wee wee
we been coochie coo all through school you and me g
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
times goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaane my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with ak's
i'm still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for y'all if my homies call
verse two
it's a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang cane on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo' cane
you got game now you run with no shame
i chose rappin tracks to make stacks
but now i dont wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go you're not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
i'll be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
i'd be no different than the other
h to the o to the m to the i to the e
cause it's a fall in no time at all
i'm down for y'all when my homies call
word if my homies call
verse three
well it's ninety one and i'm livin kinda swell now
but i hear that you're going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy
it aint what i expected it's hectic it's sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
it's fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great i'm giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
but my homie would never do me wrong
that's why i wrote this song if you ever need me it's on
no matter who the foe they must fall

church bells ring in background
in today's music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
excuse me makaveli's verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jay z from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release
the question everbody wants to know is
why'd they get this nigga started
tupac rather makaveli was not available for comment

refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
lace me with words of destruction and i'll explode
but supply me with the will to survive and watch the world grow

you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced with it i'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six eight all day
i'm soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac

so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin

i'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet

electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom bay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
there's no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige and i'm jason vorhees
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up jews wit german lugers
the mr meth tical from staten isle
will be back after this mess age dont touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for nine nickel
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
non believers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly
and i'm out for nine nickel ins tha rebels
west list this this this
guess who's back
2pac
drop the drums here it comes only got
better press wreck on your tech here we go set pass the moet
my trickery's more slippery when wet
wicked as i flip dont trip get a grip
it'll kick if the bass line's thick it's a hit
everybody's got a mic now its like a hobby
but more like a job cause bootleggers tryin to rob me
and little man wants to be a rap star
make papes hit skins drive a fat car
it aint easy sleazy even
no benefits just tricks and chicks
knock a pig to pick so here's a stick to lick
i shoot a gift til there aint none left
and if i find that the track sound def
i catch wreck till i lose my breath
that's how it goes in the land of broke
i dispose of those rock shows and collect my dough
now i suppose i'm the bad guy why
i say hi and try to stay high
but be thankful that you're livin blessed
guess who's back comin back with the track supplied
by special ed and ak comin right and exact
i'm fightin it back now snap where they at
when it's time to go to combat guess who's back
chorus repeat 4x
yes i'm back special ed
tupac is back
2pac
one minute to bounce and every second counts
i went from hustlin dicks to makin hits bustin flicks
now i'm sure to be rich for ninety six
i pull my 'capes on tapes and make papes
trace the bass to the tape with the baddest bass to date
i try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
good thoughts i wait cause they hate my black take
yeah it's on and it's packed in the rap race
but if ya got a black face its a rat race
tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
everybody wants to test me why me
no lie nuckas cried when they try me
givin up the roughness justice
i'ma bust as i'm rippin up 'nuff hits
and guess who's back no longer trapped
cause i snapped on the ones that held me back feel the contact
ride the track get i grip as i flip
ghetto wickedness i kick guess who's back
yes i'm back cause i never did front cut 'n scratched

rebel rebel rebel
rebel rebel
2pac
they just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister it's time for me to explain that i'm the rebel
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the critics'll leave your boy alone g
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till i'm banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
it's from the rebel the rebel of the underground
2pac
now i'm face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once mo'
now the fox is in the henhouse creepin up on your daughter
while you sleep i got her sneakin out
i'll be nuttin how i wanna and doin what i'm gonna
now i'm up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel the rebel of the underground
rebel he's a rebel rebel of the underground 4x
2pac
they say they hate me they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel the rebel of the underground
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they dont like what i'm talkin bout
so what's wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
but me i'm comin from the soul
and if it dont go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they cant stop me
it's sloppy dont even try to
i'm a slave to the rhythm and i'm about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punks still cant hang
they makin records bout violence
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
but 2pacalpyse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel the rebel of the underground
tupac is a rebel rebel of the underground 8x

remember that
our lifesytles be close caption
addicted to fatal attraction
pictures and actions be played back
in the mist of mashin
no fairytales for this young black male
some see me stranded in this land of hell
jail and crack cells
culture
or the repercussion
sellin my soul
for material wishes
fast cars and bitches
wishin i live my life a legend
immortalized in pictures
why shed tears save your sympathy
my childhood years
was spend burying my peers in the cemetary
here's a message to the newborns
if you believe
you can achieve just look at me
against all odds
though life is hard we carry on
living in the projects
broke with no lights on

scarface
now as i open up my story
with the blaze of your blunt
so you can picture thoughts slowly
upon phrases i run
and i can walk you thru the dayz that it done
i often wish that i can save everyone
but i'm a dreamer
have you ever seen a nigga
over looking his tomorrows
and they finally came
look back on childhood memories
and i'm still feelin the pain
turnin circles in my 9th grade
dealin cocaine
to many hassels in my local lights
survivin the strain
and a man without a focused life
stuck inside a getto fantasy
hopin it'd change
but we're not focused on reality
we broken in jane
had a dream of livin wealthy
makin it big
over football

what take it
and after all my mama's thankin god
for blessing her child
all my mama gotz to do now is collect
and then smile
2pac smile
chours
ohhh wont you smile for me x4

2pac
as we unload we witness furious speeds
un answered questions keep us all stressin
curious g's
back stabed and bleeding
crooked thoughs
laced with weed
learnin duckin stray shots
bullets be hot
they burnin
visualize the flames
will i be smothered by my own pain
strange wisdoms
cowards conversate'
so quick to dis' us
takin pictures for the feds
in desperate hopes they get us
hit us all give us plenty centuries
forgive my stance
the best revenge
is fuck friends
we milatary minded soljahs
bustin shots blindly
trying to find jahova
to help me
somebody save me
lost and crazy
scared to drop a seed
maybe now
niggaz feel me now
picture my pain
embrace my words
make the world change
and still i smile nigga
chrous till fade
background singer till fade
i shall not fear no man but god
i shed so many tears if i should die before i wake
please god walk with me grab a nigga and take me to heaven
back in elementary i thrived on misery

inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest

be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us he's deceased
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that i'm strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause i'm cursed i'm havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
show me some happiness again i'm goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die
baptized in eternal fire i'll shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now i'm lost and i'm weary so many tears
i'm suicidal so dont stand near me
to embrace an early death now there's nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
i'm barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years god and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken hearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me i'm stuck in the game
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately i've been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
i'm hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
i'm fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door shed so many tears
dear god please let me in
lord i've lost so many years and shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
laughter echoed

2pac
somebody break me i'm dreamin i started as a seed the semen
swimmin upstream planted in the womb while screamin
from a single drop this is what they got
not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
even as a little seed i could see his plan for me
stranded on welfare another broken family
now what was i to be a product of this heated passion
momma got pregnant and poppa got a piece of ass
look how it began nobody gave a fuck about me
pistol in my hand this cruel world can do without me
will a nigga live or die cause the lord cant see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects aint no sunshine
no sunny days and we only play sometimes
when everybody's sleepin
i open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
i can live or die hope i get some money 'fore i'm gone
i'm only 19 i'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
i'd rather go to college but this is where the game stops
you can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
you can ask my man ishmael reed
keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
meet up at the cemetary then get smoked out pass the weed nigga
that hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
everywhere i go niggaz holla at me keep it real g
and my reply til they kill me
act up if you feel me i was born not to make it but i did
the tribulations of a ghetto kid still i rise

please give me to the sky the sky
and if and if i die i die
i dont want you to cry
yaki khadafi
i stay sharp as always
runnin ya bricks with blitz through ya project hallways
dumpin crews like two's nigga all day
secrets of war prepare me for the worst
but now my dreams it seeems though be placin triple beams and things bro
diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans

now i plan to keep my glock cocked

i never tripped though always kept my head up high
eventually i knew that i would find my way
after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some would say that turned away is all you'll get
i just said bet and never let 'em see me sweat
while non believers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart i'm knowin that they wish me hell
yo get a real job rappin doesnt pay the rent
i hate the studio cause that's where all my money went
never surrender it's all about the faith you've got
dont ever stop just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop at least you know you gave your all
be true to you and that way you can never fall
just like a rope they hang on you until you're broke
and when you're broke they move onto the next dope
and there you are cant even pay your car nope

churches burnin planes fallin from the sky
the good definitely die young
this is a lil somethin
to help you get through the day
if you could
it was more than a tragedy
emotions be grabbin me
plane fell from the sky
we tryin to figure what happened
burnin churches fearin god
we all ignorant to aids
till it happens to you
just be a man make plans
listen to your voice
a womans tryin to make decisions
we should leave them a choice
cause who are we to say who lives and die
breathes and stops
all this judgement on other lives
what are we livin for
givin more back than takin
on my knees still waitin for my own salvation
now i feel abandoned
cause pat bucanan say i'm greedy
you can take my taxes send me to war
but cant feed me
it's so easy to regret things
after they done
scared to laugh in the sun
the tragedies that we all need
love in doses
in times like these we feel closest
the good die young
does anybody have an answer why
it seems the good die young
can anybody tell me why
can anybody tell me why 2x
when i been trapped since birth
but i had to sleep in a hearse
cause it was my bed first
my grands probably burnin
turnin in they grave
some folks aint even get to see a high age
but they did so i aint afraid
and this money got me feelin like a star
and this murder got me
and the land and stolen cars
dont get no better
dont get no weaker or no harder
i was raised in a rush without my moms
and my father

but never knowin he was dyin slower
does anybody have an answer why
it seems the good die young
can anybody tell me why
can anybody tell me why
i know my life aint promised
that's why the wise move in silence
analize these scandalous times
it's hard dogg but we manage
schools turn to war zones
leavin children to play caged and raged
they hate how come

why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
it's time somethin is done
for our young kids
they growin opus
that aint the way to live

time move quicker
no time for wastin
put your hustle down my young dealers
cause the end is nearer
but at least that's what they tellin me
hell all i know brothers
aint ridin 4 3 felonys
it's time to plan plot and strategize
capitolize mobilize
it's for all y'all
my family to the ones that stabbed me
little bit mo' love is what's recommended

the seeds from you and me

the closed caskets
growing up as an inner city brotha
where every other had a pops and a motha
i was tha product of a heated lover
nobody knew how deep it screwed me
and since my pops never knew me
my family didnt know what ta do with me
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
poor momma cant control me

a ticken timebomb
cant nobody fade me
packin a 380
and fiendin for my mercedes

punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
i'm tired of being a nice guy
i've been poor all my life but dont know quite why
so they label me a lunatic
could care less

i hope i live to be a man
must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
penn
counting pennys over tha years

proven wrong those
who swore i'd wouldnt live till twenty
now they gotta cope
since it's tha only thing i know
i'm startin to loose my hair cause i worry
hustlin to keep from gettin buried
but now i gotta move away now
cause these suckers wanna spray where i lay down

shot up half tha block to bring them back
tha streetz r deathrow

heneesee makes me think my enemy is getting close
boom boom boom
got me shooting at a ghost
some call me crazy
but this is what you gave me
amongst tha babies who raised up from tha slavery
i sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and i invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
i'm sick of being tired
sick of tha sirens body bags and tha gun firing
tell bush to push tha button cause i'm fed
tired of hearin these voices in my head
tha streetz r deathrow
chorus
tha streetz r deathrow

i've been dealt a lot of bad cards
living as a thug
count my blessings
dont stress in this land with no love
maybe if they see me rolling
i guess that's why the envious
get their eye swollen
hoping the heavenly farther love a hustler
be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut

i'll probably be an old man before i understand
why i had to live my life with pistols close at hand
kidnapped my homey's sister cut her face up bad

automatic shots rang out on every block
they got me sleepin with my infrared beams
and in my dreams i hear motherfuckers screamin

in the streets of chalk where they lie

heh maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin
where is the love never quit my ambition to thug
aint shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
niggaz i used to love enclosed in penitentiaries
to lose your life over somethin that you did as a kid
you all alone no communication block on the phone
dont get along with yo' pop and plus your moms is gone
where did we go wrong i put my soul in the song
to help us grow at times but now our minds are gone
we went from brothers and sisters to niggaz and bitches
we went from welfare livin to worldwide riches
but somethin changed in this dirty game everything's strange
lost all my homies over cocaine mayne
see you gotta get high or die cause even thugs cry
chorus
2pac
and all i see is these paranoid bitches illegal adventures
bustin motherfuckers with uppercuts i leave 'em with dentures

dear sister

they say dont let this cruel world get yah
swearing one day you might leave me
for someone thats richer
twist the cap off the bottle
i take a sip and see tommorrow
gotta make if i have to beg and borrow
reading love letters
late night locked down and quiet
if brothers dont recieve their mail
best believe we riot
staring at walls of silence
inside this cage
where they captured all my rage and violence
in time i learned a few lessons
never fall for riches
aplogizies to my true sisters
far from bitches
help me raise my black nation
reperations are due
caught up in this world
i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them
precious boys and girls
born black in this white mans world
and all i heard was
chorus
who knows what tommorrow brings
in this world where everyone lies
no matter how far i find
to let you know
that you're not alone
being born with less
i must confess
only adds on to the stress
two gunshots to my homies head
died in his rest
shot him to death
i pass his casket
gently asking
is there heaven for g's
my homeboys doing life
begging mama be stressing
shedding tears
when her son finally ask that questions
where my daddy at
mama why we live so poor
heard you late night
throught my bedroom door
now do you love me mama
why do they keep calling me nigger
get my wieght up with my hate
and pay 'em back when i'm bigger
still thugging in this jail cell
missing my block
hearing brothers screaming all night
proud to be black
but why do we act like
we dont love oursleves
dont look around
busta you sucka
check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
chorus
we must fight
who knows what tommorrow brings
in this world where everyone lies
where to go
no matter how far i find
to let you know
that you're not alone
so tell me why you changed
in a blink of an eye
my time away just made perfection
you think i'd die
not gonna cry
why should i care
like we holding on to love
thats no longer there
can you please help me
god bless me please
banging on my enemies bleed
while my g's healthy
hoping they bury me
with ammunition weed and shells
just in case they trip in heaven
aint no g's hell

verse one 2pac
i see mothers in black cryin brothers in packs dyin
plus everybody's high too doped up to ask why
watchin our own downfall witness the end
it's like we dont believe in god cause we livin in sin
i asked my homie on the block why he strapped he laughed
it's just another murder nobody mourns no more
my tear drops gettin bigger but cant figure what i'm cryin for
is it the miniature caskets little babies
victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy
maybe it's just the drugs visions of how the block was
crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
perhaps the underlyin fact stay high explain genocide
it's when we ride on our own kind
what is it we all fear reflections in the mirror
chorus 2x 2pac
who do you believe in
i put my faith in god blessed and still breathin
and even though it's hard that's who i believe in
before i'm leavin i'm askin the grievin who do you believe in
verse two 2pac
cant close my eyes cause all i see is terror
i hate the man in the mirror
cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
in this society where only gettin the cash counts
i started out as a beginner
entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
i make my money and vacate evade prison
went from the chosen one to outcast unforgiven
and all the hennessy and weed cant hide the pain i feel inside
you know it's like i'm livin just to die
i fall on my knees and beg for mercy not knowin if i'm worthy
livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me my misery

cause he just came home off of bail
2pac now tell me
chorus
who do you believe in
is it buddah jehovah or jah or allah
is it jesus is it god or is just yourself
definately not to be imposed being a demon
because this is the joy of believing
men to believe in yourselves
but for sure the higher power
resides only to ride in the heart of the true
from the soul of the man for truth never has an alibi
that's what pulls all words together
just to understand that every man is his own man
and only man can satisfy the man
only the soul of the man the feelings of the man
the for realness of the man
you cant shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
and you gotta call yourself because you are that man

2pac
can you picture young niggaz in a rush to grow
probably never even saw it comin too busy bullshittin
caught him with his mouth runnin aint this a bitch
they got me twisted in this game
the feds and the punk po lice pointin pistols at my brain
i wonder if i'm wrong cause i'm thugged out
my homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house
what was supposed to be a easy hit now shit is flipped
cause niggaz died over bullshit it's not my dream
i'm seein pictures of a broken man no witnesses
in our prime live a life of crime though it aint logical
we hobble through these tryin times livin blind
lord help me with my troubled soul
why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow
and right before i put my head on the pillow say a prayer one love
to the thugs in heaven i'll see you there
it's written for the young and dumb that wasnt warned
help you make it through the storm
my words to my first born feel me
my words to my first born
2pac
since my very first day on this earth i was cursed
so i knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
and though it hurt me there was no distortion
cause wild seeds cant grow we need more abortions
quiet your soul cause you know what you had to do
and so did victims of a world they never came to
i understand it's a better day comin
drivin with the car runnin blinded
aint no love in the hood only hearts torn
love letters to the innocent and unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
wasnt able to breathe cause the family wasnt able
cant blame her i would do the same
all i could give it was my debt and my last name
cause in the game things change livin up and down
this hard life got me walkin with my head down
but i'll never get to know so i carry on
it's written for the young and dumb that wasnt born
my words to my first born feel me
my words to my first born
mmm yeah these are the words to my first born
hey nigga talk to your born talk to your seed nigga
above the law
two thousand somethin somethin it's a new era
a nigga's too real now see shit too clear
what else is it dawg
the velvet and the silk and makin sure my kittens got they milk
hoo gotta fill this mattress let my kids know i'm at this
attack this the mack must roll hood stroll
aint no question is it above the law hustlers
if it's related to chips homey we'll handle ya
yo
although we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang
by all means stack green gangsta lean
so only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers
and niggaz that's truly down and keep god first
and give thanks for the good times as well as when it hurts
it's player haters every corner you hit
touchin their tits hella thick tryin to get you for yo' grip
i know you stressed out and fed up
but come out gun blazin and keep yo' head up
you can call it what you want to but it aint gon change
above the law 2pac og's in this rap game
and we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
y'all although we grew up corrupted and scorned
we still got a lot of wisdom to give to our first born
2pac
what you gon tell your kids nigga
who was you what was you doin how did you put it down
these my words to my motherfuckin first born
so they can know y'knahmean hehehe
aint nuttin but a motherfuckin rider wessyde 'til i die
i just played to win just played to win
motherfucker gotta bet agains the odds
killing us one by one
in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplishes nigga
niggas what are we going to do
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but we're the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge a legiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty still the bitch lied to me
steady strong nobody's gonna like what i pumpin
so get up its time to start nation building
i'm fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
there's much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy on with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day i'm gonna prove them wrong
the american dream though it seems it attainable
they're pulling your sleave dont believe
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother that's living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took our kids
but the battle aint over till the black man sings
but the battle aint over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
nightmare thats what i am
america's nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me
i shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for four hundred plus years
you should be scared

me against the world stuck in misery as a young nigga
my only thing was to be paid
life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady back in the days

where many excited fans have gathered with candles
crowd starts chanting tupac
awaiting the much anticipated release of tupac shakur's latest album better dayz

when the album will officially be released
oh hold on i think they're starting to countdown now

showed her how we swing
1 day labled thug mrs
tha essance of my ghetto sistas
hugs and kisses
that's just for me to be a father figure
little somethin for my godson elijah and a little girl named corinne
verse one
some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holler to my sisters on welfare
and uhh i know they like to beat ya down a lot
when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy what's that
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
so will the real men get up
i know you're fed up ladies but keep your head up
chorus
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter 2x
verse two
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
i'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems i'm headin for tha pen
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know it's funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
we aint meant to survive cause it's a setup
and even though you're fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
chorus
verse three
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
cause i think we can make it in fact i'm sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo'
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside you're looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
i'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and it's crazy it seems it'll never let up but
please you got to keep your head up
i
let it be prophesized niggaz'll die because ya crew's goon
around the way niggaz get murdered by the full moon
heard it in whispered tones
niggaz is bold and they choose to roll
i kill em all watch now nigga truth be told
westside was the war cry look how they scatter
niggaz dyin by my 30 yard brains'll splatter
wonder why these niggaz cross me
i'm certified crazy so sick the world made me
hard to kill a nigga cause i'm comin back like jesus
bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
momma gave a nigga breath a life of stress
i invest in a vest and makin niggaz watch they every step
label me a threat
and i aint even got started with this shit yet
thug style baby hands on my pistol listen i'm a ridah
every nigga breathin pay attention
the simple gun to my lifestyle killuminati
chorus kastro 2pac

outcasted from my family now packin heat
i run the streets a young runaway live for today
when he died i could hear him say c'mon
chorus repeat 2x
bad ass
i need the root of all evil for my stress
cause money's like a stong prescription drug it's got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's head
damn it's like a motherfuckin plague that spread
it's epidemic forgotten forgotten it got worse
i keep my head on straight makin money cause it's cursed
makin money makes a difference day by day so i gotta stay
paid no doubt day in and day out
no matter how hard you try it's in death you gotta die
a lot of my peers didnt make it to the years to come
did life doin right or did life livin dumb
who has the answers i wonder i turn to my elders
they aged and experienced but they cant even tell ya
or tell me that there'll be light at the end of the road
why cause they dont even know
a million thangs run through my mind
you aint gotta be in jail to be doin time
chorus repeats while tupac speaks below

2pac
now ever since my birth i've been cursed since i'm born to wild
in case i never get to holla at my unborn child
many things learned in prison blessed and still livin
tryin to earn every penny that i'm gettin and reminiscin
to the beginnin of my mission
when i was conceived and came to be in this position
my momma was a panther loud single parent but she proud
to school but i dropped out and left the house
cause my mama say i'm good for nothin so i'm out
since i only got one life to live god forgive me for my sins
let me make it and i'll never steal again or deal again
my only friend is my misery
wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
see my life aint promised but it'll sure get better
hope you understand my love letter to my unborn child
chorus sung with 2pac ad libs
this is to my unborn child
wanna let you know i love you
love you if you didnt know i feel this way
how i think about you every day
i have so much to say
2pac
seems so complicated to escape fate
and you can never understand 'til we trade places
tell the world i feel guilty to bein anxious
it's hard to face this cold world on a good day
when will they let the little kids in the hood play
i got shot five times but i'm still breathin
livin proof there's a god if you need a reason
can i believe in my own fate
will i raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
dear mama i'm a man now
i wanna make it on my own not a handout
make way for a whirlwind prophesized
on these cold streets aint no love no mercy and no friends
in case you never see my face again
to my unborn child
chorus
2pac
dear lord can you hear me tell me what to say
to my unborn seed in case i pass away
will my child get to feel love
or are we all just cursed to be street thugs cause bein black hurts
livin my life as an outlaw what could be worse
cause maybe if i tried to change
who i'm kiddin i'ma thug 'til i die i'ma rider mayne
touch bases eat lunch at plush places
regular criminal oasis awaits us
if there's a ghetto for true thugs i'll see you there
and i'm sorry for not bein there
just know your daddy was a soldier me against the world
bless the boys and all my little girls
please take care of all my seeds to my unborn child
chorus repeat to fade
2pac over chorus
to my unborn child please take of all my kids
my unborn child to my unborn child
this letter goes out to to the seeds that i might not get to see
cause of this lifestyle
just know that your daddy loves you got nuttin but love for you
all i wanted was for you have a better life than i did
when you get to be my age you'll understand
just know i got love for you
and i'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven
cause ghetto heaven gotta be there haha take care
run wild but be smart
follow the rules of the game
i know that sometimes it's confusin
the rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day everyday
watch out for these snakes and fakes friends comin down the way
whas happenin
i'm writin you because shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
pretty much the same way right around the time when you got elected
aint nothin changed
all the promises you made before you got elected
they aint came true
2pac
tell me what to do these niggaz actin up in the hood
send mo' troops dear mr president
tell me what to do these niggaz actin up in the hood
send mo' troops
why should i lie when i can dramatize
niggaz fell victim to my lyrics now traumatized
simply by spittin i've been blessed given riches enemies suspicious
cause i'm seldom in the company of bitches
plus the concepts i depict so visual that you can kiss
each and every trick or bitch inside the shit i kick
my heaviest verse'll move a mountain
fuck the friendships i ride alone
destination death row finally found a home
plus all my homies wanna die call it euthanasia
dear lord look how sick this ghetto made us sincerely
yours i'm a thug the product of a broken home
everybody's doped up nigga what you smokin on
figure if we high they can train us
but then america fucked up and blamed up
i guess it's cause we black that we targets
in case you dont know i let my pump go
get ride for mutulu like i ride for geronimo
down to die for everything i represent
meant every word in my letter to the president
dear mr president tell me what to do
these niggaz actin up in the hood send mo' troops
what should i do
dear mr president tell me what to do
these niggaz actin up in the hood send mo' troops

cause yo i spend my nights out with the lights out
under the safety of darkness amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros ready to rode a starship
launch it leave a nigga flat for scratch the godless
i gotta get chips but you cant understand that
wanna ban rap stand back before you get hurt
it's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
on a mission listen more chips my goal and position
trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
muh'fuckers hate cops wait it aint gettin better
but you keep tellin us that it is
while your motherfuckin troops keep killin our kids dig
dont be surprised if you see us
dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us motherfucker
dear mr president tell me what to do
these niggaz actin up in the hood send mo' troops
dear mr president tell me what to do
kastro
strapped and angry with no hope and heartbroke
fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
it's hostile niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
and it aint no peace my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things squeakin on they beefs for weeks
mr president it's evident nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter twenty two with gray hair
so i'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
but y'all play fair give me and mine i'll share
til y'all show us you care it's gon be mayhem out here
me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
i'm still a nigga you fear bring the beast to his knees
and i've been born to represent for that i've been heaven sent
and i meant every word in my letter to the president

and way back used to rap on the block for loot

my family on welfare
i'm steady thinking since dont nobody else care
i'm out here on my own

verse 1
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
pray to my god everyday but he dont listen
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
listen i can hear her crying in the bedroom
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
am i wrong for wishing i was somewhere else
at 13 cant feed myself
can i blame daddy 'cause he left me
wish he would've helped me
on my own at a early age gettin paid
and i'm strapped so i'll never be afraid
where did i go astray i'm hanging in the back streets
running with g's and dope fiends will they jack me
cant turn back my eyes on the prize
i got nothing to lose
everybody gotta die
say good bye to the bad guy
that one you fucked when you passed by
tempured glass fly
do or die walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
chorus
i got nothing to lose
that's why i got gang related
got nothing to lose 5x

i thank the lord for my many blessings
though i'm stressin keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of the smith wesson
and all my niggas in the pen
here we go again

chorus
verse 3
aint no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
i'm startin to lose hope
mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke
sometimes i choke on the indo

it has no place in our society dan quayle
withdraw on this record dan quayle
that's how i feel i'm a do whatever i like i am not a role model
voice sample from star trek v
i couldnt help but notice your pain
my pain
it runs deep
share it with me
they'll never take me alive i'm gettin high with my four five
cocked on these suckas time to die
i was a fool all through high school kickin up dust
but now i'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame
smokin weed helped me take away the pain
so i'm hopeless rollin down the freeway swervin dont worry
i'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
maybe if they tried to understand me what should i do
i had to feed my fuckin family what else could i do
but be a thug
out slangin with the homies
got my mind on danger
never been a stranger to homicide
my cities full of gang bangers and drive bys
why do we die at an early age
he was so young
but still a victim of the 12 gauge
my memories of a corpse
mind full of sick thoughts
and i aint goin back to court
runnin from my enemies will i live to be 23
there's so much pain

you've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
we been gettin along fine just without you

so if you dont mind you can step the fuck off pops fuck you
2pac
had to play catch by myself what a sorry sight
a pitiful plight so i pray for a starry night
please send me a pops before puberty
the things i wouldnt do to see a piece of family unity
moms always work i barely see her
it's a wonder they dont understand kids today
so when i pray i pray i'll never grow to be that way
and i hope that he answers me
i heard god dont like ugly well take a look at my family
a different father every weekend
before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
i'm gettin sick of all the friendships
as soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
how can i be a man if there's no role model
i'm so sorry
chorus
i'm so sorry
for all this time i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time dont lie
i'm so sorry
for all this time so sorry

moms had to entertain many men
didnt wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
i'm gettin a bit older and i'm startin to be a bother
moms cant stand me cause i'm lookin like my father
should i stay or run away tell me the answer
moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
moms was tough cause his poppa wasnt man enough
instead of takin care of me he'd rather live lavishly
that's why i'll never be a father
unless you got the time it's a crime dont even bother
that's when i started hatin the phony smiles
said i was an only child
look at mama's lonely smile
it's hard for a son to see his mother cry
she only loves you but has to fuck with these other guys
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time so sorry
for all this time so sorry baby
2pac
moms was the only one there my pops was a no show
and ohh i guess ya didnt know
that i would grow to be so strong
lookin kinda pale was it the ale oh pops was wrong
where was the money that you said you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear you aint sincere hey who the hell cares
you think i'm blind but this time i see you comin jack
ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
left her in the dark she fell apart from a broken heart
so dont even start with that wanna be your father shit
dont even bother with your dollars i dont need it
i'll bury moms like you left me all alone g
now that that i finally found you stay the fuck away from me
you're so sorry
chorus

tupac impersonating his father

crossed too many people every house i'd touch was haunted
if i was to keep you breathin had to be out of range a
had to move one to lost my name and pick the number
made me watch my back i had no happy home to run to
maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
but livin slow mean half the dough and you wont get no ass
hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
i wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
it took a little longer than i thought
i slipped got caught and sent to jail by the courts
all i ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
i'm so sorry

i wanna tell mom but would she listen
she's bound to be bitchin if she hasnt got a fix in
so now i lay me down to sleep

the thought of pregnancy is in my head and now i'm fearing it
i gotta tell mom before she sees me
i told her how he g'd me and she didnt believe me
callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
i cant believe the way you call it
gotta believe in him and dissin her own daughter
time for me to break and find another
that's when i discovered
the ways of the days of a part time mutha
i got a part time

she's a part time mutha

pat myself on the back and move on
cuz she came back with the kid and yo

brenda's got a baby
brenda's got a baby
well brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
that's not her problem that's up ta brenda's family
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
junky
went in debt to his arms it's sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
but oh that's a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
she's 12 years old and she's having a baby
in love with tha molester whos sexed and crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together
whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo she had it on tha
bathroom floor
and didnt know so she didnt know what ta throw away and
what ta keep
i guess she thought she'd get away
wouldnt hear tha cries
she didnt realize
how much tha tha little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts ta hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away
momma say you makin me lose pay tha social workers here
everyday
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now what's next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
it's payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brenda's her name she's got a baby
baaaaaaaaby
dont you know she's got a baby
dont you know she's got a baby
dont you know she's got a baby
dont you know she's got a baby

come on come on
is life worth living should i blast myself
i'm tired of bein poor even worse i'm black
my stomach hurts so i'm lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
first ship 'em dope let 'em deal the brothers
give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
2 shots in the dark now huey's dead
i got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other
we gotta start makin changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if he's close to me
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed and that's the way it is
come on come on
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah
repeat
2
i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
one better place let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white is smokin crack tonight
and only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
and although it seems heaven sent
we aint ready to see a black president uhh
it aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game
now tell me what's a mother to do
bein real dont appeal to the brother in you
you gotta operate the easy way
i made a g today but you made it in a sleazy way
sellin crack to the kid i gotta get paid
well hey well that's the way it is
bridge
talking
it's time for us as a people to start makin some changes
let's change the way we eat let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasnt working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do to survive
3
and still i see no changes cant a brother get a little peace
it's war on the streets the war in the middle east
instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
and i aint never did a crime i aint have to do
but now i'm back with the blacks givin it back to you
dont let 'em jack you up back you up
crack you up and pimp slap you up
you gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone

i'm runnin up the block in the dark with less spark
survalience on a nigga every day
waitin on my daddy just to take his ass away

so now a young niggas bein raised by the streets

one black and one of chrome
now i dont wanna hurt nobody but i must defend mine
it's all the fuck i got
so stop and walk a thin line
young niggas be brave
from the cradle to the grave
chorus
from the cradle to the grave life aint never been easy
living in the ghetto
from the cradle to the grave i'm glad to say
i made it this far
many g's died hard
and all they got was their name here up on a wall
it's sad thinkin about the times
as the warzone i got no home
dont have no friends neither
it's just me by my lonely so i married my nina
i keeps her wherever i go
i love my ho
never leave home with out my sugar
i'm hafta plug a nigga
mama told me not to trust no punks
and kick his ass if he lay a hand on me
sometimes i think my own self stupid
cause i stay shootin at marks
get twisted up in police reports
since the cradle i've been ungreatful
my first toy was a gun
i got sprung and learn to love weapons
but now i'm through with money
and through with street fame
somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave
from the cradle to the grave life aint never been easy
living in the ghetto
from the cradle to the grave life aint never been easy
living in the ghetto
march 18th
a rainy day my mama gave birth
to a baby boy trapped in hell on earth
from day one it wasnt fun i never had a crumb
daddy worked two jobs and mama wont stop drinkin rum
but my family's broke
and my pocket's short
so now i gotta sling dope
in a game filled with pain it's a fuckin shame

always in the spot with my glock slingin rocks at the rocks
shit dont stop i'm steady dodgin cops
i never flip flop

sittin on my bunk reminiscing about the good times
it's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt
but from the cradle to the grave i'ma put in work
chorus
from the cradle to the grave life aint never been easy
living in the ghetto
from the cradle to the grave life aint never been easyy

verse one 2pac
when i was young me and my mama had beef
though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mama's place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddy's the same drama
when things went wrong we'd blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
and who'd think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police that's right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand
for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed
there's no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand

now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rent's due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough you're alone
you're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three 2pac
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
it's a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

not waitin on the bus but waitin on the cash flow

girl steps to me and pushes issue
that knot you got is that money or tissue

pete nice
never had a wasted mind had the time
the flows i knows puts the papers in pockets
swings of things observed in my sockets
in ten spot i got stacks of lp wax
couderoy slacks loops and sales tax
on the racks but my label is derelict
spic n span i slam it's balls you lick
ill missions but doin us aint even simple
stereotype the rhymer as a criminal
subliminal i put a noose on the necks

mc serch
smooth set up so slick
as i set to move all the great masses
asses bounce to track that is all in
i'm droppin my quarter i'm placin my call in
to my crew that's down with the street trends
play around and you'll fall off the deep end
i heard your hooker she likes to do knee bends
and they called three friends and i called three friends
and so on and so on and so on
so go on my path and try to follow
but not step for step cause i like to sidestep
you'll get swept like a broom and you'll make room for daddy
white boy in new york and i cant get a cab g
so take me to my rest so i guess i'll get wrecked
cause i'm a derelict of dialect

dialect spoken in sectional lesson
the less you know the more you gotta guess on
i press on point some sweat my jizznoint
playin themselves with the fingers the point
i speak slow i carry a fat stick
get your kneepads and reapply your chapstick
step to this as the derelict reanimates
no jim hat as my mouth ejaculates
i stays mumble i speaks jumble
retroactive my knot scale is tipped off
i rip the head off the derelict stepped off
and left to show this to those who typecast
ill the rhyme ass trickster or outcast
of intellect i wreck shit with my own sect
the ace in the hole i'm the derelict of dialect

mc serch
3rd bass but not a bass for slidin
in motion goin in fluid
who did you just distrust it's serch and i crush this
mental need for oppression
oppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion
lesson or loss enforce those in
a spot who got your head frozen
defrost the eye and spy on the serpent
on act two he tried to close curtain
but intermission i glimpsed and i clock more

individuals who are never satisfied with the static standards
set by the masses the masses have always been lethargic
they have always opposed greatness for it is beyond them
to even comprehend greatness
you do not dig them so you say
try them try them and you may
try them and you may i say
pete nice
significant you never beat one two one two semblence
since i aint supposed no boastin
i'm keepin soaps in my mouth like coke stem
for the silence of the swine sittin slick on my slim chews
liquor on the lamp sippin booze as a cow moves
lose my head over speak of a censor
morse code but three had no family credenza
friends of mine align swine on the backstab
grabbin greedy now it's rikers or rehab
misdirected like charlie babbitt mixed up
three fifths three fifths like this
he used to roll a man with three fifths a man without his soul
so is this equal or blowin up your ass
smoke sticks who got your vote and rather slit your throat
try them bacon souflee
no i aint gonna eat none of that
try them bacon souflee
no i aint gonna eat none of that
no i aint gonna eat none of that
try them
mc serch

but they keep edgin to my plate i step back and say
thanks cause i just ate not that i would eat it
even if i was hungry all the ills of the streets
that could have done me in i stay clear of all the evil all the envy
and ex homeboys who used to be friendly
so heed the word heed the word of my foot up your ass
kickin a bone out castin a stone out
makin water ripple but got nothin the middle
so now you sit there makin big waves
talkin about my ancestors used to be from caves
it's time to wake up bake the cake and turn the page
for now is the birth the birth of the mind age
we you and me all in a new time zone
and give you somethin much better to dine on
no i aint gonna eat none of that
try them bacon souflee

attend to your owns or you're blown to bits
you're eatin green eggs while i'm swallowin the grits

like a 40 ounce the choice is constitutional solutions
arrest in domes of ignorannce full
i'm dickin down swine i stick my neck out
give a slap here and shorty'll put your head out
five g's explicitly you see the story tells

mc serch
freedom of speech that is spoken in loose lips
to those who appreciate large tips tippin the scale
slum is in favor of the man who cant stand the live flavor
bob's a jerk and he worked for the ex friend
not x clan but wax get taxed even if it's bland
branded for educated street credentials
and cant talk about life's bare essentials
but wont give you a chance or even a place to buy it
cry for freedom but music's not free it's choking
could never could ever could say what needs to be spoken
put this out before i depart
before i hit the killdrews he started with the arts
i got much much better things to do with my time
than to worry about the green eggs and swine try them
the green eggs and swine
much much better things to do with my time
the green eggs the green eggs and the swine
bacon souflee

unveling a truth with proof of all facts
cause in my life i see the life of many others
various shades of colors sisters brothers
and once my soul leaves my bodily shell

and stray from the tyranny while blood is drippin b
i aint no flapjack dont bother flippin me
i stick to this so say this while you're grazin
original mans a black man said by a caucasian
watchin a culture be stolen from asia
whether minor or major science i swayed y'all
with lingo some people dont think so
when do you stop sayin that's the way things go
the companies are frontin pete why dont they divest
and invest in freedom but they scheme on a brother
stealin trunk jewelry that's miles undercover
so discover as a people we have to take our place
there is no master plan because there is no master race
no ghetto no master race 3x
let both sides unite in peace
pete nice
science for seasons years and days
off the evils of men love bones and flesh
a brother's keeper keeps puttin peace to rest
question props and the prophets agreed ya heed
dust to dust herbs yieldin seeds of
creation of cultures to street sound
you get run around but i run the booty down
no master plan the masses all struggle
slug movements bungle our serpent is subtle
hatred born in diversity of culture spoke
change up wisdom wise and stick to tools
one called slavemaster's son by a poor fool
i aint the hypocrite fit with the two face
there's no master plan there's no master race
no ghetto no master race 3x
let both sides unite in peace
mc serch
the creators creations are put to side
you see one wants greed and then slide
and keep the truth away from the blind
you gotta find out who is who and who built this place
i play spy and try to destroy the race
we go the wrong way the wrong play master
the same people that got the gas face last year
tears shed as another head gets put to bed
paradise is a paradox the devils ridin sleds
over skulls that dulls all the truth
it's the reason why we need to raise the roof
we stand to help the birth of just one man
the master's plan the master's race shackled to a shelf
in a book that you need to find for yourself
i stand accused but never abuse the sunday
cause when i'm gone i'll only go one way
no ghetto no master race 3x
let both sides unite in peace
pete nice
i aint a master no i'm not superior
fears in hearts of the ignorant belligerents
ever since those convinced of lost innocence
got off the tip slippin sticks and stones
homes are broken or fractured like bones
who holds your soul as the master your dollar spent
evidence of dictators gone hellbent
in times of old the races vicked power many places
seperate races in segregated spaces
back in the day you turned your backs on
sold more then sold forth from south to north
swingin low on supremacy's corpse
of course not steppin out of place is in place
question those on the question of race
no ghetto no master race 3x
let both sides unite in peace
both sides begin anew the quest for peace
no ghetto no master race 3x
let both sides unite in peace
both sides begin anew the quest for peace
both sides begin anew the quest for peace
both sides begin anew the quest for peace
no static at alllllll

why'd ya run through the doors some left open
ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
i got pub and i'ma nut like a scud see
blowin up like i'm throwin up a beef patty
sell outs run a bout like the measles
no cures cause pop goes the weasels
today i'm prepared to bring specific charges
against certain members working in an industry
that reaches into every household in the country
pete nice
hoods is up so skills is up
it's a stick up so why'd you interrupt
so such bust material cerebral
i'm eatin cereal with spoons sippin cepacol
daddy o slipped me some cause my breath stank
think tanks once rolled on the city streets
i used to meet your moms between the sheets
universe is versus hoods prospectus
true flam flammin words on wax discus
so they dismiss this as vulgarity
and once laughed and pointed at the university
some perk without skills and push a pen
i send surreal scenes where you never been
looked out gave you three strikes you struck out
blew your blunts out you wings stuck up your ass
gassed you up then slap you with my staff
i seen your skins like to go to the motels
but your ass wont know to the hotels
cause a lip is zipped i paint pictures
a portrait a self far from
my discussion of impression aint ignorance
so dont label the hoods on appearances
you never thought that a gangsta could talk sense
took your papes out your pocket and just stood out
the focus the portrait of the artist as a hoods upmc serch
portrait planned it back in the days
young strays posted at the lq on friday's
waitin for dice to give the go ahead
hawkin 50 cent puttin heads to bed
for a herringbone hear the tune of the audio two
milk was chillin as i chilled in the back room
listen to snaps cuts by scoob and scrap
torn up by the kent the clark dark
as the brothers try to spark
we knocked boots and the boots got knocked
three am and it was off to the rooftop
hip hop starski the masters of ceremony
ka ka cracked out was hookin property
five am it was the ss
a hundred and forty fifth street down on lennox
starchild made all the hoes squeal
whippin home in the sunshine fun time
but now you cant find
clubs like this that kept the music in the street
and pop rap couldnt get a dime to eat
yo they're makin mills but what about the hood
a parking lot where the latin quarter stood
a landmark marked in the cranium

hooligans and street urchins lurkin
doin hoods a neighborhood's worst person
raises and the pushers and perverts
butchers cut like cold cuts the mind works
wise or weak on the weary and the wicked
plagues a city street swell in evil fitted
man verse man the haves against have nots
precedence of decadence is put out
scramble hands full of merchandise he got out
tooken taken a picture of figured strife
subsisting on the minimal fruits of life
attitudes are skewed from the right pile
introduction of a character problem child
problem that i cant fix 8x
mc serch
kids makin bids cause they're products so what
no such luck in the scam to make paper
skiddin off the edge ya portrays a faker
fakin the plans like the plans of mice and men
lands a man a chance of one to ten
but the man aint enough to legally drink
and guess what punk your shit still stink
now you perp the role the role of frank nitti
he aint a hero cause he landed on the roof of a chevy
so play the life of untouchable
the criminal times but time rollin in reverse
i wanted to be older before i saw a hearse
take the weight off my boys who are buckwild
the life and death and times of a problem child
problem that i cant fix 8xpete nice
problems problems of the prodigal
end up on the page of periodicals
a pinnacle mess movin blocks to sell blocks
under locks and keys no g's clocked
in the pen playin foul and third rate
take a step back and meet your maker
see play your maytag statistic on paper
philosophy not of a giver he's a taker
later words turn to dust he's the traitor
sells you out for a quick fix dime drops
got a chip on his shoulder without props
a bad seed leads himself the stray way
puttin off evidence of judgment day
the life and death and times of a problem child
problem that i cant fix 8x
mc serch
i step careful into the next frame
lame you're just a stunt playin a sex game
i start to wink you think he's on your hightail
frail you're shallow as you swallow up your bare sale
tail stickin out like a bumper to a maxima
taxin a brother for a fee to get sex in a wetbed
begin to get slim as he's sexin you in
he moves deeper asleep is what you thought he was
but he went bolo so low you felt and that's because
the minute he got in and violated you and became ill
treated you just like a flush'nfill
the next crisis you're ice is clearin off your mind
cause you're playin life from the cd of behind
time to wake up cant you see that you're robbin wild
file this style as another of the problem child
alright coming up now another request this one
this time from the boys down at anna's pizza paradise
a new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues
verse one pete nice prime minister
in the heart of the city you was born and bred
you grew up smart or you wound up dead
things moved fast but you knew the scoop
and your savior was a rhyme and a beat and a rap group
a modern day production of the city street
so the sleeper did sleep but the sleeper shoulda woke up
now you're in my sight the buddha sess you smoke up
that's the element you carry your rhymes on
that style of rhyme wont let you live long
cause a strong song to you is what i sent
cause i'm a product of the environment
chorus
there it is black and white 2x
verse two mc serch
seagram boulevard b 17
redfern houses where no mc would ever go
is where i did my very first show
had the crowd had the rhymes going i never fess
his reward was almost a bullet in his chest
and on that stage is where i first learned
stick out my chest to be a kid and get burned
you're so foolish but i think you knew this
that on the the microphone punk i can do this
cause i'm a product of the environment
chorus
verse three mc serch pete nice
back in the days when kids were mack daddies
striped lee jeans playboys and caddies
long beach the mok center
he almost caught a bad one when he tried to enter
our way
bang
then scatter onto the dance floor
me and my boys skeezin the cuties
never had static cuz everybody knew me
local dj's tearin up the wax
and out the corner some kid gets taxed
after the party crack open a forty
vicked it from the store yo the man never caught me
went up to the arcade cranked the bass
and then the five oh chased us from the place
everywhere i went i always tucked a
marker in my jacket to tag where i went
cause we were just products of the environment
chorus
verse four mc serch pete nice
i wanna tell you something that gets me kind of mad
it's about my dear old dad
he's tired and worn and works a nine to five
clockin thirty g's a year to survive
make that money sellin ya yo
pushin a drug i cant understand
destroyin a life with a buck in the hand
play rotten slum chain local street hero
but if you ask serch you're just a bunch of zeroes
too bad cause when you're older you wont have a cent
cause you're a product of the environment
chorus
verse five pete nice
now you know how i was livin
it happened to me like it happened to serch
prime minister pete nice'll kick the verse
in bed stuy with my boy kiwai height
the k to a kingston wednesday night
to the empire show slammin
open for dana crew flammin
mouth open wide or listening
dumb dope with a forty in my system
cause of talent no shade or nothin else
a time of tension racially fenced in
i came off and all the brothers blessed him
i left more than a mark i left a dent
cause i'm a product of the environment
outro kmd and serch
aiyyo serch skin is just a color of the mind and the soul
and a brother aint a brother if his heart is cold youknwhati'msayin fellas
word
word up man nubians killin nubians brothers just dont understand
word maybe it's some of that crime that's stoppin the growin
the drug pollution and all needs to calm down
word man cause that's what we need we need griff productions
we need a kmd man to uplift the race and bring kause in the beginning
and a posse called get yours
there it is to all y'all bigots who want us to bend

straight to eighty eight to the curves of the 90's
i'm universal i set a line free
behind me the three the hard way the jackpot
awaitin satans tryin to take cheap shots

the brothers round the way sit down and say

anticipate like a bottle of heinz ketchup

pete nice skims over lyrics i pick em
strong and long you're wrong i stick em

lyrics to the am but the house needs a swinger

how you livin hobbes
now groove into the am the master spoon feedin

pete nice
i slide swiftly keep a brother steppin
loungin strength in my throat
sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
slow and smooth flowin like fluid
the mass did worship the lyrics the three did
amid all crisis drop it like a guillotine
you're moist fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
scene is zipped pete nice is your worst dream
fulfilled your illed i thrilled i heard a loud scream
my mind is cued so i run down a menu
that downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
the needs of a shaker sweatin to the point of exhaust
blinded by the science my mind starts flexin
sexin down females to the am perplexin
a complex reflex you wonder if we slumber
the three dont sleep aiyyo pete nice take em under
steppin to the am i'm steppin to the mic
to snatch up and smash up the club until daylight
two for the time repeat 2x

kicks out the benzi in a frenzy it sends me
up the bronx river back to brooklyn apprehends me
like a d tech bustin my man in the projects
prejudicial your style artificial

fuckin dominicans turned around and gave 'em more bricks
chorus
that first verse is just a dose of the shit that i'm on
consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's quran
and prince and rightous from hillside with the mole on his nose

gamble all the time like country curly head prince and tata
po po under pressure too they know what they facin
go against crews like b bo and killers like patty mason
a lotta niggas i know been corrupted since birth
enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
together niggas stand and divided they fall
round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like ocean
lord knows tommy had loved and sold
helicopters rolls royces with louie vatonne interior
might sound like i'm fantasizin but son i'm dead serious
montanna was no dummy brought benice to watch the money
had money out the ass he politic like the asian
feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
yo rest in peace to rich and ron money what they was about yo
the twins was some queens but got crazy cream with alpo
throughout my time i heard tales of himey
frenchy jamaican pauly ducky cally
rodney bump and chick shit
a lot a niggas flow the way i flow
but aint been in the game all their life so dont know who i know
writin rhymes is the best way i express how i feel

and if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
i'm forgettin lefty and jazz pretty tony and lance
head lou mel son troy and e money bags
and a conversation over shrimp and lobster

listen if you let me i'll be the reason you shine
its a secret i want the world to know that you're mine
but on some real shit communications could be better
so i'm writin a song instead of a love letter
they can play it on the radio a hundred times a day
i figure when you hear it you would stop and think of me
i wanna get to know ya and be the reason you smile
girl you know where i'm from you know how i get down
not rap i mean me that i'm special
you know they say diamonds are a girls best friend
precious stones could you put me before them
if so i'll see to it that they always around
nothin but the best now how does that sound
if i drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
girl you on my mind all the time its a secret

if you ready to ride girl come on let's roll

we can shop a lil bit i pick out my shit
one pair at a time till your shoe games sick
now who knows what the future holds we'll be together probably
for better or worst like whitney and bobby
if you wanna play house we can play house then
but wait why pretend if you can move in
before i be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
girl its more than lust i want your trust
you keep it real with me i'll keep it real with you
chorus x2 jamie foxxx
baby i'll build you up
girl if i never show i have you by my side

after hours it was cool x8
q tip
ten after one i think i'll hop the horse
downtown late of three of course
just came from fishing couldnt get a catch
a whitened sandwich and a guiness stout
but with the bail though i had a bout
so i exchanged it for some apple juice
i had the blues but i shook them loose
a jeep is blasting from the urban streets
loots of funk over hardcore beats
the moon dabbles in the morning sky
as the minutes just creep on by
i get a thought and hear comes my tribe
like always the quest begins
in the mist though but the rhyth's move in
we find a spot and we sit and chat
speaking on the status quo of rap
a derelick makes a real long speach
we pay attention to the words he read
when he was done we rattled on
there was no lunch because it wasnt dawn
we pointed things out about this times
inflation of the nation it bothers me
i better go gold to pay the taxes
gotta be swift society
the man whose made is the man who maxes
the grounds for living are being discussed
as we go it gets close to dusk
gather thoughts and savor breath
cause there's only a few hours left
chorus
q tip
me ohh my hey hey hey hey
the human hours are here to stay
this is how it seems my witness
bug out all night ask phife he's with this
girls be screaming on this conversation
i have my two cents for a revelation
and my watch continuously tic tocs
shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
a car revs up and i hear it trottle
it probably moves with the morning wind
ohh my god here's phife again
talking about last nights game
trying to remember someone's name
so hear the frogs dancing in the streets
once again ali will bring up the beat
like this
sounds of frogs
the beat is over and so is the night
the sun is risen and the shine is bright
we all say peace and go our separate ways
youth is fading as we gain our days
expedition for the song is simp'
the hours creep excuse me i mean limp
as we go you hear a gasp of laugh
as we start up our rhythmic path
like this
intro phife and tip

lookin all around

whispered in your ear a ghetto star
lookin at my lips take a taste
taste yours too rub your back
run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
moonlight dancin inside of your eyes
close your legs i start to sigh
now i reach down to unlace my nikes
kick off your adidas 'cause that's what you like
chris tucker joke passed inside of my head
put the thought away think of you instead
roll down the window the breeze in your hair
your earrings shake you a baby doll

comafied your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo he's acting stank really on a regal
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much

verse one phife dawg
1988 senior year garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
loungin with the tipster coolin with sha
scopin out the honeys they know who they are
i was the b ball playin fly rhyme sayin
fly girl gettin but never was i sweatin
cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match her name was flo
all the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
cause i thought it was me like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playin with my mind
the only thing i learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d i need somebody for me
not someone who's mind is blank and tryin to juice me for my bank
swingin with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that yo hows about a smack
but now it seems i met my match
was a stone cold lover you couldnt tell me jack
settlin down with one girl wasnt tryin to hear that
i had tonya tamika sharon karen
tina stacy julie tracy
used ta love 'em leave 'em skeeze 'em tease 'em
find 'em lose 'em also abuse 'em
my whole attitude was new day next hon
and believe it or not they all got done
and i'm all true man like alexander o'neal
is this really love then again how would i know
after all this time tryin to be a superhoe
she finally played me but yo i'd find another
cause i got the crazy game and yo i'm smooth like butter
chorus q tip

these girls dont know me from jack yet i feel like the mack
you didnt want me then so hon dont want me now
here here take the towel wipe off your brow
and take the ccontact out your eye you're far from lookin fly
you get an e for effort and t for nice try
slum village gold still danglin in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sportin a rope
four finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror didnt know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really loved yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real i wouldnt have dissed ya
but since it was bought i had to dismiss ya
if you cant extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you cant braid it best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me diane made it
if you were you and just you talk to you maybe
but i cant stand no bionic lady
tryin hard to look fly but yo you're lookin dumber
if i wanted someone like you i woulda swung with jamie summers
you wanna be treated right see father mc

comprehend to the track for it's why cuz
gettin measures on the tip of the vibers

chorus
chorus george clinton from funkadelic's let's take it to the people
everthing is fair when you're livin in the city 8x
q tip
lookin at miss lane it was the fast lane
barely knows her name struck by fame
gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
rollin down the block checkin out the spots
she winks at the cops always give her props
she knows she's the woman cant nobody touch her
hangs out for the loot makes her papes from the gutter
tried to make my moves on miss lane she called me young boy
told her not to dis me i just want to be your love toy
you young boy my love toy i doubt that very highly
just because you rhyme dont mean i'll let you try me
always sweet scented if it's business she meant it
distractions never hurt always did the work
always was alert she never got jerked
queen of the feats thrive to compete
love the funky beats while she drive down the street
she was justified couldnt get a job
had to feed her family so she had to play then rob
pullin out the ooh wop listenin to doo wop
you dont have to say a word
chorus 4x
she's not a big kahuna wish i met her sooner
instead i met her later my love is much greater
put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
and to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
love is my motive now i'm drug promotive
plus i needed duckets to fill up my buckets
supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
now i'm missing action for this fatal attraction
and dont you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
cuz if you play me out i think i'll let ya be
i'll be damned if i let a brotha try to gas me
i played my cards well try to live swell
for the g i would sell cuz i was deep in hell
but then i really wasnt she had a fly cousin
who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
elaine she kinda new that i would do the do
but she didnt tear i did my work with care
as long as she was paid she was in the shade
you cant really blame her for holdin on a flamer
society taught her but they didnt tame her
a ten clip salute hunny heres a troop
she will never stop until she reach the top
top top
vocal interludes sampled from time is running out by the last poets
q tip
back in the days when i was a teenager
you could find the abstract listening to hip hop
my pops used to say it reminded him of be bop
i said well daddy dont you know that things go in cycles
the way that bobby brown is just ampin like michael
its all expected things are for the lookin
if you got the money quest is for the bookin
come on everybody let's get with the fly modes
still got room on the truck load the back boom
listen to the rhyme to get a mental picture
why do i say that cuz i gotta speak the truth man
doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
planted on the ground the act is so together
bonafied strong you need leverage to sever
the unit yes the unit yes the unit called the jazz is
deliberatley cheered lp filled with streeet goods
you can find it on the rack in your record store store
if you get the record then your thoughts are adored
and appreciated cause we're ever so glad we made it
dishin out the plastic do the dance till you spastic
if you dis it gets drastic
listen to the rhymes cuz its time to make gravy
if it moves your booty then shake shake it baby
all the way to africa aka the motherland uh
stick out the left then i'll ask for the other hand
that's the right hand black man man
only if you was noted as my man man
if i get the credit then i'll think i deserve it
get in the zone of positivity not negativity
cuz we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up what's in that ass what
a pair of nikes size ten and a half come on come on
chorus
we gotta make moves
never ever ever could we fake moves come on come on 4x
time time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an average of nothingness
time is an inanimate object
praying and praying and praying for
time is dancing moving lingering all memories of past
the last poets
you gotta be a winner all the time
cant fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest is on the rise
that continually i pop my zulu
if you dont like it get off the zulu tip
so what could you do in the times which exist
you cant fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a bitch brother is a jerk
leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in today's society
everything is fair at least that how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next
especially if you rhyme you have to live by the pen
your man is your man then treat him like your friend
all it is is the code of the streets
so listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats
beats that are hard beats that are funky

as we start trudgin me and my brothers we be lookin and be buggin
vehicles of life they be rollin and be mergin
searchin for the virgins of life
that be shovin out the door that's crack
the valleys of time are always on my feet
as least the beat will combine
the calluses and corns with the funky bassline
you dont need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
footin up and down like a unlv rebel
the answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics
cant be too much flackin not too much packin
you must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact
the rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
this aint rock 'n roll cos the rap is in control
if you're a megastar worth will buy you a car
i'd rather go barefootin for prints i will be puttin
now that we are in it footprints are bein printed
so fi you recognise em you can try to size em
they'll probably be the ones with the size not fryin
all over reveal you wont have to yield
if you want protection you can hide behind the shield
q tip
you can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
but we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block
hand in hand 'cross the land as muhammad cross the fade
it's a art theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
the mind will unwind it will soft to beyond
catch the track track by track get a map to track a trail
you will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
see the levels peakin as the rhythms keep a screechin
a quest oh yes a quest inside the jam i will keep preachin
the point oh yes the point because it's close but yet so far
the loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star
we are bulgin i'm indulgin in a rat a tat tat
keep it wild wide and deep you could dig it in a jeep
but dig it in the ground because the foot print now
q tip
if there's a storm that's brewin it wont keep us from doin
our thing as we start swingin travellin is bringin
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roamrome
a chair is not a chair a house is not a home
because my skin is brown yo i'm gonna do the town
rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
sing a song o' sixpence sing it like a singer
a nubian a nubian a proud one at that
remember me the brother who said black is black
you can come by request i dont play i dont dress
get emotions off your chest we are black we the best
makin moves makin motions flowin like an ocean
the walkin will continue we know that we will bring you
the times that you have waited more anticipated
be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong
drifting drifting drifting drifting by totally drifting
byjusttotally drifting byjusttotally
q tip
the deadly venom let me start from the beginning
we always hittin so yo there'll be no extra innings
as i send the mic out the park like reggie jackson
you be the minor leaguer who sees no action
the coming attractionwhat
the main feature
lurking all up in the dark unknown parts
the brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start
and that's me akki as long as the ladies move they bodies
we'll have a four on two stand
cuz that happens to be the nature of man
sexuality it is the format baby
aint no ifs no buts no ands or maybes
but i praise lord in the worlds that's unseen
respect me for that and let me do my thingjust
chorus
drifting byyou know we gotta get a hold
totally over the illest drum rolls
totally drifting by just
yo how you doin let me give you an intro
my name's the abstract now let me give you some info
got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
that makes the hardcore mcs resort to being bitch
and i dont give a shit about being wild rich
your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
down to his zealots upchuck and then spit
denouncin my beliefs well then your wig get split
lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit
you can take these words and relay it to your click
take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
the tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit
like the fourth of july on some firework shit
my record company be on some true jerk shit
and i'ma make it happen for my whole outfit
chorus
drifting byyou know we got to get control
totallyover the illest drum rolls
totally drifting by justthird verse
a yo we just gettin started
got to redirect this vision
got the beauty of a flower
plus dimensions like a prism
y'all really need to go lay down
cuz positivity has risen
we hittin
yo bust how we too strong to be broken
occasional malfunction pressure time
we aint jokin
for security we on this run like logan
kamaals doin the hustle
and you backstage voguin
dont ever try to think that you perfect
we all are human beings
there's bullshit at the surface
sometimes i mean we rhyme
damn we aint prophets
and if you think so you need to stop it
so jump back inside your shell
let your million dollar thoughts propel
but next man dont get jel
that we dont need
we slim with disabilities and
thick with possibilities
cuz then you cant move with fertility
navigatin with good visibility
we put these tunes out in record shop facilities
let's strive to get this constant money activity
we try to stay on the scene like fidel
so if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
yo watch we movin through with plan a
money market doin things the right way
chorus
totallyyou know we got to get control

he threw a trip on the ace now he's out son
hits the local bodega to woof down a hero
son is on a 'midnight run like de niro
spots the shorty rock standin on his block
conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
increased intensity his dance sure was a fly one
took her to the crib there she ran her gibs
about mind upliftment and bein positive
he yawned and he sighed til 105
then he finally realized that hunny wasnt live
at least he didnt plan on buildin for the evenin
threw the fila on the dome and said 'come on yo we leavin
came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
aww shhhyou know the transaction
brothas gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
comin down the block man loud as fuck
you would swear redman was inside the trunk
as the night seemed darker cops is on a hunt

is peace prosperity and a little paper
objects that seem greater
but i'm sure well over come when we illin on a drum
repeat x2
verse one q tip
we in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
y'all can be my witnesses
that a fella fascination with money has grown
to the point that he will shit on his own
a piece of paper makin niggaz get dramatic
but the money doesnt come automatic
gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
we got to get it yall in an orderly fashion
some cats go about it with too much passion
we got to mediate our greedy levels
cuz the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
gotta recognize it realize the power
that this little ma huckin piece of paper will devour
see i'ma do my thing and see how much i can scrape
yo i'd rather have respect than money no doubt
but listen to me y'all i want the mass amount
that the sesame street dracula cant count
so that i can give my people when that thing surmounts
to higher levels of being so when i'm mc ing
i hope to see you there steady g ing say word
but the only way we can truly reach that goal
is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
chorus
verse two phife
here comes your royal highness one of queens finest
believe me honest you know you cant stop it
come on son never leave your mic round me
true mc for real ask my man shaheed
strictly focused on what im in this rap game for
not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
with all that aids stuff going round
rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
now dont get me wrong i love honeys galore
but see hip hop's my bread butter
cause that's what i get paid for
see this is what i wanted
allah helped me to get it
and if the beat is wicked
you know malik will rip it
from the bottom of my heart
the love for breakdancing
my love for the art
and with this love i do hip hop from the soul
a real mc who never sweats how many copies are sold
yeah i want to go gold platinum uh huh etceteras
but why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya
im staying true nuff respect to those that paved the way
from bambaata down to shah that be my dj
with out my peeps i dont know how the hell id make it word
one love for the lendin hand and giving all your help
believing in me when i didnt believe in my own self
the abstract with whom im always making rugged tunes
kid hood restin in heaven i hope to see you soon
i keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
big mu and shah one day i'll take my shahada

the clock is always tickin the systems should be kickin
like ham and eggs i eat chicken chicken chicken
should i release the lever the lever of the clever
embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour
the wraughts of the rap filling up the gap
with the smash of a hand and a little toe tap
the boom the bip the boom bip
indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
phonies start to crumble funky rhythm rumbles
it's the nitty gritty my time is itty bitty
so i kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
this aint trial and error more like tribe and error
constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
the street cant depart from the bloody heart
repair the wear and tear dont start 'fore it starts
wont be gone for long listen to the song
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is
chorus
marchin off the project we hope that you will subject
it's good to be an object and never ever reject
the tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda
keep it in boom and never will we slander
should be handed dont let me demand it
money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
control it then recluse it follow you wont lose it
mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
although she's flippin crazy give my love to gracy
the pigs are wearin blue and in a year or two
we'll be goin up the creek in a great big canoe
what we gonna do save me and my brothers
hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
never will we do that and we aint tryin to rule that
we just want a slab of the ham dont you know black
this society of fake reality

tear down the rafters venerials couldnt clap us
jane doe
the church of scientology feminine biology
manic depressive psychologically add alive and we
polluted by technology the fumes and its ecology
while your thought you was out of copy i get nastier than sodomy
probably an oddesey started back on robbery
was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
regarded as a prodigy leery in sociology
let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
never makin no apology worshippin my anthropology
fuck modesty studyin microbiology
causin verbal lobotomy it's in my geneology
six months of sobriety movin very methodically
like a unicorn more ways than oceanography
guard technology rip shows antibiotically
true thugs bionically give birth to criminology
words
yo as a youngin i swear to god you couldnt tell me nothin
for girls with the church slacks with some shirts tucked in
i set it up for money my mom worked when i was cuttin
unsigned strugglin for the heat i lit the oven

before i met rob i was in the clubs frontin
oh yeah i know the tip when i see him i be duckin
but now when i'm clubbin those that used to dis were buggin
overweight chicks spandex they stomachs sucked in
stay interruptin dance and try to cut in
q tip
we never get concerned about who's in the league
we just stay workin so no one will need
an unconcerned outsider givin niggaz feed
my niggaz puff weed but negotiate the seed
the family is granite and you cant intercede
i try to switch lanes at this operatin speed
cats in the game be gamblin with greed
we the house you the player and we gonna catch these
poker face creed while my mind just read
shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
that's insignificant but this take heed
mos def
they say i'm pretty like clay is bright like the day is
beats from my fleet be sweet like sugar ray is
i'm swingin this from bay ridge to where the oakland bay is
my game is tough to play i'm tough to weigh like your safe is
the aim is to make you recognize what the name is
the place with the great superiginate the flavors
an all star block with some all star laymans
turn the music down this is probably some haters
achin cuz they hear us rotatin on the playlist
gtfrom b boy laces to detroit gators

it seems cats now a days we gettin introduced to courage
dont get discouraged 'cause my words will threw her like flourish
we got the bounty
we from the queens county
overlookin things like a rushmore mounty
and got no other choice except to get a little love
we rise above
thr pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
we have no other boy but to bring the b boy
there's nothin on this erb that can end still fear
the locomive puttin my thing in gear
i only have the fear of god and that's taqwa
you need binaca
your trap is blazing like blanca
i got the lethal you couldnt put a match to it
let me know yo we could do it like stu it
when the big one not to be super seeded
responsibility is somethin i cant deny
the illegallies is narcist reply
most cats scrambled to do 'cause they want to
but on the kick rising in the past on in prompt to
my lily's hot like two links in the skillet
a room filled with speakers one stage watch me kill it
now we should resort from the cradle to the grave
round and opposition twisted like super dave
dont make the scene messy
'cause it'll jump that's word aunt betsy
profound sentences to pure lyric dems
some of my friends be like a people with stems
folks be on the chase for this cheddar
thinkin it makes your life better
but it can make you ass out
and when i'm at a show chicks never pass out
we got the noise to make the whole mash out
plus we make posite divots to fill up all your crowns
lyrics come to cats like a hot and cold flash
so can come with ease if four and a smash
held the fort down like the justice league all the super friends
but in the world turn more spins
brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
city life breeze contempt for each race
all praises due to allah and i should say it
it' the abstract motor vader making things making things better
'cause you know this kid is got wild soul
of every kind of drama
like stars out pirhanna
cold like ice jazzed hot like a sauna
it's the has verse the the half guess who's arrived in the hood
exposing all wrongs it's all good

let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
i got to stress it again
and all my babies
children of the world no maybe's

to me your just another mc on the log
a link on the chain fluid on the brain
i boast of hype lyrics and yours are mardane
i'm the lyrical master blaster yeah i can do that
i can also do your girl so leave the hoe at home
cuz when i get done i'll have her strung on bones
it's the no joke pressure that elevates my mind
makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme
my title is locked the abstract poetic
i'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
so smooth and debonair especially for the ear
gotta keep my thing in gear cuz it's evident and clear
chorus
my mother went away for a month long trip
her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
she made a big mistake by leaving me home
i had to roam so i picked up the phone
dialed ali up to see what was going down
told him i pick him up so we could drive around
took the dodge dart a '74
my mother left a yard but i needed one more
so we left brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the belt got on the conduit
came to a toll we paid and went through it
had no destination we was on a quest
ali laid in the back so he could get rest
drove down the road for two days and a half
the sun had just risen on a dusty path
just then a figure had caught my eye
a man with a sombrero who was four feet high
his index finger he tipped up his hat
el segundo he said my name is pedro
if you need directions i'll tell you pronto
needed civilization some sort of reservation
he said a mile south there's a fast food station
thanks senor as i start up the motor
ali said damn tip why you drive so far for
well describe to me what the wallet looks like
anyway a gas station we passed
it was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
anywhere would have been better
i ordered enchiladas and i ate 'em
ali had the fruit punch
when we finished we thought for ways to get back
i had a hunch
ali said pay for lunch
so i did it
pulled out the wallet and i saw this wicked beautiful lady
put the wallet down and stared and stared
to put me back into reality here's shaheed

introchorus
we got the jazz x4
verse one q tip
stern firm and young with a laid back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers i'll daze and astound
captivate the mass cause the prose is profound
do it for the strong we do it for the meek
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends
so push it along trails we blaze
dont deserve the gong dont deserve the praise
the tranquility will make ya unball your fist
for we put hip hop on a brand new twist
a brand new twist with the homie alistic
so low key that ya probably missed it
and yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
so raise up squire address your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if you're on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool out breed
then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene
like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
i dont really mind if it's over your head
so pay attention it's not hard to decipher
and after the horns you can check out the phifer
chorus

we was in the back of the joint cooling out
and saw this girl

brother brother brother lucien you're like no other
listen very close 'cause i dont like to boast
instead i'll tell the tale of a french who prevailed
through the mr crazy rabbits who were always on his tail
on sale your rumour starts to wail
get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
if you go to jail then who will pay the bail
they'll put you back to france on a ship with a sail
escargot lucien you eat snails
from the zulu nation from a town called paris
came to america to find liberty
instead of finding pleasure all you found was misery
but listen lucien you have a friend in me
oh luck luck will drive you butt baddy
next time you get some wheels make it a caddy
in terms of doing good i know you wish you really could
but listen brother man i really think you can
succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
it'll take a minute rice so take my advice
trust in us and thus you trust in your life
lucine lucien lucien lucien

lucien i'm just kiddin
verse 3 q tip
you gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin
not so much the mission but you got crazy ignition
sure the sugar babies wanna give you a chance
with the french savoir faire and the sexy dance
but is she really fly or is she a guy
i wont ask why 'cause i know that you try
you try too hard is that the answer to the riddle
instead of doin so much why dont you do just a little
in fact it would be nice if we understood him like
a case of positionin the feet in the shoes
sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
lucien is blue even though he's really brown
i had to make the sound his life is too profound
on the up and up he's somethin like a little pup
young and naive it's hard to believe
as long as you're strong you can quest with the questers
jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
you should know

verse 1
q tip
let me tell you 'bout the snakes the fakes the lies
the highs at all of these industry shing dings
where you see the pretty girls
in the high animated world
checkin for a rapper with all the dough
if you take a shit they want to know
and if you're gonna fall they wont be around y'all
and you think that you got what it takes
i mean you really gotta rap and be all that
and prepare yourself for the breaks
check it out
do you wanna be in the business the business
the ups and downs with the hoes the business
always gettin fronted on at shows the business
people gotta stick their nose in the business
verse 2
yo i gotta speak on the cesspool
it's the rap industry and it aint that cool
only if you're on stage or if you're speakin to your people
aint no one your equal
especially on the industry side
dont let the games just glide
right through your fingers you gotta know the deal
so lord jamar speak because you're real
lord jamar
you're a million dollar man that aint got no dough
but you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
sedated and at that fact they elated
time pass and your ass say where's my loot
the reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
all you wanna do is taste the fruit
but in the back they're makin fruit juice
you ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
not able cos you signed at the table
that you didnt recoup more soup wit' ya meal
cos this is the real when you get a record deal
and i say
phife
awshucks look what the cat hauled in
it's phife dawg from a tribe called quest let me begin
like chuck d i got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no talent artists gettin signed they cant rhyme
and if that aint bad you got bootleggers
feel it's time that i let loose the lion
and if not that then i'll commence to head flyin
seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
and then you go and sell my tape for only 599
please nigga i've worked too hard for this
no more will i take the booty end of the stick
bogus brothers makin albums when they know they cant hack it
cos they lyrics is played like 8 ball jackets
now tell me i cant tear it up
do you wanna be in the business the business
people cant walk a straight line in the business
some of these brothers cant rhyme in the business
a yo i'm tryna get mine the business
verse 3
sadat x
the party scene is cool but then again it's all the same
you see the same faces but at different places
when you're up and ridin high everything is palsy palsy
well that's cool i can dig it it really aint my bag
prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
oh he's a cutie yeah real cute
but i wasnt that cute when i didnt have no loot
although i hit a pound of herbs i'm still nice with the verbs
so fuck what you heard
the born cipher cipher master makes me think much faster
but critics still continue to plaster
my name and discredit my fame
and i dont really give a damn
eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham
diamond d
well excuse me i gotta add my two cents in
dont be alarmed the rhyme was condensed in
a matter of minutes so it must be told
all that glitters' not gold
everybody wants a deal help me make a demo
see my name in bright lights ride around in a limo
but i wanna make jams damn i know i'll slam
huh well it's not that easy
you gotta get a label that's willin and able
to market and promote and you better hope
for what that the product is dope
take it from diamond it's like mountain climbin
when it comes to rhymin you gotta put your time in
get a good lawyer so problems wont pile
you dont wanna make a pitch that's wild
do you know the importance of a skypager
those who dont believe see you're laid behind

crazy situations keeps pockets on slender
yo i be on the avenue where they be actin brand new

but i gotta steady freak these boys like jojo
and i was doin it til i met ike spike and mike
one roll they had my pockets thirstier than sprite
you be havin good thoughts but the evils be revealin
and the stresses of life can take you off the right path no doubt
jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
we gotta hold it down so we can move on past
all adversities so we can get through fast like that
chorus

with raw poppy and now your first love is krill
your vision of the mil got crept like hey lover
tried to rise to the top you just couldnt recover
and all i want is my laceration of the pie
to get this whip cream before the water runs dry
you're sick of snitchin she got you cruisin to the pokey

while i be tryin to get star status like shinobi

classic classic
classic example of aa date rape 4x
q tip
listen to the rhyme it's a black date fact
percentile rate of date rape is fat
this is all true to the reason of the skeezin
you got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season
if you're in the wrong season that means you gotta break
especially if a squad tries to cry out rape
you dont wanna fight cuz you know that you're wrong
so instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
envision in your head of a great sex bout
worthy opponent all you wanna do is bone it
you ask can you kick it she says you cant stick
this is the case the situation is sticky
should you try to kiss or head for a hickey
not even you can ask steven
if the vibe aint right huh ya leavin
but if she offers her abode to drop ya load
right smack dab in the middle
get the kitten i got crazy tender vittles
phife
uh huh you know science you get buckwild
runnin mad games as if your name was scott skiles
or better yet magic or even karl malone
regardless who it is your aim is to bone
if she tries to front then you start to dis her
might as well get to the point no time to waste
might as well break the ice then set the pace
you start to talk nasty now she's ready to bone
step out of the shower throw on cologne
all of a sudden her sugarwalls tumble down like jericho
she's hotter than meshach shadrach and abendego
you listen to after 7 break fool after 10
do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
there goes round 1 ding there goes round two

black white latino and asian we cold raisin
the stakes of hip hop to a new plateau
to bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
a god fearin folk cos we all from the yolk
of one breed one seed to good goals we proceed
nowadays i strive to be a very good influence
even though not too long ago i was a truant
now i'm droppin it on this and many broad topics
from mans obsession with money to holy prophets
enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me

girls love the jim cuz it causes crazy friction
i still understand the uh cuz that's what i met her for
i'm hooked on the swings so just call me the music whore
women love the voice brothas dig the lyrics
quest the people's choice we thrive it for the spirit
if you cant hear it then get the wax utensils
write my rhymes straight up dont get with no fancy stensils
the rhymes we get is sweet we stay away from tart
our perfection is at work perkin up the art
if you want to battle i suggest you check your clock
be the prime example i deep instilled the sample
insignificance here i'll place you on the mantle
born up in harlem reside down in jamaica
the girl i used to rock her moms was a claker
now what does that make her the evil money taker
the crazy move faker i used that to break her
vinia mojica singing in the background
phife is in the house uncle mike is in the house
bob power is in the house tim latham is in the house
the j beez they in the house and de la they in the house
i must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
please dont be deceived by ugly slice of evil
the world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
wrap yourself up in it if you love it then you'll thank it
dont move to rebuttal wave your hand for action
the ladies of the '90's want more than satisfaction
they want keys and gs and all those illy things
if you want to i'll show you just what the ab can bring
if the question is of rhymes then i'll tell ya i got plenty
the thing that men and women need to do is stick together
progressions cant be made if we're separate forever
i hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
with the funky singin by miss vinia mojica
so listen because the quest is led through the underground
my people been up on quest to long no more will we be down
people tend to riff cuz they dont know the mental
people tend to bug cuz their beats are hard but gentle
play like bobby byrd on your back and your comin to
the house of the jazz of the funk of the rhythm
all the goods are welcome but if you're a villain
i'll just wait and debate contemplate your arrival
if flexin is your motive then you dont like survival
the abstract is speakin the hard beats is reachin
the black and puerto ricans
cuz their butt naked streakin through the ever murky streets
of the urbanized areas

cause yo we got to take things in to our own hands
and be aware of these dangerous plentiful lands
but do it over tribe because tribe is the bomb

always seems that you think that i'm blind
causes there always certain times when your hard to find
your on the go i'm on the go were on the go
i cant catch you no more cant see you no more
and it no longer can be ignored
cause at once upon a time it was you i adored
you disappeared and left me here out in the cold
and the absence of you is hurting my soul
didnt know there was an end of the road
and i refuse
i refuse to have one more sleepless night
i refuse
i refuse to let a tear fall from my eye
i refuse
i refuse to continue to try
i felt like i would die if i could breakdown and cry
and i refuse
i refuse to let you walk back through that door
i refuse to let you hurt me anymore
and i refuse
i refuse to continue to ignore
the fact i fell to the floor the day you walked out my door
and i refuse
no way baby i cant take it no more
and i refuse
no way baby i cant take it no more
and i refuse
to take it anymore
remember when i told you i could feel the change
you dont touch me the same dont hold me the same
no i dont want you to take all the blame
cause i know i had those moments when i caused the pain
this back and forth just like a war with you and me
see we both disagree have we ever agreed
this is nothing like i thought it would be
was it all just a dream was it ever in my reach
i refuse to have one more sleepless night
i refuse
i refuse to let a tear fall from my eye
i refuse
i refuse to continue to try
i felt like i would die if i could breakdown and cry
and i refuse
i refuse to let you walk back through that door
i refuse
and i refuse
i refuse to continue to ignore
the fact i fell to the floor the day you walked out my door
it was your way
or it was no way
and i couldnt live that way
it was our call
then it was your call
cause i gave you my all and all
i refuse to have one more sleepless night

cause the man i thought i knew
wouldnt do me no harm
and that ran through my mind over again
i promised myself you wouldnt put your hands on me again
never no more
i didnt sleep that night
i held my pillow tight
you have been told
i'm telling you never to touch me no more
never no more
i should've left you
when you called me out my name
i stooped to your level
replied you the same
now here we are again
you at my throat
that i did before
i walk away from you
at the drop of a dime
so often this treatment
is way out of line
and that ran through my mind over and over again
promised myself you wont put your hand on me again
never no more
you know i rather give you your space
whot to or not to say
stay out your way or get in your face
i just know you better not touch me again
or i'll walk away
that is one game i refuse to play
i didnt sleep that night
i held my pillow tight
now trust me when i say
you have been told
never no more
it's all because of you i'm feeling sad and blue
you went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
no days go by i'm thinking of you
and no way can i forget the things you do

chorus
no days go by i'm not thinking of you
and no way can i forget i cant get you off my mind

i never meant to hurt you dont go nowhere
cause you know this heart i'll always share

9 in the morning up up up way before breakfast

'cause you'll look up and i'll be gone
i hope you aint making plans on running me
'cause i read between the lines

my temperatures peakin
i'm bustin his bubble and he know he in trouble

changing the story or trying to ignore me
still reaching out for me
but still i'm hardly reaching
give me a reason to put you back on line
you've wasted enough time
i had to open my mind
you gotta read between the li ines

how could the one i shared my dreams with take my dreams from me
how could the love that brought such pleasure bring such misery
wont somebody tell me somebody tell me please
if you love me how could you do that to me
how could you just walk out the door
how could you not love me anymore
i thought we had forever
i cant understand
how could the one i gave my heart to break my heart so bad
how could the one who made me happy make me feel so sad
wont somebody tell me so i can understand
if you love me how could you hurt me like that
how could the one i gave my world to throw my world away
how could the one i was so true too just tell me lies
how could the one i gave my heart to
how could the one i gave my heart to
how could the one i gave my heart to break this heart of mine

i could not get you out of my mind
and ever since that moment
girl i havent been much good
i wont rest until i know that your're mine
dont you hear me crying for it
dont you see my heart's on fire
dont you feel me dying for it
give me my hearts desire
the first time that i saw you
you were everything a man could desire
and i've always been the kinda man
to get just what he wants
so please dont make me out as a liar
the second time i saw you
i just had to have you girl
i'd never seen someone look so good
and ever since that day
i just havent been the same

with yourself and do what you want to do with your life

with every chance i take with you with you
i'm out of my mind for love
what am i supposed to do
to get with you baby

to spare the pain that you could rid me of
we've grown so far apart
from used to be so intertwined
no more love you baby
if you love me well then show me
but if you dont then go on baby

i guess i figured out
that something was wrong
and that things have changed
cause girl i sit by the phone
and i wait for your call
but the phone never rings
so i picked up the phone and called you at home
you're on the other line
even see you you say you have no time
you started doing things that
you never did before how could
something so right turn out to be
something so wrong
you thought the grass was greener
you thought the well had water
you thought that you could find a
love another place
we use to take long walks
and have long long talks
on the telephone
you use to hold my hand in the
shopping mall i felt i was your own
we stopped going out as much
i started feeling all alone
girl you stopped telling me you loved me
saying that you cared
i thought we could work things out
but i just dont understand why
how could you leave someone patient
like me for something so wrong
chorus
even though you broke my heart in two
i was just hanging on trying to do what
was right and you were already gone
chorus
and if i see you again

here have a dollar
in fact no brotherman here have two
two dollars means a snack for me
but it means a big deal to you
be strong serve god only
that's the poem i wrote for the first time
i saw a man with no clothes no money no plate
mrwendal that's his name
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no one
never thought twice about spending on a ol bum
until i had the chance to really get to know one
now that i know him to give him money isnt charity
he gives me some knowledge i buy him some shoes
and to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
chorus go ahead mrwendal 2x
mrwendal has freedom
a free that you and i think is dumb
free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
for mrwendals a bum
his only worries are sickness
and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
uncivilized we call him
but i just saw him eat off the food we waste
who are we to judge
when thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
and killed over a racist grudge
mrwendal has tried to warn us about our ways
but we dont hear him talk
is it his fault when we've gone too far
and we got too far cause on him we walk
mrwendal a man a human in flesh
but not by law
realize that all in all you stand tall
mrwendal yeah yeah yeah lord mrwendal
see i was resting at the park minding my own
business as i kick up the treble tone
on my radio tape player box right
just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype see
outta nowhere comes the woman i'm dating
investigation maybe she was demonstrating
but nevertheless i was pleased
until a group of brothers started bugging out
drinking the 40 oz going the nigga route
disrespecting my black queen
holding their crotches and being obscene
at first i ignored them cause see i know their type
they got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
and they see a young couple having a time that's good
and their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
so they came to test speech cause of my hair do
i was a target cause i'm a fashion misfit
and the outfit that i'm wearing brothers dissing it
well i stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
but they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
why lord do brothers have to drill me
cause if i start to hit this man they'll have to kill me
chorus i am everyday people 2x
i told the niggaz please let us pass friend
i said please cause i dont like killing africans
but i had to take the brother out for being rude
and like i said before i was mad by then
it took three or four cops to pull me off of him
but that's the story y'all of a black man
acting like a nigga and get stomped by an african
chorus
lord i've really been real stressed
down and out losin ground
although i am black and proud
brothers and sisters keep messin up
why does it have to be so damn tuff
i dont know where i can go
to let these ghosts out of my skull
my grandmas past my brothers gone
i never at once felt so alone
i know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
not just my spare tire home
but lord i ask you home
for some strange reason it had to be home
he guided me to tennessee home
chorus take me to another place
take me to another land
make me forget all that hurts me
let me understand your plan
lord it's obvious we got a relationship
talkin to each other every night and day
although you're superior over me
then outta nowhere you tell me to break
outta the country and into more country
past dyesburg into ripley
where the ghost of childhood haunts me
walk the roads my forefathers walked
climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
ask those trees for all their wisdom
they tell me my ears are so young home
go back to from whence you came home
for some strange reason it had to be home
he guided me to tennessee home
chorus
now i see the importance of history
why people be in the mess that they be
many journeys to freedom made in vain
by brothers on the corner playin ghetto games
i ask you lord why you enlightened me
without the enlightment of all my folks
and he was there to quench my thirst
but i am still thirsty
the lord allowed me to drink some more
he said what i am searchin for are
the answers to all which are in front of me
the ultimate truth started to get blurry
for some strange reason it had to be
it was all a dream about tennessee
chorus
looking in your eyes
it's written on your face
i can read your mind
you feel the same as me baby girl it's
time you face the truth
you're in love with me
and i think it's time that you came around
girl you care for me
like i care for you
girl you want from me
what i want from you
and you dream of me every night
there's nowhere you can run
nowhere you can hide
cant you feel it girl
you're running outta time baby girl it's
nothing but your fate
you're supposed to be with me
chorus
it's really not good for you to
deny the feelings deep inside you
you're really overdue you need to open up

come to terms with what's inside you
this aint no time to run away from love

i drank your wine
as you tatsted mine
i kissed your lips
you felt my body slip
into your soul
i heard you moan
i almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
chorus
last night
last night
while making love to you
i saw the sun the moon
the mountains and the rivers
i saw heaven when i made sweet love to you
last night there was no planning it
it was so special and
so very innocent
we talked of memories
as we explored our visions of love
and deep into the night
right by the fireside
you felt my candlelight
in your soul
you felt incredible
i started to explode
i almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
chorus
the scent of you it calms the heart
the sight of you i fall apart
moonlight the things we notice
when we're in love that's when it comes
and i'm so in love i'm so in love
singer
birds flyin high you know how i feel
sun in the sky you know how i feel
reeds driftin on by you know how i feel
it's a new life for me yes

it's a new life for me
az
play the game for my people stay in charge of your dreams
keep your vision focused get wise and largen your cream
marketin schemes so many in the dark that's unseen
caught inbetween perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
forced to be keen from hustlin supportin them fiends
rockin birth stones my first get bent nurse the dome
it hurts to zone now i realize i'm on this earth alone
time ticks devilish minds design tricks leave you blind quick
cause you to die behind shit math e matic
master one twenty i'm asiatic
amazed with magic cuz it's illusions that made me savage
life change once you establish the right game
love the night rain found a new way to fight pain
clocks never stop it's all a race to the top
bassy bob brockmann babyface jeffery burrell
my heart has been broken cause of you
one always must leave that's nothing new
i thought that you'd really like to try to stay

it's been 17 months on my own
the nights are so quiet all alone
i long to feel you in my arms again
girl wont you please come back home

chorus
i never wanted to swallow my pride
i tried to play it cool so cool

i wouldnt hold back a damn thing from you
chorus
babyface keth andes
it was a place we loved
that was the place we laughed
where we had so much fun
there was the place i met her
that's where we fell in love
and it was the place where she broke my heart
so how do i tell this story
or someone i love so much
when she lost her feelings for me
have you ever loved someone so much
it hurts like hell
to see the love that she once gave to you
she gives to someone else
have you ever ever ever ever loved
to find yourself
to see the love that she gave
the love you made
the joys and praise
she was a girl called beautiful
and i was so proud of she
how could a girl like her
be with someone like me
there was a time i had her heart
and oh what a time it was
but i never thought that time
would take my one true love
so how do i tell this story
she lost her feelings for me
oh how i need her touch
chorus
bridge
chorus
jon b
secrets oh what you kept from me
they make our world go around
but secrets they only last long enough to break you down
you didnt want to be my girl
i saw you by candlelight waiting for two
sure wasnt me who was doin it with you
oh but there's too much in my mind right now
to say how i feel to do what i need to do
and how can you leave like this
when a simple kiss is all you gave me
chorus
loving you seems foolish when you do what you do
i swear girl i'm leaving baby five after two
'cause is no way i'm waiting longer for you
oh but there's too much in my mind right now
to say how i feel to do what i need to do
and how can i look up to the way
and see our love fading baby tell me why
chorus
babyface keith andes
take it from me
just give yourself some time
you're just in a shaky frame of mind
take it from me
that everyone's not that way
just out to break your heart
so baby dont fall apart
i know that it hurts sometimes
but girl if you let me ride
i'll make you feel the way you want
dont want you to compromise
we can just take our time
whatever makes you feel you're loved
that's all i want
take it from me
you're gonna love someone
i can see it in your eyes
somebody's gotta treat you right
take it from me
he'll never ever break your heart
you'll never have to feel that pain
chorus
you have this tendency to blame things on yourself
has it not occurred to you that it may be someone else
there is an urgency to change the way you feel
well i'm here to make the way for you
girl you're not by yourself
chorus
quietly i watch you sleep
hopefully you wont hear what i say
wondering if i turned the clouds
happy the moment i tasted your rain
tonight was the night
that i saw my first sight
of how pleasure wins over pain
now i know what i know
dont wanna ever let you go
you shot your arrow
through my restless shaking heart
you came down on me slow
drew back your bow
my lady you shot your arrow
straight through my heart
i kiss your mouth and stroke your hair
intently i hang on your every breath
i know what i'm feeling right now
for the sake of your flesh
girl i need you now
i'll try my best to learn how
to be all that my words might say
caressing your skin
i never imagined
that i'd ever feel this way
chorus
bridge
i'll try my best to learn how
to be all that my words might say
caressing your skin
i never imagined i could ever feel this way

made me believe true love could be
how could a love so strong not go right
where do we go from here

why the hell did you have to leave
was it something i said
or something i done
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave
was it something i said
or something i done to make you want to run away
there's many other fish in the sea to be caught
so let me tell this baby
i'll be catching when i set it off
we had a good thing but now it's time to move on
stop blowing up my beeper
but i got to be strong
what the hell do you want
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave
was it something i said
or something i done
to make you want to run away from my love
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave
or something i done to make you want to run away
instrumental with ad libs
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave
was it something i said
or something i done to make you run away
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave
to make you want to run away
why the hell did you have to leave
to make you want to run away
what the hell do you want from me
why the hell did you have to leave

chorus
busta rhymes
yo god bless
pick up your chest
here's an example of how i can stress your full court press
with finesse i bench press your stress whenever you test
i'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
just use your head and forfeit the game
you and your team just need to back off
get off my block gimmie the ball i said it's my rock
i'm startin a line up by gettin y'all to bring the livestock
throw all your money in the pot
and make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
when we come right through tell me what you really gonna do
we'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
with nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
money spending goal tending stay bending teams like crash cars
who do they be
they be the monstars
chorus
