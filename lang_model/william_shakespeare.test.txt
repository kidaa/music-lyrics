feed'st thy light's flame with self substantial fuel
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
to hideous winter and confounds him there
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
resembling strong youth in his middle age
music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
resembling sire and child and happy mother
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
without this folly age and cold decay
when i do count the clock that tells the time
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
find no determination then you were
not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
cheered and checked even by the self same sky
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time
a womans face with nature's own hand painted
and by addition me of thee defeated
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
are windows to my breast where through the sun
but as the marigold at the suns eye
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
how can i then return in happy plight
so flatter i the swart complexioned night
featured like him like him with friends possessed
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
if thou survive my well contented day
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
with ugly rack on his celestial face
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
authorizing thy trespass with compare
let me confess that we two must be twain
nor thou with public kindness honour me
or any of these all or all or more
how can my muse want subject to invent
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
and our dear love lose name of single one
take all my loves my love yea take them all
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
both find each other and i lose both twain
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
but that so much of earth and water wrought
in tender embassy of love to thee
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
and by their verdict is determined
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
how careful was i when i took my way
within the gentle closure of my breast
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
how heavy do i journey on the way
which heavily he answers with a groan
when swift extremity can seem but slow
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
to make some special instant special blest
is poorly imitated after you
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
and broils root out the work of masonry
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
come daily to the banks that when they see
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
that god forbid that made me first your slave
to what you will to you it doth belong
even of five hundred courses of the sun
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
so far from home into my deeds to pry
sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
mine own self love quite contrary i read
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
tired with all these for restful death i cry
and simple truth miscalled simplicity
and steal dead seeming of his living hue
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
making no summer of another's green
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
the hand that writ it for i love you so
o lest the world should task you to recite
my name be buried where my body is
as after sunset fadeth in the west
but be contented when that fell arrest
the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so all my best is dressing old words new
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
in others' works thou dost but mend the style
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
o how i faint when i of you do write
or being wrecked i am a worthless boat
though i once gone to all the world must die
i grant thou wert not married to my muse
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
that you your self being extant well might show
who is it that says most which can say more
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
as victors of my silence cannot boast
and for that riches where is my deserving
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
the injuries that to my self i do
to set a form upon desired change
then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
but in the onset come so shall i taste
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but do thy worst to steal thy self away
o what a happy title do i find
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
they that have power to hurt and will do none
but if that flower with base infection meet
making lascivious comments on thy sport
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
from you have i been absent in the spring
they were but sweet but figures of delight
the lily i condemned for thy hand
100
if time have any wrinkle graven there
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
102
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
o blame me not if i no more can write
104
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
kind is my love to day to morrow kind
106
of this our time all you prefiguring
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
108
weighs not the dust and injury of age
that is my home of love if i have ranged
110
mine appetite i never more will grind
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
112
of others' voices that my adder's sense
for it no form delivers to the heart
114
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
but reckoning time whose millioned accidents
116
within his bending sickle's compass come
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
118
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
120
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
for why should others' false adulterate eyes
122
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
124
which works on leases of short numbered hours
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
126
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
making dead wood more blest than living lips
past reason hated as a swallowed bait
coral is far more red than her lips red
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
to say they err i dare not be so bold
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
and suit thy pity like in every part
of him my self and thee i am forsaken
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
shall will in others seem right gracious
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
i do believe her though i know she lies
and age in love loves not to have years told
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
to follow that which flies before her face
which like two spirits do suggest me still
i guess one angel in another's hell
was used in giving gentle doom
my sinful earth these rebel powers array
within be fed without be rich no more
hath left me and i desperate now approve
which have no correspondence with true sight
the sun it self sees not till heaven clears
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
with insufficiency my heart to sway
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
my soul doth tell my body that he may
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
or made them swear against the thing they see
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand

did pocket up my letters and with taunts
caesar you have broken
the which you both denied

abetting him to thwart me in my mood

that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band on
and here we wander in illusions
dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and
antipholus of syracuse why dromio

dromio of ephesus in verity you did my bones bear witness
antipholus of ephesus went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats
adriana i did not gentle husband lock thee forth
pinch more company the fiend is strong within him
adriana what wilt thou do thou peevish officer
antipholus of ephesus o most unhappy strumpet
officer one angelo a goldsmith do you know him
adriana it may be so but i did never see it
dromio of syracuse as fast as may be frighted
antipholus of syracuse i will not stay to night for all the town

second merchant yes that you did sir and forswore it too
enter adriana luciana the courtezan and others
let us come in that we may bind him fast
buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
adriana as roughly as my modesty would let me
abbess and thereof came it that the man was mad
sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
when he demeand himself rough rude and wildly
adriana i will attend my husband be his nurse
therefore depart and leave him here with me
and take perforce my husband from the abbess
beheaded publicly for his offence
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
once did i get him bound and sent him home
into this abbey whither we pursu'd them
go some of you knock at the abbey gate
my master preaches patience to him and the while
cry within
when i bestrid thee in the wars and took
that she this day hath shameless thrown on me
angelo o peflur'd woman they are both forsworn
promising to bring it to the porpentine
for certain ducats he with none returnd
forsooth took on him as a conjurer
to give me ample satisfaction
and thereupon i drew my sword on you
if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
exit one to the abbess
aegeon i am sure you both of you remember me
antipholus of ephesus neither
though now this grained face of mine be hid
thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son
abbess most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd
abbess whoever bound him i will loose his bonds

wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear
menenius there was a time when all the body's members
first citizen well sir what answer made the belly
the kingly crowned head the vigilant eye
first citizen the former agents if they did complain
'that i receive the general food at first
you my good friends' this says the belly mark me
their counsels and their cares digest things rightly

marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter

below their cobbled shoes they say there's grain enough
they said they were an hungry sigh'd forth proverbs
menenius what is granted them
enter a messenger hastily
marcius they have a leader
first senator then worthy marcius
menenius o true bred
to gnaw their garners worshipful mutineers
brutus the present wars devour him he is grown
a place below the first for what miscarries
though marcius earnd them not and all his faults
enter tullus aufidius with senators of corioli
reads 'they have press'd a power but it is not known
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
take your commission hie you to your bands
'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
they set them down on two low stools and sew
renown made it not stir was pleas'd to let him seek danger where

where they shall know our mind away exeunt
lead their successes as we wish our own
methinks thou speak'st not well how long is't since
cominius who's yonder
but mantled in your own
holding corioli in the name of rome
from rascals worse than they

the treasure in this field achiev'd and city
cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius stand bare
in acclamations hyperbolical
wears this war's garland in token of the which
and when my face is fair you shall perceive
for their own good and ours

or wrath or craft may get him
at home upon my brother's guard even there
first soldier i shall sir exeunt
sicinius the lamb
sicinius especially in pride

menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i
menenius you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are
knaves you are a pair of strange ones
though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
menenius ha marcius coming home
menenius a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years'
the oaken garland
of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
volumnia i' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm there will be large
noise and behind him he leaves tears
in honour follows coriolanus
my gentle marcius worthy caius and
coriolanus and live you yet to valeria o my sweet lady

for sinking under them
messenger you are sent for to the capitol 'tis thought
and carry with us ears and eyes for th' time
first officer that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and
first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no
deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but
menenius cominius the consul sicinius and
in our well found successes to report
your loving motion toward the common body
menenius that's off that's off
nay keep your place
you sooth'd not therefore hurt not but your people
than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius
when with his amazonian chin he drove
he lurch'd all swords of the garland for this last
the mortal gate of th' city which he painted
both field and city ours he never stood
to spend the time to end it
menenius it then remains
menenius put them not to't
as if i had receiv'd them for the hire
sicinius may they perceive's intent he will require them
deny him
first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help
fly
third citizen are you all resolv'd to give your voices but that's
therefore follow me and i'll direct you how you shall go by him
menenius o me the gods
coriolanus bid them wash their faces
third citizen you must think if we give you anything we hope to
third citizen but this is something odd
been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common
may be consul
than crave the hire which first we do deserve
the one part suffered the other will i do
mans voice
anon do meet the senate
repair to th' senate house
sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man
his marks of merit wounds receiv'd for's country
your most sweet voices now you have left your voices
i' th' body of the weal and now arriving
sicinius thus to have said
brutus did you perceive
your su'd for tongues
as therefore kept to do so
after the inveterate hate he bears you
to voice him consul lay the fault on us
twice being by the people chosen censor
harp on that still but by our putting on
the vantage of his anger
lartius he had my lord and that it was which caus'd
against the volsces for they had so vilely
coriolanus at antium lives he
coriolanus ha what is that
or all will fall in broil
nor ever will be ruld
cominius you are like to do such business
or never be so noble as a consul
first senator not in this heat sir now
who lack not virtue no nor power but that
brutus you speak o' th' people
that shall remain a poison where it is
that with his peremptory 'shall' being but
most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth
more worthier than their voices they know the corn
of our so frank donation well what then
menenius come enough
to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd it follows
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
to the greater bench in a rebellion
sicinius go call the people exit aedile in whose name myself
enter a rabble of plebeians with the aediles
menenius what is about to be i am out of breath
this is the way to kindle not to quench
to bring the roof to the foundation
bear him to th' rock tarpeian and from thence
brutus sir those cold ways
menenius help marcius help
menenius shall it be put to that
menenius be gone
before the tag return whose rage doth rend
menenius his nature is too noble for the world
re enter brutus and sicinius the rabble again
first citizen he shall well know
menenius hear me speak
than so much loss of time
in jove's own book like an unnatural dam
were to us all that do't and suffer it
lest his infection being of catching nature
have we not had a taste of his obedience
it is the humane way the other course
menenius i'll bring him to you
that the precipitation might down stretch
to speak of peace or war
volumnia you might have been enough the man you are
first senator there's no remedy
for the whole state i would put mine armour on
but when extremities speak i have heard you say
that it shall hold companionship in peace
now this no more dishonours you at all
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
action is eloquence and the eyes of th' ignorant
as thou hast power and person
here is cominius
with my base tongue give to my noble heart
to have my praise for this perform a part
make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees
thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
or never trust to what my tongue can do
menenius ay but mildly
enter an aedile
sicinius have you corrected them by tribes
brutus and when such time they have begun to cry
of contradiction being once chaf'd he cannot
supplied with worthy men plant love among's
coriolanus shall i be charg'd no further than this present
upon the wounds his body bears which show
cominius well well no more
for which you are a traitor to the people
sicinius mark you this people
brutus but since he hath
but with a grain a day i would not buy
that do distribute it in the name o' th' people
sicinius he's sentenc'd no more hearing
brutus there's no more to be said but he is banish'd
your enemies with nodding of their plumes
exeunt coriolanus
the gods preserve our noble tribunes come exeunt
that when the sea was calm all boats alike
coriolanus what what what
i have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld
volumnia my first son
o'er the vast world to seek a single man
while i remain above the ground you shall
scene ii
say their great enemy is gone and they
requite your love
to banish him that struck more blows for rome
he'd make an end of thy posterity
as i can of those mysteries which heaven
sicinius why stay we to be baited
and so shall starve with feeding come let's go
volsce it is so sir truly i have forgot you
against the senators patricians and nobles
volsce coriolanus banish'd
accompany you home
volsce you take my part from me sir i have the most cause to be
lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
citizen this here before you
to take the one the other by some chance
first servant wine wine wine what service is here i think our
whence are you here's no place for you pray go to the door
second servant are you so brave i'll have you talk'd with anon
third servant a marv'llous poor one
coriolanus under the canopy
mistress thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher
think me for the man i am necessity
aufidius i know thee not thy name
the cruelty and envy of the people
stand i before thee here then if thou hast
th'art tir'd then in a word i also am
a root of ancient envy if jupiter
contend against thy valour know thou first
dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me
who now are here taking their leaves of me
or rudely visit them in parts remote
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
man i' th' world
first servant ay and for an assault too
third servant i do not say 'thwack our general' but he was always
third servant why he is so made on here within as if he were son
second servant and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine
third servant to morrow to day presently you shall have the
destroyer of men
rome a public place
about their functions friendly
he could have temporiz'd
sicinius live and thrive
o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
aedile worthy tribunes
and durst not once peep out
and beat the messenger who bids beware
go whip him fore the people's eyes his raising
the young'st and oldest thing
a fearful army led by caius marcius
to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses
made by some other deity than nature
your rome about your ears
menenius we are all undone unless
if he were putting to my house the brand
who did hoot him out o' th' city
that made the air unwholesome when you cast
first citizen for mine own part
cominius o ay what else
brutus i do not like this news
your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
what cannot be amended
to th' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
which he was lord of or whether nature
and power unto itself most commendable
enter menenius cominius sicinius and brutus the two tribunes with others
cominius yet one time he did call me by my name
cominius i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
would be your country's pleader your good tongue
unheard what then
the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then
menenius good faith i'll prove him
he sent in writing after me what he would not
first watch stay whence are you
you'll speak with coriolanus
his fame unparalleld haply amplified
no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely
menenius i am as thy general is
our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon
coriolanus what's the matter
look thee here's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come
my revenge properly my remission lies
aufidius you keep a constant temper
he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another
coriolanus we will before the walls of rome to morrow
whom with crack'd heart i have sent to rome
will i lend ear to shout within ha what shout is this
what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes
and knew no other kin
long as my exile sweet as my revenge
i kneel before thee and unproperly
volumnia thou art my warrior
with the consent of supreme jove inform
or if you'd ask remember this before
for we have nothing else to ask but that
are we come hither since that thy sight which should
whereto we are bound together with thy victory

whose chronicle thus writ 'the man was noble
still to remember wrongs daughter speak you
and spurn me back but if it he not so
but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship
what have you done behold the heavens do ope

opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence

trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours
by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the
queen whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers
which are the movers of a languishing death
other conclusions i will try the forces
queen o content thee

thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son

for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon
more than a mortal seeming be not angry

i hope it be not gone to tell my lord
she's my good lady and will conceive i hope
will remain hers

i should have lost the worth of it in gold
iachimo good sir we must

posthumus proceed
could be so rarely and exactly wrought
is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
i had forgot them were two winking cupids
and now 'tis up again it must be married
posthumus may be she pluck'd it of
than they are to their virtues which is nothing
more evident than this for this was stoln
divide themselves between you
i kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger

ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
the very devils cannot plague them better exit
famous in caesar's praises no whit less

caesar made here but made not here his brag

it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare
o master what a strange infection
have made to thy command i her her blood
enter imogen
that we two are asunder let that grieve him
dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of
glide thither in a day then true pisanio
how we may steal from hence and for the gap
could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers
that i cannot look through away i prithee
are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
that it is place which lessens and sets off
richer than doing nothing for a bribe
a cell of ignorance travelling abed
our valour is to chase what flies our cage
i' th'name of fame and honour which dies i' th'search
whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
this rock and these demesnes have been my world
how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
when on my three foot stool i sit and tell
o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
wales near milford haven
into a haviour of less fear ere wildness
pisanio please you read
thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art
imogen false to his bed what is it to be false
thy favour's good enough some jay of italy
imogen true honest men being heard like false aeneas
the innocent mansion of my love my heart
no servant of thy master's against self slaughter
do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
the lamp entreats the butcher where's thy knife
so many miles with a pretence this place
hear me with patience
but if i were as wise as honest then
and that will well confirm it
pisanio if not at court
lucius the roman comes to milford haven

you have me rich and i will never fail

master's garments in thy possession
held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble
re enter pisanio with the clothes
pisanio thou bid'st me to my loss for true to thee
i have tir'd myself and for two nights together
when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fulness
of hardiness is mother ho who's here
the sweat of industry would dry and die
belarius looking into the cave stay come not in
to have begg'd or bought what i have took good troth
imogen i see you're angry
belarius prithee fair youth
he is a man i'll love him as my brother
guiderius would i could free't
i'd change my sex to be companion with them
arviragus i pray draw near exeunt
the gentry to this business he creates
will tie you to the numbers and the time
a womans fitness comes by fits therein i must play the workman
before her face and all this done spurn her home to her father
belarius to imogen you are not well remain here in the cave
to seem to die ere sick so please you leave me
as i do love my father
cowards father cowards and base things sire base
our courtiers say alls savage but at court
i might know more
good ancestors
with winds that sailors rail at
hath mock'd me i am faint
that fly me thus some villain mountaineers

the man that gave them thee thou art some fool
nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
and on the gates of lud's town set your heads
arviragus in this place we left them
there was no money int not hercules
and set them on lud's town
can we set eye on but in an safe reason
he'd fetch us in yet is't not probable
did make my way long forth
arviragus would i had done't
till hasty polydore return and bring him
not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
or what his death will bring us
belarius he went hence even now
and brings the dire occasion in his arms
belarius o melancholy
reposing on a cushion

yea and furr'd moss besides when flow'rs are none
and let us polydore though now our voices
is quite forgot he was a queens son boys
when neither are alive
guiderius fear no more the heat o' th' sun

'our britains harts die flying not our men
a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
like fragments in hard voyages became
posthumus nay do not wonder at it you are made
i know he'll quickly fly my friendship too
'tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
on either side i come to spend my breath
posthumus a roman
scene iv
by th' sure physician death who is the key
no stricter render of me than my all
if you will take this audit take this life
they circle posthumus round as he lies sleeping
whose father then as men report
moulded the stuff so fair
to be exild and thrown
second brother for this from stiller seats we came
the graces for his merits due
to th' shining synod of the rest
sky planted batters all rebelling coasts
our temple was he married rise and fade
stoop'd as to foot us his ascension is
a mother and two brothers but o scorn
nobler than that it covers let thy effects
tongue and brain not either both or nothing
posthumus so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish
charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you
gaoler your death has eyes ins head then i have not seen him so
the way of winking
of them too that die against their wills so should i if i were
that the poor soldier that so richly fought
pisanio he hath been search'd among the dead and living
further to boast were neither true nor modest
cornelius hail great king
i will report so please you these her women
believe her lips in opening it proceed
should by the minute feed on life and ling'ring
despairing died
enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other
we should not when the blood was cool have threatend
so tender over his occasions true
to say 'live boy' ne'er thank thy master live
bitter to me as death your life good master
imogen he is a roman no more kin to me
i'll be thy master walk with me speak freely
guiderius but we saw him dead
winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him
which torments me to conceal by villainy
i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
hearing us praise our loves of italy
iachimo all too soon i shall
cymbeline nay nay to th' purpose
than i did truly find her stakes this ring
most vilely for my vantage excellent

by being worse than they i am posthumus

whom for the theft i wedded stole these children
fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy

thus much the business is we have here writ
to business with the king more than the scope
that shall not be my offer not thy asking
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
ham aside a little more than kin and less than kind
queen if it be
for they are actions that a man might play
of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief
is death of fathers and who still hath cried
it is most retrograde to our desire
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
how weary stale flat and unprofitable
must i remember why she would hang on him
than i to hercules within a month
horatio or i do forget myself
nor shall you do my ear that violence
did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
ham saw who
in the dead vast and middle of the night
and i with them the third night kept the watch
it lifted up it head and did address
hold you the watch to night
ham pale or red
ham his beard was grizzled no
let it be tenable in your silence still
i doubt some foul play would the night were come
but let me hear from you
for nature crescent does not grow alone
the safety and health of this whole state
or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
and recks not his own rede
look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
and it must follow as the night the day

and to the manner born it is a custom
as in their birth wherein they are not guilty
shall in the general censure take corruption
that i will speak to thee i'll call thee hamlet
making night hideous and we fools of nature
but do not go with it
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
go on i'll follow thee
i say away go on i'll follow thee
elsinore the castle another part of the fortifications
to what i shall unfold
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
ghost revenge his foul and most unnatural murther
wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear
with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
but virtue as it never will be mov'd
and in the porches of my ears did pour
all my smooth body
a couch for luxury and damned incest
and shall i couple hell hold hold my heart

hor good my lord tell it
to tell us this
yes faith heartily
ham never make known what you have seen to night

pol marry sir here's my drift
according to the phrase or the addition

so by my former lecture and advice
exit reynaldo
and with a look so piteous in purport
he falls to such perusal of my face
and to the last bended their light on me
his access to me
more grief to hide than hate to utter love

but issued from the progeny of kings
to compass wonders but by help of devils
that so her torture may be shortened
york she and the dauphin have been juggling
but reignier king of naples that prevaild
may never glorious sun reflex his beams
with letters of commission from the king
that in this quarrel have been overthrown
as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby
that in regard king henry gives consent
adorn his temples with a coronet
no lord ambassador i'll rather keep
or we will plague thee with incessant wars
and therefore take this compact of a truce
thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
of beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me
the chief perfections of that lovely dame
king henry and otherwise will henry ne'er presume
to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
and of such great authority in france

scene iii
from thence unto the place of execution
i cannot justify whom the law condemns
my stay my guide and lantern to my feet
and even as willingly at thy feet i leave it

peter i thank you all drink and pray for me i pray you for i
peter thump
horner hold peter hold i confess i confess treason
which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully
sirs what's o'clock
when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets

to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
for suffolk he that can do all in all
and each of them had twenty times their power
herald i summon your grace to his majesty's parliament
stanley so am i given in charge may't please your grace
death at whose name i oft have been afeard
according to that state you shall be us'd
and show itself attire me how i can
the strangeness of his alter'd countenance
he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
and his advantage following your decease
made me collect these dangers in the duke
the duchess by his subornation
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey
seems he a dove his feathers are but borrow'd
somerset that all your interest in those territories
gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king
who can accuse me wherein am i guilty
or any groat i hoarded to my use
that england was defam'd by tyranny
suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answer'd
virtue is chok'd with foul ambition
will not conclude their plotted tragedy
and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
if those that care to keep your royal person
gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
ah that my fear were false ah that it were
the map of honour truth and loyalty
even so remorseless have they borne him hence
queen free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams
this gloucester should be quickly rid the world
york so that by this you would not have him die
to make the fox surveyor of the fold
sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how
cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk
post great lords from ireland am i come amain
witness the fortune he hath had in france
queen nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
to ireland will you lead a band of men
but now return we to the false duke humphrey
york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts
well nobles well 'tis politicly done
and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
oppose himself against a troop of kerns
this devil here shall be my substitute
and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
didst ever hear a man so penitent
first murderer 'tis my good lord
than from true evidence of good esteem
queen marry god forfend
suffolk comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort
thou baleful messenger out of my sight
yet he most christian like laments his death
so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb
what did i then but curs'd the gentle gusts
and would not dash me with their ragged sides
and threw it towards thy land the sea receiv'd it
his father's acts commenc'd in burning troy
that want their leader scatter up and down
exit salisbury with the commons
and with my fingers feel his hand un feeling
with that dread king that took our state upon him
who in the conflict that it holds with death
look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
'tis like you would not feast him like a friend
even so suspicious is this tragedy
warwick what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him
some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
that thou thyself was born in bastardy
king henry what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
suffolk the trait'rous warwick with the men of bury
they say by him the good duke humphrey died
yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
your loving uncle twenty times his worth
commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in
but three days longer on the pain of death
the world shall not be ransom for thy life
and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave
my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
though standing naked on a mountain top
so get thee gone that i may know my grief
yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st
and whispers to his pillow as to him
theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee
scene iii
cardinal bring me unto my trial when you will
bring the strong poison that i bought of him
hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
suffolk and other gentlemen as prisoners

outcast of naples england's bloody scourge
york i thank thee clifford say what news with thee
and chop away that factious pate of his
that with the very shaking of their chains
hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
what wilt thou on thy death bed play the ruffian
that bows unto the grave with mickle age
who can be bound by any solemn vow
i am resolv'd for death or dignity
this day i'll wear aloft my burgonet
for you shall sup with jesu christ to night
and dead mens cries do fill the empty air
enter old clifford
clifford nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
enter young clifford
the name of valour sees his father's body
to die in ruffian battle even at this sight
as wild medea young absyrtus did
for underneath an alehouse' paltry sign
to give the enemy way and to secure us
young clifford but that my heart's on future mischief set
with drum and colours
three times bestrid him thrice i led him off
and it hath pleas'd him that three times to day

i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
warwick and when the king comes offer him no violence
york then leave me not my lords be resolute
their hats
westmoreland what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down
exeter but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly
york 'twas my inheritance as the earldom was
and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
clifford urge it no more lest that instead of words
who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
richard sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly
and now in england to our heart's great sorrow
for richard in the view of many lords
exeter his is the right and therefore pardon me
can set the duke up in despite of me
and over the chair of state where now he sits
clifford what wrong is this unto the prince your son
and die in bands for this unmanly deed
whom i unnaturally shall disinherit
warwick long live king henry plantagenet embrace him

richard ay with five hundred father for a need
scene iii

alarum enter the duke of york
and thrice cried 'courage father fight it out'
with bootless labour swim against the tide
come bloody clifford rough northumberland
and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland
dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
i prithee grieve to make me merry york
putting a paper crown on his head
now in his life against your holy oath
upon their woes whom fortune captivates
it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
as the antipodes are unto us
for raging wind blows up incessant showers
o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
and in thy need such comfort come to thee
clifford here's for my oath here's for my father's death
act ii scene i
how fares my brother why is he so sad
so far'd our father with his enemies
but sever'd in a pale clear shining sky
and overshine the earth as this the world
your princely father and my loving lord
but only slaught'red by the ireful arm
the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd
for never henceforth shall i joy again
richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death
richard great lord of warwick if we should recount
i come to tell you things sith then befalln
for by my scouts i was advertised
or more than common fear of clifford's rigour
and we in them no hope to win the day
from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
as he is fam'd for mildness peace and prayer
warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out
may make against the house of lancaster
richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
and he that throws not up his cap for joy
warwick how now what news
queen margaret welcome my lord to this brave town of york
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
he but a duke would have his son a king
make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
successful fortune steel thy melting heart
for all the rest is held at such a rate
king henry edward plantagenet arise a knight
and in the towns as they do march along
unsheathe your sword good father cry 'saint george'
i was adopted heir by his consent
richard 'twas you that killd young rutland was it not
northumberland no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
queen margaret defy them then or else hold close thy lips
that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
as venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings
and ne'er was agamemmons brother wrong'd
and heap'd sedition on his crown at home
we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
exeunt
edward smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
richard ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
i'll kill my horse because i will not fly
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
richard brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
clifford now richard i am with thee here alone
scene v
forc'd to retire by fury of the wind
they prosper best of all when i am thence
how many days will finish up the year
so minutes hours days months and years
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
son ill blows the wind that profits nobody
my father being the earl of warwick's man
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
ah boy if any life be left in thee
king henry woe above woe grief more than common grief
take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
exit with the body
exit with the body
having the fearful flying hare in sight
scene vi
the common people swarm like summer flies
i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
as doth a sail filld with a fretting gust
see who it is
your father's head which clifford placed there
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
richard thou didst love york and i am son to york
stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
the scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again
richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
enter two keepers with cross bows in their hands
i'll tell thee what befell me on a day
no humble suitors press to speak for right
and as i hear the great commanding warwick
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
inferreth arguments of mighty strength
second keeper ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king
you are the king king edward hath depos'd
and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
such is the lightness of you common men
king henry in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd
which we in justice cannot well deny
keeps the wind
fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow
lady grey three my most gracious lord
lady grey ay full as dearly as i love myself
lady grey no gracious lord except i cannot do it
gloucester the match is made she seals it with a curtsy
lady grey my mind will never grant what i perceive
accords not with the sadness of my suit
one way or other she is for a king
i know i am too mean to be your queen
gloucester the ghostly father now hath done his shrift
king edward well jest on brothers i can tell you both
gloucester ay edward will use women honourably
why then i do but dream on sovereignty
my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
and for i should not deal in her soft laws
o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
and i like one lost in a thorny wood
and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
can i do this and cannot get a crown
queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret
and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares
that henry sole possessor of my love
scotland hath will to help but cannot help
enter warwick
first to do greetings to thy royal person
to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart
that henry liveth still but were he dead
oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
methinks these peers of france should smile at that
oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom
while i use further conference with warwick
tell me for truth the measure of his love
lewis now sister let us hear your firm resolve
that bona shall be wife to the english king
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
both full of truth i make king lewis behold
they all read their letters
sends me a paper to persuade me patience
did i forget that by the house of york
and henceforth i am thy true servitor
and force the tyrant from his seat by war
bona my quarrel and this english queens are one
thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal
shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
son edward she is fair and virtuous
i long till edward fall by war's mischance
and i'll be chief to bring him down again
how could he stay till warwick made return
which are so weak of courage and in judgment
whom god hath joind together ay and 'twere pity
gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge
hastings 'tis better using france than trusting france
to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
which being shallow you shall give me leave
but as this title honours me and mine
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
king edward i blame not her she could say little less
and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long'
that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
till we meet warwick with his foreign pow'r exeunt
warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick
and but attended by a simple guard
you that will follow me to this attempt
second watchman what will he not to bed
that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
enter warwick clarence oxford somerset
the drum playing and trumpet sounding re enter warwick
and come now to create you duke of york
of thee thyself and all thy complices
unto my brother archbishop of york
warwick ay that's the first thing that we have to do
queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person
warwick may lose that now hath won the day
rivers but madam where is warwick then become
if warwick take us we are sure to die exeunt
and often but attended with weak guard
now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
huntsman better do so than tarry and be hang'd
and turnd my captive state to liberty
conceive when after many moody thoughts
warwick although my head still wear the crown
to whom the heav'ns in thy nativity
and in devotion spend my latter days
and clarence now then it is more than needful
my joy of liberty is half eclips'd
his looks are full of peaceful majesty
warwick unsavoury news but how made he escape
somerset my lord i like not of this flight of edward's
oxford ay for if edward repossess the crown
my waned state for henry's regal crown
by fair or foul means we must enter in
mayor true my good lord i know you for no less
hastings the good old man would fain that all were well
and all those friends that deign to follow me
montgomery then fare you well for i will hence again
why shall we fight if you pretend no title
montgomery ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
all long live edward the fourth
yet as we may we'll meet both thee and warwick
and many giddy people flock to him
northampton and in leicestershire shalt find
king henry farewell my hector and my troy's true hope
king henry here at the palace will i rest a while
my mercy dried their water flowing tears
enter king edward gloucester and soldiers
the sun shines hot and if we use delay
how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
drum heard
warwick o unbid spite is sportful edward come
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york
and henry is my king warwick his subject
gloucester come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
enter oxford with drum and colours
warwick o welcome oxford for we want thy help
he and his forces enter the city
king edward et tu brute wilt thou stab caesar too
and set up lancaster why trowest thou warwick
with resolution whereso'er i meet thee
gloucester welcome good clarence this is brother like
march warwick and his company follow
why ask i that my mangled body shows
have been as piercing as the mid day sun
what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst
i well might hear delivered with a groan
king edward thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
and blow it to the source from whence it came
will thither straight for willingness rids way
but cheerly seek how to redress their harms
ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
but keep our course though the rough wind say no
or else you famish that's a threefold death
and make him naked foil a man at arms
o brave young prince thy famous grandfather
ready to fight therefore be resolute

whilst i propose the self same words to the
prince of wales nay take away this scolding crookback rather

what wilt thou not where is that devils butcher
king edward he's sudden if a thing comes in his head
'tis sin to flatter 'good' was little better
the thief doth fear each bush an officer
thy father minos that denied our course

orphans for their parents' timeless death

gloucester what will the aspiring blood of lancaster
for i have often heard my mother say
i have no brother i am like no brother
clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
repurchas'd with the blood of enemies
and made the forest tremble when they roar'd
for yet i am not look'd on in the world
witness the loving kiss i give the fruit
and now what rests but that we spend the time

than my weak hearted enemies dare offer
for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
going to chapel and the voice is now
to be thy lord and master seek the king
so good so noble and so true a master
and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee

second gentleman he will deserve more
and patience her woman
out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't
katharine alas poor man
about the hour of eight which he himself

mens evil manners live in brass their virtues
lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not

toward the king first then his laws in filling
out of our easiness and childish pity

by your good favour too sharp men so noble
cromwell not sound
cromwell and i
would you expect you are strangely troublesome
out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
chamberlain 'tis now too certain
in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
they are too thin and bare to hide offences
king no sir it does not please me
not as a groom there's some of ye i see
i'm sure in me
you must be godfather and answer for her
gardiner with a true heart
as i have made ye one lords one remain
this a place to roar in fetch me a dozen crab tree staves
man alas i know not how gets the tide in
and that i would not for a cow god save her
will beget a thousand here will be father godfather
raild upon me till her pink'd porringer fell off her head
amongst 'em i think surely
as if we kept a fair here where are these porters
chamberlain as i live
porter make way there for the princess
then four noblemen bearing a canopy under which the duchess of norfolk
good queen
into whose hand i give thy life
upon this land a thousand blessings
holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her
nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
and yet no day without a deed to crown it
to see what this child does and praise my maker
the epilogue
the merciful construction of good women
king john
philip the bastard his half brother
king john
king johns palace
of thy deceased brother geffrey's son
to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
and sullen presage of your own decay
which now the manage of two kingdoms must
that e'er i heard shall i produce the men
a soldier by the honour giving hand
of that i doubt as all mens children may
bastard i know not why except to get the land
i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
with half that face would he have all my land
and in the meantime sojournd at my father's
full fourteen weeks before the course of time
in sooth good friend your father might have kept
than was his will to get me as i think
lest men should say 'look where three farthings goes'
yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear
bastard brother by th' mother's side give me your hand
and have is have however men do catch
a foot of honour better than i was
why then i suck my teeth and catechize
and talking of the alps and apennines
but from the inward motion to deliver
what brings you here to court so hastily
bastard james gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
we know his handiwork therefore good mother
legitimation name and all is gone
which was so strongly urg'd past my defence
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
france before angiers
to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
king philip a noble boy who would not do thee right
and confident from foreign purposes
against the brows of this resisting town
and then we shall repent each drop of blood
hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
our just and lineal entrance to our own
that thou hast under wrought his lawful king
and this his son england was geffrey's right
that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
as thine was to thy husband and this boy
bastard hear the crier
bastard it lies as sightly on the back of him
in right of arthur do i claim of thee
give it a plum a cherry and a fig
ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd
being but the second generation
and all for her a plague upon her
whose title they admit arthur's or johns
before the eye and prospect of your town
by the compulsion of their ordinance
to make a shaking fever in your walls
of him it holds stands young plantagenet
to him that owes it namely this young prince
but if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
for him and in his right we hold this town
king philip as many and as well born bloods as those
bastard saint george that swing'd the dragon and e'er since
bastard speed then to take advantage of the field
many a widow's husband grovelling lies
commander of this hot malicious day
open your gates and give the victors way
enter the two kings with their powers at several doors
rather lost more and by this hand i swear
the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
citizen the king of england when we know the king
bastard by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
till their soul fearing clamours have brawld down
to whom in favour she shall give the day
turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
king john speak on with favour we are bent to hear
such as she is in beauty virtue birth
do glorify the banks that bound them in
lions more confident mountains and rocks
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown
this friendly treaty of our threat'ned town
shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
i do protest i never lov'd myself
blanch my uncle's will in this respect is mine
that i can find should merit any hate
full thirty thousand marks of english coin
is not the lady constance in this troop
to our own vantage
go we as well as haste will suffer us
that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
this sway of motion this commodity
but for because he hath not woo'd me yet
gain be my lord for i will worship thee exit
i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
with my vex'd spirits i cannot take a truce
salisbury as true as i believe you think them false
this news hath made thee a most ugly man
patch'd with foul moles and eye offending marks
and with her golden hand hath pluck'd on france
i may not go without you to the kings
enter king john king philip lewis blanch
constance rising a wicked day and not a holy day
no bargains break that are not this day made
but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
austria lady constance peace
a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
austria thou dar'st not say so villain for thy life
why thou against the church our holy mother
to charge me to an answer as the pope
king philip brother of england you blaspheme in this
against the pope and count his friends my foes
that i have room with rome to curse awhile
how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
austria well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs
constance o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
king john the king is mov'd and answers not to this
and the conjunction of our inward souls
with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
and make a riot on the gentle brow
a mother's curse on her revolting son
that is to be the champion of our church
and falsehood cures as fire cools fire
and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
but in despair die under the black weight
o husband hear me ay alack how new
be stronger with thee than the name of wife
bastard old time the clock setter that bald sexton time
grandam i will not wish thy wishes thrive
the blood and dearest valu'd blood of france
some airy devil hovers in the sky
will bring this labour to an happy end exeunt
arthur o this will make my mother die with grief
i leave your highness grandam i will pray
and with advantage means to pay thy love
yet it shall come for me to do thee good
or if that surly spirit melancholy
then in despite of brooded watchful day
he is a very serpent in my way
king john enough
france the french king's camp
o'erbearing interruption spite of france
holding th' eternal spirit against her will
thou hate and terror to prosperity
constance no no i will not having breath to cry
young arthur is my son and he is lost
if i were mad i should forget my son
sticking together in calamity
and father cardinal i have heard you say
and so he'll die and rising so again
remembers me of all his gracious parts
my widow comfort and my sorrows' cure exit
on their departure most of all show evil
pandulph your mind is all as youthful as your blood
a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
pandulph how green you are and fresh in this old world
no common wind no customed event
of all his people shall revolt from him
to train ten thousand english to their side
england a castle
young lad come forth i have to say with you
young gentlemen would be as sad as night
hubert aside if i talk to him with his innocent prate
turning dispiteous torture out of door
i knit my handkerchief about your brows
but you at your sick service had a prince
the iron of itself though heat red hot
hubert stamps come forth
and i will sit as quiet as a lamb
let him come back that his compassion may
hubert is this your promise go to hold your tongue
arthur no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
and like a dog that is compelld to fight
arthur o now you look like hubert all this while
much danger do i undergo for thee exeunt
fresh expectation troubled not the land
pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done
for putting on so new a fashiond robe
to overbear it and we are all well pleas'd
pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these
the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
king john let it be so i do commit his youth
what we so fear'd he had a charge to do
he tells us arthur is deceas'd to night
so thrive it in your game and so farewell
no certain life achiev'd by others' death
for when you should be told they do prepare
three days before but this from rumour's tongue
with these in tidings
to any tongue speak it of what it will
to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes
exit hubert with peter
and thrust thyself into their companies
bastard the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
cuts off his tale and talks of arthur's death
to understand a law to know the meaning
quoted and signd to do a deed of shame
when i spake darkly what i purposed
out of my sight and never see me more
is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
and make them tame to their obedience
enter arthur on the walls
heaven take my soul and england keep my bones
bigot to morrow morning let us meet him then
return and tell him so we know the worst
salisbury murder as hating what himself hath done
of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
bastard it is a damned and a bloody work
the incense of a vow a holy vow
salisbury o he is bold and blushes not at death
lest i by marking of your rage forget
bastard keep the peace i say
hubert lord bigot i am none
th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter house
bastard ha i'll tell thee what
will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
i left him well
now for the bare pick'd bone of majesty
a thousand businesses are brief in hand
king john now keep your holy word go meet the french
that present med'cine must be minist'red
king john is this ascension day did not the prophet
to offer service to your enemy
but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
away and glister like the god of war
and he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
and find no check let us my liege to arms
enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke bigot and soldiers
a voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
but such is the infection of the time
upon the spot of this enforced cause
lewis a noble temper dost thou show in this
this show'r blown up by tempest of the soul
come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
pandulph hail noble prince of france
lewis your grace shall pardon me i will not back
you taught me how to know the face of right
what men provided what munition sent
no no on my soul it never shall be said
what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
from out the circle of his territories
shall that victorious hand be feebled here
their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
not trusting to this halting legate here
alarums enter king john and hubert
messenger be of good comfort for the great supply
england another part of the battlefield
salisbury when we were happy we had other names
and i with him and many moe with me
since i must lose the use of all deceit
paying the fine of rated treachery
in peace and part this body and my soul
even to our ocean to great king john
but stay'd and made the western welkin blush
messenger the count melun is slain the english lords
lewis keep good quarter and good care to night
hubert what's that to thee why may i not demand
hubert unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
bastard show me the very wound of this ill news
yet speaks and peradventure may recover
these lincoln washes have devoured them
doth by the idle comments that it makes
than when you left him even now he sung
who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
there is so hot a summer in my bosom
through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north
on unreprievable condemned blood
and then all this thou seest is but a clod
prince henry even so must i run on and even so stop
to push destruction and perpetual shame
bastard he will the rather do it when he sees
with other princes that may best be spar'd
salisbury and the like tender of our love we make
come the three corners of the world in arms
first emperor of rome

flavius hence home you idle creatures get you home
but as you would say a cobbler
second commoner truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i
marullus wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
be gone
see whether their basest metal be not moved
so do you too where you perceive them thick
caesar calpurnia
the barren touched in this holy chase
cry caesar speak caesar is turnd to hear
cassius will you go see the order of the course
you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
among which number cassius be you one
cassius 'tis just
that you would have me seek into myself
to every new protester if you know
brutus i would not cassius yet i love him well
well honor is the subject of my story
caesar said to me darest thou cassius now
i as aeneas our great ancestor
his coward lips did from their color fly
brutus another general shout
brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
when went there by an age since the great flood
brutus that you do love me i am nothing jealous
brutus had rather be a villager
what hath proceeded worthy note today
antony caesar
so soon as that spare cassius he reads much
i rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
casca why there was a crown offered him and being offered him
shouted
was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it
speechless
herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet
brutus and after that he came thus sad away
there was more foolery yet if could remember it
cassius so is he now in execution
cassius i will do so till then think of the world
in several hands in at his windows throw
cicero good even casca brought you caesar home
either there is a civil strife in heaven
who glaz'd upon me and went surly by
for i believe they are portentous things
casca farewell cicero exit cicero
submitting me unto the perilous night
cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life
their natures and preformed faculties
in personal action yet prodigious grown
and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
never lacks power to dismiss itself
he were no lion were not romans hinds
casca you speak to casca and to such a man
and i do know by this they stay for me
cinna to find out you who's that metellus cimber
and look you lay it in the praetor's chair

re enter lucius
lucius i will sir exit

brutus 'tis good go to the gate somebody knocks
the nature of an insurrection
by any mark of favor
to hide thee from prevention
which every noble roman bears of you
decius here lies the east doth not the day break here
stands as the capitol directly here
to kindle cowards and to steel with valor
that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him
brutus o name him not let us not break with him
if he improve them may well stretch so far
o that we then could come by caesar's spirit
which so appearing to the common eyes
and that were much he should for he is given
for he is superstitious grown of late
and bears with glasses elephants with holes
metellus caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
let not our looks put on our purposes
enter portia
you stared upon me with ungentle looks
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
to walk unbraced and suck up the humors
by all your vows of love and that great vow
is it excepted i should know no secrets
portia if this were true then should i know this secret
here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
re enter lucius with ligarius
had you a healthful ear to hear of it
brutus that must we also what it is my caius
enter caesar in his nightgown
calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
will come when it will come
that caesar is more dangerous than he
let me upon my knee prevail in this
cannot is false and that i dare not falser
that is enough to satisfy the senate
hath begg'd that i will stay at home today
decius i have when you have heard what i can say
pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
caesar welcome publius

caesar good friends go in and taste some wine with me

brutus what said popilius lena
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes
that caesar and his senate must redress
that will be thaw'd from the true quality
for the repealing of my banish'd brother

unshaked of motion and that i am he

brutus where's publius
but we the doers

next caius cassius do i take your hand

that were you antony the son of caesar
that antony speak in his funeral
it shall advantage more than do us wrong
antony be it so

fourth citizen what does he say of brutus
antony friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
so are they all all honorable men
yet brutus says he was ambitious
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
fourth citizen mark'd ye his words he would not take the crown
your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds
you are not wood you are not stones but men
whose daggers have stabb'd caesar i do fear it
second citizen descend
the first time ever caesar put it on
for brutus as you know was caesar's angel
then i and you and all of us fell down
fourth citizen o traitors villains

all we'll mutiny
antony here is the will and under caesar's seal
and to your heirs forever common pleasures

i have no will to wander forth of doors
third citizen ay and truly you were best
fourth citizen for your dwelling briefly

lepidus upon condition publius shall not live
the three fold world divided he should stand
either led or driven as we point the way
to wind to stop to run directly on
are levying powers we must straight make head
scene ii
hath given me some worthy cause to wish
nor with such free and friendly conference
they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
first soldier stand
before the eyes of both our armies here
let lucius and titinius guard our door exeunt
cassius in such a time as this it is not meet
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
for so much trash as may be grasped thus
brutus i say you are not
go show your slaves how choleric you are
let it appear so make your vaunting true
brutus no
for certain sums of gold which you denied me
to lock such rascal counters from his friends
cassius you love me not
set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
brutus sheathe your dagger
brutus when i spoke that i was ill temper'd too
he'll think your mother chides and leave you so
for i have seen more years i'm sure than ye
cassius and come yourselves and bring messala with you
cassius how 'scaped killing when i cross'd you so

'tis better that the enemy seek us

young man thou couldst not die more honorable
the storm is up and all is on the hazard
as pompey was am i compelld to set

cassius now most noble brutus
which he did give himself i know not how
that ever brutus will go bound to rome
if not 'tis true this parting was well made
let them set on at once for i perceive
i slew the coward and did take it from him
are those my tents where i perceive the fire
and tell me what thou notest about the field
now titinius now some light o he lights too
thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath
far from this country pindarus shall run
messala is not that he that lies upon the ground
messala mistrust of good success hath done this deed
for piercing steel and darts envenomed
but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
messala lo yonder and titinius mourning it
it is impossible that ever rome

if you be well pleas'd with this
whether those peals of praise be his or no
that only to stand high in your account
as from her lord her governor her king
bassanio madam you have bereft me of all words
o then be bold to say bassanio's dead
bassanio with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
with oaths of love at last if promise last
ducats
i bid my very friends and countrymen
and i have reason for it signior antonio
i know he will be glad of our success
that this same paper brings you
my state was nothing i should then have told you
from lisbon barbary and india
and doth impeach the freedom of the state
that he did owe him and i know my lord
bassanio for me three thousand ducats
to pay the petty debt twenty times over
jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible i
venice a street
the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder
solanio it is the most impenetrable cur
antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law
to see me pay his debt and then i care not exeunt
how dear a lover of my lord your husband
being the bosom lover of my lord
i have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow
i shall obey you in an fair commands
now balthasar
but get thee gone i shall be there before thee
i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell
at the park gate and therefore haste away
that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
christian
thus get my wife into corners
if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i
lorenzo will you cover then sir
lorenzo o dear discretion how his words are suited
for having such a blessing in his lady
hast thou of me as she is for a wife
enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio gratiano salerio
his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
shylock the world thinks and i think so too
glancing an eye of pity on his losses
to have the due and forfeit of my bond
some men there are love not a gaping pig
must yield to such inevitable shame
shylock hates any man the thing he would not kill
when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
i would not draw them i would have my bond
be seasond with such viands' you will answer
come here to day
drops earliest to the ground and so let me
thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can
governd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter
a young and learned doctor to our court
of rome his name is balthazar i acquainted him with the cause
enter portia for balthazar dressed like a doctor of laws
duke of venice antonio and old shylock both stand forth
portia then must the jew be merciful
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much
if this will not suffice it must appear
shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel
a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
to alter me i stay here on my bond
how much more elder art thou than thy looks
shylock is it so nominated in the bond
to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
and he repents not that he pays your debt
if she were by to hear you make the offer
we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
gratiano o learned judge mark jew a learned judge
but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more
shylock give me my principal and let me go
i'll stay no longer question
and the offender's life lies in the mercy
and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
you take my house when you do take the prop
that lately stole his daughter
portia clerk draw a deed of gift
portia i humbly do desire your grace of pardon
three thousand ducats due unto the jew
bassanio dear sir of force i must attempt you further
i will not shame myself to give you this
bassanio good sir this ring was given me by my wife
let his deservings and my love withal
enter portia and nerissa
portia that cannot be
that they did give the rings away to men
and they did make no noise in such a night
upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
did young lorenzo swear he lov'd her well
stephano a friend
lorenzo he is not nor we have not heard from him
launcelot sola where where
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
the man that hath no music in himself
nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle
portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
or i am much deceiv'd of portia
portia go in nerissa
bassanio we should hold day with the antipodes
for as i hear he was much bound for you
gratiano about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
gave it a judge's clerk no god's my judge
to part so slightly with your wife's first gift
bassanio aside why i were best to cut my left hand off
bassanio if i could add a lie unto a fault
if you did know for whom i gave the ring
if you had pleas'd to have defended it
even he that had held up the very life
since he hath got the jewel that i loved
nerissa and i his clerk therefore be well advis'd
portia mark you but that
my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
in lieu of this last night did lie with me
and even but now returnd i have not yet
gratiano were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
nerissa ay and i'll give them him without a fee
and we will answer all things faithfully

mess my lord your brother john is ta'en in flight
othello the moor general of the venetian forces
bianca mistress of cassio
that thou iago who hast had my purse
but he as loving his own pride and purposes
that never set a squadron in the field
he in good time must his lieutenant be
iago o sir content you
keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
but seeming so for my peculiar end
proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
iago awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves
your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
brabantio the worser welcome
to make this bitter to thee
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
at this odd even and dull watch o' the night
your daughter if you have not given her leave
this accident is not unlike my dream
which even now stands in act that for their souls
servants with torches
brabantio o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood
roderigo i think i can discover him if you please
yet do i hold it very stuff o' the conscience
are you fast married be assured of this
which when i know that boasting is an honor
you were best go in
and he requires your haste post haste appearance
the senate hath sent about three several quests
cassio to who
roderigo signior it is the moor
if she in chains of magic were not bound
that weaken motion i'll have't disputed on
without a prompter where will you that i go
first officer 'tis true most worthy signior
scene iii
as in these cases where the aim reports
duke now what's the business
that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes
first officer here is more news
with his free duty recommends you thus
to brabantio i did not see you welcome gentle signior
brabantio my daughter o my daughter
and you of her the bloody book of law
brabantio nothing but this is so
their dearest action in the tented field
brabantio a maiden never bold
that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
or came it by request and such fair question
othello ancient conduct them you best know the place
from year to year the battles sieges fortunes
wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
devour up my discourse which i observing
she swore in faith 'twas strange 'twas passing strange
here comes the lady let her witness it
light on the man come hither gentle mistress
to you preferring you before her father
i am glad at soul i have no other child
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes
these sentences to sugar or to gall
of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
due reference of place and exhibition
to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
in me defunct and proper satisfaction
make head against my estimation
with such things else of quality and respect
your son in law is far more fair than black
of love of worldly matters and direction
roderigo it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then
our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so
be a sect or scion
to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an
venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell
a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time
iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse
to get his place and to plume up my will
i have't it is engender'd hell and night
montano methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
and quench the guards of the ever fixed pole
hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly
third gentleman come let's do so
of very expert and approved allowance
second gentleman they do discharge their shot of courtesy
does tire the ingener
the divine desdemona
and bring all cyprus comfort
cassio he is not yet arrived nor know i aught
good ancient you are welcome to emilia welcome mistress
marry before your ladyship i grant
you rise to play and go to bed to work
the thing i am by seeming otherwise
she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit
desdemona o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what
she that in wisdom never was so frail
cassio he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the
would they were clyster pipes for your sake trumpet within
if after every tempest come such calms
but that our loves and comforts should increase
othello come let us to the castle
does challenge much respect come desdemona
with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and
very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds
iago lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the
which the time shall more favorably minister
roderigo i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity
not out of absolute lust though peradventure
that judgement cannot cure which thing to do
knavery's plain face is never seen till used exit
was his pleasure should be proclaimed all offices are open and
cassio iago hath direction what to do
enter iago
provocation
iago o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you
with that which he hath drunk tonight already
and they watch too now 'mongst this flock of drunkards
iago some wine ho
drink ho are nothing to your english
he held them sixpence all too dear
those things well god's above all and there be souls must be
ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not
the one as long as the other 'tis pity of him
perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
so to the moor
roderigo beat me
help masters here's a goodly watch indeed
iago hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen
from her propriety what is the matter masters
and would in action glorious i had lost
of a night brawler give me answer to it
my blood begins my safer guides to rule
to manage private and domestic quarrel
shall nothing wrong him thus it is general
for that i heard the clink and fall of swords
yet surely cassio i believe received
desdemona what's the matter
cassio ay past all surgery
ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his
iago what was he that you followed with your sword
recovered
stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and
and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement
cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech
the inclining desdemona to subdue
directly to his good divinity of hell
so will i turn her virtue into pitch
venice
pleasure and action make the hours seem short
act iii scene i
clown are these i pray you wind instruments
but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly
of speech wilt thou do this
is that she will to virtuous desdemona
for your displeasure but all will sure be well
if you think fit or that it may be done
enter othello iago and gentlemen
enter desdemona cassio and emilia
he's never anything but your true servant
my general will forget my love and service
than give thy cause away
iago nothing my lord or if i know not what
desdemona why your lieutenant cassio good my lord
to suffer with him good love call him back
on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn
that came awooing with you and so many a time
to your own person nay when i have a suit
whate'er you be i am obedient
iago but for a satisfaction of my thought
iago my lord for aught i know
and didst contract and purse thy brow together
are tricks of custom but in a man that's just
othello nay yet there's more in this
but some uncleanly apprehensions
shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet
who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing
it is the green eyed monster which doth mock
from jealousy
is free of speech sings plays and dances well
with franker spirit therefore as i am bound
othello dost thou say so
for too much loving you
othello i will not
not to affect many proposed matches
othello farewell farewell
yet if you please to hold him off awhile
othello this fellow's of exceeding honesty
must be to loathe her o curse of marriage
re enter desdemona and emilia
desdemona faith that's with watching 'twill away again
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
emilia do not you chide i have a thing for you
iago hast stoln it from her
when she shall lack it
but with a little act upon the blood
othello avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
iago i am sorry to hear this
pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
iago is't come to this
greater than that
iago i should be wise for honesty's a fool
iago i see sir you are eaten up with passion
if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
othello give me a living reason she's disloyal
in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona
othello but this denoted a foregone conclusion
iago i know not that but such a handkerchief
'tis gone
ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
you elements that clip us round about
that cassio's not alive
enter desdemona emilia and clown
and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own
emilia i know not madam
desdemona i will not leave him now till cassio
hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
desdemona i cannot speak of this come now your promise
othello that's a fault that handkerchief
to give it her i did so and take heed ont
and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
desdemona it is not lost but what an if it were
othello the handkerchief
desdemona i ne'er saw this before
desdemona how now good cassio what's the news with you
but to know so must be my benefit
and stood within the blank of his displeasure
puff'd his own brother and can he be angry
for let our finger ache and it indues
and no conception nor no jealous toy
if i do find him fit i'll move your suit
what keep a week away seven days and nights
bianca o cassio whence came this
cassio i know not sweet i found it in my chamber
bianca but that you do not love me
othello think so iago
iago so they do nothing 'tis a venial slip
othello by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it
or voluntary dotage of some mistress
othello with her
falls in a trance
this is his second fit he had one yesterday
othello dost thou mock me
that nightly lie in those unproper beds
a passion most unsuiting such a man
i say but mark his gesture marry patience
a housewife that by selling her desires
quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant
othello now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
othello so so so so they laugh that win
the other day talking on the sea bank with certain venetians and
iago before me look where she comes
out no work ont
with you
othello i would have him nine years akilling a fine woman a fair
out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention
iago o 'tis foul in her
by midnight
othello i kiss the instrument of their pleasures
desdemona my lord
lodovico may be the letter moved him
lodovico my lord this would not be believed in venice
othello mistress
i am commanded home get you away
whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
that stroke would prove the worst
lodovico i am sorry that i am deceived in him exeunt
emilia never my lord
let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse
desdemona my lord what is your will
desdemona upon my knees what doth your speech import
othello heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
to try me with affliction had they raind
where either i must live or bear no life
who art so lovely fair and smellst so sweet
the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
othello what not a whore
you you ay you
emilia he that is yours sweet lady
the smallst opinion on my least misuse
as true hearts cannot bear
her father and her country and her friends
iago fie there is no such man it is impossible
even from the east to the west
if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
it doth abhor me now i speak the word
go in and weep not all things shall be well
what already i have foolishly suffered
iago well go to very well
roderigo ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of
in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than
fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some
thence which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and
another room in the castle
forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
we must not now displease him
desdemona my mother had a maid calld barbary
this lodovico is a proper man
the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans
desdemona sings
in such gross kind
desdemona in troth i think thou wouldst not
world for your labor 'tis a wrong in your own world and you
or scant our former having in despite
desires for sport and frailty as men have
quick quick fear nothing i'll be at thy elbow
and he grows angry now whether he kill cassio
no he must die be't so i hear him coming
falls
forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted
these may be counterfeits let's think't unsafe
iago what's the matter
to lodovico and gratiano what are you there
lodovico as you shall prove us praise us
bianca what is the matter ho who is't that cried
bianca alas he faints o cassio cassio cassio
iago signior gratiano i cry you gentle pardon
save you your labor he that lies slain here cassio
though tongues were out of use
bianca he supp'd at my house but i therefore shake not
will you go on aside this is the night
yet she must die else she'll betray more men
o balmy breath that dost almost persuade
othello have you pray'd tonight desdemona
othello ay i do
othello ay and for that thou diest
desdemona no by my life and soul
desdemona then lord have mercy on me
i saw the handkerchief
othello no his mouth is stopp'd
othello nay if you strive
emilia within what ho my lord my lord
o insupportable o heavy hour
what's the matter with thee now
and cassio killd
desdemona a guiltless death i die
emilia o the more angel she
to this extremity thy husband knew it all
an honest man he is and hates the slime
rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart
i care not for thy sword i'll make thee known
i know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain
emilia i will not charm my tongue i am bound to speak
o villainy villainy
i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
that she with cassio hath the act of shame
no i will speak as liberal as the north
for often with a solemn earnestness
othello are there not stones in heaven
but kill him rather i'll after that same villain
so come my soul to bliss as i speak true
gratiano what is the matter
and very sea mark of my utmost sail
from the possession of this heavenly sight
othello i look down towards his feet but that's a fable
an honorable murtherer if you will
from this time forth i never will speak word
othello o villain
cassio i found it in my chamber
iago set him on
i have done the state some service and they know't
albeit unused to the melting mood
othello i kiss'd thee ere i killd thee no way but this
and seize upon the fortunes of the moor
dramatis personae
earl berkeley
captain of a band of welshmen two gardeners
act i scene i
king richard tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
high stomach'd are they both and full of ire
namely to appeal each other of high treason
my body shall make good upon this earth
mowbray let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
these terms of treason doubled down his throat
meantime let this defend my loyalty
what i have spoke or thou canst worst devise
bolingbroke look what i speak my life shall prove it true
fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
and by the glorious worth of my descent
as he is but my father's brother's son
disburs'd i duly to his highness' soldiers
once did i lay an ambush for your life
upon this overweening traitor's foot
our doctors say this is no month to bleed
mowbray myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
give me his gage lions make leopards tame
then dear my liege mine honour let me try
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
justice design the victor's chivalry
which made the fault that we cannot correct
some of those branches by the destinies cut
yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
thou goest to coventry there to behold
with her companion grief must end her life
i shall remember more bid him ah what
scene 3
gaunt bushy bagot green and others when they are set
speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath
a traitor to my god my king and me
before king richard in his royal lists
marshal on pain of death no person be so bold
marshal the appellant in all duty greets your highness
against a bird do i with mowbray fight
to reach at victory above my head
of thy adverse pernicious enemy
this feast of battle with mine adversary
bolingbroke strong as a tower in hope i cry amen
on pain to be found false and recreant
and both return back to their chairs again
and for we think the eagle winged pride
therefore we banish you our territories
which i with some unwillingness pronounce
the language i have learnt these forty years
is made my gaoler to attend on me
lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands
to plot contrive or complot any ill
since thou hast far to go bear not along
i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
for ere the six years that he hath to spend
thou canst help time to furrow me with age
o had it been a stranger not my child
flourish exit king with train
gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time
bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make
there is no virtue like necessity
suppose the singing birds musicians
or wallow naked in december snow
where'er i wander boast of this i can
king richard and say what store of parting tears were shed
that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave
how he did seem to dive into their hearts
as were our england in reversion his
we are enforc'd to farm our royal realm
bushy old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord
pray god we may make haste and come too late
enforce attention like deep harmony
my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
that is not quickly buzz'd into his ears
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
this precious stone set in the silver sea
of the world's ransom blessed mary's son
hath made a shameful conquest of itself
old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
king richard can sick men play so nicely with their names
ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
o had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
thy state of law is bondslave to the law
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
and thy unkindness be like crooked age
to wayward sickliness and age in him
words life and all old lancaster hath spent
towards our assistance we do seize to us
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face
did win what he did spend and spent not that
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
but by fair sequence and succession
king richard think what you will we seize into our hands
and we create in absence of ourself
northumberland richly in both if justice had her right
bereft and gelded of his patrimony
and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he find
willoughby the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man
ross we see the very wreck that we must suffer
northumberland then thus i have from le port blanc a bay
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
stay and be secret and myself will go
and entertain a cheerful disposition
bushy each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
of what it is not then thrice gracious queen
queen 'tis nothing less conceit is still deriv'd
queen why hopest thou so 'tis better hope he is
green ah madam 'tis too true and that is worse
queen so green thou art the midwife to my woe
who gently would dissolve the bands of life
your husband he is gone to save far off
and will i fear revolt on hereford's side
comes rushing on this woeful land at once
gentlemen will you go muster men
and meet me presently at berkeley
is near the hate of those love not the king
will the hateful commons perform for us
farewell at once for once for all and ever
draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
and hope to joy is little less in joy
percy i had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you
and sent me over by berkeley to discover
which elder days shall ripen and confirm
percy there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
shall be your love and labour's recompense
and i am come to seek that name in england
enter york attended
in an ungracious mouth is but profane
were i but now lord of such hot youth
in gross rebellion and detested treason
will you permit that i shall stand condemnd

but for his own and for the right of that
i do remain as neuter so fare you well
for i am loath to break our country's laws
salisbury stay yet another day thou trusty welshman

uncle you say the queen is at your house
the coast of wales a castle in view
as a long parted mother with her child

hath power to keep you king in spite of all
behind the globe that lights the lower world
who all this while hath revelld in the night
for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd
one day too late i fear me noble lord
did triumph in my face and they are fled
at thy great glory look not to the ground
and what loss is it to be rid of care
like an unseasonable stormy day
thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
and tell sad stories of the death of kings
infusing him with self and vain conceit
taste grief need friends subjected thus
aumerle my father hath a power inquire of him
so may you by my dull and heavy eye
of that sweet way i was in to despair
aumerle my liege one word
the welshmen are dispers'd and salisbury

welcome harry what will not this castle yield
of holy reverence who i cannot learn
even at his feet to lay my arms and power
go signify as much while here we march
be he the fire i'll be the yielding water
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
because we thought ourself thy lawful king
and we are barren and bereft of friends
the purple testament of bleeding war
harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
enfranchisement immediate on his knees
shall be accomplish'd without contradiction
that laid the sentence of dread banishment
the king shall do it must he be depos'd
a little little grave an obscure grave
or shall we play the wantons with our woes
give richard leave to live till richard die
exeunt from above
to make the base earth proud with kissing it
king richard well you deserve they well deserve to have
king richard then i must not say no flourish exeunt

and not king richard thou most beauteous inn
and cloister thee in some religious house
and fawn on rage with base humility
and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
you must to pomfret not unto the tower
and he shall think that thou which knowest the way
a twofold marriage 'twixt my crown and me
king richard ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
and piece the way out with a heavy heart
once more adieu the rest let sorrow say exeunt

thinking his prattle to be tedious
and barbarism itself have pitied him
and lasting fealty to the new made king

he plucks it out of his bosom and reads it
now by mine honour by my life my troth
duchess strike him aumerle poor boy thou art amaz'd

as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
spur post and get before him to the king
bolingbroke can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
takes on the point of honour to support
i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
what is the matter with our cousin now
bolingbroke have thy desire
bolingbroke what is the matter uncle speak
fear and not love begets his penitence
this deadly blot in thy digressing son
duchess within a woman and thine aunt great king 'tis i

bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
duchess i do not sue to stand
bolingbroke but for our trusty brother in law and the abbot

their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
for though it have holp madmen to their wits

to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
into this breathing world scarce half made up
and hate the idle pleasures of these days
dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes
he should for that commit your godfathers
and for my name of george begins with g
that made him send lord hastings to the tower

poor key cold figure of a holy king
cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
and that be heir to his unhappiness
gloucester stay you that bear the corse and set it down
and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
provokes this deluge most unnatural
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
gloucester fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
anne thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
gloucester let him thank me that holp to send him
gloucester i know so but gentle lady anne

and humbly beg the death upon my knee
gloucester then bid me kill myself and i will do it
gloucester then never was man true
wear both of them for both of them are thine
and wet his grave with my repentant tears
imagine i have said farewell already
to take her in her heart's extremest hate
stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury
my dukedom to a beggarly denier
and then return lamenting to my love
and cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes
a man that loves not me nor none of you
to your good prayer will scarcely say amen

what dreadful noise of waters in my ears
that woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
keeper awak'd you not in this sore agony
and so he vanish'd then came wand'ring by

second murderer the urging of that word judgment hath
second murderer nay i prithee stay a little i hope this
second murderer o in the duke of gloucester's purse
fac'd spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills a man
sigh
first murderer soft he wakes
clarence thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
the bitter sentence of poor clarence' death
clarence erroneous vassals the great king of kings
in quarrel of the house of lancaster
for edward for my brother for his sake
that princely novice was struck dead by thee
than edward will for tidings of my death
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
from this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven

and most assured that he is a friend

among this princely heap if any here
which i will purchase with my duteous service
i thank my god for my humility
king edward who knows not he is dead who knows
that came too lag to see him buried
derby the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you
have been beholding to him in his life
god will revenge it come lords will you go
son why do you look on us and shake your head
with earnest prayers all to that effect
and pitied me and kindly kiss'd my cheek
enter queen elizabeth with her hair about her
why grow the branches when the root is gone
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
ah for my husband for my dear lord edward
alas i am the mother of these griefs
that you take with unthankfulness his doing
and plant your joys in living edward's throne
love charity obedience and true duty
we are to reap the harvest of his son
the new heald wound of malice should break out
yet since it is but green it should be put
exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester

thus much of this will make black white foul fair
that makes the wappend widow wed again
nay stay thou out for earnest keeping some gold
that i might love thee something
phrynia thy lips rot off
maintain my opinion
voic'd so regardfully
are drownd and lost in his calamities
i had rather be alone
timon that by killing of villains
make soft thy trenchant sword for those milk paps
nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
and to make whores a bawd hold up you sluts
be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs
that he may never more false title plead
the source of all erection there's more gold
timon yes thou spok'st well of me
whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd
teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
by putting on the cunning of a carper
timon were i like thee i'd throw away myself
of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
timon why dost thou seek me out
outlives incertain pomp is crownd before
the sweet degrees that this brief world affords
that numberless upon me stuck as leaves
to some she beggar and compounded thee
i'd give thee leave to hang it get thee gone
timon thee thither in a whirlwind if thou wilt
apemantus where wouldst thou send it
apemantus an th' hadst hated medlars sooner thou shouldst have
wouldst thou do with the world apemantus if it lay in thy
ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and
be that were not subject to a beast and what beast art thou
timon when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be
timon away thou issue of a mangy dog
timon rogue rogue rogue
thou ever young fresh lov'd and delicate wooer
but not till i am dead i'll say th' hast gold
fragment some slender ort of his remainder the mere want of
second bandit 'tis his description
the oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips
here's gold go suck the subtle blood o' th' grape
the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves
i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er
enter flavius to timon
when man was wish'd to love his enemies
flavius an honest poor servant of yours
but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping
forgive my general and exceptless rashness
for many so arrive at second masters
that which i show heaven knows is merely love
have sent thee treasure go live rich and happy
and comfort you my master
poet to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that he's
they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his
the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most

painter our late noble master
the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
timon most honest men why how shall i requite you
painter so so my lord
timon you'll take it ill
that he's a made up villain
each man apart all single and alone
flavius it is vain that you would speak with timon
offering the fortunes of his former days
for each true word a blister and each false
the senators with one consent of love
and send forth us to make their sorrowed render
and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators
against the walls of athens
in pity of our aged and our youth
timon why i was writing of my epitaph
first senator that's well spoke
that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
what is amiss plague and infection mend

whom though in general part we were oppos'd
the enemies' drum is heard and fearful scouring
dead sure and this his grave what's on this tomb
our terrible approach
shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
transformed timon to our city's love
who were the motives that you first went out
for those that were it is not square to take
thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
shall make their harbour in our town till we
but shall be render'd to your public laws

quintus
sons to tamora
a nurse and a black child
saturninus noble patricians patrons of my right
were gracious in the eyes of royal rome
know that the people of rome for whom we stand
hath yok'd a nation strong traind up in arms
returns the good andronicus to rome
bassianus marcus andronicus so i do affy
saturninus friends that have been thus forward in my right
enter a captain
and quintus two other sons then titus andronicus
to re salute his country with his tears
here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
how many sons hast thou of mine in store
tamora stay roman brethen gracious conqueror
o if to fight for king and commonweal
religiously they ask a sacrifice
alarbus goes to rest and we survive
mutius the sons of andronicus with their swords bloody
in peace and honour rest you here my sons
lo at this tomb my tributary tears
enter above marcus andronicus and tribunes
that hath aspir'd to solons happiness
titus a better head her glorious body fits
in right and service of their noble country
andronicus would thou were shipp'd to hell
of noble minds is honourable meed
reflect on rome as titans rays on earth
to us in our election this day
i hold me highly honoured of your grace
rome shall record and when i do forget
thou com'st not to be made a scorn in rome
proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum
titus traitors avaunt where is the emperor's guard
mutius my lord you pass not here
my sons would never so dishonour me
confederates all thus to dishonour me
to ruffle in the commonwealth of rome
sith priest and holy water are so near
saturninus ascend fair queen pantheon lords accompany
and titus' sons lucius quintus and martius
this monument five hundred years hath stood
quintus he that would vouch it in any place but here
the brother and the sons kneel
the greeks upon advice did bury ajax
lucius there lie thy bones sweet mutius with thy friends
that brought her for this high good turn so far
thou and thy faction shall repent this rape
by all the duties that i owe to rome
titus prince bassianus leave to plead my deeds
tamora not so my lord the gods of rome forfend
dissemble all your griefs and discontents
to whom i sued for my dear sons life
a roman now adopted happily
you shall ask pardon of his majesty
and at my lovely tamora's entreats
to hunt the panther and the hart with me
advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach
and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
and see his shipwreck and his commonweals
i am as able and as fit as thou
till you know better how to handle it
nor would your noble mother for much more
aaron away i say
this discord's ground the music would not please
chiron aaron a thousand deaths
though bassianus be the emperor's brother
demetrius aaron thou hast hit it
that you affect and so must you resolve
and many unfrequented plots there are
but to your wishes' height advance you both
per styga per manes vehor exeunt
that all the court may echo with the noise
i promised your grace a hunter's peal
will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
to bury so much gold under a tree
tamora my lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad
let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise
aaron madam though venus govern your desires
hark tamora the empress of my soul
which dreads not yet their lives' destruction
to see the general hunting in this forest
are singled forth to try thy experiments
if foul desire had not conducted you
enter chiron and demetrius
and when they show'd me this abhorred pit
and leave me to this miserable death
chiron and this for me struck home to show my strength
and with that painted hope braves your mightiness
lavinia o tamora thou bearest a womans face
yet every mother breeds not sons alike
nothing so kind but something pitiful
therefore away with her and use her as you will
and tumble me into some loathsome pit
this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him
of titus' sons quintus and martius
upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood
from this unhallow'd and blood stained hole
o tell me who it is for ne'er till now
and shows the ragged entrails of this pit
of this deep pit poor bassianus' grave
into this gaping hollow of the earth
re enter tamora with
in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
o tamora was ever heard the like
some never heard of torturing pain for them
titus i did my lord yet let me be their bail
fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
demetrius see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me
like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind
shall i speak for thee shall i say 'tis so
that could have better sew'd than philomel
for such a sight will blind a father's eye
titus hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
because they died in honour's lofty bed
in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still
the tribunes hear you not no man is by
who though they cannot answer my distress
rises
from these devourers to be banished
titus faint hearted boy arise and look upon her
in bootless prayer have they been held up
where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
now i behold thy lively body so
perchance because she knows them innocent
how they are staind like meadows yet not dry
to make us wonder'd at in time to come
that to her brother which i said to thee
and send it to the king he for the same
shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn
aaron nay come agree whose hand shall go along
titus agree between you i will spare my hand
he cuts off titus' hand
aaron i go andronicus and for thy hand
do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
then into limits could i bind my woes
for why my bowels cannot hide her woes
that woe is me to think upon thy woes
where life hath no more interest but to breathe
even like a stony image cold and numb
and would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
exeunt all but lucius
and make proud saturnine and his emperess
as will revenge these bitter woes of ours
when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
titus how now has sorrow made thee dote already
if marcus did not name the word of hands
nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife
and buzz lamenting doings in the air
flattering myself as if it were the moor
i'll to thy closet and go read with thee
follows me everywhere i know not why
ah boy cornelia never with more care
although my lord i know my noble aunt
some book there is that she desires to see
titus lucius what book is that she tosseth so
marcus see brother see note how she quotes the leaves
unless the gods delight in tragedies
staff and guides it with feet and mouth
and guides it with stumps and writes
and arm the minds of infants to exclaims
but if you hunt these bear whelps then beware
and where's our lesson then boy what say you
presents that i intend to send them both
marcus attend him in his ecstasy
he hath some message to deliver us
to gratify your honourable youth
non eget mauri iaculis nec arcu'
but let her rest in her unrest awhile
demetrius i would we had a thousand roman dames
chiron belike for joy the emperor hath a son
what dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms
nurse a joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
aaron villain i have done thy mother
nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
nor great alcides nor the god of war
to keep mine own excuse it how she can
chiron i blush to think upon this ignomy
he is enfranchised and come to light
they sit
two may keep counsel when the third's away
his wife but yesternight was brought to bed
pointing to the nurse
herself and hers are highly bound to thee
to be a warrior and command a camp
terras astrea reliquit
i pray you deliver him this petition
and kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
and vengeance on the traitor saturnine
and pull her out of acheron by the heels
'ad jovem' that's for you here 'ad apollinem'
titus now masters draw they shoot o well said lucius
and who should find them but the empress' villain
titus but what says jupiter i ask thee
marcus why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your
supplication
and when thou hast given it to the emperor
an emperor in rome thus overborne
his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
shall be no shelter to these outrages
and rather comfort his distressed plight
tamora empress i am but yonder sits the emperor
shall i endure this monstrous villainy
enter nuntius aemilius
these tidings nip me and i hang the head
and will revolt from me to succour him
with words more sweet and yet more dangerous
to aemilius go thou before to be our ambassador
to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths
which signifies what hate they bear their emperor
be bold in us we'll follow where thou lead'st
and as i earnestly did fix mine eye
they never do beget a coal black calf
this is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye
a sight to vex the father's soul withal
thy child shall live and i will see it nourish'd
aaron swear that he shall and then i will begin
and keeps the oath which by that god he swears
to that which thou shalt hear of me anon
as sure a card as ever won the set
wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it
and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
accuse some innocent and forswear myself
'let not your sorrow die though i am dead'
but to torment you with my bitter tongue
he craves a parley at your father's house
tamora thus in this strange and sad habiliment
is it your trick to make me ope the door
tamora if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me
i am revenge sent from th' infernal kingdom
revenge which makes the foul offender quake
provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
tamora these are my ministers and come with me
tamora this closing with him fits his lunacy
see here he comes and i must ply my theme
and would you represent our queen aright
and when thou find'st a man that's like thyself
they have been violent to me and mine
and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
feast at my house and he shall feast with them
with him
to lay a complot to betray thy foes
titus fie publius fie thou art too much deceiv'd
stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
you killd her husband and for that vile fault
whiles that lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
this is the feast that i have bid her to
to make this banquet which i wish may prove
and his child in the arms of an attendant
i fear the emperor means no good to us
saturninus what hath the firmament more suns than one
trumpets sounding enter titus
tamora we are beholding to you good andronicus
titus a reason mighty strong and effectual
saturninus what was she ravish'd tell who did the deed
'tis true 'tis true witness my knife's sharp point
scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
cannot induce you to attend my words
nor can i utter all our bitter grief
and they it were that ravished our sister
i am the turned forth be it known to you
marcus now is my turn to speak behold the child
now have you heard the truth what say you romans
and bring our emperor gently in thy hand
lucius thanks gentle romans may i govern so
thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips
marcus how many thousand times hath these poor lips
a roman you sad andronici have done with woes
i should repent the evils i have done

sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses diomedes menelaus and others
nor princes is it matter new to us
but the protractive trials of great jove
lies rich in virtue and unmingled
the strong ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
besides the applause and approbation
thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak
and look how many grecian tents do stand
and therefore is the glorious planet sol
divert and crack rend and deracinate
take but degree away untune that string
then everything includes itself in power
it hath to climb the generals disdaind
the fever whereof all our power is sick
and with ridiculous and awkward action
'tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquar'd
yet god achilles still cries 'excellent
all our abilities gifts natures shapes
in such a rein in full as proud a place
forestall prescience and esteem no act
or those that with the fineness of their souls
aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince
i ask that i might waken reverence
but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
agamemnon what's your affair i pray you
he tells thee so himself
and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
shall make it good or do his best to do it
agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas
one noble man that hath one spark of fire
agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand

however it is spread in general name
ulysses and wake him to the answer think you

achilles well why so i do
lord achilles ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts
thersites i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not
ajax well go to go to
thersites there's ulysses and old nestor whose wit was mouldy ere
i
that hath a stomach and such a one that dare
thus once again says nestor from the greeks
more spongy to suck in the sense of fear
to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
with spans and inches so diminutive
and reason flies the object of all harm
hector brother she is not worth what she doth cost
without some image of th' affected merit
when we have soild them nor the remainder viands
why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt
and do a deed that never fortune did
cassandra within cry troyans
cry troyans cry practise your eyes with tears
can qualify the same
and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
to stand the push and enmity of those
paris sir i propose not merely to myself
there's not the meanest spirit on our party
unlike young men whom aristode thought
than wife is to the husband if this law
to have her back returnd thus to persist

nestor then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
are legs for necessity not for flexure
cannot outfly our apprehensions
than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself
not portable lie under this report
ajax is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a better
his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself
in will peculiar and in self admission
and batters down himself what should i say
that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
that were to enlard his fat already pride
ajax an 'a be proud with me i'll pheeze his pride
ajax an all men were a my mind
nestor our noble general do not do so

ulysses i do not strain at the position
fronting the sun receives and renders back
ajax renownd o heavens what some men do
achilles i do believe it for they pass'd by me
quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
lie there for pavement to the abject rear
high birth vigour of bone desert in service
that all the greeks begin to worship ajax
i have strong reasons
keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home
in time of action i stand condemnd for this
my fame is shrewdly gor'd
to see us here unarm'd i have a womans longing
achilles how so
fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the mans
arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make his demands

by friendship nor by speaking
cressida and is it true that i must go from troy
even in the birth of our own labouring breath
distasted with the salt of broken tears
when shall we see again
and i will see thee
the grecian youths are full of quality
so mainly as my merit i cannot sing
and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
and by the way possess thee what she is
troilus grecian thou dost not use me courteously

julia 'to julia' say from whom
and you an officer fit for the place

and not depending on his friendly wish
proteus my lord i cannot be so soon provided
lest he should take exceptions to my love
proteus why this it is my heart accords thereto
ah silvia silvia
valentine why how know you that i am in love
after dinner when you look'd sadly it was for want of money
physician to comment on your malady
valentine what dost thou know
speed you never saw her since she was deform'd
valentine what should i see then
speed i would you were set so your affection would cease
now will he interpret to her
silvia i thank you gentle servant 'tis very clerkly done

i would have had them writ more movingly
he being her pupil to become her tutor
speed by a letter i should say

speed ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on
julia if you turn not you will return the sooner
my father stays my coming answer not
alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb exeunt
hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this
for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand
tears
panthino tut man i mean thou'lt lose the flood and in losing
to fill it with my tears if the wind were down i could drive
valentine mistress
thurio so do counterfeits
thurio how
silvia who is that servant
silvia no more gentlemen no more here comes my father
and not without desert so well reputed
yet hath sir proteus for that's his name
as meet to be an emperor's counsellor
valentine this is the gentleman i told your ladyship
valentine to see such lovers thurio as yourself
silvia too low a mistress for so high a servant
proteus that you are worthless
proteus your friends are well and have them much commended
with nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs
upon the very naked name of love
valentine then speak the truth by her if not divine
should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
and i as rich in having such a jewel
valentine ay and we are betroth'd nay more our marriage hour
and then i'll presently attend you
she is fair and so is julia that i love
'tis but her picture i have yet beheld
launce forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not welcome i

launce what a block art thou that thou canst not my staff
speed the conclusion is then that it will
speed i tell thee my master is become a hot lover
enter proteus
but now i worship a celestial sun
if i keep them i needs must lose myself
aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend
but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross
are visibly character'd and engrav'd
lucetta better forbear till proteus make return
julia the more thou dam'st it up the more it burns
i'll be as patient as a gentle stream
lucetta why then your ladyship must cut your hair
julia out out lucetta that will be ill favour'd
lucetta then never dream on infamy but go
but truer stars did govern proteus' birth
to take a note of what i stand in need of
duke sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile
this night intends to steal away your daughter
being unprevented to your timeless grave
i gave him gentle looks thereby to find
for which the youthful lover now is gone
enter valentine
that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
neither regarding that she is my child
valentine what would your grace have me to do in this
dumb jewels often in their silent kind
take no repulse whatever she doth say
valentine why then i would resort to her by night
so bold leander would adventure it
under a cloak that is of any length
i'll be so bold to break the seal for once reads
that they should harbour where their lord should be'
and think my patience more than thy desert
but as thou lov'st thy life make speed from hence exit
there is no music in the nightingale
proteus run boy run run seek him out
valentine nothing
for they are harsh untuneable and bad
from hence from silvia and from me thy friend
as if but now they waxed pale for woe
have some malignant power upon my life
thy letters may be here though thou art hence
bid him make haste and meet me at the northgate
she hath had gossips yet 'tis a maid for she is her master's
launce with my master's ship why it is at sea

brew good ale
launce then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for
read on
launce out with that too it was eve's legacy and cannot be ta'en
launce of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down she is slow
the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the
speed for me
rejoice in the boy's correction exit
trenched in ice which with an hour's heat
duke so i believe but thurio thinks not so
how she opposes her against my will
therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
proteus you have prevaild my lord if i can do it
duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind
proteus as much as i can do i will effect
moist it again and frame some feeling line
will well become such sweet complaining grievance

when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches

torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd's son who
lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing

my life may last to answer
excels whatever yet you look'd upon
leontes her natural posture

camillo my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
if i had thought the sight of my poor image

1609
upon her head a platted hive of straw
that seasoned woe had pelleted in tears
the mind and sight distractedly commixed
which one by one she in a river threw
with sleided silk feat and affectedly
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
if that from him there may be aught applied
'but woe is me too early i attended
what's sweet to do to do will aptly find
if best were as it was or best without
proud of subjection noble by the sway
came for additions yet their purposed trim
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assigned
'yet did i not as some my equals did
to put the by past perils in her way
though reason weep and cry it is thy last
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and so much less of shame in me remains
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
with the annexions of fair gems enriched
'lo all these trophies of affections hot
hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise
to spend her living in eternal love
upon the moment did her force subdue
must for your victory us all congest
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
lending soft audience to my sweet design
'o father what a hell of witchcraft lies
shook off my sober guards and civil fears
or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows
that th' unexperient gave the tempter place
would yet again betray the fore betrayed
