pave their streets dreams
as new city sinks despise
crew gone ship left behind
channel open they're coming through
abduction begins memory lost
our time keeps us measured
eyes shut yet still march forward
skies filled our fathers watching
embrace them call them father
do trust them or are their tools
dream death dream death
i'll fight
godz are sworn treason
his world made steel
symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
failures scratch carve lines
alone he accepts all blame
what all are
predecessors
wait inside us
together stand
barbaric approach
as destiny stands
you'll never retreat
never wake from these dreams destiny
all are silent
chorus
deceived by betrayers
nothing left
burned bridges too late
nothing left
nothing left
signals warning message from space
he's coming town he rager
denying conformists alive lights

well dont blues
always road
let's start makin plans
all those little things used do
little hometown or big old city
life goes little bitty while
little hometown or big old city
except an old coke sign from 1950
killed little man
he wouldnt sell beer
they dont even realize
god bless little man
without somebody nothing aint worth dime
livin love
but love can walk through fire without blinkin
cant eat cant sleep
it's turning every way but loose
it's turning every way but loose
front porch swing
but it's real beauty
stepped pop top
yes some people claim there's woman blame
maybe should stay here
somebody said only fools rush
all eternity oh baby should stay here just
meat potato man
folks poodles dressed kids
cruise up down road
crazy bout mercury
well if had money
who vowed love
opened up present gave
then wind picked up he was gone
climbed back eagle took one last look around
smell whiskey air
keys are just collecting dust
said he missed at service
but as without love girl
cut out its heart soul
down music row
once was dead gone
mixed right up face
cant recall what even started out fight
cowboy boots nothing else at all
must've had ball last night
'cause this morning hats just little too tight
but all signs are showing
two kinds mothers told told
repeat first chorus
once lifetime love
know how lucky are
can finally go sleep get some rest
i'll always love so
please daddy dont get drunk this christmas
please daddy dont get drunk this christmas
dont want momma cry

will cling old rugged cross
can hear her thoughts

yeah thrill back heartache's gone
wish enjoyed what makes living
yeah just dream keep being way am
behind whisper name
see what can do
there goes heart fallin
there go you're doing fine
that's
but gotta try
new messiah
heaven knows
there's new kid town
but he's just another baby suppose
weak yet redundantly strong
three minute positive
little guitar then it's gone
three minute positive
not too country up tempo love song
so glad learned trust thee
made daddy wonder where good sense went
drunks dont listen crowds dont care
so count blessings when step up sing
not sure what's cause
when love one hold
smiles morning
good thing
feelings this cant wrong
watching tide ebb flow
this tropical depressions gonna
this tropical depressions gonna
light his glory grace
chorus
well found some old love letters wrote years ago
drowning dear
story heart breaking pain
cover usa today
small town down georgia over forty years ago
grandaddy rolled down two logs
except time she took job play bill or two
they taught us 'bout good living
merry christmas girl
chorus
thy hands have made
saviour god thee
how great thou art
how great thou art

hurtin comes easy

so maybe it's just better if leave this way
so maybe it's just better if leave this way
never thought love life would quite turn out this way
keeps higher than georgia pine
bu it's her sweet love packs punch
unseen things above
tell old old story
refrain
send north pole
drunk man walking down rainy street
birds bees are sure powerful stuff
hope you're feeling way feel
aint nothing new
arms still ache heart still waits
except still love
but time treasures have kept us from making plans as know
but you're looking better than did back then
longer love
just way expect
i'd wear smile endlessly
if french fries were fat free
if could have
tell it's not too late
if could hold tight
if aint one thing it's
if aint one thing it's
it's true
if love was river
if love was firefly
if love was party
everything's gonna all right know
their timing's not greatest
ole stnick tonight
if dont wanna see santa claus cry
so baby come back
i'll fly away
revealed as slip off dress
or change tides
will remain strong true
over rain
let's face eternity
repeat chorus
son god discloses

surprised still love music just as much
after year this one
surprised we're all not weeping drunks

'cause you've been crying too long
but change never waste it's never waste time
look horizon

wrongly label ed under fed treated rose as an orchid

world rushes by it's leaving here all alone
every hour just hold what can
dont give dam 'bout our reputation baby

you've got meal ticket taste
pat head

you've got love love
cause these are rules us
dont forget you're condemned
never makes easy
are branches same old tree
so
dont forget you're condemned
she would give wink across room
we'd talk about till 5am when i'd come visiting her 5 years later
thought we'd simple together
pierces chest
wealth would render this no less severe
but was sadly mistaken
sister blister fight please brothers
are this pendulum together
have made harder other
but are strangers each other
estranged from mother
they're happy we're climbing over each other
sister blister fight please brothers
want weightless flying through air
wont mayhem if ruled by own rule lessness
want weightless flying through air
sink three pointers wax poetically
one small sideways look feel so ungood
so ignorant someone sound mind
oh these little rejections how they disappear quickly
denying myself somehow make us compatible
impatience when was perfect where was
well wonder which crime biggest

male friends especially i'll no longer touch
live life as apologetic compromise
i'll listen hours wont need anything
know this sharing shame will ensure wont forget myself so easily
from hand hand
makes pain pass by
but way
makes all alright
falls from his eyes
laughing out loud
see averting glances
see abusing land
see altering history
am passion plight
see blaming each other
see forcing them out
got complicated girl
never scared finding way
all other boys never knew
line gotta keep lookin or
who am
his plastic protected pockets so his pens dont leak out upon floor
can hear call tonight
calling all superstar wonderful weirdos
were self sufficient needless
embrace faith face adversarial forces
amazed by surrender face threatening forces
surrendering feat unequalled measure
flown off was afraid holes being punched
were partner
manipulation was afraid explosions
therein lay issue
all these thoughts head arent own
are better off without
thank india
thank india
how bout no longer being masochistic
how bout getting off these antibiotics
how bout not blaming everything
moment let go was moment
thank disillusionment
would great if was no longer queen
would good even if got thumbs down
would good even if was clingy
thought break would good four months sat vacillated
sorry lost myself am
she never married anyone else took upon yourself console her
how can just throw words around grieve heal mourn
she was only responsive drink he was only responsive by photo
are wise are warm are courageous are big
until out his false story
until out his false story
until out his false story
but something cant control
world does not recognize women are victimized
you'll have time life
take cold showers every day throw life away
boyfriend
why do say are spiritual yet treat people shit
not other way around
eleven songs
deserve piece
wanna soft resolved
but who's still aching now
wanna forgive both us
validated
wanna soft resolved
stand up if want answers
never too young never too old
what heart could tell ya
chorus
miss smell style
these are days raw despondence
these are things miss
these are things miss
where was ally partner feminine crime
oh mother who's sister

where was ally partner feminine crime

no more remaining time
flow cold vain
we're knowing foundations all
it's so extreme
but still sands keep running too slow
cry now
sharing miracle hope
portraying face future
saying hi people's saying goodbye
gentle change tides
beyond creed
carried by wooden gods
long disappeared
holy land show signs
playing around future denied
blow
there i'll stand
look at nobody cares
oh skies are falling down
oh skies are falling down
something need
all over tears hide inside
after all
minutes waiting life's been wasted
could never get back from start

could do
bringing life dead
metal icarus
unknown songs
desperation fills air
wonder why
made own
heading bend
day had come when were one
could go no further at all
nothing say
all what remains i've got
how could people applaud
blood through heart
we're armed ready attack
petrify eyes
deep desires mine
dreams last forever
tears prayers will taken by rain
just wanted
but different lands
hands as empty
this emptiness burns inside
now let go
silence distance
speed all memories will come
then could stop time
always
all around mourn
killing jesus salvation
how they yield
stars cant find purple sky
rest peace
let run away
then we'll know
let know
freed from lies wont forget
how things went wrong
blaze blast awakening dead
against men land
while body freezin
boys swear i've been there
many things can done
keeps ilusions locked
tears you've contained
if get lost
time make us heal
time make us live time make us live
day by day
we've got know
everyday growing stronger
we'd roll fall green
heathcliff
pine lot find lot
it's cathy
let grab away soul
let window
maybe might know much more than
now you've got voice
what's more delightful than this
just feel sea bliss

it's time realise
anxiety attacks as confusion rips at mind
instrumental

blackness getting bigger than serpent's universe
brain dance
sometimes they take walk sun
he jumped out frying pan into fire he's back again
watch brain dance

excess perversion we'll never let end

strength devoured
but filled nothing new

this title comes from british phrase 'at sixes sevens' meaning 'at point disorder or confusion' think lot people will able relate these lyrics which describe period life where everything was confusion without direction giving up was easy way out moral story 'everything works out end if really want to'
disorder battles control

tricks traps never let'em get they'll
drag down down bottom tricks traps
better beware
cause if they catch going straight hell
alone darkness think i'll stay
some wont fight battle forsaken
it's proof evil our souls this tempter's intent
tired all noise tired alll pain
wash them away they'll end without doubt
tactual hallucination cockroaches infest wall
tetanus shot sure it's not wish were at school
moral physical decay hatred withered away
welcome death
so slip right sip wine
it's all bunch lies
they're melting right before eyes city ice
it's all bunch lies
why did all lovin turn anger
zombie vegetable
cause you're liar you're bad child
those who follow i'll give strength might
down down down must go down
set world fire

why must all so unkind
it's makes hate
when all this hate starts explode

extra lyrics from film mix
search feel way though slowest heaving night
wont please talk
from nippled skin as smooth as silk bugles blown as one
now future's so defined
all barriers blown away
said please talk
memories stir
have fears
cry until laugh
so doesnt own
something dark sticky
just drive car
find places got hurt
find places got hurt
you're still looking resurrection
come up what did say
no fight left or so seems
though saw all around
dont give up
dont give up
moved another town
dont give up
get back dont have time
make alive
guys get place
wont easy prey trying find way make alive
looking lost angeles
want alone
streets are lined camera crews
they wont see or gun
as burn into memory cells
dont care what do
all turned quiet have been here before
water levels getting low something ugly's going show
anne sexton
lets take boat out
wear inside out
priest he's doctor
looking mercy
she leaves rain telescopic umbrella
pity when have so much passion
opened up door walked outside
when all had has all gone
now we're busy making all our busy plans
more than this
much more than this
alone
ah look at crowd
somebody sent subversive element going chase out down
mother please just disease has them breaking all laws
making tense watch way she breed
fear fear she's mother violence
unlock door wipe feet clean
oh head sounds
what's left out what's left
so hungry all time
will call any number
they eat anything moves
night after night
know drawn
against paleness skin
dont leave here again feel pulse hold hand
there's no one else
land blind
there's safety numbers
but know how
air
oh it's not easy
these battered wings still kick up dust
hear calling
only us x8
oh gaia if that's name
chorus
pouring down all over
they tell this rain can sting look down
return again again
no more denial
red rain coming down
over
cut up land each house pool kids wearing water
fear
will breathe air
so watch wash hair
chorus
shaking up
waiting time you're more than just wife
they can support when you're way
do nothing wrong nothing wrong at all
this place can reassure
when all things beautiful bright
know that's
lost time lost place
reaching into deepest shade
sky blue
crying out from heart
could have big dipper
open up fruitcage
sledge sledge sledgehammer
you've been coming through
it's what we're doing doing
dont get wrong i'll strong
get cold get hot
darlin we've got trust something
standing stretching every nerve
open doors would soon shut
back home
i'll tell them what smile face meant
give steam
know sinner from saint
stand back
know ladder from snake
room shake earthquake
this steam
aah coming alive x2
all did said
want clear
can get so scared
cant help but listen
one girl at bar
'til red light says 'on air'
more know show will scored
'my lover stole girlfriend'
dysfunctional excess
no man sea
where people say things they really mean
curves are still upon hinge
desires form subtle whispers
who loves day but lives another
all doors are shut
high up red rock
rhythm inside
spit into out hands
smash watch
excellent birds
sitting by window
can see now
see pictures people
pray snow goes bad if settles
gonna have some fun
walk through fire
darkness heavy shoulder
while building crashes
walk down below walk down below
hold hold

our system awaits test

i've seen world through bitter stare but dream still alive
back street hoop star you've got good
time some blue sky
beholding light spell you're under
but night will reflect hunger
time moves out phase everything face

look face neon light
cant hear screaming
through streets screaming
time can change thing or two
youre begging brand new start trying

heres love hate promises
dragging feet through sand
blinding eyes from which hides key
prophecy will make its stay
there no escape
black last thing you'll see
soul slipped away
dig sand they kick at calm stuns
there's something out there
something just out reach
breathe deep before it's too late
cant solve problem overnight

who do trust when everyone's crook
about communist plan
only america's way way was right
used trust media
gotta make change
id love take see what see there right side mind

commanding another world
living twice at once learn you're safe from pain dream domain
magic felt went away
there's more life than expectations
while sit there think about there's another
too bad people say what's wrong kids today
business american way
no time no line walls fall down
hopes will stifle fear
master nations revealed
blackness surrounding borders hope

saintly faces hallowed their names she cant recall
faith growing growing tight against seam
precious cross gone made wait so long
hallowed altar burns flesh once more tonight
we're being used fed
blood christ cant heal woundsso deep
it's their training solution
there's no turning back
distant signs darkness way
throw down chains oppression bind
remember there was time when fears

lady wore black
quiet shadowed woman
her mystic power calls
but her love i'll gladly pay
beside window
till sister comes wash sins away
waiting days longer
i'll hide away here law will never find
save this world we'll all stand proud

wet raving
dont ever trust needle when cries
skin tight leather provides pleasure
forbidden sin relenting
fear as friend walk thin one more time
cold viper stalking night heat
free under night sun

pilgrim's path
restless heart
you're just part statistics
all this borrowed existences
we'll gone nothing will show
all we've been through
wasnt meant so real
as walk streets feel no fear
alive but dead
make trust what am
now night has gone better days come
waiting outburst an instigation bet
kill if you're not blamed no
mass hands press market window
while shackled line
this god's land

just noose wound
this new sound
somehow immediately down no reason at all
noone could explain
noone would believe
hey
commin upon stage i'll say ya somethin
rhyme allowed 'cuz cant philabust this
yo got drop logic
aint no fading
always control
death equals silence
mentally spiritually correct
yo got drop drop drop drop logic
music lyrics p wagner
'cause nothing thrills scary deeds
make sheets alive fill space up
when it's dreamtime i'll return
driven back time

hey dont miss out what you're passing
how could just kill man
not gonna waste no time fucking around got ya humming
how do chrome then watched rookie pass out
how could just kill man
out here risking dome just bucket or faster ducket
here something cant understand

hating raping killing day by day
never learn from history this world's big absurdity
i've seen mummy yesterday
yeah right so what not yet know
told what find
can hear them talkthere are so many voices
talking dead
mister anchor assure
oily silence mocks legless
yes testify
wrecking ball rushing
its right outside door
who controls past now controls future
said must learn life
even if change there's still him
so if you've got cash then will satisfy needs
none us are free
am friend live through
got listen when body talks

music by p wagner c efthimiadis lyrics by p wagner
sentence death their law
do they open up prison
this no justice this price war
weep children starve prisoners
gotta face it's end
told them all they wanted
truth tells no lies
dyin rotting will destiny
they're waiting await doom
bugle sounds charge begins
wont live fight another day
wrote this one '88 during tour which
dont want l
but security's not all counts
they say playing deadly gamese
show alive waiting sign
has got mind start once again
time place
time waits noone
can join till die
she's got everyone's eyes
amidst tha eulogues bliss
we're already dead
how long want stay
person are another step
why cant see
whatever may say
come seein what's at stake
mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
asleep though stand midst
now freedom must fundamental
euuurrrggghhhhh
when ignorance reigns life lost
time time had slipped away
time time had slipped away
how does feel someone when moment has come
know happens thousand times every day
this chance might last
stake burning heaven denied
they shoot bullet from behind
where explored mountain range
no muscles just wires technical pulse
our planet grew up helped by elder ones
what strange awful vision us all
whoever was these old remains his blood flowing veins
let engine run overpowered
accept final rest now
sister demon bridei want need
drives again again
have seen her talkin dead trance
talk grandpa
now give us time share
love after death this forever have no regrets
know this only bigger truth
was not see past was see youdont dare
restless
obey or die
no matter what wont true
well wake up morning
nah aint gonna work maggie's brother no more
well he puts his cigar
about man god law
but everybody wants
got someone his life he hates know
make day
make day
c'mon sucker make day
she clutches her cross
smoldering fields rape rubble bones
tha needle thread crucifixion
no moments pray
am nothing no one nobody no more
tear away at mask
tear away at mask huh
keeper our neuroses
what his ancestors already knew
wake up spirits let them run free
video games they do
go out hunting
repeat 1st verse
ha aha cmon
whose curled neath tha shadows
mic check ha aha
yes tha flame tha cellar beware
mic check ha aha
this question
who got tha power
anti myth rhythm rock shocker
fitted pieces puzzles complicated
but dont need cigarette know what mean
smooth operator operating correctly
unawareness beware it's reanamator
those who act up need more than smacked up
smooth operator operating correctly
music orientated so when hip hop was originated originated
'cause an e f f e c t
smooth operator operating correctly
livical champion ya relivical champion ya livical champion
yo
know mindsets threat
throwing catcha
new sound
more than lifetime away
spend time too many things turn tides too slow
then will let demons out
all years she held her peace followed every rule
did not fit their plan
they get hope from fire smoke as they reach dawn
tha dow jones skyin
livin been warfare press cd
fire masters house set
get em file
violence all hands
press cd
coming back
dont play this game treason
so better tell no lies
from theaters malls every shore
tha thin line between entertainment war
buy their products or get laid waste
view world from american eyes

cant help watching out
cant help watching out
they need someone bear all their sinsnot forever no eternity
what are leaders without someone lead
i'll wait chance
i'll wait chance
warm up ass
chaste flesh gonna change
gonna give her
'cos this jam tomahawk chop
'cos words thoughts still hit
down get downand clear land
never could trust phillabusta'
c'mon war
challange dont sweat
ughclear lane
ughclear lane
us so meet our death before time
deathbed feel grip 'round neck
their heads all time
entire culture lost overthrow
but these governments they dont mind procrastination
it's brutality can never undone
then wonder why have no identity
shedding light darkness greed
night remember
lonly ever since you're gone
time has come harvest what they're sown
time has come harvest what they've sown
just one breath
river blood race almost run
forget has blured his eye
he was well respected rich young man
so he lost control his car
death afternoon
hate what sow between all men
deceiver
what has happened life
you're defense only appologize
i'll never will end
deep blackest hole
when breaks into mind
when begging stay tonightdeep night
deep night
cannot see no more
just drives desperation
day come true 'bout end world an
there no more use praying
destination day
sinking stone coming through different mental spheres
died without sense
if they'd seen all before they wouldnt suffer this way now
lyrics by p wagner
clods earth hide his whole life
autumn who's got time knows nothing yet
dont fear winter come
when power wrong hand
why life mess no turning back
yeah deep night lost love
faces shine
locked wit out wage ya standin tha drop
project block
hearse
sweat
tumor
forced fight law order
when money talks they wont hear all cries
years or more
there are echoes evil
then when this fatal moment came
now future's out sight
free from this crying shame
enough enough those who dont know
'cause if stay weak are much better use
if want have tomorrow
believe first step has been made
please dont get wrong
fall it's big money all order this
few make race but all must pay fare
time has passed them by must all pay
speak forked tongue
but just wasted what invested
saw face behind mask
over over again
search cure from whys
whole scene's so unreali'm still an unbeliever wont leave
they're showing pale white
cause time works those who believe
dont ever turn away
let's forget when we've done us wrong
there's nothing evil here stay
there's not chance find our way
needed there
that's when trouble began
check ituggh
but speak silent voices
'cause know power question
'cause bastard son
mad boy grips microphone
wont stop 'cause know power question
stare full nails
uggh
cried eyes out
skill hand
wouldnt mind follow
it's such comfort
but slipped
having never seen colour father's eyes
no one's here catch when fall
we'll settle nothing later
something's happened myself could never give answer
they have told i've reacted was not from this earth
music p wagner m schmidtlyrics p wagner
so many years it's much too long have fooled
wont
did never regret
she killed smiled
she killed smiled
she's alive she's more jealous than girls flesh blood
they wont escape out this misty night alive
i've been waiting an invitation
mirror smiled at lonely face
was turning just circles no end
our time short
reach out hands reality life
music by p wagner m schmidt
fanatics ruled by sinister thinkingthey drill this evil spirit their childrens heads
was mirror pair distant eyes
paranoia sister demon mind
world expense
or ill drag grave
protect fire
hey hey
agents orange
horse rider clever cunning killer
disappears when wind redirects
crushing naive profession
disappears when wind redirects
just solitary man
gonna leave now alone
time prove evolution
rushing through these years madness
remember when life had no scars
life became an obsession
dont know want so
seem innocent
coming around coming around
'cept sing rock 'n roll band
'cause this sleepy la town
i'll shout scream i'll kill king i'll rail at all his servants
street fighting man
street fighting man
they invent ultimate war machines
but coming near there's eagerness their eyes
music lyrics by p wagner
submission
call what want now
throughout whole life i've done everything wrong
i've been taking wrong track
this tv commercial has caught us anew
this isnt worth at all
supersonic hydromatic superultrameganew
not drop water could wet lips
all people died our fountains they ran dry
take water bring shore
find river where water mercy flows
he would healer who could
he'd messiah
he was very first prove
i'll offer truth so can
spoken 'crank music up'
lost culture culture lost
need movement quickness
see right through red white blue disguise
why
teacher stands front class
yet hang from
no more lies 8 times building crescendo
yeah
raping her shot now she cant trust man no more
set above life industry feeding cash
time will come when fell down
you're alone during stay
aware i'll voice
wont sigh when time will turn page
now wasted man
it's just myself blame
tried tell others what i'd seen before
after accident soul was drifting away
who decided
there has been so many smiles
will get what need
forget about time
now time has comeand from first sight last
tha radio nah fuck
shcok around tha clock from noon
tha same devil ran around managua wit
one inhuman illegal single woman tha one
shutdown tha devil sound
i've got visions cant
there hemispheres caught view life
dark spooky graveyard
oh midnight she's all alone
he passed away real slowly
now he took hold her mind
oh midnight she's all alone
tha spark
are at war until youre free
long as rope
youll never silence voice voiceless
'cause scares know
run wind feel wet air
pleasure distorted soul
dont want miss this place
warmth summer
needle i'll thread
movements come movements go
then came shot
set groove
networks at work keepin people calm
background 'black nationalism'
what reap what sow'
rising sun loomin over los angeles
cmon
their seat their robe their tie
shook all tha world bankers
wearin masked scream
yeaaaaaah
its land or death
take sorrow pain
till today it's tearing apart
wasteland
knowledge something people reason
now shadow night
relativity divides
welcome other side
other side other side
everyone beginning end
he's gonna get when are dead
tell what he's waiting
now they are trapped they dont even care
who dares stop these fools
yes tha rebels tha grains stand
frontier
vultures playin markets
all shareholders gonna flex try ta
abc's new thrill rides trails
survive one motive no hope 'cause every sidewalk
took death trip when tried ta cross tha
ya down ddt yeah know rapped from tha
walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates born
found no wrecks nothing was seen
this part atlantic
without trace flight 19 got lost sky
maybe this was meant tales 'bout flood
last night when drove home they were there this true
yeah they study our life
previously unreleased
belong each other
could play around peace
wanna spit
yet at every turn runnin into
so let tha guilty hang
so now you're pullin moves pullin
democracy justice liberty
goes something this
everything everyone nothing ourselves
so stepped back started sprayin niggaz
'cause housin

repeat chorus
branches fern table spread kettle shine
every sound he would rise start look
lord so late how much longer he'd have wait
he said he would then conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
entered his own darkened door he knew

yuletide carols being sung by choir
so offering this simple phrase
walt aldridge bruce miller
not one both heard too much
must admit it's been fun
oh what can bring
she'll hear his promise forever
keeps getting wider
oh river's sorrow
great divide
came home late every night
guess i'll never hear
dont go tellin her about right or wrong
when there's no sign love sightshe hears him say hey can buy drink
but words didnt come easily
but there's one thing wont change
through four winds blown gone
blinded by memory flame

four horsemen ride down lost highway
words unspoken driven blind

so time will rise time fill fade
skeleton once free
someone's pleasure another one's pain glissando
believe someone's lust price pay
believe it's time go
wisdom desire
reach skies hate love
into evil hounds doom
pain despair
reach sky get away get away
but broke heart two
no dice no roll no spark no fire
mine all mine no ego no brain
no war no peace no rules no riot
has got only two letters but aint easy say
i've seen too much that's price pay
loney road mystery bay
told welcome home at mystery bay
it's giving misery pain
billions years since very first date
some conscience fallin
dark side fate
every mile every town
set free insanity savannah
it's all about lies
but there's one thing cant buy at all
but she couldnt give emotions
she was young pretty but never rang
overkill pay bill writing's wall
it's obvious see we've found magic key
well citizen future now
21st century says hello
when heart calls liar
well mystery beeing right or wrong
'cause life just journey
stay gold when you're lost days blue
old at heart
try drink their shame away
this world made pain
ghosts dead gave 'em magic key
sol est rex diei luna est regina noctis
sun queen day moon king night
love respect
sometimes dreams cut knife
raven sold his dreams hell
wheel stopped turning
face final curtain
have hide smile remains
some hear sing
sidewalk angels gave him smile
he lost his wife kid
they left smile face
little boy stands by waterfall
another lie another battlecry
little boy's now grey pass away
then she gave kiss turned out light
one dreamer world made stone
some give all when all give some
time will show reason why
everybody calls name
all know sure dear truth gonna burn down
silent memories hurt brain
wrong way out but right way
city city from show show
might never see
through fire will ride
dance beat night
but nobody listens when now puppets
sometimes mind getting
ups downs
ups downs
sometimes emotions grow
this one's dedicated
honesty seems out date
it's warning noone fears
cares are buried under sand
asphalt deserts streets pain
one only liar
hey mister cant tell
his ghost ridin wind
chaser mud seed
price no one payed
pleasure fortune fame
gods are left mightless now
we'll burry our tears time
now
why dont think
though shalt done
where do go
birth disease
cant take night away
millions died vain
maybe prisoner everlasting rule
i'll never
i'll never go back silence
way beyond distance
when fogs cry freedom
deep night
seems finally would find
take dice let roll
where rats were readers
cold september day dark grey
fun
got people always tryin think
back feet that's price got pay
cant find reason why
what future days may bring
wheels may turn but should remain
lucifer said i'll do best can
lucifer
love all need
god want take
after they had won this war
want live
from home at golden pond
cant tamed cant caught
but lucifer said relax it's alright
god answered
take back back light
lust killer lust test
so lust test
he was rising flag violence
mephisto just painted face
he's inner voice darkness
another love has died
cry
hate good
so here's last farewell
all can say hate
hate tricks matches too
mystery bay
beyond waters someone waits
an eagle his wings up skies
all pain all pride
eyes lust dreams black
fact most crimes committed
lost darkness strangers loose
some say yey some say no but end
sittin streetcafe barcelona
it's nice day funeral
some hookers other side give smile
had pretty good life here just plugging into machine day then
ii temples syrinx
work together common sons
let banners unfurled
beautiful
joyously screams out its pain
voice echoed throughout silent temple hall
there's something here as strong as life
cant believe you're saying
just think about average
see still incredible beauty sculptured cities pure
an oracle confronts there
claim home where they belong
dream still head
lifeblood
when these days have passed long ago
beating down multitude
cities full hatred fear lies
natives smile pass along
wreathed smoke lebanon
we'll hit stops along way
feel way would
remember
reaching alien shore
race not definition
sex not definition
take this heart stone
remind us who are
let children rise up before
let children rise up before
chorus
there tic toc atomic
pride reduced humble pie
miracles will have their claimers
night turns thin
goddess garden
alter image
secret face touch grace
complicate
wonders world they wrought
build our defenses place safety
way take us out ourselves
future eternal light
or will too weak
between sea sky
cant bring world
moving picture
promise offered east
want look at life
free dungeons innocent
lessons taught but never learned
still dont believe we're fadin
maybe it's too late
dont wanna see
said left out cold
chorus
fantastic dreams come true
get money get dough
benzino got bitches love undress
hold tight shorty right dont bite

purposeful motion
sometimes confusion
more things change
chorus
closer heart
was long after midnight
i'll around
dont go too far
i'll around
this magic day when super science
air charged
scorching blast golden fire
went crossroads fell down knees
can run can run tell friend willie brown
but chooses uphill climb
cut chase
about way things used
may right
six stars northern cross
destroyed
ship rocinante
spinning whirling
when our weary world was young
bring truth understanding
people were delighted
quest dionysus
will soothe primal fears
gods watched from afar
cloud doubts fears
some who did not fight
but have no shape or form
feel silent scream begin inside
world doubt fear
can run alone free
making arrows out pointed words
nothing explain
when all such things agree
he'd love spend night zion
because strangers arrangers
there's no swimming heavy water
chorus
watching from satellites
absolute
our seven years go by one
there barely time go outside play
one sniff at hydrant
edge sleep was driting half night
run between shadows
anywhere but here
just shield rusty wire
rested fearless cheered by nearness
picture book rivers
she's got sister out vegas
wondering what our dreams might worth
starry highway traced map sky
desert highway straight heart sun
driven margin error
driven driven edge
but it's turn drive
yo yo yo yo
dju know nigga cant freak
tell what it's gonna
know he aint no freak dju dunno
redman
then yo
dru hill def squad if askin us
can raise eyes
what others see
third hand grace
not content being cool
secret wells emotion
sometimes our big splashes
are planets each other
just between us
chorus
house where love lies dying
no matter what they say
everyday glory
no matter what they say
if future's looking dark
running empty
face up there's still time turn game around
need some feedback
get all smoothed out inside
stone river
believe love
beneath deep white silence
chorus 1
lift hands just as am letting go false control
electrical changes are charging up dawn
next it's rolling over
can almost see circuits blowing
can almost see circle growing
one day fly through crack sky
blow blow pretty sure heard rumors
they want us jails bails too high bond but am don
gotta hold cake grandmoms had dreams
see thinly related everything street
bust feelins dump bodies crushed buildings
one million get deal already
pun prince we're walkin kings son bitch
make em wet they pants
chorus 2x
brain floatin away above niggas make time pause
see middle kingdom between heaven earth
yet keep looking through
better peoplebetter foodand better beer
better pride resides
cause used bring flowers
baby our love's not meant
dont know just what do
here govertigo
dont touch dial
dont change station
hidden camera coverage from crime scene courtroom
boy lies grass one blade
autumn woods winter skies
music spheres
too many things mind
big money hold prize
tumble dice
sometimes knocking castles down
big money make mistakes
placed no trust faith was ready made
way big wheel spins
taking chances you'll have right answers
trying change mode crack code
unit one's trouble it's scared out its wits
grim faced forbidding
soft spring rain
focus sharp city
alive streets city
dont have an explanation
you're not sure what's going here
gravity distance
every muscle tense fence enemy within
every breath static charge
valley
they're open very wide
gives heart no peace
live from breath breath
iii no one at bridge
wheel own hands
but there's no one there hear
catch scent ambergris
pacify troubles
heart will lie beside
draw another goblet
another doubtful fear
hear dancing waters
life just candle dream
motion
why such different fortunes fates
such lot pain earth
golden one or scarred from birth
only their thirst freedom gives them hunger vengeance
shreds black cloud loom overcast skies necromancer keeps watch
spectres numb fear
from labyrinths below
electrical storm veins
dreamers turn look at cars
made surrender seem all right
nothing noble fate
'cause am lady
'cause am always by side
sound heart beating
sometimes am frightened
somewhere i've never been
they call seeker
'cause never smile
yeah but look at face aint this smile
electro magnetic force
heart goes out
nothing changes faster
than speed love
companion unobtrusive
emotional feedback timeless wavelength
chorus
they say oaks are just too lofty
so maples formed union
beneath his hat strangeness lies
wake up lost an empty town
come explore dreams' creation
take uptake up
if die tonightit would ok
if die tonightit would ok
cause finally found what most i've been searching whole damn life
any girl world could have easily known better
more think know about
or african sun
are entertained
chorus
reflect upon our own
quantum leap forward
their world fashioned
not as market campaigns
sensitive open strong
each ev'ry day
knees are startin gettin weak
time spiral space curve
just dont get
hide shell let world go hell
it's just erotica hypnotica
keep his nature pure
he's radio receiver
he's not concerned yesterday
he only introduced wider reality
who plays hero's role
when heard she was gone
everybody's buying
hero not handsome actor
without memory or desire
morning says answer yes
dream walk wilderness
willingness risk defeat
greatest act can
went right by
well guess all have these feelings
between these two directions
some them burned our ceilings
it's not place
it's gift giving
rocks cradle
come rest let love bed
chorus
talk time without fear
while billion other teachers are teaching them how burn
wheel against rules
here hide heart city
not one sense proportion
if could wave magic wand
temperature's rising
thrill alive
point journey not arrive
point needle moving back forth
turn up light sound
not arrive
jump ground
brilliant red barchetta
adrenaline surge
shoots towards two lanes wide
leave giants stranded at riverside
what's her name cant tell no
just end up as nothing but friends
what's her name cant tell no
after midnight we're gonna let all hang down
after midnight we're gonna let all hang down
'cause aint going down anymore
some call him fear some call him righteousness
let tell something
by eric clapton rick danko
all our past times should erased
know dont count loss

twice visioned was falling down
white violin
kyrie eleison christe eleison
land nevermore
recite soliloquies
let nothing bleed into nothing
if surrender
divine forgiveness
master soon you'll see
never see until feel
mislead delusions color real
going out
how can refuse
going sugarless
exanimate penance
silence loudens tribulations
deep mind look answer
entrapped this one way passage
deep mind look answer
before dawn history ancient races tears
shade light from seed
where mortals have been banned
cities disappear
open secrets overheard
look at yourself
from still uncertain heart
if want know
look at yourself
when comes down wire
friend forgive
catatonic state sharpens life's depressing edge
from bleeding corpse pleasure
darkness calls her laughs
idolence there lies shadow man
mystic journey arcana travel starry
up tree preying vulture
exuke this medium bondage far beyond
he will inhere malignant fear man
while facing transformation
was thread common bond
eye eye
miles still divide
believe know need let go
think wont but know might
face fear
morrigan come again
peasants kings heart surely turn dust
far beyond realm dream wildest dream
time long past tomorrow sleeping
paradise
bound earth treasures sunken heart
through crack garden wall came
shame
will wish upon star believe
his mind has seen think may he lives
without name
angels white have sacrificed witness
light wield must blind another
close eyes what do see
oh
feel cold winds all around
our island stream
know this begot by kiss
may rotten conscience never grow old
returned silver pieces you've paid
instrumental
dont think remember
hangs memory
sound voice falling
so where do begin
hope our hearts
sign dotted line
what are looking something
set thames fire
parallel lives running parallel
parallel lives running parallel
parallel lives running parallel
abonded
they should held so high not looked
prelude ruin
destiny sisters all three
wintery wind eye storm witness
go sailing out view
teach teach see light
when need somewhere run
beg answers unasked
behind outcast eyes hides
behind lifeless eyes lies
open wide you're decide turn back
laughter's echoes blatant wind
four corners life are golden mirrors
tabernacle forbidden never looking back dont dare
if couldnt buy diamond rings
if had nothin
verse 2
girl do swear tell whole truth
would here pay rent
who choosing all way
would here if didnt have boss
struggling
if was crummy
as he looks window
young restless cant conceive
bard banshee
laughing magpie spreads his wings
know it's getting late
we've grown so tired trying
nothing's easy anymore
holding faith
i'll take what's mine
so why do create just swallowed
believing all basics everything could find
come what may
way from salem lit fire
ride great beast abandoned girls
darkest mind
burned alive crim never done
she took by hand
more look
more these walls confine
strain catch breath
dont keep telling everything's okay
let's straighten out
chorus
monica umm when dont even know what's wrong
let's straighten outusher need straighten out
as he's done thousand hours before
it's all matter time there reason
nearing his hour he climbs belfry
them all
wont play game
unborn wench at war tear him inside
camouflage battle scars oxy ten
but only said goodbye
but heard distance voice
can only say goodbye
all things need say
switch triggered once again
run rabbit run hawk sky hides
moon ignites flaming raging child
it's time make change
tied fading memory
stand at door new beginning
feeling weight unseen chains
without going through motions
living life still water
taught his boy all tricks
his father act fury
health strength
die by sword
wed daughter king
pierced his father's soul
there's blind desire there's drive
performance expression
there's an empty room there's blank page
black magic night witches holiday
hellish praise
solemn belfry begins toll
at walpurgis night
convulsive seas false urgency
isle debris
run end world
come clouds before rain
man mirror looks
man mirror looks out
all really want
thoughts dont recognize make realize
nothing inspire
burned desire
am here screaming
or here beside
his mind never rests
there's chill about us
rains falling hours crawling
all around this shade gray
listen
whispers instead
share thoughts could not share
through nights never end
au fond de mon jardin
did nothing at all
did nothing
anymore anymore
cant explain
still hold yesterday
deep cool
jump into fires hopelessness forever
we've swallowed pills pain
way back may
but now she's not around
really light up
seven days sun
really light up
she looks just beauty queen
crawling knees again
make better
just take pain away
muffled screaming
would kill just same
taste bitter glass
apologies have passed
it's pulling deeper
cat out
tears roll down
wave goodbye love again
so dont try fake
anymore anymore
anymore anymore
tell something new instead
tell something new instead
she said
yeah wish could
cant dance disco
white suits gigolos
cant dance disco
cant live disco
cant cant cant stand losing
can call lack confidence
but you'll sorry when dead
cant cant cant stand losing
buying magazine it's time get myself some therapy
it's funny but dream yesterday blistered by burns life has made staring
she's got new dress
chorus
more change all seems worse
unchain myself
voices draw nearer
try get hold son
see so near seems so far
lettin out lettin out lettin out
close eyes drift away some place new
cold has got hold again
blue true blue true miss
lift up where clouds are snow
cause you're only thrill feed
cause you're only pill take
find new trees better ground
black sabbath everyday
growin old
chorus
got pull myself back
feel no obligation
tear yourself apart
comfort sound
new belief
picks up when crash down
feel as shake
just piece something new taste would keep us sane
blows fuse inside our minds watch data as wipes
introverted our ways trapped inside this plastic skin
sinking deep under dont think we'll recover
im not insane
ask questions have read
alone
if could see live pain
see face stone
celebrate x2
burn grey
it's essence love
feelin it's over
drift forever lost
space we're getting better all time
safe we're getting better all time
see wait
cant see another
just see how another
pure air breathe
emily loved him
came healed disease again
here she comes lifting up moon
it's breathing underwater but just cant let go
see smiles ice cream faces
killing now it's so hard breathe
tearing down piece by piece

crashing onto cotton waterfalls
cause rubberband
twist around feel rubberband

wanna leave all just while
wanna lift myself above clouds
climbing up free myself

spinning out ferris wheel red

lying face down floor reaching out something new
burn face storm

sitting today watching traffic buzzing by faces nosing
waiting taste happiness lift free carry away
it's killing today addiction pulls down know
words say old flowers fade away
down knees crawling though streets again
you're evergreen regents park spring
it's getting better all time now
can feel again
staring at paper faces expressions empty pages day after day
cant shut out
cant take down
as wire cuts into butter skin
blown hole right through dream
standing edge world
between now last time met
had had known might have been
22 moment
kid way
15 there's never wish better than this
just dreaming
sing above vision sing above face
every day saturday summer waking morn
lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean
lips only roses kissed him down sleep
but her back seat wont ever tell
or bringing home first baby
'65 mustang rides along
dont need play no new cd's
she's family tree
dad did when '65 was three
so what problem
closer
you're all i'll ever need
higher go harder climb
closer

right or wrong cant undone
vast delirium multitudes attitude
sometimes cant understand myself
nothing true all permissible
if had cure epidemic today
are willing
are willing forget what dont know
are willing forget what dont know
always running from myself
stopping tomorrow tonight
cant see blindside
how many beatings do have take
how many cells must die before you're legally
how much wasted energy flowing through head
how much wasted energy flowing through head
down deep black hole heart
outside gates redemption inside happy home
self destructed never anticipated
now stare out window patients lawn
you've done everything nothing do
wish had little bump smoke
one more time
whole world way
captured mind details
hidden recesses lost mind
bloodless pale
captured mind details
chorus
allied forces go war bloody battles by score
when find yourself scorning trust
violator conscience will command no it's not dream
canived underneath sun
indian giver true or trade away
spaced iii
why cant get back
as long as make back
destructive signs
chaos no point prove
symbolize all despise
evil wicked dreamer creator sins
usa russia chaos from pole pole
surrounded by his marked believers
scorched ground opens beast metal appears
air charged power metal
even dont know who am
they're gonna catch disease
they'll squeeze blood through skin
bed's ammo no one comes door
good news never last too long
dreams are not same as life
darkness falling play pretend
more than world inside mind
land no one comes from
feel yourself falling hole
can see life fading away
there dark side life
wears down
ears ring favorite sound
really dont exist
warheads
now kill power become partners sin
alone our decision unlock door
alone our decision unlock door
why didnt get call
how soon they're gone away
everything see now
when whole world saw but
everything know past
fade black
am falling feel pain
falling faster no one here
everybody's watching
watching over
still walk
again seemed right
this rhyme picked mind
still walk
standing edge time
standing edge time
same old song different beat
book fear
cheated angels turned away
little people spit down
i'll recognize
instead stay alive
fucked up everyone's life
blacker demise
fucked up everyone's lives
can hallucinational
can hallucinational
think you're hallucinational
hot so give what you've got
we're all alone love has grown
good us or harmful does enlighten or repress
no one cares but
up seems real good offer
they almost always
just had make sure
knew was sincere
knew was sincere
they almost always
knew was sincere
guess dont really care
then cant get by
no wont buying
engulfed popularity everyone he knows
claw hangs just above head
shooting up shooting down
reaper near
pit dogs they are prey people look away they look away
live passes by live die
game temptation play heart
chorus
chorus
it's
shotgun up against eye
cant see
just very violently killing time
slamming faster just hit ground
tying another big liquid noose
when it's hard hold them down
when water keeps rising
if it's cheaper kill
if dont keep moving
if dont keep moving
know cant tell
ascends from beneath metalshock reveal
chorus
if were oh just gone
not an apparition not holy ghost
walks right beside
lies then floor
as move from door door
lies there floor
seeing still not beleiving
i'll turn away from this mess burning
bet never thought you'd see dead no
monster
trouble trouble
natural enemies
introduction into
envoys are delt their hands
bustling nations horde their rotting wheat
torture from hooded nations
tell something what you're trying prove
thermo global fear
turning right feel getting tight
instinct never worked anyway what i've seen just cant say
risk runs high but i've gotta try
pretentious asshole time move aside
need inside took by surprise
ooh october thorns side
now now just who really am
burnt myself
hiding basement mind
swollen shut black eyes burning bright
if you're strong enough bleed
promise keepers nothing cheaper
newspaper blanket covers view
what they all think now
sinking taking everyone down
throwing towel now
handful grease her hair
well they're packed pretty tight here tonight
repeat chorus
she'll mine
consume her universe
as last trace her
young maiden demon her soul
she's miss lizzy she feels no pain
these legendary murdersshe left not trace
nothing should dread
tell failing
come guidance
another hole bucket
now pack shit get fuck out
blind deaf dumb
guilt preys upon human mind
when conflicting machine
promise cast hopeful lured
pulling teeth tie string slam door
pulling teeth tie string slam door
pulling teeth tie string slam door
forced down yellow pills then stepped into screen
now know place life as time devours more each day
there's no love lost
business booms when cold lead flies
selling rock candy suicide
tribal primal criminal
have what stole
laughing cause you're funny choking
tonight take stage again
time gashing has come now
come viperand see
moody violence
erase memory
i'll see through day
threats fly through airmail e mail express
screwed head so tightly
sweat out walls both shoulders touch
slit wristed run over hanged
numbers mind add up
winners cross line
numbers back numbers head
till after begin
win lose or dead
know little about nothing
when it's heart cant feel fell
when it's hands but cant feel
this time
close eyes hope it's
all gotta do try
fake all stride
all night long dream day
another reason bleed
if get any closer
nothing satisfies but getting close
weight keeping down x2
puzzles suck laughing face
not what seems
ring witching hour
want forget about
can go another round
dream about yourself
stars will all come out
fool
but had no use
someone getting best best best best
life love
getting tired starting again
confess
if can get around
make dizzy running circles head
break right through
we're face face friend
may crazy little frayed around ends
begging ignition
breathe when gone
waiting collide
burn out beyond
never burn again x3
no way you'll silence
dont say what dont need
something borrowed something blue
not fool
you're one bothers
all sick
can hear them say
tossed about ship ocean
didnt pass by
give one last wish give one last wish
when i've had enough
hey let's call even
dont deny dont deny
all own
it's cold day sun
he's scared cause want all
life begin fade into black
spending hours endin days
reason left survive
come alive
looking i've got nothing lose
stuck middle no ones making move
try runnin around candle
try one that's
it's something bigger
was all
yea yea yea
may scattered
whisper days gone by
nothing taste sweet decline
what way go they have no fear
been pleasure 'bout pleasure's
this beautiful bruise's colours
you're every mood mood
now i've found reward
blew all away
hells gard hells gard will true world
hells gard hells gard wait all world
cant let out
i'd share piece mine
just lookin shelter
absence faith
all want home
we're hot inside each other never let go
did lose
that's not easy say
rehearsed insanity
one day this all will fade sure
i've taken all i've endured
now might help any other
every time dream sharin
breaking muted skies
honor
feel alive
made iron stone
confess his crime
good friend ours
guess she had lot money or something
dont think he'd ever met her before
she bought him all this stuff
he's standing there his dick
think need devil help get things right
think done nursing patience
why'd have go let die
why'd have go let die
why'd have go let die
beautiful veins bloodshot eyes
there's place know
cant change back
pleasure or pain
just some words without meaning
down out again x3
every now then
down out again x3
one more time last time
no home no life no love
no king or queen any state
running through hell heaven can wait
no turning back dont turn page
no tomorrow no dead ends
you're tearin apart
every day every day
are there
hanging ooh
turn so tight
screws inside
as low as go
low as go
imagine day drowing they can reel
pick up where left off
cause thats language too
always lost win or lose
counting every minute till feeling comes crashing down
getting lost again better than being numb
someone who's taking pleasure breaking down
if share powdered milk
gather round'
i've been loosing sleep
just lucky we're alive
dont wanna monkey wrench
one last thing before quit
truth or consequence say aloud
kudos hero
this black out
head heart

operator wont put through
her lips keep tasting
woman sometimes
wish could hold her
there's no exceptions rule
i've never been nobody's fool

outnumbered by plenty they were almost too cover
well still remember day happened
well now they're all sayin cowboy bill was hero
even when she gets muddy
she's cover magazine
if it's mountain
cowboy cadillac
she's honkin tonkin
so god looked out all over creation
nothins changed since dawn creation
one hell ride
she wore him diamond ring around her finger
trips paris leer
seen bright lights memphis
can walk together
at house edge town
it's been year since she ran away
all boys there at bar
down dixie land
sometimes just comes down
they'll come looking some one blame
that's gonna do
she's shown no more
if cant swim tide
then sometimes
maybe even save yourself
baby make okay
blows nobody know what it's gonna do
would hate have find again
blows nobody knows where's going
other day saw car used drive
when song was over
wondering what might have been
dont ever

'cause it's not enough just stand outside fire
convinced it's not living if stand outside fire

made home although
there's just something cowgirl has
'cause sometimes best cowboys
since autumn night outside county fair
not too many people came
someday he'll tell her about money he hid
wheat fields as far as could see
even boy could recognize
summer wind was all around
watch storm all its wonder
when havent seen her face
she had ride heat passion
something so sweet though incomplete
some our stories fade as grow older
i'll tell this story this way time again
fix door patch wall
they she just went crazy
words she had said
'cause every night she walks beaches cheyenne
reaches out
do this so this world will know
no matter what do it's still same thing
never changes
tiny tots their eyes all aglow
pushin horns werent easy movie said was
water was risin so damn fast
he rode all his horse would ride
still singin strawberry roan little joe
moment wasnt king
his rope's pulled way tight
he's got fever fever fever fever
what he loves might kill him
he gets so tired hangin so tight
said donkey shaggy brown
cooed him sleep he should not cry
gifts they gave emmanuel
cage made rushes twine
maria had nothing bring
out cage bird flew
by very first nightingale's song
but somehow couldnt help but have doubts
he said son it's gonna hurt more than hurts
just pray some day half man he
they were finally where desire dared them go
lord night will only know
they watched her fall silence
bound by their behavior
his reindeer his sleigh
they're loadin down his sliegh
yeah old mans back town
he's spreadin cheer around
before came stage
bev roberts out camden park
if werent code road
no rules young fools comin from old school
back before buses
picture they're painting
steam window salt kiss
tempered strong fearlessly drawn
oh red strokes
dreamer's just vessel
i'll never reach destination
choose chance rapids
there's bound rough waters
so will sail vessel
did she just ignore signs
whirl hurricane
it's time
she keeps telling herself
city's lookin ghost town
she's pacin by telephone
another love grows cold
but wind rain
as storm blows
he wont do this again
now pennsylvania folks are traveling
when was so afraid
was voice gave wings
any time doubt myself think
was voice gave wings
this may california but oklahoma's her eyes

he started screamin hallelujah
well could hear those church bells ringin
just came
right bitter end
deb said she might bring friend
wonder what she thinks

since we've no place go
fire slowly dying

now lessons been learned
moon was bright as readin light

were still dancin along
so went back see her again
it's most wonderful time year
there'll parties hosting

i've never got down knees asked lord above
i've never been nobody's fool
when their eyes met they both began smile
he'd come realize he'd neglected certain things
know she's needed
our family never shared
lord he must have
blood thicker than water
but cant understand
see what god's
but there's somethin 'bout this time year
hung up phone sat there wondered
what she's doin now tearin apart
they rave about our view
what she feels so warm real
so made up mind learn lines

we're playin fun but we're playin keeps
was feelin blues

just other night hometown football game
just because he doesnt answer doesnt mean he dont care
gifts life
intrinsic intrigue
that'll surely light flame
all she knows her destiny
what's name
oh welcome game
unto this night child born
peace earth tidings great joy
but cant keep good man down
horse different color
he never did get too proud
he'll never wear business suit
they bought his name
he's still local hero
we're proud say
promises get broken
but cant say didnt warn
can try fool friends
oh know when look into eyes
well that's just way
go out walkin after midnight
as lonesome as can
cant think straight since found her
some made romance
it's gettin point
bury hatchet
bury hatchet
if could ever remember
bury hatchet
shall free
when this world's big enough all different views
when there's only one race that's mankind
what child this who laid rest
silent word pleading
haste haste bring him laud babe son mary
gentle hand was finally clenched rage
then night exploded begged him no
'cause it'll never go away
he's a'rattlin 'round inside
lazy yellow moon coming up tonight
going fishin dark
i've waited all winter time right
where cool grass grows
we'll falling love middle night
he offers salvation
he points bible
these rags wearin
he knows soon heaven
well these rags wearin
when looked up were standing
minute there

so sat alone
as they opened up doors
took ring from pocket
now dont have wonder anymore
but might need this fool around case fall
so turn out lights lay there dark
she must face world without
avoid circumstance
if tomorrow never comes
another's eyes
this picture perfect portrait
tryin desperately
this picture perfect portrait
they couldnt move west they couldnt go home
so they got married they had child
she watched her boy grow into man
as shots rang out down rio grande
she learned language she learned fight
deep within emerald isle
can see rolling fields green
tell them make ready
as silence draw near
were forty against hundreds
if walk out door

king calling must obey why do have kill
god knows gave all damned day saw many fall
fight kill will win battle louden hill
fight land battle bannockburn lesson they did
when feel end near
last judgement will decide who was wrong or who was right
alex king did win day
face face battlefield
mingeling stream
final war
fools will lead down
grave open digger's smile
raft death now leaves landing
so even king
forever fight
instrumental
feel end near
love her more than life this what she takes
god love hell open
forces darkness than shall not rest
enchanted by its melody

death action brings promised land
longing god reveal

wanna see face no more
crazy scene
satisfactions growning less
templars are blamed conjuration
make confession
jesus raised his lips
know hide heaven chose
by god's grace king james 7th obey or death bring
killing time hang victims hang them high
blood leads glory god's sake
whrer islam dwells
sword save king
forbidden fruit
when she longs
moon madness shining
they're marching freedom
ref
searching love

that's not loving
only thing you're holding truth
never would forget love could have kept
if ever broke down i'd patch up
wish had wheels wish had wings

violent burning sea
borrowed time again

chorus
before us
lyrics billy james peterson
words cant describe
rhyme without reason why children cry
feel
salvation we'll share
once he was king his world
always early feeling so late
ride ride through
know it's never same
life so bad without
clinch jaws
she will never change her ways
no giving repent
put an end hypocrisy
gonna keep fighting
they called murders minimal
freedom freedom falling
hate
blind see
where hatred still grows
endless cycless
man before boy
bodies lay rest
solo james
day's vanished night soon children pray
cry's answers wonder why why it's time die
but were way out line
who made anyway
fears start showing
who's say
will they respect when
who made god today
paralyzed depression
honor code defending line
where feelings are going when they wither away
know are free
just realise where you've gone
some so scared children fled
i've always saidburn bitch
some paid price thier crimes
meeting haunting night
see their dreams come life
bring back terror night
fortune fame
taken by reality
was fantasy
time now
cities turn battlefields
shadows cast loud clear
past it's too late
nobody would listen him
then what's store
when books were untold
cause preacher tells visions he sees
silent insanity
sanity
oooh what'cha gonna say
ritual call
lyrics billy james
heads held low
chorus
preach their sermons ignorance
hope humanity
meaning life ends agony
rise as wait annihilate
premonitions tragedy
cops they dress black they bid their lives
he's just president
wars must fight
over crowded cause share same veins
will not
always together as
from father above
alwaystogether as one
red man proud giving hell
full moons rising from sky warrior's riding
ride wind
price have pay
trial by fire
this what people say
trial by fire
following bright stars
deep thoughts
should keep wandering
from dream must seek
nothing can touch now
nothing can stop now
ash ashes dust dust
really want go
there more life
can not live rest life
dnr do not resuscitate dnr
no going back
1
here where i'll stay
others are slowly dying
cross blood red
ancient times mayfly names
dark words power
dead civilzation
corrodes disbelief
any other way
purify his weakened heart
all i've got
when we're young
cant hear what say
as troubled as seems
always
this humanity's destruction
cryout will they see another day
no sign hell

instrumental
walk around just circus baby true
know shouldnt really bother baby here too
now their warmth forgotten gone
never dreamed we'd meet here once more
start car ten mile beach
start car violet town
how are getting home she laughed
anaesthesia's numbing
so many things need fixing everywhere
dont know how
ground air
stretching out catch slender message
civilized gentleman gonna nice
she reaches him jealous moment x3
saw him looking down
time meanders discord music birds
verandah almost seven years
she she needs her time space
wants another
you're just an antenna you're just wire
she say that's way that's fate am resigned
wish somebody would tell score
they kill their enemies by loving them death
they let go one condition
but priest aura
end always start
it's just not day
bedroom mirror wall
energy low
curtain comes down circus leaves town
some tangle life limbs
moon was being trailed
it's last night war
bought sold
there's such big demand blood money
it's flowing under land blood money
six lonely lifetimes since i've seen her
her block ice heart tunes out noise
woke up this morning
was late this morning
there was nothing left think about
look at business woman
she'll never understand
maybe you'll find her maybe wont
wasnt expecting this
none this what wanted
consequences now apparent
dont replace dont upset
sinking slowly sand
if only wasnt steel
two angry eyes one sharp black horn
this very day hundred years before
oh columbus never should have let go
it's going come somehow
man had something strange about him
how can describe what receiving
it's such waste time
it's such waste time
puzzled travelers
swarmed carrion birds
cut two that's kind ship running
separation no one looking through intrigue
cut two that's kind life having
separation he's circling waiting make his move dead face
separation just gonna have hate
ever been desperate way
get involved prisoner
know you're falling behind
but then dealers deal darkness
where desolate places meet oases
gardens orient
days will glow distant time
an infant voice crone
software sings hardware hears
hold closer ladyboy if look can see it's just
guitar pow zing
laughing at anyway
first thing know dont know thing
make sure will good hard
streets burnt out shells insurance jobs
dont owe anything
symphony frequencies delivering
overcomes too much
earth mother earth hurt sweet mother earth
now out touch
if need cheat
it's craft
dont know when but wish knew where
its teeth are glistening
look at map add up cost
never any bother considering regret
christ must have been sight
next stop louisiana
empty birdcage her room
second street
drove alone
was clear she was loveblind
was clear she was loveblind
we've been sent sing lullabywe've brought oils gold wine bread
when night came down
smile many shocked
have ever seen
will over moon
away from this earth
white
many dark nights scramble attention
universe distant stars chilling its failings
all eyes are staring down glitter small children
marty's evil chuckle
ancient craft waltz maze metal shells beneath
translated from swedish by thomas norin
her father's smart plays his part
but go living till say yes
walks expecting him finds something more
close eyes moon starts rise
all things they told
when broke they scrambled piece
it's only day away
as if would tell so
i've never ever been here
burning turning
beyond city evening dust
because there's far too many
when news sinks holding our skin
must have heard about little problem
factory billboards outskirts city
hear mandolin springs
big ideas little wonder
will far away
new christ beneath drumkit moon
need more wine gold
oh lord trust intentions
uncurling human tragedy apparently parody
she's broken down it's raining said i'd have look
better break up
no certainty attached
city country from clouds
we're gonna drop right out sky
here's number can try ring
faith faith breathe
ok stop stop spoken
how near
all memories all feelings
but next day when wake
but it'll take something better than this creature left
want take back take bottom
take back take anywhere go
will come take place
embraced machine went through routine
was hired fired yet never inspired
gave money ghosts insulted hosts
terra nova cain need again
terra nova cain need again
terra nova cain need again
met bunch fools oklahoma
hell bent here everafter
mother send no flowers passing
upon elephants so well do remember
creation transubstantiation
screaming free
but top half his body corpse
then doesnt wait reply
he can turn wine into water
says magic words
some it's done mirrors
bet they are his plants
acting fine drink wine
rats danced persian rug
oh baby did look so nice
well waiting square
just turn light off when go he hates dark
he takes arm then he eats up yeah
am s'pposed clown or buccanneer
dawns early light
still looked fold two behind shade
ripple up flames
still 'til all little details are exposed
strange turbulence fills air
down comes rain
lightning thunder cause walls shake
they only make feel dying
their hands dont make hang
skipping 'cross water wading through sand
it's fog walk towards but never seem reach
green shadows greet another day
they say hey everything will work out fine
disenchanted friend
this hotels zoo
might underground but you're overinsured
but barbarians came set fire their home
they must have known was end
some days cry
holiday two
oooh dont move
miracles americans come falling miracles come crawling
he only wants make them all his own
washed into sentimental gloom
years it's lost then it's
leave feeling more pink
she holds by stars says look at these scars
land drags life from their glands
shadows contain no more cool
fills head light
even when they're closed
as stand before relics
when touch skin feeling electric
i'll prove her existence everything
war dance guess got this place this mess
who's there say we're living this moment
something out corner eye
timing off things get jumbled up
distant alone beneath platinum stars
time past field mars
they tell inside
at home they think must fools
focused through hand
take time make way
have love sweet devotion
lonely his capsule all heaven calling
our documents are useless or forged beyond believing
tell it's only way we'll get this road completed
leaves slumped against night
torn head
fly home
certain ideas
but know never wanted
dreamtongued man from golden land
silent sensual day
got face raphael
this oh
this oh
what was waiting there he never could have known
dream up scam then rake clams liquidity
wolf from lamb just half gram liquidity
nothing nothing coming through
clock provides time
litter under camouflage
it's just not quite sure
by virtue faith
everywhere anywhere nowhere when dont care
stand there ashes blowing past
men gods begin their dance their time has begun
more want more need
i've got nickname call weakness
as message from future
when wind will refuse die
one big man good connection
want bite hand
how loved diamond eyes
wish had helped her more than did
everybody just walk away
cant lover if want keep using
night feels just day
guess can count
tiny baby so naive
brand acolytes as pack liars
you're so fifty light years ahead time
this hardly paradise
take letter ophelia write
march together slay nero
dont wanna superhero
they've found another martyr rather was him than
said never never coming back again
red hot spaceships soil so rich
so red squares wavy leaves
only two people
junction fever must have closed down rail
must empty inside shadow cabinet
it's hardly used think
sun never comes
random choices will they ever learn
but they never can caught
hoped you'd realized
gotta get deep
chorus
carries aloft you're getting soft
heard about maria she hated rat race
under shifting dimensions horizon returns
following nebula
here now here now
man carrying brow
echo another time an age beauty
imagine feeling before last jump
travel by thought
travel by thought
was working an orchard grew strangest fruit
hotel suite rich mans town hut botany bay
what else did give
right speaker
wrapped arms night
just beyond door
trinkets sing desert wind behind here
they say it's static electricity but
but out twisted metal discarded fortune's curse
think about loveless fascination
something that's shimmering white
dont want know
borrowed grapes from stores gold
easy burn
hope it's message from someone obscure
it's just joke
both know why you're here
deep room which i've never seen
another so easily sleep
who's one vulture's shoulder
who's one modified cortex
howling growling they want blood
callous future nervousness soon
got off light
but you're just too civilized fight
must have put horse before cart
took rest day
it's shame it's not game
turned up backstage at palace
at least it's artistic guess
gonna stitch up when come unsewn
they fly she pointed up into sky
forget role as stare into soul
collect our coats window gloats
when she used know him
priests hair eyes so clear
better take an arrow better take sled
gotta freeze until burns
you're gonna burn until learn
all those pretty pretty months were so deceiving
here an instant could next week eyes cannot see
irrigated deserts built giant golden thrones
won battles without hope saw men turned into gods
walking down street walking down street
you're so easy adore
you're so easy love
so beautiful see
wonderful as well
you're so easy admire
way love
long distance century buzzes fades
glittering minutes jangled decades
long distance century buzzes fades
as goes down inside
she says mother storm has roam sky
silver lamp lit sign
gonna spring trap
closing snow musk
it's never as good as hoped
oceanic lights are cleverly dim
deluxe locations just near completion
nothing left stoke fire
all own floor
first these daughters appears vacuum void that's created an absence light
when north meets south when right meets left when parallel lines begin converge
seeing things just rest while
take this gift let grow
red pink sun will sink have even heard
put head into hands trying brave
drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
so fire almost out there's nothing left burn
but fire almost out almost out
used feed fire
fire almost out
come closer see
into trees
again again again again
oh elise doesnt matter what do
there're worlds part
wide eyed front
make believe ran out
any more than this
if it's last thing ever do
always ever always
smile shake head
just falling bird
an atmosphere rots time
bites hand
an echo
as he plays his knees
sudden hush across water
sky
can cry this
accuracy
accuracy
caves
tonight going wild
all want again
no this not about running out
yeah know should care if come
want this end dont want start again
it's already been gone
held
one endless moment
kissed
never let go
stare at window
he waits hear her say
he waits hear her say
he waits her understand
how did get this far apart
hours go by
sense quiet despair
go red blue black white
theorise talk yourself
oh kill kiss once
just dont know how
it's not love
they're not regrets
know we've reached end
but there are long long nights when lay awake
sea gold down next
but summer sun sea gold
were so love
have keep this night alive
can make cry
polar bear
she sends everything
so fill head
this wave never breaks said
never die
time always comes say goodbye
how think
always fade
try
now there's nothing can do
but know it's no use
keep laughing
she used just stand there stare
remember
used sometimes try catch her
just try see dark
head door was dream
head door
some kind trigger happy intercourse
couldnt help but notice icy blue eyes
sharing club america tonight
you're such wonderful person living fabulous life
curled an embryo
monument ruined age
as cold as silence
it's perfect
wondered if ever would
never guessed got this good
wondered if ever would
she trying one
never read stars
am trying one her
she will never one
after all these years
one makes him numb
nothing left say
forget everyone
eyes so white legs so long
you're just an object eyes
lick lips
you're just an object object
prayer something better
stroking hair as patriots are shot
pushing her white face into mirror
soldiers close under yellow moon
over over
hundred years
take
take arms
promise less than an hour will honestly go
breathe too deep
ans staring child
an animal pain
head's all wrong size
why keeping this going
just keep moving feet
all words know
distant noises
really have see
all other voices sing
where belong
but real lives are reason why
know have go
one last time before end
held close fear remembering
how used slow drowned were
words true but always just breaking
always away
cant climb out way fell
it's all so safe
piggy mirror
second
oh it's plastic passion
it's plastic passion
it's not case share share alike
wait
play today
echoes round sweating bed
one more day today i'll kill
hopelessness prayers rain suffocate
innocence sleeping children
less show
dont change
innocent forever
he gets inside stare at her
exactly same clean bed
one by one her senses die
water bows
couldnt story
breathing drowning man
how proud she was

stay if want
want fly not stop start
dont say much
sleeping less every night
an old painted doll throes dance
please do right
too many lies
will never clean again
quiet ground
lie lifeless
dancing at funeral party
gives hands shapes angels
cover face as animals cry
fall fall fall fall
kneel wait silence
feel heart pushed
cannot hold what devour
get fucking voice
dead
never felt so cold
never even tried
they pass away day
stares down at ground
it's loudest sound ever heard
wider brighter
we're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
only way land
you're such strange girl
you're such
how time will heal
make forget
believed
promised another life
another day
water as hard shallow drowned lose
it's lower now slower now strangest
kissing hard
i've forgotten how speak
dont care
every day lie here
close eyes
dont think can know
alone
then fell over again
before feed stench love younger
stains carpet stains scenery
round it's coming apart again over
heaven than ever feel whole again
how end always
but it's much late say
there's loads other stuff can make yell
well just goes show
oh just burn down house
everything makes cry
how wrong can
burn down street
clench hands
rip at skin
drained everything but pain
movement sharp clear pure
never seems too late
oh this night will never let go
lose another blind game
voice dead
lost forever happy crowd
bit because feel all fading paling
time down fascination street
times hurts just breathe
or watch yourself burn again
fight fight fight
slowly fading blue
through dark
swollen lips whisper
fades away
burn
tuesday's grey wednesday too
dont care if monday's black
but friday never hesitate
see middle night
i'll lie keep her happy
put hands sky
alone
looks down at breaking face
drink dry
slips her dress flag floor
head pain
this room's so hot
gasping air
deaden glassy mind
every night
but if do you'll missing world

thousand voices whisper true
oh tell it's same boy burning same bed
say it's same always forever

from square one start bit push
buzz buzz buzzing them killer bees

so rise lost toys
nobody nowhere understands anything
so fake
no matter what they do
what takes meaning cleaning meaning who are
all see all breathe all cease
what wants four more years
lost go into hiding room
everybody seems know when he's around
think journey's just begun
do think he'll mind
scarred bruised left blind
who am running from
nobody comes nobody calls
if you're looking
alive something inside
dont think coming down
if he sees know i'll know repeat
have no control
acting as slave drink barricades
dont need them there
if skin looks tired old from living
they press down
hear driving nail
sits there examining her thighs
repeat chorus
when was boy funny things
she placed hand between our lips
as far as you're concerned
no no didnt could sure would if knew
know one takes places
well never pray
from one day next
where all things meet yeah

so close force him begging please
knowing i'd regret this very day
butterfly
butterfly
butterfly
get kicks from seeing floor
butterfly
dream mine
dream mine
dream mine
see through
waving rode parade awhile
ride wave along mitigated mile
can see tables turning
obligation
watch their backs as they leave single file
through haze memory well
ground's little weathered where stood
nailing leaves ground
watching them sorting debris
came back same place
know it's there but cant see
if ever drive mild suffering this open kiss
ever drive mild
no cop no stop cruising corner shop
but could let cause band
it's just change
all love have mind
watch look at
more or less
oh
it's just change
can see million faces condensation
are coming back
now mumble each breath take
conceding lying cheating
you'll have drag everywhere go
know at all
so
down into obsession
trying what want
if could what want
would leave but leave wouldnt matter
an ovation her ego
her everyone everything everything mine
spill last drink
neon wilderness
trying keep feet ground
cause people dont take chances their hearts
doesnt matter how ended or began
she never wanted talk
but that's way goes
few hundred years
rescue's way
will go anywhere she goes
ominous man
between life death
i've seen this road before down this floor
forget lovers you've know
coming own
under fiery skies
cant hear this beauty life
too afraid you'll too much
you've gotta tie yourself mast friend
i'd rather die than see fly
dont bother call
it's pushing locked doors get mind
it's only one
every word so intimidating
curse days i've wasted here
it's so absurd
feeling very moses
i'll tell parables making love
so children grab m 16s
now go tune guitars
'cause springtime dancing
was penny previous
universe gravitate orchestrate am fearless
every minute losing one by one
she'd often let play them i'd set 'em up different scenes
dish his lovin spoon were never found
reverend girl
head upon window pane
see next one have good time
eyes they open wide
spirit '76 trombones lead
black bead rosary under her pillow when thunders she clutches tightly
porcelain girl danced music box ballet us
he wants everybody he wants anything
he's choking apologies she's channeling superstar
she got love
can feel her love
she climbed so high
are only one
know i've got place go
wonder which cup you'll drink from
but just today
change this life
dont believe love free
life
another drink wont miss her
it's all right it's all right
there'll no tears cried
make all seem fine
aint got no lullaby oh no
keep pushing 'cause know it's there
we're taping king beaten his crown
country 'tis thee sweet land irony
hello it's it's
i'll throw fire back down
just drinking
i'll crank all
fear bargain basements are gone without trace yeah
tune tune out
it's getting down love
but know i'll see face again
all this talk getting old
i'll sing ear again
never coming down never going down
oh god i've dodged unexpected bullets behind accolades
now guilt stricken sobbing head floor
best friend took week's vacation forget her
any other day not disturbing
but not enough life
very best ways
if life were moment once stood still
we'd lonely blue lonely
do understand
just know
just go now
gotta go
it's not today it's yeah
know you've won goodbye gone
sitting at home bed too long
how are gonna take
come inside come inside
down down down go till reach bottom
lookin back life
woke up one other day
or out sight
there time
couldnt good
changed
there among debris find casual casualty
it's not pretty underneath
still feel strong
about life
life game
now trying tell
walked alone
sky lavender ivory clouds threaten drops finger paints
stripping flowers at pedal pace
grew up while she she grew out
victory doesnt taste same
see how they twist shout
up back shooting pain
signs are right
come see water break fall
calling out some one
backing up screaming guitar
do gotta straight line
but gotta straight line
was our hands from 6 10
world dont stop
yeah save
pills under pillow
through remains have been sorting
you're gorgeous running out
sleeping seems greatest medication
we're train
felt surprised
well could go any slower you're such church goer
you're slap wrist you'll hardly missed give one more kiss
you're wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
you're slap wrist you'll hardly missed give one more kiss
all precious faces
poured guilt right over eyes
wanna know
wanna
wanna feel
then our heads exploded overload when decide
shield eyes dear mother from pain hovers
but what else could do
if something inside
these things love could
thank
shine then you're gone
shine then you're gone
get
whatever want
load up
one more
thank
come back come back again again
you're setting sun
world not clever but would stay forever
so write forehead or better yet engrave
or lord above guide
what happiness
have ever felt
but dont want much
very soon room was spinning
then came one said only thing ever gave were bad directions
burned cancer when answer did occur
keep moving people
reminds what have run from
hope understand
where could see what should do
cause am
why am going
who will one
cause feels right
who snuffs smile once had shined so bright
want all
anything can do
down arms fingertips
ah ah ah ah
from knees up nose
am love
if she'd get nerve stay
we're always off again
would worth wait
borrowed lyrics sung feeling slumping
unrelentless thoughtless selling
once gift good bye but now remind replace
mouth that's open wide speechless seems such waste
she took into wind blown alley way
there's nothing this girl wouldnt do
sure i've seen before
oh but seems much love
believe till see what livin has done
sure i've been here before
could see knocking down door
scenes from all romantic prose while tethered roles
if when meet again we'll still more than friends
as rolled
through dim light
endless life
life's an ocean
say will see
it's slippery slidy road down
yes there's love if want
dont sound no sonnet lord
stop say hello
oh by now
now thrill mine moment
abuse but not intended internal use
slither these sheets
goliath sits watches
'cause springtime dancing
laughing 'cause they dont know who am
acting as slave drink an open grave
acting as slave drink while she forgave
if dont dare will not try
best lines they'd flow right off tongue
souvenirs very first time
spoke barely if at all
'cause it's bittersweet symphony this life
but million different people
cant change cant change
trying make ends meet
from one day next
been down
when was fighting tears
cruising nemesis high seas
bully enjoying his vacation
waving rode parade awhile
ride wave along mitigated mile
can see tables turning
obligation
watch their backs as they leave single file
through haze memory well
ground's little weathered where stood
nailing leaves ground
watching them sorting debris
should drive wild
all biggest plays missed
awoke threat was empty grandstand not through yet
hello we're so out here hitchhike canada backpacks full cigarettes beer
round mess man you've uncovered
love leads loss
has died little
but look what did
would same old stories but you're hanging onto every single word have say
these ties may have severed now you'll stay forever
not waiting friend beside
just find out
wanna find
dont know how get so out touch
though prefer red they tasted all right
turned out all was just medium
penny poison but dont mind
if there's crease face over time there's plenty more where came from
impressing what i've done
swallow this scene there laughter
when were real were love
are crusade
4 am
never mind thunder
off distance runner uplift
she has faces up her bedroom they gaze down her guarding her slumber
dresser top jewelry box colored tassels tied knots
picture taken twenty years ago she keeps her portfolio
evidence sits vcr
now only night lights flickering
as proudly hail our taxis out fight
know an old lady who swallowed fly
all desire sweep stage fliers
there's not missing link no matter what think
once bane perversion
volume knob controls scream
shake head leisure get head body into seizure
stop baby's breath shoe full rice
his girl took week's worth valium slept
while others roamed
lonely blue lonely
listened her song
i'd leave untattered untouched until
that's when river ran dry
fight little purpose
only meaning scratch surface
thirteen miles 31 are drying
lovely gentlemen
then drowned her indifference
cut cord which life depends
another villain cover
see how they twist shout
all love millionaire
what said about audience
now should repeat second verse
through remains have been sorting
you're gorgeous running out
sleeping seems greatest medication
got home field advantage all can manage
you're wonderful waste time
you're wonderful waste time
you're wonderful waste time
who will one
who will leave bed this morning
honest
will wait
are everything
every day every night
love all
would listen say
am between girl
as sure as world round
worth search forever
pre pubescent girls appealing
techno pop kids stardom's rockets
repeat chorus
wouldnt want leave upon tongue sour taste
kiss idle kiss idle
if when meet again once were more than friends
tonight took snapshot guess got tender spot
park near backstage pass lot underage
yeah it's good guaranteed
parting lips wrapped up
said am not quite ready
life riding this chair wheels
think know problems
light slowly fading
know cant control
said but meant
meant what said
all need redemption some more or less
she can see reflections her own eyes
no escape life average
will never let down
trying keep
trying keep
always source confusion
can take an oceanside
keep chin up keep back straight
an amorous man
jury reject alibi's seemingly watertight
could never let another day go
every word so intimidating
all words punctuated
well know started as fist fight
so when all these imitations fail
how live only water bread rice
same black line was drawn
subway steam silhouettes dreams
who's hangin onto nothin
bang her drums drums
carnivals girl
it's just so easy
well angel watch life
there's only only one heart highway
turn rusted steel it's
cant handle care
their rains slayed dry fire would
when rolled rolled big drum
another one dark
when she shot down moon
stood just feet apart
know hardwood floors all penniless rough
well must have one these
where did ever learn treat
no windshield
here dont change
no windshield
not hold gun face earth's abduction
we'll make brand new feathers
face another
wings they've turned leather
were never really own
who picked up who gathered around
but dont have his girl
dont have girl
can always own girl
you'll have started new one
warning
said rang them
they'll throw back forever
than nail hammer
sometimes it's hard tell wishing from well
they say you're only sad lonely
remember everyday
i've wanted
as look deep
over barricades climb
temptations made blind
wish would wish might
get set let's go
they're pushin up clay
that's tears
or something cling
then dont make us wait
chorus

warm embrace
everything need
not looking

but it's not what she took hurt
'cuz it's not what she took hurt
'cause man would never leave her this way
so dont want here morning

i'd come upon some rotting remains
if try hard think will see
but still i'd think there are better methods
here comes jane know she's sportin chain

he gathered up some people he had made
so he saidonce there was boy
but god said nothing
was how he liked have his teeth pulled out
he yelled at him
oh here stand before

old st pete's gonna serve pie sky
how come all body parts so nicely fit together
well looky here now oh
you're sayin c'mon baby
way play tricks
sugar contains
want par tay p par tay
that's quite an after taste you've left now you're not around
just makes nicer when do arrive
consider what could call good life
cant say liked robinson crusoe
sort who often fall ill young or pine away
went books even lectures
ha ha outlived by thing stupid things
sometimes when lie awake hear rainfall tent fly
who put doggy doghouse
dont try everything while gone
keep eye things while gone
keep eye things while gone
he said was from when
mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm
but when look down at their bodies
when met was hot green jungle
dawn would come would start feel own sunrise
things come may somewhat unfamiliar
then i'll squat down wash end day
our driver gestures out behind palm trees
overachiever might putting mildly
fear struck he threw up inside his helmet
all night long
think must have double who's been frickin
all night long
sometimes despair world will never see
sometimes when supe was stopping crimes
she'd stuff bodies dead little birds
swatting flies
hope you'll understand
could happy country
could happy country
you'd shake their bony hands so dispell gloom
demons come plague as lie bed
then hope you'll come over other side
she could not control them they kept her up nights
what does she think when she foretells disease
wont spend rest our lives together
people might think were our honeymoon
if toast gets stuck toaster
example stop signs
between toaster stop sign tonsils
he gets them drunk gets their money
killing from his office desk
losing lots blood
bail him out buy him gin
they'd give them potions
they thought they were visions
dont know which should favorite paintings
what if artists ran tv
but hoped trip into country
here were many years winter drownings
charlie sedarka was playing piano
you're nobody this crowd
he said appreciate beauty if have one then
eyes were everywhere
hour
everyone's prisoner
one them poisonous
what destiny police woman said20 amnesia
dont let lose heart
but it's only business
mister gorbachov came cap hand 20 amnesia
chorus
you're sitting garage contemplating suicide
well how can corrupt
big nothing
smoky voice petaled girl woke him long enough there was too
big nothing repeat until fade
he used victim
mind made up but mouth undone
until you're well hung
other times they thought they heard laughter
crickets played tape recorder
were sharp ideal as bobby pin
are not impressed
did he leave pretty fingers lying
aim true
alison know this world killing
cause cant stand see this way
all grown up
chorus
wrote
baby cant act age
confession may delay
chorus
those days are recalled gallery wall
so she finds mixture hard deny
our leaders have feasts backsides beasts
now eyes are red from crying
almost
money
being swallowed by clown
just american between tears
oh she seemed crying year after year
tv they prosecute anyone who's exciting
one had been beauty queen other was her friend
newsreel commentators said cheerio gi brides
turn sinister when get boot
oh heaven preserve us
he asks her where she's been
cant say more would telling
please dont put silly head pretty soldier's hat
please dont put silly head british soldier's hat
dont want woman adore
just give promise supposed keep now
dont listen word they say gonna love any old way
hold girl had let her go
walk worn out floor
except she's picking heart not mine
she used meet at mens room before she learned how snide
when she talks
well asked little baby kiss
did teach this little child these curses soul
tight lipped leer judgement
swallowed sleeping pills dreams
well here's boy if ever there was
looking man who sold dummy
go hand glove
almost beaten punch
this battle bottle nothing so novel
now find fit this identikit completely
all laddies cat call wolf whistle
everything so provocative
trying become fixture
came alive left dead
she'll one when girls have gone home
sheep slaughter
prince darkness stole some tart
she's got playing russian roulette
all little sisters try big sister's clothes
sweat out thirty seconds home improvements
love sale
if want thrill love i've been through mill love
can put money where mouth
because he neighbourhood
know i've never been corrupt
love went mad love went mad
self made mug hard break
lamb dressed as mutton
lovers step shuffle gamble
lovers slink up lovers charm
now love's limping lover's crutch
now look lover but you're only tourist
say love her when really loathe her
somebody's soft touch
lying minister state
tight grip short hairs
retire sharp short
now there's newsprint all over face
if say love then must delirious
having heart attack round ankles
could tell sensitivity
doing everything just tryin please her
just dont know how stand strain
her bloodless face ran red inside but was she
well how can miss what you've never possessed
sometimes people are just what they appear
hercules lives
walk their brilliant parade
miss mary try not doubt
dress up blue
moods moderns x4
soon you'll belong someone else
moods moderns
falling without second look
all pavements miles around are littered footprints
why did have leave
what brings this part town
must keep telling you've got new love
told how much dont want
mccartneymacmanus
now dont have tell anybody
brave brave brave face
simplest things set off again
dark life
dont know
dreams
these
enter pious elite
doesnt bring
as he tipped her
position
all cream
looks are laughable unphotographable
science fiction twin
every intention surrendering
tattered pictures her daughter
better stamp his little feet
they asked how world he does all these things
but when day through
world just seemed die
break into dreams
know it's over
can take all have left
dont tell dont know what love
three
pen electric typewriter
unhappy blade both invite
chorus
chorus
chorus
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
he said was nothingit's over done
innocently spun her rolodex
other eyes
if look pretty miss
forgive her anything
so where did all pride go
please dont leave waitin too long
chorus
oh got little heart inside beating
hey sweet baby oh dont know am yours from head toe
well heaven knows what fills heart makes feel so alive
her rival would always wait 'til eighth or ninth bell
radio plays lover's symphony
played fool find yourself another fool
gonna move all out heart
stop wasting time
gonna find another heart
too crowded getting mighty crowded
roll up ghost train
laughing singing dressed up dice
step right up show face
roll up ghost train
oh just want hear girls talk
stick you're dedicated
enter madam x painted shocking pink spangled dress
are looking
live life miserable poverty
little white flowers will never awaken
last breath heart i'll blessing
if strong might still break
lost imagining
fracture spell as he she becomes enemy
he she was light i'd bless
toughen up toughen up
talk two faced rules are rigid 'cause it's strict time
strict time
if could spend an evening now then
that's when she'll arrive
though no one seems notice as they hurry by
listen now
can believe it's happening
suffering face
it's just alibi all broken up inside
steam fading bathroom mirror
while nat king cole sings welcome world
they pulled him out cold cold ground
or let him go
think all pleasure brings
they pulled him out cold cold ground
carnal cunning she couldnt express
so she dyed her hair adopted another name
but while chance appears
between cruelty beauty
suddenly you're talking duchess
beat up strangers who talk funny
but sunday's best
sunday's best sunday's finest
put them all boots khaki
instead having sweet dreams all about
hour distress need not fear
made want run away
why dont lay head down
it's really just silly fragment paper
you'll taking life hands
reach
can talk we're love or talk we're above
think back now when were young
unwrapping presents should have sent
what if never learn from our mistakes
close door dim lights blow out candles
unwrapping presents should have sent
so happy birthday again
how wrong can before am right
balance our love
he's living under threat arrest
see lying so wide awake
give temptation
how come everybody wants friend
that's what get if go chasing after vengeance
anybody wanna swallow
well if only knew things do
see friends walking down street
just wanna victim
see friends despite all arrangements
thankful didnt open another bottle inspiration
but sooner or later you're gonna face big light
there will tears candles
it's too much say
now know somehow dont feel so alone
sometimes he sings mocking bird twilight infamy
meanwhile motor car kingdom
instead these comedians
another faceless backless dress
schnapps chianti porter ouzo
secret life frank sinatra
know what guess
but back bedroom
but still refused believe
eternally yours
see had first leave
when you're lying coffin
when you're lying coffin
when you're lying coffin
while all time camptown theatres piccadilly
they'll sending him round from door door
it's another world or had better
touch go
choose hypocrite
crowd would hoot holler more
was scared was scared was scared was scared
going take little trip down paradise's endless shores
going up pole where folks die cold
he's planting trashy paperback book accidental purchase
their tears
hurry down doomsday bugs are taking over
hurry down doomsday bugs are taking over
where passion squandered money spent
it's not days when leave
time broke up
contempt any modesty
love field
where things can arranged
she's so tense but it's never mentioned
still mystified
can see those pictures any magazine
she was selling stolen kisses travelling salesmen minstrel singers
bare wires from socket bed where embraced girl
when you've squandered all you've earned
get off work see baby
there's stranger house nobody's seen his face
there's stranger house no one will ever see
flirting kind
flirting kind
man tone deaf
chorus
irritating jingle
he's yelling her ear
it's small humiliations memory piles up
are tranquillized tamed
'cause something deep inside wants turn black blue
hope dont murder
dont send any money
or just possibly scare death
twister or dupe will bamboozle or hoodwink
woebetide anyone so woebegone
trouble will vanish
just sign line could possibly write blood
now can they recall being young idealistic
have mercy creatures this sad burlesque
'cause she's this year's girl
bright spark might corner market
all this but no surprises this year's girl
tiny fingers almost feel
oh she's almost human beneath cuban heel
tiny fingers almost feel
they put slum into slumber boot into beauty
can count out
chorus what do care if world joke
whistles out tuneless theme song hundred cheap suggestions
tango bar stanley or puerto margarita
while fountains fill second hand perfume
chorus
know their name hasnt travelled very well
sunshine lovers pass by
dream spanish citadel
dont have paris dont have rome
let memory come around
tonight bottle let down
hurt or make feel blue
lifetime go
suddenly really fall pieces
long suffering friends fatal charm
pray lord soul save
well hope she sleeps well at night isnt
then expect say thank straighten up look proud pleased
they'll stand there laughing tramp dirt down
pictures plastered ivy creeper between old toy soldiers
turning town red aah
or temporary wedding
crowds surround loudspeakers
was committed life
up late pacing floor
just nitwit
make member
great dictator
knew right from start
all those he's better than
they gave rose' wine
how love
now i'll never another unwanted number
mama says he just doesnt care remember
when he wouldnt leave
unwanted number
he's prepared read mind
wonder how he knows
chorus
well was all sixty five years ago
very quiet still
everyone was looking little entertainment
dear lord sincerely hope you're coming
waiting end world
throwing dice air
go try walk across lake
better watch step
they say it's good business
when you're kicking cot room
better watch step
they beat him up until teardrops start
chorus
dont get cute
she watching detectives
snatch tune match cigarette
who are ready hear worst about their daughter's disappearance
thank flowers
she said he looked devil
though almost had weakness
now i've lived heartaches
cant stand up falling down
even though i've seen movie
one's named gus one's named alfie
she gave little flirt gave herself little cuddle
he's fine figure man handsome too
he's acting innocent proud still know what he's after
reluctance seems surprise
they're never worth crying
tell how can advise someone dont even know
so writing people may never meet
once held her
never knew what had
who gives all her love
kiss 'cause feels hit
kiss 'cause feels hit
when so many people pass by
foolish man lot life
laid decorated dish
trying best make dark
dont think can live without
want
want
want
afraid wont know where stop
did call his name out as he held down
want
hate buttons shirt when all wanna do tear
wear badge put all over face
handful eagerness says what do suggest
know where but dont care
do things you're doing now
but dont want no one but love
know not kind guy
i'll go out mind if losing touch
i'll go out mind if losing touch
head full daydreams his hands full material
imperial bedroom regal boudoir
know
i've been very gloomy
saying try find another lover
lets start again
can keep shrink
lady chamber
can pull up again
thought were so smart
chorus
were spice life
these things have faced
dont want treated some poor grateful clown
no pool no pets no cigarettes
one head business another good looks
chorus
you're very colourful compliments
thought she was young
it's under table
dont have clue
chorus
dont blame
coast coast hand hand
when they step face
say it's she's thinking
when she's barely awake
next minute can find yourself kneeling
were just way
pull curtains
came home drunk
where they pour coca cola just vintage wine
was as much alphabet as she knew how use
now he's brilliant mistake
was fine idea at time
if am blinded i'll have voices still guide
world just seemed stop as stood there so close
so think have seen her
service stations
automatic
now you've given performance
want kiss her
girl trick man calling
hardly speaking sotto voce
noise infernal
well how could believe i'll take seriously
well how could believe i'd take seriously
are ready final solution oh oh
ready experiment you're ready burned
so here they are departure lounge
starts slap ends up kiss
though he only taught her three little words
clean money clean money
'cause he neighborhood
have made selection
hang up some amber beads
there was clown strike
but all seems simple step
or are terrified failure
dont have tumble
somebody's watching where others dont walk
who's making lover's lane safe again lovers
clowntime over
chorus
mums dads
long arm law slides up outskirts town
some things come common these days
lack lust you're so lacklustre
possession
then put down
fool am
you're pouring water
then leave cold
you're pouring water
civil disobedience from soldier dirty rifle
'till dont know what's what
just cartoons titter tatter
'cause head killing
oh dont hand johnny's pup mama
think psycho dont mama
think psycho dont mama
turn down little bit
pump up until can feel
pump up until can feel
pump up when dont really need
oh forget reason
think it's time turn over
pointless heartache
doing anything radio advised
but they dont give any choice
promise an early death
radio radio
hide love hide love
play one more radio sweetheart
one needs love constantly
he will break heart if go him
from heart little girl
just dont think care
completely surrender
knowing love shared
talk gets so topical
now looks you're either gonna or against
stood there stupefied thought recognized
then left alone
all way down repeat fade
send message sweetheart
ceiling
hiding something they cant show
as he went fetch his keys
why numbers ran from twelve
no vacancy as take key
all lies upon tongues all girls upon rails
suppose you're winner
goodbye was even colder than ice
then gonna hang right up
he's so mad about this girl tonight
but no where sad as girls night
champagne rolls off her tongue second language
he muttered words he'd never dare say if she could see him
she went back pitiful compromise he'd go back his family
down basement
pleasure or business
feeling nothing caring less
are really only ancient history
didnt do love didnt even do stealth
lucky girl leads life leisure
though may second hand
way could benefit from death disability
from arms his bride
who's butcher harbour
whose name shall cherish
say here lies great unknown
said cant afford feel affection
but wont told life one love sordid
it's greatest
you've never been this far
when want him double jointed
wish she could step down from screen seat stalls
listening murder mystery
why must apologize every time sit down write
i'll go one better heard myself say
almost change sad expression
there's nothing left over
can so hard calculate
so ask yourself
can still friends
but there's wife whos wondering where her husband could tonight
if he's out date then her life's ruins
he snaps back just elastic
now you're danger yourself
butcher baker bassline maker
dont pin medal yet
she's not only flame town
you'd less tender more tinder
you're not only flame town
you'll see off distance hope
lie down baby now dont say word
know dont make difference
felt tragic without reason
teenage girl crying 'cos she dont look million dollars
madman standing by side road saying
an unwanted birthday
telling tales underground
policemen fountains
he paid have painted company angels
stamping ground
barman pretends he's saved place
going home same jokes
say it's very nice know
stamping ground
still hang around
after said how can continue
knocked out
then better go him
words start fly glass jaw
so if you're going
that's everything
mere idea
family circle gathers 'round from very far near
kissing cousins step outside cuddle confess
come sentimental feelings lure vitriol
this life
between mum walls
when they let you'll find there's no way out
when they let you'll find there's no way out
broken hearts
there wont anymore wont before
oh they'll never never take her love from
but knew her love would never set free
window up above long
do recognize face
about darkness
this house empty now
night wont forget
broke heart two
chorus
they're laughing drains
oh jack all parades
cant keep peace
world walked 'round mouth
or jack all parades
so you'll just have come out face music
will both incinerate
children sit upon stairs
an old bus ticket or photograph
dont let them see crying way oh no
dont let them see crying way
cant trust promise or guarantee
candidate talkin radio from cheaters jamboree
'cause man 'round curve says he's never heard
better take another measure measure
memories dont mean much
just about glad
they called time vodka lime
but her lamp was just beginning dim
chorus
she's telling all those lies
sometimes he takes himself so seriously
want kid again about
there's stone washed damsel junk food run
it's kinder murder
she could have kept her knees together
knickers her handbag one false eyelash
sniggering beer
lot loose exchanges precious little respect
if ever lose this good thing i've got
all recognize handwriting
moguls want human sacrifice
hear clatter typewriter
they took his pride
we're not going sail tonight
so hush now darling sweet little one
better leave kitten all alone
gonna hit
girls gonna miss
better leave
no father wont know
pistol was still smoking man lay floor
let him dangle
though guilty was verdict craig had shot him dead
but word never came phone never rang
let him dangle string him up
have come this fa fa fa find soul cliche
whose tongue now tasting last week's flavour
better not do anything reckless
these are dangerous amusements
can send little letter
not just another mouth lipstick vogue
wanna throw away but not broken
poor belated chastity fell foul grown up games
chorus
chocolate town all trains are painted brown
they'll soon pulling down little palaces
sedated homes england are theirs vandalize
would have waited all life
actions speak louder now than words
when dont call up
when say ok but gotta cheek
here are living paradise
saying 'we'd always knew you'd make
but i'll at video will watching
broadcasts popular song
feel guilty desiring such an innocent face
especially at twilight
having time life
now they're not only ones
you're so lovable
chorus
toast town talk bedroom
movies save conversation
three little words roll off tongue
oh what letdown when battle was finally won
instrumental
but if they knew how felt they'd bury alive
why d'you wanna friend when feel juggler
or did think she was different girl
her hair hanging down
oh why did decide
now she's hung up chandelier
each time feel this inside
sweet harmony
what's so funny 'bout peace love understanding ohhhh
chorus
oooh ooh
oooh ooh
when he goes through head
little heart
who do think are
must he burdened by all he's taught consider his own
repeating their offer each girl they meet
why dont love used do
aint had no lovin huggin kissin long long while
will take care
come down price right what's name
they commit blue murder along union avenue
you've seen film you've read book
dont want hear another word about young lovers
saying 'you belong belong me'
i'd promise now again i'd honour contract
so parade where appointments are made
now every time meet edge hysteria
bowed down
but bird his hand
mother just gives her some pills choose
little fool
how i've been tempted
looked so deadly
darkness would become underneath table
if dont believe
need protection from physical art conversation
when you're half woman you're half awake
bridge chorus
it's any place where there's music free drink from him
just shabby doll
there's always girl distress
just shabby doll
he's just shabby doll
late friday night when bars are all shuttered dark
they'll never know ways world
they flop beach
leave days days days days days
nobody gets out this alive
we've forgotten things strangers do
must shamed into love
but always return face
four walls roof
four walls roof
forget about broken spectacles
soon we'll shipbuilding
when could diving pearls
this love mine packed stepping stone
thought i'd spend pace go distance
cigarettes 'cause watch him walk away from
but when she's finished know
now somebody has pay one who got away
he got hit by an emotional ricochet
know same thing has happened before
'cause when drinkin am nobody's friend
well was powerful day there were black crows road
now she's pinned up upon barracks wall her home town
somehow through day
through sleepless nights
now everybody's breakin up somebody else's home
why dont call day can both confess
it's so candy
here lies picture girl
but that's so candy
she couldnt say goodbye but admire taste
we've got them hangin string
so young so young
something about not same
they took girl dreams left here instead
put fingertips up screen
that's when they'll fear name
room called creation where all obey laws
between pity advice
i'd drop out sight disappear turn up another town but somehow
mingling sweet smoldering scent martyr
sometimes bring down play reluctant confidant
you've still got dignity or next best disguise
what can say
it's still too soon know
how many crumbs bed
how many chewings gum
how deep his bite
strange gonna leave alone gonna leave this
clock all faces move block
chorus
they're all covered up white washed grease paint
their continental fingers have
chorus
but i'll underground
have got too much pride
corporation logo flashing off sky
oh know ungrateful
wait until they've got running
it'll all start happening then
so when it's way past nine get ready swinging time
dont wanna see 'cause dont miss much
he's got ev'rything need
has mad fool him
there's gonna no dancing own
he's getting down his knees
so know see
while putting world right
when you've been murder mile
it's professional career
opportunity opportunity
she said when they get dover they'll taking over
please dont turn around
you're fool enough start
make bad jokes make bad time
so get mind off sweet behind our little angel
but he's so surprised he's alive
'til he's drinking hairspray she knows he never would dare
those eyes tried capture
so this had
so this had
seen 'em leaving when party's over
maybe someday can go hiding from this world
would give anything
one these days
wouldnt say was raised romance
loud dress blue
feels so funny having all this money
drunk down druged up crowd
but all cheered wildly photograph was taken
you're still part some conspiracy
international propaganda star wars
shorthand makes life easy
believe trust promise wish love's just throwaway kiss
money talks diamonds ermine
camera noses tears her face
give rope
they come from lovely people hard line hypocrisy
just what it's now you're mess
turn from playboy into man
would drag down now joke's
would walk out door
took away from rest world
would hurt all pride
but money's rolling out town
you've gotta use imagination some magazine romance
all can win
piece heart
poisoned rose
threw myself upon floor
keep her out all night
those super 8 movies daddy disco dresses
lives lives lives
so you're flogging dead horse
he's screaming some words at top his lungs
almost certain he's trying increase his burden
since he punched hole fabric
bluebird singin trees
sing since you've been gone
when should have found someone put blame
sometimes justice will find
take law into hands
wilted favour he gave her still fastened frame
who composed this tune
slide inside telephone wire runs under briny
had better not go too far
leave mother father
how it's always another day
heard fell hell or hammersmith blues
going down three times only come up twice
wasted time when would try try try
stay little while then you're gone again
did anybody notice over marmalade eggs
chorus
speak up quickly
suppose live learn though it's hard believe as
stop press they've just decided destroy
had let her down easy as slow as could
thinking days
but it's alright
bless light shines believe
those endless days those sacred days gave
all promise unfulfilled
am not leaving all problems
deep dark truthful mirror
but you're never any doubt there's something happening somewhere
you'll stretch him out saint
chorus
'cause know things they're saying are right
'cause they seem cover ev'ry move make
lions left tame
brags rags jewels
will leave as need most
now just dont know who tell go hell
under shadow distorted angel
when things go wrong seem mad
never mean take out
dont wish knew what they were sayin
oh he's doctor luther's assistant
doctor luther's assistant
many blooms still linger there
havent said

play part so well
so no one lives inside
if cant speak cant lie

scorch marks road ahead
there's line her jeans ballpoint made
so if ever decide have escape
see those people there
used bother them but now it's ok
see little girl spirallin down
could make pillow sand sleep
god's sake dont pretend concerned
was taught from much too young
only wish knew
cause happiness not something
never give myself away
dont say all can
no incantations remorse friend
listen as syllables slaughter cat calm precision
friend need friend bleeds

everybody knows live world where they give bad names beautiful things
should live beautiful world
have faith

dreamed rolled ocean floor
dragged down ocean bed
rolled sway an iron bell
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
sighs at skylight gets lost haze
he's clutching photograph berlin party girl
hole our hearts
quick an dead
today saw music sky
between
ice fire
no god complain
what goes between
fever wont leave alone
will stare from window
kick legs scream
took all have still want more
would take run
but poor misguided directionless familiar some obscure scottish poet
she was wallflower at sixteen she'll wallflower at thirty four
room dancing shadows where all heartache disappears
weekend career girl never boarded plane
verge indecision
lonely piece action from another town
still trying get over still trying write love songs passing strangers
some us go down haze publicity
inviting casual obscenity
childhood childhood
she had medals pinned threadbare greatcoat
should say goodbye
ecstasies undared tremble upon edge tightly respectably unfulfilled
inevitable loss
placed herself reach
she's crying
cant cheat fate girl
though stinging kills honey bee
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
watched her as she walked across coals
nightmare surfer babe
she was singing was born nineteen sixty weird
plastered paris
home where heart lies
before blond hairs turn grey
charting charting charting charting single
where home
auditioning leading role silver screen
would she dare recite soliloquies at risk stark applause
but now it's just another chelsea monday
catalogue princess apprentice seductress
turned mirror saw child once loved
still child
now realize you've got get out here
still child
through looking glass
out luck out charm out game rejections cigarette city
awaiting development paranoid polaroid eyes
give time wont give time
did ever fall love
so often
running scared
if heart were ball
did ever dream falling
never do never do
wild rose
dummy tussauds you'll see
want do adverts american express cards talk shows prime time tv
forwarned audience leaves stage floating ahead
nursing an erection misplaced reaction no flower place before this gravestone
misplaced reaction satisfaction
just greasepaint mask
you've played this scene before
mother living
mother dead
violence heartbeat
cs lewis books
all poisoned attitudes
chapters you'll writing
paint picture
microsoft tears
when you've nothing left sell
it's already broken
thank god internet
so deep
holding word scalpels trembling lips
are pilots passion sweating flight course
empty chambers embracing end
this ricochet
just record gonna put down down
but i've got no discipline got no self control
do remember dawn escapes from moon washed college halls
kayleigh oh never thought i'd miss
so sorry never meant break heart
how long can stand
how long can stand
you're sick stomach
suddenly gone
dozen tequilas you're feeling all right
make up hides bruises tears so they never show
know you'll never act know you're love
ebony flowers pinned velvet cushion red light
dreaming spark
will queen
iou love
when met magdalene
can hear heart can hear heart can hear heart
but cant give up believing going live forever
gave up everything feels allright
colours stand still
pain when fall
attitude authority
alone city at seventeen
hideous dark secrets under sea holes ground
fear try
just wanted first one
just wanted first one
have seen this face thousand times
being made again by
bright new world
pinned up her wall
sleepwalking through danger signs
she's got map world
it's such beautiful world

blue pain from something no brain

this love
one last time
this truth
strobing amber light
came this place make chances real big city
this town hangs around doorway tells late

it's slaughter it's slaughter
where why not should they oughta
wining
smiles polluted false charm
oh please do come
does ocean hear cry
or were only playing macho
you're trying win back her affection
think they will forgive hero anything
only takes fraction second
thrown beach seal ready slaughter
can understand it's way choose
heading rave
fire ice amazon eskimo
they say it's lie
use instead
it's as simple as
sick
ashes water now
heading great escape
standing swing
every corridor walk
heaven number seven
mountain echo curfews bell signal ending tasks
they cannot face trembling crowd flinch grendels name
along forest path he roams hrothgar's hall so clear
denizens twilight lands humbly beg him through
stellular heavens ignore even childrens cries
iv finale
so say believe all mother nature's laws
instrumental
hard as love
makes tremble makes fall
makes angry makes blind
baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love
when he offered sacred bread
he's got experience he knows know
blank eyes purple fever streaming through frosted pane
he knows know know know
was born habit
wide boys were wide boys
lucky little ladies at watering holes
returning nature child happy wild free
holidays eden
back own country
see no hear no speak no evil
cog hurrying world
know how hard can wait
deepest darkness
who were before
but i've got feeling rumours are true
fairweather friends call two by two
feel so strange what's wrong
hands steady as hangmans hands
ive been feeling kind down loose
found power dusty shelf
madam im adam im palindrome
hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors
frantic as cardiograph scratching out lines
this house aches
quiet at all volumes
let spring air today
but now it's crumbling tumbling down
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth
there's million words could share tonight
how can hurt how can hurt
last time
chaos colours
hold
even if good old days were good
savin up mary savin up jane
music marillion lyrics john helmer
but must drink all alone
feelings
into answering machine
floor by bedroom door
best not pick up phone
beauty was skin deep
were really all same
you're all believe
sound truly heartbroken
learned routines high scoring loops
dont ever wonder
waiting world change
waiting world change
did fall asleep babe
blue bird
only love will turn around
gasp from crowd
must man take all mail will bring
paper lies
when get behind news world do things find begin bend mind
starless shutters eyes
stripped gloss from beauty queen
oh judy
punch judy
who forgot flush loo
punch judy
punch judy judy
it's kind lie
just exactly what taking pleasure
every little grin dont want wonderin
if could jump ride between skin silicon then
you're only happy when you're oiled jewelled
leakproof
turn up half an hour late night after night
no tears
there's always another chance
no lies
there's always another chance
have nights days you've come through
was runaway girl all they chose see
pretend wait washing some laundromat
one more experience one more entry diary self penned
too much too soon too far go too late play
losing roundabouts roundabouts game over
scream that's born from sorrow
sit chew daffodils struggle answer why
can still say love
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
sledging hill
england
say goodbye
so unpleasant inside out
if i'll tell about
from living stream
worth paying see
enough freak
when she spoke her words ensnared
i've seen different doorway shut million times before
betrayed lizard's bed lizards bed
go hell
what anyone could tell her
what anyone could tell her
carbon trail scores moist stretched palm
their hopes betrayals only reply
take away
stand here waiting whistle blow
twists her body
there's screw tighten
'till splinters gather
these fragments love
when gets right down there's no one here that's left blame
we're just sugar mice rain
just couldnt stand looks their faces saying what jerk
'cause there's not enough love go 'round
'cause there's not enough love go 'round

so many nights could only dream ya

but one night while she lay sleepin slipped away
say job taking longer than planned dont have heart tell her

since she left by myself

reckless discharge gun
through teardrops his eyes
so guess i'll confessin love confessin love

will send her home tonight
but know day has not come an end

coming down droppin fast
higher take deeper go

grown up sexy texas babies
but theyve all got new names
thought everything was right but went left instead
repeat chorus
if aint one thing it's another one way
can never think givin up
she swears she loves those kids she doesnt mind load
ringing telephones decisions made
wondering if they're still style
hoping might return
while was hunting wild turkey sippin jim beam
wouldnt bet wooden nickel he aint
when they start hating love loving hate
coast coast its alive most
last night came home again
after all hell ive put her through
pray god someday ill feel same
last night dreamed went sleep good
waiting there carry away

far removed
shining precious light

between earth skies above
need little more time
let breathe air

from morning 'till night
while cold winter winds do blow
shanty mans life
they wont back 'till spring
children all come out play
when they arrive at home
well water fell away
livins not hard it's just not easy
believin aint hard it's just not easy
sunrise

hate gone drippin lies from tongue
dont walk tall
what one eye sees

laneganjohnson
all tied up winding sheet
night when dogs from hell come out
please touch hand
nothing else matters

just prayers drownin ships at sea
how can all this rain keep fallin
fear paranoia run together dreams
as light as anything
winter time goin
mornin comes cold chills shakes
lady
can never no doubt
here am still spinnin round
run around catchin 'em baby
tell where did sleep last night
pines pines
have watch come back earth
or written stone
'cause mind an open door nothing inside
or go where jesus fled
she could have had anything she wanted
inner tubes piled top
she says right beside
anybody can see she loves
love's gamble every heart will take
because lovin paying off more than knew
oh now i've got ace hearts
almost doesnt count
one foot outside door
came real close
if you're looking more
almost doesnt count
but standing here just got thinkin
back when all had was love dreams
roll up our sleeves keep this love alive
anywhere but memphis
if telling sooner was just too hard
she could've told baton rouge or dallas
three girl it's plain see you're only one
one you're dream come true
came breathed new life
one you're dream come true
hey now look at hanging stars
back earth
thanked them all being kind

you're purest form heaven earth
what's not love about perfection
yes love what's not love
said he loved her they told her
no survivors found she heard him say
they say hello miss so wish were here
give little then take back
broken wing
she still sings
goin through motions life

but when sun goes down
or held so long
havent left clue
somehow woman knows
mansion hill

saw face when
no feelings have lasted
so dont thinking
he's nothing but ashes
oh yeah by way still love
sometimes what dont say

she was only ten when her daddy got fired
she smiles 'cause she knows end
then she sees her little girl
these tears are gone beyond blue
sometimes sit front porch swing
here ones love
have been blessed
when feel holding
have been blessed
was born give love
as sure as newborn babies cry
seems always end up driving by
feel so at ease
baby you're best i've ever met
her image all tear stained worn
each breath he draws makes him think
sound goodbye
chorus
dug solid ground
wearin same dress she wore yesterday
she flies place where she's loved
she flies place where she's loved
she flies place where she's loved
it's gonna alright it's gonna alright baby
when rain when rain comes crashin down
'cause there's no comfort here zip code
'cause there aint no telling what i'll find
cry shoulder road
yeah if really wanna give 'em something different
'cause they dont have clue
yeah if really wanna give 'em something different
cant cry hard enough
always thinking it's gonna hurt forever

'til figure out what plan
keeping distance
keeping distance
can see need
never let down guard

living life 9

living borrowed time
never dreamed turning back
strong enough carry weight
burning light did shine
kind feelin words cant explain
not aching should
losing feels good
'cause loving has hurt so bad
love land
amazing all progress we've made since days thomas edison
now we're watchin him blow three candles out
love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again

forget thought then never could
beside above
you're young one who running

tell myself live little freer love little better
what they dont know what they cant see

but now wind blew wrong
there one who'll lead home

tears will run they'll keep afloat
an angel standing guard
there are standing crowded room
you're watching over
there are
wondering where life gonna go
this all girls about forty two
who dream everything they have
who love without holding back
other's runnin scared
papa needs new job
but wolves just keep gatherin 'round door
get off mind

repeat chorus twice
so blue lonely
just call true blue fool
when you're standing' bridge that's always burnin
say goodbye
baby it's just time walk away
'cause i've been workin too tired anyway
but i've been sleepin warehouse west la
even if sun refused shine
but dreams couldnt love more
always took rocky road
wanna join our hearts
'cause love led heart back home again
hand mine
shameless color
she made her life mess
he's all nerves when he sees her
she'll wearing white
later can work out
say yes need
whether go whether stay
all looked so promising
day she quit baptist choir
when god fearin women get blues
call ladies aid
what they're gonna do
dont know who'll sang her part
when are old tired gray
will old too see
it's hard everything everyone
baby arms free
baby hold close never let go
there's not stone mark
feels mile wide ditch
cannot give name
there's not stone mark
do feel lonely
if were single free

keeping love alive these troubles times
well must've been hard must've been tough
baby what else could
from day met
knew was safe
happens lot men
poor heart would never mend
gonna stand right here

just trusting was great sin what can
love still won again
never push never pull
lift gently up
hope wind catches
from ashes
so dont try save now

as he struggled down driveway almost
i've wrestled wrong right

but there's cracks all walls all windows
i'll sew some yellow trim along seams
sure hope can live forever
here am begging try
there's chance could change mind
keep giving go living way things are
that's how feel when
every day there's something new
when you're followin all rules
cant guarantee dreams
but straight
but lie awake alone dream whole night through
but lie awake alone dream whole night through
so i've made up mind
they still make blue
time has opened door
it's wonderful now
this old heart has just run out time
when teardrops finally come
dont want feel
can hardly breathe
can hardly wait till our next kiss
sure as sky blue
sure as sky blue
baby love
but what would matter
there wont always someone there pull out
sweethearts walk by together
wonder if she's sorry
but wont close eyes
see black white
if was raindrop would fallin
but you're sinkin stone
repeat chorus
there aint no breeze big enough slow
i'll there ready waitin
hope believe
promised we'd never forget
if can count one thing i'll here

poor but proud
daughter's eyes
oh puts smile heart
though she'll grow someday leave
soundbite at news break
some are just too quick give away
pull blinds lock doors
these times which live
they said he was dangerous man
roll stone away let guilty pay it's independence day
let whole world know today day reckoning
few short days night together
two shadows blending
world's greatest lovers
dreams flying fit nearly
she comes
see now nearest dearest
inertia creeps
make no sound eidertown
she comes
say string along
bring love
go out every night as single
love sweet love
you're gonna lose love
see someone you'd just mingle
though may not drive great big cadillac
may not have car at all
can still stand tall
though you've found
better things will surely come our way
magic without love
love mother
love god
no sunshine life way deal shady

chorus
j marshall k vanderhoof
i've fallen down while playing ball
human life's gift from god
abuse from pit hell
do people feel humanity something past
neighborhood or dmz but people call home
amidst subtle war that's right outside door
more cover ups legal deceit there no one power who can destroy
any price they'll pay pay
forgotten man wanders misplaced world
everything you've worked everything you've done
doorways they dwell are shelter night
all alone again
as world awakens so hard values have been changed
as world awakens so hard values have been changed
as world awakens so hard values have been changed
form tonight kill tonight
what will do steam something nation
struck out now bodies just remnants
hear lamentations women who cry loved ones crush oblivion
i've always thought when grow up somehow get wise
what looks it's harmless rotten inside
split planet atomic bursts
withstand dark attack
will make back beyond black
bet fear loss
all forgotten heroes lost crippled dancers
conductor what's destination
if never quite belonged
it's hard enough live life why dont live own
i'll pay soon as get paid check mail
someday i'll get ahead things life will so grand
cant even afford pay attention
seen more than he wants see
things he's learned today
they need place get away
another shot another pill
just pay bill time
sickly decrepit ones
healer
took easy way out
flee from reality
delivering resignation
no one his savior from vises he made
got down knees
devil loose
gave us their fire but who was watching
gods wrath
inaudible hockey's fine by
god come down gods are before
they got their men promoted before it's time
you're at cemetary feeling all alone
bloody mary drink choice those who dabble
are just right type little bit closer dear
trapped pressure cooker
too many potions cabinet
dont pull this shit
too many potions cabinet
enemy you're looking laughing all while
know last words they spoke were who loves
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells

congregation rises starts chant hymn

d wayne k vanderhoof c wells m dodson

suddenly think you're so bold
would bide time

chorus
but looks night fate proved 'em wrong
put her heart hand
oh she's about as lonely as gonna let her get
while she's so sad while mr right did her wrong
she found out hard way about him
she walks by every head turns
but there's one kind trouble dont mind
could get jealous but aint no use
she yells at everybody just come along
when he gets home he'll find
but once she made up her mind
what once was sacred only yesterday
drifted into town one day
somewhere north heaven
still running free
wish could hold one last time
but i'd wake up still love
if had time i'd spend
whole life dreaming
only fool would wanna strong
oh another pretty woman just what dont need
chorus
find way lay this hurt rest
maybe find way back her again
was foggy mornin south san jose
still see her wavin through radiator steam
livin moment forgettin all rest
she used call texas called her norma jean
it's fact women one left
but there's nobody sitting by phone
it's shame but afraid one love
dont think deserve hear say goodbye
dont think deserve hear say goodbye
what she wants most are little things
whatever turns her
might as well playin matches
aint nothin left but few old bones
think about ya start speed
know they say if love somebody
climbin up hill
sometimes ask heart did really
wing prayer
it's belief pride chief cause decline
such waste two lives

yeah could have said million things
thought had her wrapped around finger
little sundown buzz 'n more way

somewhere down line

it's rushing touch dirty wings them highway angels wear
there's something waiting us down dirty road

meanwhile rick james takes her new
but she had lighter
let go
mexico
but she was sky
i've lost heart again
there's building fire
get car out driveway
where are mr fireman
we're comin stand back
then they flap their wings at last second
dont see their last second curves
unless see their ascent
then they flap their wings at last second
becomes important
mr mastodon farm
love
gonna paint her stop light green
dont own
i'll make love right now that's all want do
though just cant live without
dont know just how say all things feel
though just cant live without
'cause quittin just aint shit
baby you're never there
you're never there
love was just game
this roller coaster
ever ever there
no phone no phone just want alone today
waking when asleep
no phone no phone just want alone today
heads state who ride wrangle
learn buck up
shut f up
now clever feet flicker fire
dont wanna
can cut from their bloated budgets
who crunch nuts mouths squirrels
now simple feet flicker fire
when we're driving car
need here
when we're driving car
left out last night got scared 'cause thunder
left out last night got scared 'cause thunder
watch out dont fall
shot little rain
avocados omlette pans
brand names fake rocks rabbit feet
canaries corn secret morse decoders
make great gifts ones love
get away
get away
baby baby
hospitalize crazies
was hell time was hell time
it's undeniably lazy
trying make smile
you're driving recklessly
take all away
je serai blonde pour toi et trs jolie
il y aura beaucoup de soleil
il va donner une trs belle maison
la joie
their prowess potent secretly stearn
he's going speed
his mind he's still driving still making grade
she's all alone
who plays so loud
night after night who treats right
find yourself message some words call own take 'em home
got play
mad
they hate
more thing will bite scratch
some people make life little tougher than
wanna nasty bride
what was was really pure
can soak bread gravy
can soak bread wine
say always waiting
room where still sleep
wont
place where would kiss
bein beauty queen
wanna ride
wheels keep spinning round spinning round round
alright
spinning round
why say music stops are not love
when sleep
or just cutting through jello very sharp knife
when sleep where do fingers go
rivers are raging blood
hear whisper
there's only room
there's only room
same ones drowning
but when it's lock door
tear down bridge
then go home kiss wife
it's what choose do
they're pouring slowly steady
think
heard
friend four letter word
she's writing she's weaving
but now you've gotta write them all again
want confront
think she's an open book
need here
need here
need here
blood now critically proof neural cells fatally quenched
bleeding urine as inflamed bladder rips
black star burning bright

brittle tests eroded hot corrosive succus
rancid meat writhing life

disinterred detuned
usefulness isnt through

now redevelopment lies ruins
play hard child's play
chondrin puzzle so quaint
so mystifying
each cumulative piecing commensated meat
an incessant game methodically made
munch mouldy scabs lick septic gash
thorax infected furuncles boils
acholial fluids coagulating thickening

cross heart hope die
cross heart come let's cross line
misinformation distortion make belief
lies lies half truths misinformation
lies believe them all
palpitations spew foetus
ladling out aborted debris
stiffening dead babe's crib

finished fragments mass stinking waste
miserable festering stiff
evaporating reek putrefaction gets right up nose
rupturing gallbladder

disemboweling rage

brutally impaling rectum this process adore
grimly dig up turfs

virginie jolie
je cherche lombre pour danser avec toi mon amour
sur cette vie trop courte qui file entre nos doigts
je crains la nuit quand tu nes pas la
je prie qu'on ne remarque pas
rain lightenings black cats
wary myself so often
je crains les saints le mal et le bien
hearing voice

chacun ses habitudes
when dont feel doing anything
je de de de danse dans ma tete
every day same words
je de de de danse dans ma tete
from everywhere they stallite us
j'prefere regarder la lune
les sirenes de police
je de de de danse dans ma tete
que nous lattendions passionnement
le bien le mal et meme le bonheur
et que la vie lappelle que le monde lattend
je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
je ne suis pas celle que les lumires clairent
je ne suis pas celle que tu vois
un peu d'amour sur la terre oisive
douceur d'un ciel d'amrique
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
promises wind

cette drle de chanson
grave bien mieux que par une lame
heavy sadness our hearts
lourde la peine en nos coeurs

through wonderland looking glasses
as river runs through fields

je prie la terre de toute ma voix
je prie les roses je pris les bois
et j'suis sincre j'prie pour tout
et tout ce que je crois

soleil fragile
dans mon coeur quelquechose bouge

ou comme un phare banal oublie
qui pardonne celui qu'on choisit
le vent la mer et les orages
rencontrer la chose magique
et je vois briller le monde
today more than ever
some shadows afraid
et ma vie change avec toi
au got des plus mauvais jours
see shinning world
beach all clouds
against waves against tears
aujourd'hui plus que jamais
life changes
but come save
from worst days
et je vois briller le monde
today more than ever
believe heart does go
near far wherever are
heart will go

once more open door
endless confessionthe rise fall
somehow forgot how ease pain
would do same
did know would play part
safe as will ever so hush dear sleep
soul yours steal
'cause trembling shaking
take wherever want baby
heart's almost breaking
while spoke many things
tu es comme tu es ca plait
ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
ecoute c'est important
ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
air breathe
just want all
want face see when close eyes
would teach all things i've never learned
but know can never cry tears
there isnt very much can do
didnt change world
if care about her
take this heart
but she'd rather go than fade away
i'd hold affection
bought flowers sold line
there's no point this affection
talk circles when need straight line
make believe
there's no love
hold inside
foolish pride
if only could see now
freedom walked away gain
see above
know love will bring back
ev'ry second live that's promise make
ev'ry beat heart ev'ry day without end
will hold all night never let go
turning over mind
there's no way out this
dont think want stay
dont think want stay
only know
heyever felt this before
when we're lying where fell
when hear no violins
ooooh baby
understand some things are better left unsaid
but faced past now realize
used believed love
just might give heart
said needed needed free
silent stars
but nights alone can
heart would come undone
when warned not throw love away
if only could see now
if could feel now
get wings fly
filled love
feel alive
when call
all worries die
loving every moment
hear whisper
lovin everything do
no rivers too wide make across
when all hope gone here
all days will bright as sun
am angel
i'll shoulder when cry
i'll hear voices when call
les ocans et ses naufrages
comme des toiles sur ta peau
j'ai vu lazur et les glaciers
j'ai vu des hommes tomber
comme des toiles sur ma peau
spark makes power grow
make journey through eternity
every ounce must see though
all love
dont give same old look
his touch
how hurts need someone much
there's leaf tree
unlocks desitiny
there's sky vast blue
maybe meet middle every night everyday

we'd trim treetops knockin boot off
little bit snow would fall
well maybe whoville not ville
oh you're hard one
oh aint gettin no younger
why dont come senses
but it's right behind her eyes no matter what she buys
can hear carols sing
when you're feeling inside out insecure
miles an hourit's orbiting at 19 miles second so it's reckoned
we're 30000 light years from galactic central point
pray there's intelligent life somewhere up space
when rivers all run dry she finds water
never was man ever felt this way
getting one leg up when it's said done
one mans ceiling another mans floor
most things dont have clue
know wanna hold know love
exit

burnin up back streets tearin up town
killer curves are gonna drive far

if she gave worked this one out
she wants kind love she cant live without
horse without rider
know i've been through all
i've been loving blind
but it's not really
but i've been numb since our last goodbye
knew things had gone awry
showin nothin but taillights
'til find pick up truck
stuck here thumb out wind

braggin how used
how world ever got used
one emotion wrapped around
it's just as real as wild horses
seems it's never goin down

you'd have some sympathy
now head over heels lost found
i'd walk right back
most them make sense
hear old cliche
has so quickly come gone
it's holding tight lettin go
way work together what sets our love apart
help make each other all can
love isnt just those words said
aint funny how melody can bring back memory
can make right from wrong can make fall love
but it's not

there are no walls cant climb
but here heart

little conversation
know never could say anything
story incomplete
let others speak
all times couldnt tell her how miss her
blanket shoulder
when breathing wind
sing lullabye lullabye
miles have gone away
can see million years
look up at sky
thinking underneath mexican moonlight
so can watch all evil room
waiting time fall behind
wine dine do line
it's matter time until they find
wherever go
cant get away from face mirror
everything did
deathly cold
sip tequila give some time
by world filled
moon full stars are bright
thought heard car
wonder where are
things tried say
but you're always polite
hands are shaking lips are cracked
run run run
eyes are jaded complicated
wont give her up
never knew price would go up as such
they finally called away
she said hold hold out
wonder why
keep keep keep
glitter her eyes
he doesnt give fuck he's living under truck
show ray
show ray
as love looking down them
love killer thought
paws claws try not fall
love teacher who lives dark
they say goodbye tomorrow wendy's
any second coming
i'll get pick up truck i'll drive away
am who am it's all can do
cause if cant walk proud i'd rather walk away
when smile dont know what do
when smile dont know what do
all while behind dancing eyes boy crying
cant keep promises just keep naming names
it's just dope
cause was born liar albatross
from god above
i've been told things get better
life hazy hazy hazy
i've been told things get better
when process comes undone
heal these wounds
when kill mother there no other
struggle side mind waste time purest thoughts evaporate
break sun one chosen one time up time due
dont they wish they were blessed
will broken
you'll good citizen
just move move ahead
were lying yourself 'cos were afraid what you'd find
can say vengeance you'll back from grave
land 1000 nos
fucking mess
he said happens every time
wont live up image
have fun
beast you've been fighting
potential vaporization
mind haunting haunting life
reckon forsaken dead
heard too much know too much dont know if can take
constant pain endless rain becomes too much bear
you're dead
dance dead
dark thoughts there are no words
hum increases brain
sad domination by those who say more than you'll ever know
pick own deliverance
amputate shown
there's man who watches over
you're drowning daydream
listen battle cries race knows it's dying
but dont erase pain
all they hear are echoes well
dress codes rules age limits
i'd rather have hole eyes
2 might make crawl
how did come become
someone hide behind
look future
i've gone out
only alive do what's
hey fool havent heard heavens not over flowing
know rules only apply witness stand
no more
their minds they've found
powerfully screaming what life's meaning
technological march death
stealing filth from those forgotten
what if was high an aeroplane would look at same
would queen this desperate land do think give damn
rabid pack sirens howling
at loss words
tired going through
our eyes
death without loss
mad world we're living mad world
until they sound truth
no care no less
no care no less
no care no less
minds are controlled
except few who got rich off
whole goddamn world riding words thousands years
got there
crippled will tomorrows pill
man they cave
mygrain
always wanted make difference
so go ahead call dumb
painted smiling face
hear
poisoned planet nuclear war
left rule
where are putting energy
as pressure turns rage
god's word enforced controlled
rabid dogs rabid dogs
lonely boy says come what may
kills dream so sing this simple song
sleeping wing
toobad good ones always have take blame
sweatin line doin 40 wasting time
mister clean
chances shine seven days our fears become entwined
beginning this world selled mankind
put us their hell set our souls fire
technocracy probable cause
technocracy bending laws
growth this planet but
tell what gained
by staying aboard this runaway wreck
while you're losing curve
nihilist turns scrape into gash
so snake keeps recruiting one more royal shooting
but snake just pawn remains when are gone
vote
talking about revolution
chorus
crosshairs lined up dead sight
cant even think
but never condemn man
time names will change
voice screaming clear
when bays opened nothing was said
guaranteed
listen few fueled by fire
guess bought gun
then they take their knees again
1494 he did girl next door

someone take us back home
people dying from lonely days

read an open book
all innocence wasted
but just not coming through
were sleeping next
take some time before go

thin lines light these days were lit by light
maybe just want breathe
morning rain
how garden grows
see things they'll never see
cant remember last thing said as were leavin
it's one more night hollywood
it's one more day up canyon
separate love from addiction its not same know
wasted time this picture see nothing one
put bad self get out party dress fix up makeup try
morning sun when it's eyes really shows age
all did was wreck bed
oh maggie wished i'd never seen face
water beading up her chest
were infants pushing slowly through
haunting only myself
render blind ones who see
it's got far too many doors block wind
absence place

everyone stares at ground
dont add up anything at all
his intentions are clear he wanna well liked
einsteins down beach staring into sand
who'll never together again
who'll never together again
an eggman off wall
all his wings are slowly sinking
one more sun comes sliding down sky
one more sun comes sliding down sky
worst things come from inside here
what fear night day comes call anyway
there's house burning down radio but
all smiling hands delivering all
lonely lonely lonely
every night floating over love
it's plain
say dont care
all over
can relieve
are only lies
her pride
make mark upon wall
all want something fine
got four more reasons why
damn these nights are dreaming
got four good reasons why cant go back there again
mary comes goes
much much too concerned about mary jane
mary jane pulls her hair back wonders what she'll do all her free time
sorry she said
she doesnt exist any more
wouldnt if she wasnt her
she cant keep away from them
pretty soon they've got her heading door
she dont want anybody see
oh so saddle up go
she said it's raining' head
six different ways go deep inside
not one same
she's watched all tidal waves away from disaster
bind mother

taking some time thinking about leaving soon got some things cant tell
staring out his window as world rushes by
out there shadow modern machine
have dreamed black car shimmers drives
girl who could make all clean
replies dream ballerinas dont know why but see cadillac's sailing
drives down length evening carnival side house where

no body can ever hear him call
sweet home alabama lord coming home

but guns they wait stuck by at side god
years ago heart was set live oh
inside time moves she dont fade
inside time moves she dont fade away
ghost she dont fade
make an exception am not worried
but sure there's something shade grey
she cant stop shaking
but it's not all easy so maybe should
it's keeping awake anna begins toss turn

no one say when we're done
rode ladder climbed across nation
took cannonball down ocean
make movie from things they find crawling round brain wish was
elizabeth know doing alright these days one these dreams
well night time let her through
without single place go interest

what brings down now love
been hangin around this town corner
been hangin around this town corner
after love has faded
dont get up 'till afternoon
gotta get out but stuck so tight weighed by chains keep
when weather bothers
she wears silly yellow hat
when wake morning covers light
all regrets cant forget
you're remembering again
sometimes

here comes feeling again
gotta find place without so many

this island life never ends
comet common uncommon honestly

baby lets use up
how got these lonesome johnny blues
price pay remain alive
he wound up taking much more than own
earth was without form void darkness was upon face deep
millions regardless
their tears taste wine
tempering weapons criminal lust
tiny red miracles falling likerain
devour sun
jewel more radiant than moon
she lulled away from rich masquerade
sea misted lawn where stone figures forlorn
danced blind acolyte
now know what thou art
but poised nectar within stirs
secrets dead wouldst thou inflict
need fires have lured abominations here
blind reason against thee enchantress
enrobed death's shadow swifter
our fantasies spent
damned
remember night as if were engraved
come friend fate let's raise
damned
shadow miss anne thropy
heart torn apart left rifled grave
death was swift swallow hells life
she stole soul hate had sold away
eternity
all heil love fails all hope lies eclipse
but then all soon
limbs ignite
under quicksilver clouds
argentinum spurred
instead harking prophecies
come skyclad arms
buck under flames
love night
dressed sepulchre
amor e morte
bent silhouette sharpen dull razors
from heavens farthest shore
thrown east before midnight masses
this grave mistake
never fucking more
ran blood through scarred ravines
bruise upon heart lingers
221
coming days
through rich whores corridors
as he wrote smote
stars overall
catch sight seams
knew not her name
her spinal chill rakes earth
as bane tyranny her dobermans sleep
beauty always cruel
wench her tower tombed
as eclipse
men entranced divined from her gait
suspicions abroad
chandeliers tiara
but caprice honours leashed
winds lashed their limbs together
were flung wayward god
pounding upon pauper ridge
elizabeth's grace could raise
littered aphrodisiacs
her embers tempered roared
each tendon muscle rippling
she drives fucking wild want her her knees
she let her wet tongue roll gasp cant control
burning penal fires roused strain
horror stalked bilious fogs
moved mirrors cracked heavy lines
splashed occult tongues
died at last
he took things
skies litten five pointed stars
circus lurches ring promised delight
war torn forlorn malarial
she was light world going down
should she awake through embrace or mistake
dani filth scripture howls
additional guitar by martin foul
performed by budapest film orchestra budapest film choir conducted by lazslo zadori
livebait booking agent
but now cease play
heading bedding
now tidal are turning
polished scythes reap worldwide
now tidal are turning
drove ghosts forbears
this mouth mine
must protect her
across shifting abyss
potions made
she spasms orgasmic flare
pity
horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
forever sworn keep
their unforgotten violence remember those who died
burning funeral pyre
burning funeral pyre
who stand accused have refused church's clemency
fill bleeding christ arms
shifting parent flesh
are blind see rotting wood trees
hear growing chora new dawn shall bring
should have cut our looses as at calvary
heiling new flesh
smell their cumming
nightmares crawl
prowls cloud dead eyed
fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
this end everything
all sinners lose their lot judgement day
our knees or another fker's shore
now they're clawing back
when empires fall
whilst bitter winter moon
as through plundered groves carnal garden
this world long paradise lost
those damned flames repay
peace fragile lover left us fantasising war
next eve
shall see gehennah paved
thick forest dusk has filled
whipped welted neath barbed windsong
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed
her zenith come
her lustre eviscerates
commit this world thy ancient
grant thy dark command
toll o'er sobbing throng
shrug off shroud preternatural sleep
masterbating their graves
yet far fiercer still
usher spite seething draconist
seduce silky timbred limbs
bewinged infested belfries
this wintry eve when snow glistens deep
necromantic tongue
celestial knifes ebonied
love sank wounded when betrayed
candelabra snuffed prey silhouette wedded
love vein
crowned conquering darkness
claim her their very own
whilsts cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
path towards castle weary innocence takes
laid rest now am blessed
hilt dripping fangs range
foul snake despair
just palace dreams
once crucified
gabrielle
long lost gabrielle
gilded cunt
black grey panzers
dirty little gold digger
halo paid by consummated ring ice
stars are fixed
dirty little soul frigger
motherfuckers
but words escape when try speak
mark words believe soul lives
hallowed thy name
serrated mountains mad shadows
victory spent
fulfilling destiny promised fever
secret amour her archangelic rape
lords star veiled red sepulchres
now freed plunder
our legions killing all sight
hell awaits
satan sees answer lies not far
warriors from hells domain
their souls are damned rot hell
before coronation vocal aspirations
desire fire
screamed supreme again
aeons reversed two
first degree murder ravens
abyss edge
down dark steps history
limpid rags resurrection
whose kiss glittered sleep
thief come after dark
night awaits baited thighs
cream mortal kind
their crystal skirts
i'll make pray
bleeds their borders
even man who pure heart
black side glass
sharp eyed impassive whore
thistled ruin garbed around thy heart
impaler lord
foam flecked nightmares drag moon
unto us wait patience
nakedness their ochre flesh
trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
raven feathered dress
satanic tyranny
yet all tongues are not true
mathistrises dont give damn
kindred spirit graveyard
gothic towers tottered her heels
take reins pleasure
vengefull call grace
iplintered her coffin lay floor
concern save aeons left
her corset laced arsenic
heaven where thou didst reign deeps
lips distend ending time falter
strung where crippled vultures dare
cracks grin so wide hides stars
sowers discord growing wars reap
sunset expect
lightening freezes seven
once forests spired
come drumming thunder
disintered writhe lone survivor
martin suicide notesbroken heart strings
thanks perversebeauty6aolcom filth7986hotmailcom correcting track 9 lyrics
ran morning fauna his mastiffs gazelle
she deftly spun
serpent tongue
simple dish born silver spoon
palled mysteries
mankind basked vast eclipse
originally performed by anathemaand often sigh
broken sleep
call within holy house dwell
carnal desire runs through veins
break their crust
strive ever more joyous death
spare from wolves
has never burnt so sickly sweet
soft white throat
bestial past
start gnaw fingers
her spilled over
save soul hell kept
these words scrawled severed hand
life have her
day laughter died
much as have tried
midst mist sleepy hollows fever
now drowning resounding
life have her
forever flung celestial dreams
grinning winds hate unfurled
they pray full moon rising
war
stain milky sunset red
his dark eye
grave clarissa
devils pride
smoke has choked these vistas
lipped blood last goodbyes
but her face soon dispels
naked she sways
as our ghosts fog
all desire
it's just high cost loving
every second counts cant break away
step by step
can take or leave
temptation
temptation
thou art pale hecate
nothing will keep us apart
leave them lifeless broken
come black goddess arise
hidden lusts will break gates swarm
this state bliss
mad caliban manner
they call bad
mouldered where older
theres nothing mouthful venetian tar
passing fad
grave
wont have peace mind
hangman today
saw silver lining hidden mushroom cloud
white assassin painted black
this garden gethsemane
sip blood red wine
as restriction bled from veins neck
as wild hunt careers through boughs
stand enthralled
she comes again
torn bloody weeping skies
her exists beyond all knowledge
yield swords sever stain
spat snarling into form
him whose place was set
him spur hymns heaven sent
lustrous scourge fallen spirits
these waters held secrets
espied gasping breath under dark sheeted moons
truth her deleted scenes
equal measures sewn
sense beauty waits there
than breeze next this night
but now fear will never peer
bent knees harrowing
drink pouring fury
unhilt black grimoire death
as another soul passed grasping styx
limbs purring from kill
from lilt choirs choking
peopled air prowess absinthe
countess fell
growls mating houls inclined
if blood what thou carves foul fiend
countess promise
ravenous wolves elements led
none more cold repose
possessed such delights
though inwards she abhored
tombed her soul such stone
pouncing haunt
faustian verse
stigmata still wept between her legs
past howl buggered nymphs
flame unto deathshead
biblical prattled their mantras
through maw woods black carriage was drawn
round hearts glance would betroth
erotica
but stare their lord
when she knelt down atone
forgiveness would come
no horrors were worse
she sought soceress
forest's vulva
secrets brooded as she rode
but elizabeth laughed thirteen autumns had passed
forever throne
her dark secret eden
her cunt she feeds fulfill her desire
reveal mysteries witch
seeking cause subjugate
suffer not infidel suffer not infidel
zealous maniacal
unfettered few who choose roam
unbridled at dusk
turn screw
her cut diamond rings
enclaves were upgraded goshen
fertile female mind control
yield sweet embrace
let all acknowledge are here
work crafts surpassing sin
seven days seven festival nights
she was found
war torn forlorn malarial
she would take jesus
v empire
ebony dressed sunset
as shall see
pondlife as pearl
they crept through woods mesmerized
dawn discovered her there
come back
broke under christ seeking guilty signs
porcelain yin
mesmerized
her ghost fog
though incisions once made her so vivid
break make fluttered heart amiss
once dancing spotlit waltz
those frozen moments won
midst writhe parapets
thank god suffering
swathed haze
where virtue bathed their ravings made
smothering another lover
though fated now than later
night 'twixt vice virtue
midst drowning crowds howled rage
though spit all things divine
return their fallen leader
weaves inside should
just white flag blackened by
am thorn
stays sleeping beauty
am spear longinus
lightning strikes their blinded mains
wooed by dresden serenades
greed deepest dark deception
her surgeon full general curses
libertina grimm
they haunt her heart those precious few
so alone
lump throat come choke
live slow serrated rape
dub lord abortion living dead
perverts gasp inside mask
who lets prey gilles de rais
appetite whetted storm crows wheeled
know sick as dahmer did but this what do
lest curses spat from primal lairs
into scented scheme night
thoughts possess
erupt from grave aflame
woman scorned by life
verona marishka aleera
all eternity
life's brittle glass
before veil could part our embrace
soul dead achieve
how they plead skies
so came night
but dreaming thee regain
from temptations peak will see
lives hide scriptured lies
than death could alone
awaiting sun set crimsoning seas
dripping sweat
how was first met
as they have forever more
mannequin
god alone would know
tongued nuns at louviers
samhain mist
wreathed dreams
sprits rising discredit rebirth
through forest our hearts
under pagan veneer snakes fear
tread salt dead exult
no mercy or brakes applied
sleek polished black
millennial whore
smothering congregation
instrumental stripping gods
hear foregone cries last surviving
comets tear skies
thereafter
spilling wine her fornication
death slathers near her heel
her laughter
mr crowley what went wrong head
conceived eye secret
want know what meant
tragedy blooms from one act
am nemesis
no longer am paralysed
nemesis
poured arms
whose flag unfurled
black heart
black heart
just
it's just adam says
voices pass time
feeling
no no no no time cry
everything will alright
chorus
dead would sing
have delivered gifts from grave
wolves among sheep
as phantoms have fled basilisk day
deceivers dragged before their cross
rather dead forever than lose her
cold was soul
would ever soon
nymphetamine
wracked charm
as did those golden days
from bind holiness
her alone full submission
nymphetamine girl
untold was pain
come above unto
sick weak from condition
am circled prey
as did those golden days
from binds holiness
her alone full submission
nymphetamine girl
she was all three wishes
two tracks
she haunted at corners mind
hope grave
never enchained
right slot sacred key
nymphetamine
more white lady laid
bared tomb
discolours all tunnel vision
none better
every rome inside
screaming keys faith fear
from pleasure or pain
every dirty word
baring lunar curvature
her roseate sliver
sculptured nymph seeking base relief
slaughtered lamb throw
thick unguent rum
succour
whiplashed from gates
satan seated there
half naked insane
at throat human race
spat from massive throng
afaisnt flora nightfall
unveil greed our needs are bitter spent
mona lisas where paint has run
draw blinds floors raw meat
will she show rewrites dark delight
over teeth have tasted shame
dreams unroll
ghosts pearly gate remissions
time past
but now winds are strong
were quaffing morning glories
time has come
300
her spirit freed eclipsed moon
thrown upon damp cellar walls
narcissistic unrest frozen mirror's face
once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
where erotic stains had cleaved
met torments giving vent her swoon
by father lies
virgins forced naked
douse their luminosity
only when they're running
within this kissed disembowel arena
shatter glass house
as they have countless lustrum
red
winter ice terminal frost
fall man now at hand
future coming
rip back out
death comes ripping
skinless dark shall scream
an emanation phantom madness
how weep pure
her clock hacked out cunts
as pregnant skies outside bore thunder
she carved her seal
she's just devil woman
can see tall dark stranger
she's just devil woman
showing future past
she's gonna get
our father who art heaven hallowed thy name
judas stride
conquests deep methodical screwing
this winter chill grist his mill
killing al resolve
have locked hasten blood
pits self rebirth
hell those dwelt
from palace orchard espied
listened heavy heart
were all but reared
since crimes divine left behind
michael was weaponed
far worse had worked
adoration moon thee
appease beast spattered sheets
surrendered splendour her sharpened caress
snow white balletic grace
bequeath thy fiery kiss
thy seduction haunts castle erotic despair

bleak midwinter stable place sufficed
what can give him poor as am
yearn comfort
yearn comfort
will walk into fire 'til its heat doesnt burn
reunited
walk without sound across barren landscape
feel only what want
it's very strange world leaves
into old familiar shoes
but come around time
but deep senses know
led from home
only hope
sweet surrender
cold room
so continued both day night
o'er bethlehem took its rest
born king israel
cannot tell you're so strong
through years i've grown love
path overgrown strewn thorns
both shall row love
neither have wings fly
but send thieves
have hold
if agree well it's just appease
if agree well it's just appease
born world oh gets so high
born one love gets so high
cause train wreck
somewhere deep inside
can show places where our time has had no ware
someday we'll free
he said can take there
'cause wouldnt lie
wake getting wider eyes are drawn astray
under blackened sky
new born hope unjaded by their years
have hold precious little thing
new born hope unjaded by their years
allah kiss once more
allah kiss once more
cannot believe what see

life's never what seems
spinning 'round circles dreaming
twist turn avoid
words deceive more more
so take all this noise into brain
i'll say thousand words or more
believe loved when completely by myself alone
believe only ones who disagree are millionaires
believe cant appreciate real love until you've been burned

when feel all alone
can mend broken heart
let one call
you're fire inside man
fever burns heart
fever burns heart
just return heart 'cause know i'll find
you're fire inside man
feelings aggression are absence love drug
cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
but heartache misery
if cant find way out these problems
more than angry words hate this silence
but lately i've been down upon knees
now dont live exist

so begins this beautiful journey
seven day saint or seven day sinner
what was once weight shoulders
seven day saint or seven day sinner
what was missin
think they call intuition
who walks talks know who
need girlfriend hold
first they gotta squeeze us
it's just cheap thrill when
look into heart one solution
just one life given willingly
remember
heart's fire but wont burn
chorus repeats twice
so honor him pa rum pa pum pum
lay before king pa rum pa pum pum
beside still water
can feel hand gently lead home
chorus
her heart cant help but break
know exactly how lucky am
thank god
devil trouble get into
chorus
but sure do remember them well
if ever get chance
here middle middle west
i'll never go down easy
feel tears wellin up cold deep inside
here comes pride backstreatch
how lived fear waking up each morning
tears are holdin back
looked out at school bus his little man said
down our long dusty driveway
his mind was wandering
was lightning water
could've walked away
she thinks if only he could see her now
where hearts dont touch ends dont meet
girls from work are going out tonight
expectation was none too great
they dance they dance
cowboys cowgirls just show
there's trouble line
wont have choice
lordy i've been denied
dancin new shoe
cause aint love 'til twist comes shout
when run from love
when run from love
some things just come when it's christmas time
no bedtime stories just questions instead
it's right where are
chorus
where was when stopped lovin
when did become history
everything have or can do
duet dana mcvicker
we'll leave trail smokin when drive away
above thy deep dreamless sleep thousand stars go by
oh little town bethlehem
hold head up high
hollywood if new york could
got 747 coming down night there's 747 goin into night
strangers night lost separate flights
cant see thing here night strangers night

how make feel
then one night took ride
she'll make heart break

escuchando vientos nuevos

find our love place where can hide away

it's written down inside heart
it's all written down lifelines
till day die
makes sad all time
let's try again
give all need
i'll throw pages floor
beautiful as first day met
cause when know love gone
cause cant exist
when there no love
lose mind

but tongue tied
do ever let emotions

driving out town just follow heart
rocking night after night day after day
lyrics klaus meine
ooh better find way around

ooh lord need break
look at sun inside
how can waste time

what can do so life
but instead poor son bitch

many crazy nights

sometimes they make hard choose
before have go
taught everything know
keeping forever young
through wind rain
best yet come
soldiers never die
you've always been one
take hand best yet come
play wicked games
they say devil doesnt rest
cross bearing
made kneel
i'll nail cross
you're just touch away
dont let fall you've gotta
future never dies
future never dies
make see light
from moment hit ground
strong survive
it's time play
another breath begins
pumping blood head
life will alright
bring boys back home again
good die young
stay out trouble son
alice said have forgotten what will
until twilight fades
get away
said better stay
'fore lose mind
try put back together
watch shadows fall across floor
through cruel hallways
lights barriers
feel slipping every day
where do stand when it's all over
guess dont care about nowwhere do stand when it's all over
truth less little town
unconquered unreal
fill head everything find
count miles before they pass by
can go back moments held before
there's things wont believe
should stay or should hide
changing memories they fade away
empty promises lonesome town
heard wings you're going die
i'd never seen face here
when walked into room
one touch leaves mark upon hand
dont hide ashes
'cause know what's coming then
see coming way run
let us know
until destinies dissolve
certain keys were held until they must have let go
know they're just repeating
now cant come back
but know they're just repeating
walk cold rain
some experience we'll go
days within glass cube
anything here see wrong reality
i've seen what you've never seen
i've left what you'd never leave
but now can repeat 2x's
watching many moons go by around head
direction sun
eyes have turned atone
torn an old dollar bill
trying make better
been gone while
trying make better
control just seems twist around
til both become ceiling
dont look down
lord hear pray
all these dying days repeat waiting sunshine x2
timeless echoes green
catch baby dinosaurs see how well they ride
orange circles southern sunrise
there'll screams cant imagine
all sights sounds
stand at window dim light fading
know never going go back home againwell alright now
waves meet ship
i've led an angel edge night
wanna give something can choose
when put head into flower web
we're not alone when it's two us
when put head into flower web
loud voices fill sky
different way bring down
dont turn away havent yet awakened
if there isnt time then should let go
why dont stay remember what said
baby tell what have done wrong
no one knows just where go
there's change this too will pass
lies still unspoken
listening wind turning sweet sour
take new day
little orange airplane
she turns her head never tells who
other different days different planets yeah
leaving all these things behind
suddenly never ends
tried but couldnt make
come down
residing land that's either
heavy as smoke still lingers
waiting come along
say should change before it's too late
should know i've got nothing say
without reason without reason
hour drawing ever closer
find reason carry
before dust will trip up again
when appeared just happened
it's coming over again yeah
wasted sad devotion
she knows she knowsdont hesitate it's fate
she knows time this
now dont remember why ever stayed
smoke rings drift over
gone so long feeling so let down
waves have washed home their disease
alone see myself stare
face looks mirror
well all nights last thousand years
just standing edge wall
storm was she dead
there's ghost head
some things never change
get burned away
dreamed were there
carcasses million dead sheep
now counting chances gone 1 2 3
hovers slow till finally know
pushin so very nearnow walls are closing right
what are gonna do now
wont one
it's another tear
what could've been
all that's gone before
but street light you're only witness
where fall could calling
we're baptized still getting blinded darkness
then cry please dont
do feel
not at all said i'd never go
come
his first contact his only sight
pathway
alone unreliable
secret kind
sign wall dont understand
everything inside burning
close eyes dawn
just as far as know it's alright
watch them burn
lonely way
she wont tell why
patterns locked all these drawers
find didnt know
was traveling too far away
ah ah ah
but only would remember when
if decide which one want
ah ah ah
these prisons cant abide
cant unbind
it's just another question faith
will turn head away
will turn head away
booked got hurry
till it's laid waste
take away no one knows
been waiting such long time
never know where twain shall meet
so very long doesnt matter where this has gone
which one stays
pale skin cant turn any whiter
over again could find way
precious vice
now raindrops fall away souls
it's kind hard now see all
gaze eyes will feel so cold
find time fear past
that's what said
hung line
shine

beautiful one sleep sun

shaking mind an etch sketch erasin

some days takes all energy just forget about
destroyed recreated
love
can make cry
dont know
look around myself at shining toys
so i'd love believe
all alone one true love
happily ever after
peacefully ever after
so searched greed sunshine all see there
afraid never gonna find way back where i've been
but fear has caught words inside
rising rising
from bottom lake
still wanna stay
stainless steel balloons
remove this whirling sadness
grieving barely believing now now
if run can free worried mind
but wouldnt want leave behind
she's got picture her mind
she can see right through all little games
every mistake ever made
waiting waiting girl call
where nobody ever goes
i've been living cassette
got tape changed mind
say promise long keep
did ever look so nice
wanted home again
want stay forever her light
darkness blows mind
i'll satellite satellite
somebody
give yourself
now eyes are open wide
body mind
gonna surprise them all
gonna surprise them all
cuz something life was run away
ah ah ah
maybe hang her phone number too
gave what wanted then went away
what gave as gift gift
cant see weary
cant see blurry
cant see blurry
counting down from ten it's time
when man at stop light catches
getting anywhere
we're speaking tongues
we're wasting our time
down wishing well
not even angels saw
who who have become
now damage done
all toil all exhaustion
shattered dreams all down
just bitterness remains
stern cold man what am hard relentless
i'll last close last close eyes
equipped hundred swordmen
awaiting winter frost
thousand men crossbows
sign dark cold
behind seven seas
confusion will rule till die
wander between these worlds
nofaded dream
sandman stab back
bleed arms wounds within
fall from grace as offer sin
no looking back life once had
life kicks us teeth
yet go onwe go
yet something makes us crawl back more
yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
hear these words say
each funeral just makes us realize
this momentary trail
now can no longer see shine
could seem doing fine
has only led back hell
flame thou wisdom greatest
set world fire
piss upon graves where thy enemies are laid
raise gun take aim blow away
put bullet through head
love death
will wait
may death again us unite
this snow may reminds
white as ghostly veil ground
now night descends
nothing more lived
grave sweet grave welcoming home
can see torment damage has done
fears preserved
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
as long as remember life has been hard
feel home when air's too thick breathe
only bastards havent met
dark death
because here must dwell eternally
hunt or hunted
keep grave open longing die
freezing our feelings ice
burning light between us already starting fade
drowning us sea flames
killing all have
now everything
it's time tonight's night
from this trip taking now
am shape game but life no more
he'll make through all
loving death
his remains upon hearse ahead
lower flags
weight world off chest
rain drums lifeless ground
strongest link our chain
lead flying all signs are there
strongest link our chain
sky darker than yours star brighter than yours
am before all gods
was written stars am wrathchild
gave gave gave all had
now it's all over am done
music tenkula sentenced words jarwa
nepenthe
drown all sorrow
reach skies distant sun
will make fast
it's only way
leave no room happy endings
far too long truth's been inverted by false tongues
as world goes down drain
far too long they had wait him arrive
as world goes down drain
guess hate grew much stronger than love her ever did
last rays setting sun loveless pulse fades away
love laved stillness grave heart
dark silent cold
again reach out dark despair
now there's only ruthless wind
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
so thought you'd just put head
without hope without fear
at dawn
into icy abyss colours
northern lights
obsession obsession obsession
inside burning mind obsession
at shattered remains world
hope life leaves dead
dont scared take death open arms
everything
but seems you're not receiving
one more day
makes him wish gone
life's been too dire so fullest desire has died
moment departure follows time
leads fiend out our minds
arising evil all see
hells gates were open
can give warmth life
i'll cast mine all over thee
make glow go away
candles have been blown out by wind
she gave everything had craved
day zero mother was expecting worst
just let corpse decay unburied
do not deserve luxury
now every single cloud becomes raging storm
no longer feeling pain
rain comes falling down
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
what can do now except continue
only know at some point
music tenkula sentenced words serial self killer
suicider dying every night day
it's last one will get
you'll fire musket but i'll run through
screams pain as comrades fallwe hurdle bodies lay ground
as lay forgotten alone
mullan rakoseen vaivun
this tension this pressure
disillusion
dove peace falls torn apart
if could take look into this fighter's mind
turn away
end we're but two strangers
first came wind dark clouds storm
spread over our homes
beaten numb didnt see sneaking round corner how could
right track bastards
rise from ashes from these ruins mine from rage
vengeance mine
warrior life know reaper by name
shadows are growing long
beams light are
prior deceased
hey little sister who's superman
let go so longit's nice day start again come
come
margin emptiness
eager see
life has given much maybe taken more
will leave bitterness joy
will leave bitterness joy
are one
are one
put all forms life an end
hovering air rain
'hovering air'
ceasing bleeding heart now
coming closer end every breath
she takes away sight her shine
music tenkula ranta sentenced lyrics tenkula
so quickly everything swirled descent world
frail as are
from bleeding prison
turned hellliving emptiness
verse iii
dont need care if want
dont need reason brake
keep dreamming

just waiting final release

it's all over said done havent heard
music lopakka tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
shadowed shine our sun
burned alive flames love
yet one precious treasure lost forever more
well kill god mothafuckin horse
holding silver sword upon his mighty head swearing revenge
says son time all luck
from sea discontent he says
felt
felt
she stands at edge
dont make say
words dont believe
am
from underneath
distance between
all stones are thrown are building up wall
too black or too white
regardless balance
no yeah no no no
hey devil boy
we're gonna blow you're house
hey devil boy
if would come back if would come back
because he's laid one out mei think if everybody streamed
need string good intentions
she says there's motivation
need have little conversation
you've got wonder moving best can do
translucent delicate
think loneliness code
it's not clothes she borrows
because feel him sometimes
subtle constant shiver from bottom top
busy talking himself livingdying just same
can wall around under any covering i'll find
she dont break she dont sink dont think dont think thing
what told
headstrong
tell new apron strings
bye bye bye bye bye baby good byetell mother's new shoes
recognize because
what's daddy say
today we're giving away
get brand new chance
i've made most love
could wrong
could strong
could wrong
if was then was
back up what do
she thinks him
maybe it's prison
deals herself
maybe killing went down town
she's got backup
marry she said dont reply
daddy said better or you'll die
away from mobility
beat sun from her glory
cuts what she cant untie
what's she trying do
spins
she didnt want play role fool again
know all right because
because needle cant burn
colossal fact daddy's ex dont let read
this kansas wheat wont break
if oven wont burn
air leaks from tire
cant look straight ahead
know will just fades
urban shopping mall
maybe worry
do things hurry
sit useless
she dont need
since cant remember when
tell what i've seen
would never believe
things i've done
reality steps
keeps looking over his shoulder
how live mistakes
pretty shame cant defile
spread out every queen see
know when old only runningonna come
as they crumbled into dust washed into sea
funny how these things come about
'cause i'd seen her minute before
this aint no fucking game
dont go down water's edge she said
know how good wind blows
know how hatred goes so buried mine
now want lovers
save from things cause us pain
they believe now
gotta earn every breath take
feel safe
it's an animal city
love
que pase junto ti
aprendi querer los gatos
mentiras piadosas
y fue por ti que descrubi

desesperada la operadora
yo siento acabada de nacer
eres tu y contigo
por que este amor ya no entiende
para esta intil
enterrarte en mi memoria
y esconderme para no sentirme
ojerosa flaca fea desgreada
torpe traste testaruda
mi tu anatomia
bruta ciega sordomuda
y aunque diga ya no mas
nuevamente
torpe tonta lenta necia desquiciada
es todo lo que he sido
pero vas vencer asi nomas
ten un poco de compasin por mi
pero ese sentimiento es mas fuerte
before didnt give damn 'bout what they say
dont so hard this
'cause not here let down
dont so hard
cuentas conmigo
porque no tenemos barreras
cuentas conmigo amor
que cuento contigo
dando vueltas en pars
y qu pasa si son ellos
los han visto en los cocteles todos
la que canta esta cancin
que te hicieron por ah
ya vas ver como va
ya vas ver como van sanando
la lgria sec
ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
y hoy vuelvo ver
ayer te busqu
y quiero pensar
saliste de aqu
ayer te busqu
en las revistas
dando vueltas en paris
y que pasa si son ellos
hasta ofreciendo conciertos
o la que canta esta cancion
ven regresa por mi
donde estas corazon
porque en el planeta
en las revistas
tan largos tan grises
tan faltos de aire
tan faltos de aire
que aun encuentro con vida
rompes la herida en tu pobre alma
como perdida en el desierto estoy
yo necesito de ti de ti
tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
yo necesito de ti de ti
nada lo consigo si no estas tu junto mi
tu necesitas de mi de mi
no creo que el mar algun dia
que nadie mas te amara asi
ay yo quiero ser tu firmamento
por eso sigo aqui y camino
si hablo demasiado
voy pedirte que no vuelvas ms
no se puede dedicar el alma
siento que duelas todava aqu
acumular intentos
get bit attention
next her cheap silicone look minimal
place
or train horse
y lo peor es que aun quedan tantas ganas de
o que mandes flores
para obtener un si
solo en las calles transitar
pero digo la verdad
es ms difcil ser rey sin corona
pero digo la verdad
desde ese entonces hay quienes lo han visto
pero digo la verdad
es mas dificil ser rey sin corona
pero digo la verdad
puedo vivir sin ellos yo
fi ainaiha aralhayati
abandonado en el desierto
viaj de bahrein hasta beirut
y no encontr ojos as
puedo vivir sin ellos yo
fi ainaiha aralhayati
abandonado en el desierto
viaje de bahrein hasta beirut
y no encontre ojos asi
delatando al corazon
no se como se puede ser tan bello
por favor ya basta
despedazo mi corazon
y retumba en mis oidos
y te enfrentaste dinosaurios
piensa que el hierro
y ahora estas aqu
saludar al vecino
que dira la familia
y en la fiesta de quince
permaneciste desnudo
y de suenos blancos
los nombres y las medidas
para vivir en la vida
no hagas ruido en la mesa
y bailar bien el vals
no puedo
mejor le digo adis
que he comenzado estorbar
tu boca de anis
start out playing yourself
i'd rather eat soup fork
cuz there's foot every shoe
pero que quedes t quede tu abrazo
que se consuman las palabras en los labios
pero que quedes t quede tu abrazo
que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
porque yoooo yoo si si
o que renuncien los filantropos y sabios
y si quedas tu
ahora que no estas
ahora que no estas
unas cuantas libras menos
ya ves que hasta mis manos
que gaste yo la vida
que te seques con mi llanto
corochorus
es abrir la puerta de mis aos
mi vida es transparente todava
busco eternas primaveras
sin saber por que
la flor que se abre plena luz del dia
que renazcan la vida
esta vida nunca pasa en vano
mi primer amor
huracan de emociones
used sing saddest songs
ready goodtimes
dont wanna look at fashion magazines
swear wont gone
siempre viste de gris pues no tiene remedio
por la ley del magneto
cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
dana es nina de bien eso dicen sus padres
corochorus
cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
cuando muera tu
se lava bien los dientes
nada ahora puede importar
ya no tienes
siempre barre bien
lejos de esta enorme ciudad
duelen tanto las sonrisas
pensando en ti
sigue rodeando
hoy estoy
es que no tenerte aqu ya hace mal
que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
y siguen rodando por ah
pensando en ti
if this was meant
there's something
plus you're best kisser i've ever known
they say god's do exist
quand je regarde dans tes yeux
make believe
castillos princesas que ironia al fin al cabo fantasias
ya lo se no eres perfecto y es verdad
le ro lo le lo le
quiero vivir contigo
le ro lo le lo le
contigo mi vida
siempre soe con ser sirena hablar con algas y ballenas
yo tenia un mundo de ilusiones en el que te guarde un lugar
siempre soe con ser sirena hablar con algas y ballenas
yo tenia un mundo de ilusiones en el que te guarde un lugar
cuando se entierra en el medio de un no y un si
voy
prueba de patadas
satrico
te aviso que estoy de t vacunada
del mundo el dolor
muy muy lejos
si ya es hora de limpiar
pronto estare de ti
tu boca de anis
si fuera un viernes
dentro de este hueco
de una hora y media
es caminar sin mirar
que ha aumentado su nivel
y por mas que yo lo intente
te necesito te necesito mi amor
yo no se si he vivido
some kind amnesty
this day time
are moving right left
heartbeat sun racing mine
ahhh
plant more trees
world full strangers
chorus 2x
timor timor
it's alright it's alright
isnt isnt
if forget about 'em
it's alright it's alright
if they forget about us
let's keep telling world it's sunny
then hurry
y siempre tu fuerza que gua
y mi lado siempre estzs
buscare donde te encuentres tu
mis zapatos destenidos
el adios que no sabre decir
porque eres tu mi sol
y cuando miras se encoje mi cuerpo y hago chiquita
ayudame hacer ilusion en mi mente
que paso
no importaba
ultimo momento
no inquieta porque esta cancin es solo una alarma
y eso paso
de vez en cuando lejos
corochorus
que se hace lava que hace
jumpit out jumpit
where find them
running out reasons cry
love more than all that's planet
there's an endless story
toda en ruinas como el partenon
pleno imperio romano
corochorus
corochorus
could both make fun distance
whenever wherever
lucky breasts are small humble
we're meant together
le do le le le le
there's nothing left fear
i'll never wear
only half body
i'll never wear
only half body
once upon time
wishing time hadnt passed
when could spend our evening
wishing time hadnt passed
have lived too much too fast
when really cared
pero el prncipe azul
cuando miro en tus pupilas se que dios no dejo de existir
entre lo mundano y lo sagrado
muy original
que eres mi prisin
que es lo que te hace ser
que busca intimidarme
ser tan especial
y tu buena suerte
solo porque tengo una mente traviesa
es mi forma de jugar el escondite ingls
y enredo con las horas ya no se si llegaras
el estar contigo hace libre
este es el ritmo el que hace vibrar
esta noche voy contigo bailar
que recien ya te conozco
desato el corazon
si dices te amo siento muy bien
trapecista sin red
y ahora estoy aqui
estoy aqui quierendote
las cartas que escribi
sabes que sigo esperandote
que por ti esta latiendo
quisiera verte en cada atardecer
yo quiero saber

open heart
aunque te de lo mismo
y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
empezar por uno mismo
y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
y el deseo gira en espiral
y mas abajo estara yo
no faltes nunca
no pido que todos los dias sean de sol
no solo de pan vive el hombre
y andar arrojando los cerdos miles de perlas
y hoy se que es tuyo corazon
yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
fue una tortura prederte
una victima casi perfecta
despacio despacio comienzas caer
un volcan hoy
luego bailar bajo la luna
por estar tan lejos
hoy veo tan perdida
lejos de tu amor y sin salida vuelve
la resignacin es un deseo sin piel y
una mquina
lo fatal lo imprescindible
y aunque haga la invencible

but things still look same
love still from here
hear footsteps seems i've been through this before
ooh are near

keep wondering wondering wondering
tell about this love you've been

they're dressing andy warhol up
killing andy warhol

life times art talk
love lies under western eyes powerful yet transient
relief
sweet tears roll river from eyes
make want live make want die
lost broken scarred
one more kick door cracks open
power powerless strength unto weak
let children let children speak
let children let children
secrets lovers
let there love
so let love
praying
let there love
life day

life day
want go where are
want touch let play

maimed us at start
words cant express how sorry am
who can show how can
out history have come
i'll talk but wont listen
since then have taken granted

last night went see love
or perhaps he gone some other lover
near there spent youthful days
rosy cheeks ruby lips own she has heart thrall then
but there's none them can sing so sweet
circling around sun
oooooh it's breeze blowing deep beneath skin
not ready yet

oh let glorious love done
through when dreams are only blue

but u put head shoulder

if you've never seen good time
i'd terrible broken heart

but will rise
should've left light
wouldnt have begged hold

see what can find
so you're fool attack
as did when were alive
no harder this world
thief heart
though lips never part
as went out walking one morning june
green woods will wander shun all mens view
but when he was dying heard his last cry
see how black moon fades

think it's fun think it's fun games
so dont wanna fix
no one can see
chorus
you're laughing as sinking down
dont know much but have clue
slipped man twenty keys hunsay
gonna keep chrome out ride
cops kids their checkin out ride
hit as it's goin off
been thinkin 'bout what we've become
times havent changed still swimmin
tell kid exactly where not go
can taste blood
everyone wanted hear
know its over
are set
where have been
swing set
never ever ever
it's no secret
take bow
just time

tomorrow's gonna hurt
every single day just fling
there's nothing left choose
wear underwear steal shirts
get outta hair get outta head
what's man suppose do
she was high she was really bye bye
she packs pipe as much as she can fill
all she could up this
even make jamaican man sing happy song
teach world snuff fires liars
but if offer shun might as well walkin sun
repeat chorus
lookin at watch
moppin up floor
when was carrying
could lovelier
could luckier
just wanna make crystal clear
eyes shielded shaky hand
obvious used excuses
children gather wonder
seen ya seen ya seen ya standing everytime
they wouldnt have mafia
want know
i'd rather hung from tree or shot by gun
top this list things before leave this place
said wasnt all right but would all right
even when get home somehow you're still alone
chorus
know am
but you're not
trying save world but never really sure
nothing more than that's all really am
just average ordinary everyday superhero
nothing more than that's all really am
better love mother
better shake funky attitude
had good plan but didnt go right
doesnt matter what try all ends same
there's always something ends up happening
seems story life
das verspreche ich euch
scary vulgarism
gasp vomit out
coming from behind

loving husband devoted father
where justice where punishment

so lighting up cigarette followed pursuit
so turned around forty thousand headmen hit dirt
painter paint scene

but when hope love has gone
get back up try againthough future's not plain

misspent angel eyes tonight

trapped by insecurities
only thing really know sure
blood runs so red face
lesson once learned so hard forget
never make promises break
from deserts west shining sea

thy love will thus fruitless ever
reasons will love should just

see you've sent letters back
but you'll sorry when dead
follow step
call lies mud

age chivalry not dead
blood lost dozen litres
mother told was clever one

maidens numbered only one
settled down family
everything falls way
swelling world
listen girl
at centre fury
dont seen alone without friends at night
no life at all
hush child
all sorrow
heart was lost distant planet
every footstep only
would make prison life
all our histories without love
every prison blown dust
y no piensa en nada ms
another lonely day
but should have known this right from start
hundred billion bottles
there's moon over bourbon street tonight
now can only show face at noon
how could this way when pray god above
unspoken invitations everywhere
must careful not lose our way completely
all things we've dreamed moonlight
as summer golden church
then can turn murder into art
you're flushed very first success
it's as easy learn as abc

world not playground
could lost could refuse try
could've made through
if had do this all second time
one only love
whenever speak
tells are own
although all must sometimes stumble
need some lips feel next mine
know can make everything alright

horse he kept running rider was dead

leaving too soon
cant make up fire
all hear lonesome sound
they got their sights
from wound lovely flower grew
blood lazarus heart
sacrifice life yours
lifts her eyes sky flower rain
seas have their source so have shallow springs
night after night she would stand shore
i'd give three ships spanish gold
day after day he would stand shore
no debt was paid no dowry gained
secret marriage vow never spoken
there are soul cages
these are soul cages
vintage blessed every ship line
these are soul cages
he dreamed ship sea
if should happen again shall worry
found myself deck rolling ship
at first just rustle canvas
held fast wheel rocking ship
lost wild wild sea
they're dancing their fathers
they dance invisible ones
one day we'll dance their graves

she's real gone cuckoo yes sirree
fifteen miles down track

she said how much do need
but before our future course set
circus mind
it's alright
some would say was lost man lost world
never saw no military solution
if ever lose faith
then wont understand 'til end days
though pages are numbered
there's promise heaven hell but damned if see
cant see where they lead
here arms where world impossibly still
all noise silenced room
except when this moment comes near dancing's end
there was an old guy beard
cant see nobody better so you'll just have do
had no time worry though there was just much do
he's god's best friend he's got seat board
so said had mission his favourite dove
rock steady rock steady
walk streets money
told once wont tell again
dont subscribe this point view
there no historical precedent
what might save us
i've been searching long enough
spirit moves water
all saints angels stars up above
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
i've been thinking 'bout things believe
if somebody up there likes somebody up there cares
minute saw her face second caught her eye
minute saw her face second caught her eye
it's promise or lie i'll repent before die
send love into distant dawn
but still earth moving so fast

but our thoughts kept returning
circles made our fires

at feast crow
what's use worrying feeling blue
so easy must succeed
spread little happiness as go by

only takes moment dont afraid
spends night his lover there's trace her cologne
but there's more than suspicion this lingering cologne
promised one day could it's what said phone

our saviour christ his lady
o they sailed bethlehem

burn wicked garden down
out dark blinds
would tell things wouldnt have
think spread myself little too thin
musictolkkilyricstolkki
eyes world
shades night walking through sleeping village
god computer's name
log out system
so let's all join our hands
4th reich rising
meaning so much more
life changing cannot recall where i've been before
morning no recall no memory nothing at all
was meant fail every time
musictolkkilyricstolkki
maybe it's would throw dice then hope nothing goes wrong
life down here just one big endless curse
can hear calling
stays forever
before summer turns winter before dreams will turn snow
again see standing there watching
black diamond
cast spell never let go
love stream endlessly flows
see through history
they say are crown all creation
have been sailing across oceans
searching loving from strangest places nothing left but pain
without am ship without it's sails
take hand will alright go
they will put down their minds steel
times are changing so fast wonder how long lasts
look all things we've done under burning sun
control life am one
so please wait
distant skies
looking back through time through childhood days
will close eyes float away stream
why dont take there wanna feel some infinity
so long have been accepting what i've seen
cant make no compromise stop what has begun
seeing new face impression moment thought
cant believe what's screen
we're flying so high
am facing truth
courage faith will show way
walking down road choose
there's no ehwo could stop now she'll mine
path wisdom only way reality
musictolkkilyricstolkki
reign terror
winds time soul will fly
listen now so close
all sorrow pain will washed away
hasty deeds spoilet chances mine
walls sometimes skull called
until damage done beauty gone
before go sleep
tears ice falling down
what did
dont know what happening
but eyes light way
dont turn please wont stay by side
what happened all dreams
wheel time
approaching visions things
staying there alone reaching unknown
will take things as they come
i'll turn
other side calling
spirits are calling
leave

nostradamus century v43
save us are future
end end end our time
soon there will no one fight
did ever give dime things really believed
what will find
canceling tasks i've delayed so long now it's do or die
but am here am wondering
if want have look future world
silence all hear blackness fills world
breaking silencewinter blows colder
witch hunt coming town better look around
take little life ride away
he leads us destruction
shouldnt all up them
music by tolkki words by kotipelto
but they cant chain our minds or hearts
stand alone darkness winter life came so fast
as long as live
change into blessings if change point view
look through yourself there's mystery full
pain misery true when say never
it's fright night
heat blast watch beauty mushroom cast
were ment free
earth rolling her grave
demons sometimes find way
feel glory world
acquiring more still there's never enough
telling salvation comes from above
remember get just what give
unlock door
look that's their eyes
lead us into light
higher than sky
we'll keep mem'ries gained inside our hearts
fighting
under cover night
years he spent cage they did not help him at all
more clear it's each day
millennium new day
tears pain
should have learned by now
mind aching cant go
musictolkkilyricskotipelto

birth day
there's this black widow spider darling she's been walking hand
you've been long darling looks rain
but blood makes noise
think it's really
when blood sees blood
how did this come pass
question
'cause pictures lie
you'll see
always
took urgent whisper
number every page silver
has taken its toll
might still want
am asking
bitten soul
better go into town get then friday night
you'd think maybe by now you'd see light
but think ought use little more sense than what you're using
'cause know if were gone i'd miss sound laughter
brought him into
hair blows long
kept him here years
song wind
long
how would live myself
these things begin
only turned see
what could
look sign
ah
soon will hit deep freeze
wondering where hell
evening has flown loose again
she sits by window eats sunflower seeds
where they wrestle they play
her wit wonder snuffed
love never blind
no shadow or shade doubt
dont want hear
it's making nervous
fat man dancing girl
it's making nervous
most show concealed from view
never dreamed would fall
does she tell truth
get rid soon
never imagined
floor room
had know
even
each night
as she's lying bed
love
i've come
will she try again
all i've got guitar couple dollars spare
i'd better start moving if want get somewhere
he's so true she too she says
they woke up they broke up
love
tickling
pocket

wintertime
if were only
every sane person asleep
do fear light
slink along sidewalk outnumbered out place
destroy all way
by day give thanks
find outline things will
now watch falling into sleep
what's underneath all deadpan face
will cost cost cost
i'll match i'll bet i'll play
said think am afraid
said think dreaming
but dont know who was because
said dont know who you're talking
watching as field goes dry
ask please
wait hear
looking fingerprints
ask please
turning ash as hits air
years an inch step
years an inch step
years an inch step
dark life
it's out his hands over his head
she turns tease camera please us at home
it's out our hands over our heads
by numbers by mirrors by water
suspended ring or mode laughing
by red hot iron
she'd come house
top umbrella had come off
once when saw her
something will shine through body
mask will keep features check
if may
i'll make see
so large
you'll know
so small
woman who's drinking
his symbol freedom
or family or friendship
every sigh every sway
put their fingers hair
burden sun
into this world although they try
memory
rush foam choke
water through rusted pipe
hear creak
wave goes back
comes skin
it's gotten given
am watching
am scattering light
turning hand
daddy's dark riddle
are little kite
never use threes twos
shuffle up luck see almost won
solitude stands by window
she turns her hand extended
then she turns her hand extended
she turns her hand extended
if had met darkened room
could have played mistress
talk talk tell truth
her mother can see lives within her still
by brass candlestick near red velvet coat
still am sure was only but one
what stinging tune
came see if would take
had been so dear kissed as lay
number could call
face under street lamp
as cold
knew loved
so went bed
they had come wrong man
this will mystery
silencer stun
pocket knife attack
so just put down hostage we'll
upon her belly her throat
if were movie
if were movie
hadnt done anything yet
conjure up some grace
so go
so i'll see face dreams
light pale thin
he sounds he's missing something
boy belfry
i'll girl who sings supper
hunchback heaven
would burn myself into memory
would still look eye
waiting our faces seen
take place what it's worth
where point aimless rage
ironbound section near avenue l
front ironbound school yard
where portuguese women come see what sell
backs are cheap wings are nearly free
bound up wire fate
into ironbound market
fancy poulty parts sold here
remains untouched it's way too much
you're playing near line so thin
well there's no time now explanation
it's better way
friends
oh know know
we've got keep little distance
oh know didnt mean way
do love many can love one
one side fire
what am doing
until there's nothing there left at all
her body
watch while queen
silence more eloquent
timeless placeless place
are all laying low
realms underneath
gone
can hardly tell them from petticoats sin
but trouble still trouble evil still evil
corner
but only
somewhere inside us
off strip
looking at them
left center
grope about embers
time burned away
ashes time
some little crumb affection
i've been where are standing
go home
another generations parties
love only thing matters
find each stoop doorway's incomplete
just dont ask what was
yes think okay
phone call received
standing so loyal
skin trampoline
refusal
dont talk about later
walk house afternoon
think it's called destiny
but feeling thing
know was
dont feel will
or maybe vision
depends day if he's eaten yet
go hang gang get lost fray
into places where people dont stay
we'll all go up go down go down go down
hangs so far from
will so sweet
maybe boy will steal
know must
clientele
always thought she
seems have resigned
so if you've seen anywhere
did not know waht say
oh she's gone
do know where friendship ends
was she was never nice
so assigned read her mind now
it's between binding
her hair again
she's cut down
straight lines
cold metal
he likes
he loves city
this ok do not mind
writing letters
sun
but still will
have marched across this field
where was waiting there
hold him flame
soldier came knocking upon queens door
she never once took crown from her head
she said i've swallowed secret burning thread
but she knew how frightened her she turned away
out distance her order was heard
am singing supper
tell what do do
hear those little birds
am feeling devil
her hair blew all around her
said lady why are crying
but am youngest father ageing
so she sadly turned away from
knew she had sent from wherever she was
can feel his eyes when dont expect him
cannot give no must refuse him
they know health
move light
it's just there's so much do
tired sleeping
tombstone cause weathers well
but do try see kingdom
corner
out window
her umbrella
up paper
funnies
really see
getting wet
once upon time
every day
watched drink
unbound roots unbound
at root bound at root
would leave only bones teeth
wanted learn all secrets
sleek
now have
so dont expect any slow careful
cant expect any kind mercy
battlefield
though saw splinter
but save ourselves when all omens
so consider widow boys
but save ourselves when all omens
hear click these men are hard
letters door know what they're
wait here steer clear
night walls disappeared
moving piece sun
alive
riches strange new
down waterfall i'd swim over brim
west end avenue
america this street
wash away wash away downstream
pictures eyes
let hear through heat
have hands raining water
long slender body
blowing by one day
she's every girl you've seen every movie
she's every girl you've seen every movie
plaster paint
they never know
call saint
he's taken form human likeness manifests himself all our darkest dreams preying upon centuries weakness feasting despair our own selfish greed
what's become world colors unfurl revealing blackened haze conditioned fear voice hear calling an end days millions souls under control pawns king led by string final hour
chill grows near you're faced fear
so fly away
nightmare fantasy
marching staff hand
as fight stay alive
knew
untrue reality
begin fantasy what does mean
as fallen star divides sky divinity
empty minds still wait here
answers voices hear
now at feet dying voice balance nevermore shall there way fly way fly wings divinity as words wisdom fade away
time dying dont call name
time closes near
solo
another question mind
winds change bring songs
forced run away hide
play violent strings symphony
bow down platinum maze
bow down platinum maze
forever lost enslaved
merciless judgement church machine
praise this child words her rhyme sacred gift magic five will bring tranquillity new order equality
watching waiting curtains fall
arrival dressed kill it's tragedy
gaze these eyes child see here by side you're destined fears night flee sun if are one kingdom gold lay at feet ruler time space will rivers truth forever will run if are one
great ptah khnemu sacred priest temple ra keeper truth crystalline spheres power light grant us keys stars secrets flight 'five shall as one'
was sure fateful wish evoke night from day thousands now join as one afraid what have done clouds are dimming sun his wrath disease decay this masque vengeance leads death parade what have done shadow burning shadow burns across land
way carry what believe
silence fills shrine giving us sign
feel her kiss steals breath away
desire echoes from tale ancient lore
lady snow holding
sacrifice this paradise innocence
seizing intrusion unveil his clever disguise

desperate cries hail fire deciding
summon all heed their cryinnocence fading away

scanning eyes turn into stone

solo
heal hearts still bleed
while grow old
you've realized
heart thrust dagger
all adversions still remain
savage curtain closes
behind this illusion
decaying hope wasted years
pray someday sun will shine
straw breaks back
straw breaks back
feel eating secrets within mind
but really dont want stay
but really dont want stay
then cast into shades gray
they reap harvest sew take trusting fools
weaves our souls roar
live shadows fears behind smoke mirrors
faith that's misleading vague
power controllng mindit's so sad our world breaking down
savage notorious
sworn quest rest
bring peace again
strength within
understand
this justice thunders our condemnation
or our tongues from evil
watch him jest as bleed

all know paradise has begun
pray glimpse touch sunlight
chance dream fast asleep nightmare ends
close eyes edge forever
tell now do somehow
isle deadly shores
found by
this whole thing mad still can see
can undo things i've done
cant leave
malicious designs built strong iron clad catostrophic
ten thousand tyrants preach their treachery
conquer wicked
solo
silver cross ancient halls deep inside castle walls
prey siege voiceless woe who's dust was scattered long ago
dreadful scene behold
witching hourhaunting minuet immortal duet
try elude these prisions flesh but return
there's no image mirror
part
through bird's eye view can all true
dream within dream
talking riddles ears fallen deaf
now remove masque that's obscuring this dimension
do believeall things you're seeing are true
could never smile
i'll die another death
there's an empty place inside hurting
why gotta so mean
chorus
why gotta why gotta
would wait forever more
believe believe
believe believe
stand protected under bigot sunshine
but far from home
when were just little boy
make wear dog collar
oh they'll pay top dollar
oh they'll pay top dollar
speaking separate tongues
speaking separate tongues
so came across water
come stay while
come stay while
come stay while
there's no peace mind
if ever need somebody
if ever need somebody
underneath confidence
wont hide scars
do know how feels hurt
alone alone
hard bare
did everything could
holding lightly
future says run
no cant even talk
wasnt good enough wanted love
so can trust again
so can trust again
when she says she loves
what must do
you're stretching out arms something that's just not there
give love but wont
not fit soldier
now fight or i'll take land away
over seas over seas
they send away send away
come baby walk
sister moons been shining all day
nothing but blue skys coming our way
saying everything was fine
always grab hold ones know can change
knock down walls
cause need
make way lemon parade
always i'll want
so take another shot boy
never learn malicious
can never break
his heart's command
or underminded
palm his hand
mountain
stood ground
cant deny
swallow pride
i've carried those pails
men they sing song fear
do tell her everything's gonna alright
underneath birch trees
it's all part plan dear
you'd let us all down
could have been enough try
beneath blue skies above
just need something
get feet again
they'll go away
they'll go away
just let go
she said she'd do anything just meet
did they tear all up inside
queen wanna queen
so give love
but somewhere we'll find answer
there was time could not believe
if want best friend
roses always grow
just wanted know
just wanted know
reasons out our control
'cause there's not enough time day
hey little girl
sweet soldier's daughter
sugar burn
show what need feel
sugar may hide
all want sunflower
not asking more than lover not asing more than friend
but you're pushing down
mmmmmm
fear falls rain
fear falls down rain
not broken
they all have got tricked
love she dreams
cold water runs deep
spread wings fly away
chorus
life good life grand
dragged down razor
nobody can change world
waltz
tell something
oh tell tale wicked soldier
some say rope she hanging
all others will compare her
all others will compare
will never say were wrong
love isnt there
got pick up when am down
more than could handle
what about deal flying trapeze
gladys save place grapevine
how we'll rise height our halo
blinded by choices
without guide them all zion

please forgive this bold suggestion
calm beneath castles
life's just too short push away
wont long now
dying cancer crying
here this hopeless fucking hole call la
fret contract
followed by meteor showers tidal waves

wildlife still hear crashing down
thousand acres day
were gone before even knew
there's no way ever get back
matters not who guilty who innocent
bind ropes set horses afoot
without this shadow life would shine
drop platform brings an end crimes
an alibi what need
indulgence by proxy broken rope seven
holy tongue fire commandments were cast
then only then can truly free
what good will man if he gains whole world yet forfeits his
as scaled wings erupt brilliant colors spectrum's view
from world's first dividing cell loneliest quarters hell
flesh blood though are not
promise will do best
nigh does master
iguanidae sees east west simultaneously
spiritual migraines still persist
sleight hand slight mind
our judgement mind polluted
too white too foreign too smart too boring
imparts those he calls his own
pain beyond compare
spiritual death kicks off its swan song
subdural detour shuns embrace logic reason
blind cavefish inbred victim ocular atrophy
avoiding vital confession
'he's coming back' isnt forever
it's about time put away finger
out anguish quiet voice mesmerizing
when sorrow has it's grip
three feet more
god's got funny sense humor
when put away bitterness
burn twice
inability within
boasting set adrift
christ alone completed
lifes only what see
there was rich ruler
if walk light
was there
worried smiles across room
man who gazed into mirror
just down foe cant understand coward giving
or maybe dont never knew
so go ahead friend open up door

dont need religion
religious
lead well life
now given manifold miseries mortal dismay
wisdom calls from these halls
contingent being blessed
so he can take
detested forsaken by family friends
rewarded his faithfulness

cant see how holy exterior appears
have noticed sin lack odometer has been turned back
when pressures come doesnt fly
holidays they come they go
as lock our priceless heritage away
shrouded mystery
chinese water torture cell
dollars happiness that's what world tells us
made
body infested debilitating proteus strain
body starts shake violent burning rigors
then must acquire this toy
but make sure can see through
land tears sadness
death things
or christ himself
when all answers
ohh that's what need
god's grace will torn
that's what it's there
so proud tell us how goes
our calling should heard
world black white surreal
could do sleep
do anything anyone
had have more more more
shut world outside rot inside headphones
good enough them
same way their vow was now
weakness severed power divine

coiling fast
surprised by such an evil thought
so aimlessly search around no answer found

wait wait wait wait but nothing good happens
next time are quick say just waitin lord
who can take away pain
horrors night seem twice as harsh day
hanging plants mournfully wilt waste away
years hateful thoughts will get back
but way raging words actions
broken before one who understands
through myriad eons lost time
will give rest soul
just another day dead half million lay
has his dignity completly destroyed

but dont believe believe can ever get by
when count up odds there's still no guarantee
day began

world spinning around around
just tryin find flame

sometimes may falter
even though know all too well
so give every little thing choose
not alone now alone now

hear lonesome dove off distance
old lonesome dove gonna mourn his love
held greatest expectations
went way went mine
all laughter pain
love alone
fire blew out
silhouetted cross its face
just call quits if cant commit
baby just love or leave alone
baby just love or leave alone
it's gone gone gone
put real good show
but did
while stand sacred ground
would here soon
told starry sky wait
everybody's heart aches
maybe it's love
so turned myself ice stone
maybe it's love miss
tearing down walls inside
saw wino corner gave winnings back
got job california they sure style
now then go back biloxi
dogs wouldnt leave us alone
his chickens might fall fox
when evening fell heard strange sell
swim nearest distant shore
you're trapped between his lies great unknown
every heart itself
second chance
i'll take into arms
it's down track aint lookin back
brand new day wash those tears away
when hear tires squeal
then it'll oh lonesome
snow falling down around
church downtown new orleans
face crowd
if can truthfully say
just one time
well makes one row
georgia rain jasper county clay
as sky fell an storm clouds poured
fixed daddy's house up nice
could talk till blue face
need old friend once knew

came revelation
amazed by wonder
opened heart washed clean
sent from heaven above
there's new kid town

promises are little diamonds
no angel disguise
best at self defense
never turn around
best at self defense
she will stay them till all hope gone
now from moment love comes call
was singing when freed

wont dance
there someone you'd turn as soon as left
would mean as much as used
know sucker baby what cowgirls do
repeat chorus
this gift you've given humbles
her lips still warm lies
should just stand by
let her go
but nobody answers when call name
chorus
ive never felt such release
love power makes heart beat
repeat chorus
when smile world turns upside down
i've got two lovers life now
cause heart only knows what feels right
heart can finally true
wanna
so love
just baby
slowly fades away
there's nothing quite as ugly
girl reason heart's beating
love have shown unlike anything i've known
but trouble's gettin ready start
just hate se eyou wind up nothing
magick speaks tongues fire fortune take hand
take where falcon flies symphony steele
tragic splendor death are free
distance leave behind there no meaning when promises are
they're through there'll no mourning skies are alive whisper
death bring seven meanings our love there'll no warning

hear voices calling see king's return
blazing presence rips through through
blinded by such beauty caught so unaware
shrouded angels meet his gaze
no more tears or dying his throne he's shining
anxious weary mind wracked by fears unnatural scan horizon
once so great now lost cold hungry spirits stalk these halls
god fire proclaims so
no no more from let actions speak awake
blood gasoline
another night highway blood dust air
blood salnts
light years flash before eyes
dare forces conspire against thee
face face fear death hate
cry another day
one nation one kingdom one child survives
i'll meet again through eyes our son
fatal beauty innocence
chains fire night's alive dark burning
oaths made violence punishment turn
fallin callin
dead will taste deeper treasure than youth or life
this sin know can death taste ignorance creator's
are born live again
i'll never die while light races over head
truth
i'll never die while light races over head
know wanna believe
one judas kiss
seven years spent torment alone
way might've been
under hunting wings
chorus
oh dont need
earth
slay clan clouds furies now fly face despite take
earth earth
chorus
open up arms coming home
i've felt tremors hate
black sky cries out name
hours damned
sidewalk screamin rat race
dont gimme prayers
jet black black as night
kingdom fearless kingdom gods
light up sky light up world as run
your're flesh worms
kingdom fearless kingdom gods
die die die
after 3 days will rise again teach all
promises broke woe
finished
burning street's fire
even death can take an holiday
gunfire up heaven no religion here
i've lived among ruins walked among dead
walk desolation hand hand against cold
always wanting more
aint looking love
can hear them say
caught spell winter dreams
will
name sky
will heaven let
swim seven seas rage ruinalive all eternity
time will make mine
bite her lip
darlin love blind
ship storm
'cause cant love
shed blood upon sun
snake rny arms
are ready cos we're leaving tonight
endyamon bridge hades searching sign brink
know
endyamon see vision see line circling onward looking nine
just died today
oh never believed good bye
yes winter's comin onand think all time
oh never believed good bye
noble stance
chorus
innocent eyes shine down

union power love will devour
ooh do know from whence this hunger grows
day goes sleep
wanna make mine
they say you're too young feel
tonight virgin child come
will meet sun
tell her saw stand proud
fortune now waiting vulture sky
proud rebel thief stealer fire never kneel

river ice mountain fire i'll not reveal one
return hero our conquering king
glory too high dangerous gift from gods
elders elektra
you're deliverer king unchained
against hosts heaven sun turns black falls
will die
chorus
there's fire eyes

holy fire golden pyre death
music lyrics by david defeis
watch take her as die
chorus
none can ever tear asunder
when light life over calling from other side
must never look back
purgatory awaits
dont know what you've been told

unholy water you'rebringing down live die
unholy water her breasts were full her hair was wet
victory mine underneath savage sky

child desolation cry under stars have died
created light
promise peace never
fight fight tooth nail
teeth can rip two
slash tear
once more into cobra's nest
how spear faction blazed
by strength herakles arms
distance black rivers flow
you're never forgiven destiny's earned
if terror scheming freedom burned
flames black star shine soul
silent drifter highway side
calling pleading
so let's go all way
klytemnestra
great sword flame sky
great sword flame split night

under desert desert moons
when see coming

flesh blood she leaves
free from life despair
awakened from this nightmare
tragedy still haunts her
strong ride forth pride
cause this day this hour it's coming true
marked proper math child's none late
born beast eastern sands
forever will
feeding inner beast
side by side
you've got see
bow down head
now behind reflection
lies foolish lies
living life total lies
initiate beginning
unleash retribution
no turning back
end all sinful
feel no sympathy
am one binds this world
you'll see things see
every note
make sacrifice
take traitors thieves liars
cast their bodies flames
their ignorance brought about undying pain
guardians primordial light
from war deceit which infests our world
walk little faster now
dont expect sympathy
money's gone
schaffer
now our world crumbles it's happening within
oh ought know
shackles slice her virgin wrists
when was created murky haze
standing now before her eyes
can one man feel
thanks maker questions unanswered
cluttering up his thinking
so beast resides
set motion now armageddon
chorus
now disciples watch
questing through nine plains hell
this where all things are left behind
hurricane hate mocks their helpless pleas
sullen vain
howling sky
medusa's inner soul
they'll suffer here eternally
traitors freeze all eternity
unaware what ive become
experimenting understand human soul
unlocking human life force
deal was rigged
will obey destiny
will refuse his slave
challengers call him from all around
when smoke clears he will arise
blistering rays hate strengthen
shall rise conquer
twilight morning rest weary eyes
not longer than nine score
though blood runs cold
die mankind's sins
it's eyes where deception lies
holy predator wolf sheepskin
i've gotta do as say not as do
you're man cloth comin
see her face comforts
order dragon feed human life
am dragon blood relentless prince pain
centuries past many tribes know tales
techno city state
you'll live life slave
patient contrived
our technology
everything that's pure
but if just submit
has break these chains
overwhelmed by mourning process
robbing graves nearly dead
he turns his back his own creation
now you're always searching
pray lord soul keep
speak
here i'll walk field where fight
this isnt what planned
oh when need
what makes hurt so bad
wind blows cold
are chosen ones
earth fire water air
pain shows
hell put through
god knows why
shamed meyou shame god
hiding right here inside
evil takes soul
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
here our fate
we're damned by our youth
so take final step
last december
visions come visions go
reflection an aging soul
schaffer
see sadness their eyes
things i've said done
look at pain around
nothing less nothing more
there one choice see
singing word
as moon fades away
everyone's grave danger
wont see us there wont feel our stare
now you're frozen there human shell
so heed warning before our own existence falls near extinct
oppressed centuries await prophecy
so our world doomed we'll lay claim again some day
know it's wrong cant deny
pure evil
paint sky blood tonight
as life slowly fades away
lifeless cold grey
nor ones leave
lyrics schaffer
brought this all upon myself
musiclyrics schaffer
now just puppet god devils own descent
will wrath god have mercy soul
father said worry not what they say
hear what say
it's leap faith
storming demons travel through night
what this have done
life's own it's pride
vindicate cleanse earth all mankind
bide time planning fate
sixth day
walk earth another day
descending angelic force
she swore an oath an allegiance
prechorus
bridge
repeat chorus
forced power besieged
this path choose
y erik love i've waited all life
carlotta's head other death's planned
y m what's behind mask
bound forever this barren land desolate
as plead knees
night came
chorus
henchman awaits
chose this fate no turning back
undying his will kill his bloodlust profound
families these bodies which held such precious life
demonic clown shapeshifter
watch beat as cry
weeks weeks cried
oh know oh know
know he's an angel now
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
into burning lake fire
brings knees
fill sweet desire
bridge
our sacrifice reality
knew was end
what will price
our fathers told us this hell
there was garden eden serpent more crafty
searching someone devour destroy
master master disguise
master master disguise
need another way shelter from war
you're staying down too long it's time fly
answer master when reach our destiny
mind collide
but somewhere along this road
nothing no words say
selling their pride temptation hide
twisted by tales demon
when heart blind
hunting down soon or later
they've got control
memory's haunting
burning burning love
when sun goes down
street smart talker gun his hand
city's fire
stepping closer grave
dont know judgment day at hand
it's life palm hand
light are ready stand
see tears roll down another victim night
heart bought sold
cross bear
every mile there's party see
one hot jacuzzi big swimming pool
down so low maybe more
passion adrenaline
everything do everything say
every little word every little thought
all fired up ready go
lightening flashes through wasteland
still there famine floods earthquakes
find way saving grace
face grand illusion hide behind mask
sin after sin nailed cross
better turn yourself another page
so better pray there's no delay
stuck middle dead night
when saw smoking gun
had change evil ways
time trial agony
want have all
now refuse listen
but say headed fall
hot desert sand
keep eye prize
gggg grin
grin bear
sanctuary hanging from chain
soon sun will shine just hold line hold line
hear sweet voice love cant deny

choose between wrong right
read horoscope swear palms read
ready stand ground
take promise word
let love shine through night yeah
got find narrow way leads paradise
taking our place ancient days

take hand we'll start again
turn hand fate
cant see our love so right
i've tried everything could find
walking paradise

forever i'll share life
knowing what's line

there's still time turn away
never surrender no take power love

what really matters when cross finish line
caught up rat race playing devils game
living fast lane burning flame
she always was winner
secret lover comfort
speak silence talk
i've finally found home by side
now realize cant live without
so get out bed
but since you've been gone
telegram
out head
his spirit's dying way
stealing everywhere no one seems care
where's peace where has gone
reflecting mirror
heading from east into west la
perfect stranger stand line
together can have all
together we'll share harmony there without treason
stand or fall
tears eyes world
dying traditions selfish ambitions
silence night can hear cries
into valley sorrow
into night they will ride
solo
there's no turning back
when he's running pack
another mindless crime
papers signed at immigration
into air fly gracefully
when you're under gun it's cold sensation
when you're under gun it's blue damnation
freezing by fire while you're chilling bone
victim system living city
deadly stare into monitor screen
remote controller's hand
visual decline etched upon mind
i've got brand new band
walk inside shoes
but momma aint now painted clown
'cause life aint no crime
hope someday see what see
walk away you're prisoner lies
it's only fear itself keeps chained alive
am wrong or right
but could feel him
am wrong or right
sick tired being pushed around
cant hear river run without sound
double chorus
shine brightly while can
feel warming one
all around
all around
see rising sun
wanna tell
all people
hear voices

nothing seems right
but wont get far
baby dont cry

as eye sun rose her lips
no storm or heavy weather
mesmerises one wedding guests
hoping good luck brings
terrible curse thirst has begun

name rose fire sky
ohi never felt so strange
all life's blood slowly draining away
hand hand then we'll jump right into pool
nobody there reason why
when cry there isnt sound
night day scan horizon sea sky
lost far from home
so all alone
sunlight falling steel
life wheel it's rolling still
what are fighting
where mustard gas barbwire bloom
why did they make war
choosing guns or fighting swords
best man wins end
angel death hears last breath
where blood red journey ends
sins they gave one
temptation take all far
now stand alone darkness
reflecting past life doesnt have much time
it's not so easy stop from screaming
catch soul it's willing fly away
but never have felt no never have felt this way before
have lust earth below
chorus
cant accept soul will drift forever
when werent there help
never had no trouble
lord running
they're coming from sea
vikings are too many
axes grind maces clash
you'd better get away
as falls upon floor
up above head iron maiden wants
cluthching at straws find way
if had chance again
all life have believed
killer behind
compelling satisfy
house soul
knife truth
look truth
fate has brought these shores
dont want existence end
saints sinners
what deserve just dont get see
branded leper because dont fit

there's some people coming down street
someone call gendarmes
murders rue morgue
murders rue morgue
should return scene crime
gers dickinson harris
accuse before know crime it's all too late
looks feelings are just remains past
you're phantom opera you're devil you're just out scare
tell why had powerslave
so bring blood red wine
but open gates hell
slave power death
i'll die oh please
oh help please
it's driving mad
bushes open wide
repeat
every step tread
seems so futile
turn look at who's heels
pay kill die lose
nowhere run nowhere hide
toe toe throw line
show them no fear show them no pain
nomad where go no one tells
reputation goes before they all say
silhouette statue carved stone
nomad you're spirit men fear us
were they reflections warped mind
666 number beast
but feel drawn towards chanting hordes
wont get away from grasp
have us all
dont stray from narrow way
run i'll kill eat
know where goingout
you'd better scratch
but what makes man decide
new generation brings
will live forever
wider divide can see between good bad
you'll take life but i'll take yours too
as race towards human wall
as lay there gazing at sky
there something you'd rather
all life i've run away
do really care what people think
he knocks feet so what are gonna do
he can push his own boat as set up off track
kingdom sands
desert planet dune
he has power foresee
true leader men
cold as steel darkness waits its hour will come
crush them fly
gone ar days when men looked down
cant get used purgatory know really makes cry
try show her she's never gonna alone
close eyes think home
cant ease this pain so easily
no one should go where eagles dare
it's really impossible climb
was born into scene
until find him
some say shouldnt matter
until find him
have sailed many lands now make final journey
take heart set free
will not fail now as sunrise comes darkness left behind
forever now cant think why
get feeling all love's inside
devil get ready take over mind
power inside i've decided pray
'cause am chosen one
banish conqueror who's taken land

handing out their trash
he said had none blame but
husband if you'll wife
dont treat so doggone mean
little cafe just around bend
am calling oh
hold there was bed
by his bedside standeth stone
babyyou're so cruel
these are dreams mine
yeah you're moving moving again
why did come here
undo life too much cocoon
by light sun murder comes
how would happiest man world
fare thee well honey fare thee well
when wore apron low
i'd at home mama's bed
her head her hands
head hands her kiss lips another
did really think this bloody road would
pave way
better turn around blow kiss goodbye
i'll waiting right here just show
how our love will blow all away
know everybody here thinks he needs
while this time's busy sleeping
dont fool yourself she was heartache from moment met her
tell myself over over wont ever need her again
long enough clouds fly away
feel them drown name
tell man never coming back again
blood red flaked gunshot glitter
left coins behind
parting was mutual moment became
heard there was secret chord
her beauty moonlight overthrew ya
there was time when let know
it's not somebody who's seen light
lay nails down till they rake over
world repeated love
take away blues
paranoia will write world prayer
bolt doors hire guards
hmmm it's brand new power
when count down from ten
are soft young
if wanted
all past once knew
if wanted
they say every man needs protection
all day long hear him shout so loud
but little cry wants someone badly
'cause cry all over madly
dont do anything
kisses mouth his
remember words told
never want see face
sweat pours down
because lies spirit possessed
say all right though things get kind slow
her stay
so long ago when was small
rien que nous deux
ah mon amour
even pepi from napoli
maybe it's still there still there today
know are woman by way burn below
crystalize illusion shine forgot here
jewel box sadness bring catch tear
she takes just woman yes she does
she takes just woman yes she does
cant stay here
then ache just woman
were at party
saint john
hot sweet tight
resounds rebounds off ceiling
that's what
j buckley
baby maybe just because didnt know at all
maybe didnt know him at all
under lilac tree
lilac wine feel unsteady love
see rain fall upon funeral mourners
child know how much need
ohor will ever learn
kingdom kiss upon her shoulder
'cause it's not too late
an cov'rin crossroads standing at
but mama you're just mind
lying bed
memories fire rhythms fall slow
it's i've searched so hard
spring water floor this
bliss abyss
she cheated she lied stole her
can hear love again x4
all law gravity
price admission
had send away bring us back again
what am still
have no right wonder just how or when
whole family's splintered
no stars revolve around
there no single entrance
feel no shame what are
fall light fall light
leave home car leave pulpit
fall light fall light
all young lovers know why
dont know what asked
so new bedroom floor
so new bedroom floor
it's overflowing now inside
how many times have heard someone say
but one thing's gone certain when comes time
take away these thoughts mine
dig holes sleep inside
dig holes sleep inside
she free
thought i'd hurt mother
back when was baby baby saying his prayers
lauraknow this song always
although door was open there's nothing left now
strange fruit hanging from poplar trees
jump hedges first
oh oh sweet thing sweet thing
sweet thing
oh sweet thing sweet thing
nevermind now heart how much he's all
i'll keep happy rest natural born days
gone astray
good riddance goodbye
there nothing sadder than
when her baby comes call
watch evil black sky
people public can ignore
let's see take another drag
will now black sky
have no fear this machine
love that's right time
do do do do
turned each other saying 'i love baby love you'
good night
come call question
please let bring back this gifts mine woman
loan shark bliss

magazine
magazine
there's man moon
climbing mountain taking gamble
mary hangs from rearview mirror
but still want
take these broken bones
changed name changed mind
now something just went wrong inside head
cheap greeting cards hollywood films
could get job bank
it's truer now than ever before
stumble through
think know what mean
do feel real
if so i'd know
do really feel real
do feel real
bob dylan didnt have this sing about
if anything
watching world wake up from history
nothing ever goes quite as planned
just need someone blame

there no good no evil only
wall there red light
let all
stripped oh
time took what's mine took now
things arent what they where they're what they are
dream better things see
couldnt tell yo if it's black or white
dont mind all things they say about
may seem strange but that's all want do
how about
now it's okay smoke
get wrong get right

he knows it's true they're our there
if look hard enough then you'll see clearly
just tell where start

shoot mouth off
top world's place
walk up edge
if this as hard as gets
want see things first time

everything fine
louder shout better you're heard
two two always equals four
ee do
welcome back victoria
welcome back victoria
now mostly dont
what would know
cynic's hired hand
spin around yes give more lies
will make face go pale
at outside at outside at outside at outside
who am
live fast die young words fool seems
timebomed stick around see all go up smoke
separates light from dark
when it's yours lions share
dig own grave
expecting share views
this time revolution will computerised
oceans part patterns mind
cash jim took home
first last time
luck should so bad now
little flat tin case all need
know clothes seem shabby
haze smoking pleasure
has changed his world friend
wont what dont want
ages passed knew at last
all good places
through far marches acres wild
cement fingers
giving herself chance there's no need show her how should
will still there further
will still there further
eats but one every ten
no mouse police never sleeps
hope everybody's dancing their own drum this fine morning
so take minute remember part
well there has some better way
apogee through night
tight lipped soldier
gonna get some
pink cotton undies blue telephones
watching as frilly panties run
warms his feet
when ice
stand naked telescope
under big sky
yours mine
astronomy
so why are holding hand tonight
so why are holding hand tonight
script blowing out sea
but rock roll star knows his glory really nothing
but god laughing up his sleeve
automotive science engineering
things are humming
they didnt see wink eye
having chosen nothing
where no one can ring at all
just wond'ring what things do
what hell was thinking
she's breath champagne sparkling night
can call another line
ale spew puddle brew boys throw up clean
throw soft shadows water night
as ship moves sadly from pier
died falklands tv
there's child woman praying an end mystery
where real mountain men are kings
got nothing but sit sun
him resurrected from grave
chains history
you'll praying till next thursday
really dont remember
could he sitting left
who's got cheque this hot dinner
go weak kneed at suggestion
snatch if fall
swing big bear down
well there no rehearsal
but safety curtain falls
prompter his corner sorry he came
first violinist's hands are chilled
looked out window saw stencil black
no step no step
no step no step
wet pavements thin apartments
are routine assignment
feel steps quick headlights
black viscous bound cure blue lethargy
prices boom aberdeen london town
happy way
there's good times had
no say have answer
ceilings crash walls collapse
paint own deceiving sign
nothing say
trip up
occasional demons too
sheepdogs howl make tracks growl
eddies whirled beech leaves furled
another tea time another day older
who hides his head pretending sleep
as pull old wings one white duck
so fly away peter fly away paul from
available consultation
critics falling over tell themselves he's boring
``but you're wrong steve see it's only solitaire''
so come up singing above cloudy cover
high love feel fine
old dog experience
ripping through black yellow cabs
dodging rickshaws bicycle boys
well meaning overkill
while child within raging
they just tell gotta close hard
make marked card play
`til force comes through
by dun ringill
there's wink seduction from mainland
singing mainland blues
island city cut by cold sea
it's really up her
washed up new identity
warmer beat european legacy
fallen hard times but feels good know
giving us hard time friends
nine miles two strand topped barbed wire
big road's pushing through along valley floor
they say they gave compensation
no chance finding woman who
believe fires at midnight
fold clothes neatly away
dont lay bait while whole world waits
did our friends all catch needle match did
did our friends all catch needle match did
not fishers men
no hope immigration keep passing through
no one left tale tell
calling name into night
which at one time seemed dream
was they who were wrong
ape's curiosity
walking
they grow very still
jack kerouac ren'e magritte name few heroes
through clear skies tracking lightly from far down line
fail safe forget things saw
few bridges tonight
tall general points
crossing
convenient alliance
head wont deliver well sold down river
but turning again
yes `n turning again
hard liner she brings ice when bring fire
how does she retain heart's desire
but remember warm loving nights
she's real hard liner
face up last card
i'll close eyes count ten
cold drink hand
no use trying board train
flies at nostrils plunder
let find filly proud stallion seed
you'll strain once again sound gulls
bring song evening
thrill sound all
heavy water
what goes up has fall back down
i'll here do all things comfort
let angels take home
where path was barred
boot leather flashing spurnecks size thumb
just normal low born so so
oh jesus save
got no reason go anywhere no friends call anymore
taking simple life feel grass roots growing
all places i've been make hard begin
wont worry about thing
well thinking does
try get through what lies deep inside
scattered all around
monkey puzzle lid
can guess name can guess trade
have guessed trade
staked claim heartlands put grain store
strange avenues where lose all sense direction
somewhere crowd think hear young girl whisper
she walks between lines
stuck out august rain
while mummy's at home sleeping
get out get what can
red lights pin stripes short step shuffle into night
well dawn was coming
no sense sitting there hating everyone
what was looking got something mind
chequered flag sweeps across oil slick track
two biscuits morning paper mystery
lemming hearted hordes
high rise city canyons dwells discontent ages
synthetic chiefs frozen smiles holding unsteady courses
oh gladys
felt searching hand frisk her
got fixed up now she's doing fine yeah
he said ``you'll need someone help
up dusty hill rattlesnake trail
going rattlesnake trail
warchild dance days nights away
heart heart there's tiniest part
edge half dream glowing
are still here taking
it's whaler's dues
money speaks soft hearts lose truth only whispers
am first piper who calls sweet tune
climb saddle whistle along
all sit up bed dont think straight lines ahead
think back dream had
warm rains
she peeled from stretch black snake
mosquitoes buzzed her hair
i'll follow beneath this dome
all these nights playing precious games
think see us these promenade days
puppy dog waves big moon sea
still shaking wings
it's been long time
old rocker wore his hair too long
prays he always will
so old rocker gets out his bike
stopped off long drive
she went this way while
there's ladder can climb
oh she says
ohh oh i'd cup black coffee piece sweet cake
i'll truck stop runner
upon snow
so raise lips coax
one more arctic desert day
send chamber pot back down line
as slip greasy platform
someone can trust
wrapped up smile
tell when not yet
next transit lounge
break story heavy type
snap up flash away
communications down
news running late tonight
could meet eyes working girl
there was tear drop sparkle inside her thigh
wont let move but cant sit still
want
just p'rhaps he's hungry
am him
well way three cheers doctor bogenbroom
he sits quietly under every tree
jack do never sleep
oh jack please help through winter's night
sending water lillies sailing
dipping weaving flutter
first moths summer
paradise steakhouse
sheath steel so may hold
i'd eat i'd eat
old meanings move drift time
roots down wet clay branches glistening
try wee sensation but first have want join
do wolf pack crawl
books
strange foreign chaps white bed sheets
clone smartly dressed pressed uniform
exorcise beast
everywhere's danger zone i'd love help
let voices swell stare beastie face
oh dont fool `cos know what feel
i'll visit down beggar's farm
beside myself
forgotten charms soothe
small child messing down messing down
werent glasgow train
big dipper
run up radio calling out wind
steal little inspiration steal little muscle
looking face staring from sunshine
brightest flower garden
freezing rains melting no trains running
black sunday falls one day too soon
born minute next returning
vivas cortinas weaving their wake
out north no oil rigs are drifting
all kinds people come down opening
stamps from green shield
bless hard heart those who surround
while she ran perfect circle
along skin satin sea
know rippled just hint muscle
thought saw her at late night restaurant
walking through forests palm tree apartments
claws at back send chill through night air
he's lover life but player pawns
we'll give john supplement his camels he dropped his
she made tea
when you're stuffing yourselves at christmas parties
angels night
cup silver liquid fire
desolation valhalla
it's house commons brawl
as jackets off they fly heaven bent
end commons brawl
move old lady
still more independent
as agent scores another front page photograph
tear down double quick time
there's suite down at hotel
some angel from midwest regretting being
best boots road suits nine lives
did buy passport from queen
cross eyed mary goes jumping again
cross eyed mary finds hard get along
all media here show
regular boy dressed blue
but they cant seem get deal right
will heed song calls them back
pass wit ancient wisdom pass cup crimson wonder
desert candle tented space
wont peek behind those dangerous veils
desert candle tented space
said butler hall
big jet rumbles over runway miles
politicians weep
where keepers kept
closed pages
dharma seek will find
i've been treated growing pains
you've been causing tonight
tuned crazy imperfection
seems guaranteed send mad
dogs midwinter
look around every face see
when you're looking at each other down muzzle gun
she doesnt talk workers rest line
lady meadows
which hide head
thread holds down
misfortune sparrow hawk hangs over
oh no no saboteur
wanna no saboteur
but if dream good why not share when nights are cold
separates eastern steel from western gold
she looked at was jack ripper
i'll burn
so began age man
then god director smells rat
i'll give steady push six knot simmering
his side
cecil sea lion
no central heating or cement
as light cigarette burning deck
as crowd grows uneasy boos begin
make no pin cushion this big balloon
where they built their industries edge town
what do do when river's turning blue
oo
i'll sing very softly so if phone rings
one day you'll wake up present day
do things they should have done
well do ever get feeling story's
sometimes she does
just when feel dancing
timeless unreasoning
take hand take bow
played that's all now oh never
court jesting never resting he must very cunning
dont believe you'll cry there'll smile upon face
rare gems upon her fingers
ten thousand years
pausing briefly corries
white london town
''permission breathe sir'' dont talk old man
only things feel
dont hear what dont say
make feel much better than could know
as drag down every lover's lane
songs from wood make feel much better
not pathetic lie
are yourself not
gonna get piece mind
spine tingling railway sleepers
faithful dog master
late commuter special
hey mr policeman wont come over hook up power lines
who's left make most from least
they made feel they loved all seeing they say
nice girl but bad girls better qualifies both ways
just cant help come when she calls
by hours minute by those ladies who bless them
stepped out new horizon
get tax man agree
should circulate her likeness
should her place or mine
there was heavy traffic radio
barre but sometimes an owl feathers are really smooth
eat meat that's infected
keep stiffly starched collar
wardrobe mistress
but wear old god's horns
take cues up beatbeat down
as verses unfold soul suffers long day
symphony sounds underground put under duress
daddy said it's just some flickering
it's you're man tv screen
are grownups brave or do they just pretend
well dont care eat out smart restaurants
well dont know about carrying out
mean tall
well maybe can stretch
once used join
runs all time loser
bed having fun
he picks up gideons bible
failing notice pussy cat has come out take leak
look at animals look at well how would queer one
he regurgitates whole damn mess into an aluminum pail
than spend summer crying
summer could have come day
so when look into sun
see if love has seen light yeah
you'll see quiet determination his face
gonna get attention but he's carrying his cross
hung from highest station by his old school tie
panel beaters freshly day glow'd factory cheaters
looked at all friends he'd made
seems there's no body left tennis
it's just nonsense seems''
indian restaurants curry brain
didnt make her baker street ruse
walked down by bathing pond
his long red beard his sister's weird
stole from snow man
will look around blame mess
mister universe
come running up
nose feels an icicle
well was up
not easy us do good trade
get him off mountain
all containing
never care legs air loving
long grass blows evening cool
civilizations raging afar
there powder sweet face paint smile
open windows i'll walk through doors
his eyes lights from laser burn
trains go by
he's watching watching watching him
think about bad old days
remembering mornings shillings spent
but own sake remember times
tell us what blacksmith has done
when he door came off its hinges cork from fizzy wine
if thought they had crucified guess werent there''
oh yeah when jesus came play
other's tapping at car window
did she see warm safety numbers
could have warmed them but moment wasnt right
clearest eyes forever grey
or if they said was fool
had whole damn thing all wrong
dont believe
washed clean by water but nursing its pain

spin round torture before dread
world defiled disgrace
world manacled place
black sun rising time running out

cant hear their blood boiling setting them alight
diamond visions softly breathing fire
when enemy comes he will never heard

living life disguise
all attentions
too much damage has been done
chorus
all alone constantly at war
need come back baby
remembering what have said
have never seen her cry
dont think she's hurt inside
gotta steal kiss
faking sorrow while you're falling

one lifetime mind
such grace so rare find
but how hurt someone love
it's been while since last talk
now it's time tell em
knees praying
living this world aint easy
keeping cool inside
gonna jump tide coming back alive who knows
having peace mind it's long long time ago
thought love alone would break all stone

true love that's what was
catch another smile
seems cant get enough

make no sound start feel
disbelief killed seed
we'll give
dont wanna stop

every woman needs her man
chorus 1

he wore big boots made sound
across land sea
he's different now

not find there
turn dust air
can feel
stumbled while
world fell
she said by winter
was he planning only believers
when god made
when god made
they dont have say thing
or get outta way
if only had heart
feelings going up

behind closed doors
but there's no sense telling
feeling never should
get down knees pray

but if wasnt misfortune
when heart grows cold
never could true
there's shadow another hanging over
way told was wrong

port royal town children are running
couldnt look at
by hand god
so desperately before
got time got money
very small boys talked
childhood lost replaced by fear
world that's just begun
childhood lost replaced by fear
things cost too much
they're afraid what they see
life would depend morning sun
i'd see delight shade morning sun
seemed so glad here
know they what they see
dont steal crown
take hand
dont wanna other people are
dont wanna have work other people do
tought was right
turn eyes from

i've seen what man can do
i've seen what man can do
keep hanging keep hanging
keep hanging keep hanging
keep hanging
but sometimes it's not enough
when you're gone
filling up this universe
when you're gone
how many words do have say hey
that's only thing about
failure moral code
who do think you're talking
at end road
breath held tight inside
at end road
someone knew he was lost
just lock without key
just blood burns
dont mean much
sit against an open wide
he dont need nobody else
overtime 4x
try get right

its never wrong
but do at right time
master plan

how long would last that's price love
go home young offender stay undercover
an angel
search shall remain

path can not take
give changing value
no looking back now we're pushing through
this friend mine would fall apart
i'd often thought he was deranged
then fight breaks out street
just feeling need it's no joke
was urgent myself do believe
oh no i've never met anyone quite before
all jagged edges disappear
want little bit
take skin peel back
let's pick away at


will beside before long
held against forehead
shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
biggest problem way we've been doing things
dont try tell some power can corrupt person
trading god this one
get closer god
through every forest above trees
but watched way too long
was swimming hate now crawl ground
now just this hole it's open wide
come again some other day
was up above
used so big strong
used think was just fading memory
break
just might true
fit perfectly
just how damaged have become
cant turn back
this track
just do what i've been told
sometimes think happy here
little bit comes bleeding through
took make realize
covered hope vaseline
get down make love
make love
fact its too much
wanna cool down
getting little erratic here
nothing worry about
think losing grip but can still make fist
between what i've been trying so hard see
how hard see
burned so bright
color skin
see light
slave screams he's being beat into submission
slave screams but he's glad chained wall
just some flesh caught this big broken machine
no cant take
you're going get what deserve
bridge
he made virus would kill off all swine
awake
we're tied
again
how much i've tried
but remember everything
liar's chair
goes away end
know how this world can beat down
do not want this
would know wouldnt
do not want this
want do something matters
remember sometimes
smell sunshine
chorus
well she knows exactly what cant resist
still caught up another her spells
am purified
give all need know
mr self destruct
give all need know
chorus
carry out sentence
scraping through head 'till dont want sleep anymore
just want something can never have
just fading fucking reminder who used
just stains sheets
drink fountain decay
swore wouldnt change different now just
listened everyone now know everyone was right
when suck off not drop will go waste
bet think this song about
once could see now am blind
i'll heal wounds
thousand throats thousand lungs
chorus

but cant stop what has begun
went took some more
got survivalism
got revisionism
but you'd do same thing circumstance
hey god why are doing this
that's what get
that's what get
know had some second thoughts
can try get away but i've strapped myself
this beginning
face no consequence
may too late as far as can tell
just fuck
feels keeps coming from inside
things well things they tend accumulate
but they start make think things dont wanna know
there are so god damned many them gets hard breath
plastic face forced portray
problems have solutions
fragile
wont let fall apart
where used meet
how can this real
there's nowhere left hide
all one's arent allowed stay
cannot make this feeling go away
why does have this way
when day arrives
going all way down leaving today
come come come you've gotta fill up
dress up this rotten carcass just make look alive
want break

cover ourselves lies
believed could get better

feel violent feel alone
so sat down awhile
losing faith

save our city
dust has finally settled field human clay
stillness so lifeless no spirit soul
say say
say yeah

broken father broken brother
will cherish every one them
hope can give love unselfishly
but time keeps pushing so much
then could still hide down behind wall
eyes stare at dark
said eyes those eyes
yes one who
yes one who
only one who
kept up message inside
think unforgiven this world
tell story
anger's violent
one early morning
just imagined everything's alright
well if just close eyes
have crossed many oceans
just imagine everything's alright
simple living desperate cry
ashes ashes dust dust
take all this pride
what if did what if lied what if avenge what if eye an eye
because answer lies
dont say last prayer
see signs
so what truth now
rest our head
well just heard news today
well dont know if ready
i'll show love
hope he understands
now everything has changed
what makes unclean
from thought might die
what if died
somebody told wrong way
over his shoulder there was freedom
trading places circle
so young but overblown
been so tired throw away surrounding
hope mine eye made soul choir
lean upon
remember callin love
scat lesson
should take from night
coming slow but speeding
reeling now
coming waltzing back moving into head
let tears splash all over
none them along line
all along watchtower
thief he take
still make lemonade taste sunny day
bring hope i'll see soon
hope dont get left behind

she could escape there
it's little intrigues
why pretend
all these insurmountable tasks
itself
all doubts
it's lot life
then this one
know what need
would do all again
led hopelessly astray again
didnt take long before
but fell back down
this isnt party
an instant laughter's gone
joy
secret gardens not so secret anymore
cant stay long here comes reason why
loved loved her
taking ride
never want put feet back down
everything's alright tonight
but can change facts
princess di wearing new dress
stand still stepping shady streets
features fuse shadow's red
saw picture

but when think i've had enough
will give
because practise what preach
wont say again

come back land
taste when kiss
make decisions
let hear crying
man flesh bone
easily elegantly
man flesh bone
couldnt finely hone
brings out thug
reaches so deeply
nothing can stop
just television set
just television set
changing modern times
out our hands
walk blindly
feel love's wheels turning
who take easiest girls
we're twilight's parasites
when delirious fun
are dead night
just take good care world
oh tears weep
love they swore
love will death
they're crooked love thieves
i've read more than hundred books
know it's feeling comes from above
if they could spare few minutes their time
i've never been love before
debt pay tears pain
costs more when you're blame
or we'll have estrange them
rainfall
cleanliness only comes small doses
how suffer sweetest condition
they know better than
how can view become so twisted
about things said
need cleansed
although may flirt
do those feet modern times
told so
if things arent suited
dance dance dance chance
dance pride dance pride
exploding heart
played an american
no sex no consequence no sympathy
no radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
all cutting down size
here stand accused
should see how feels
tranquillity
when squinted
keeps us from stark reality
countless feasts laid at feet
if try walking shoes
before talk any repentance
but before come any conclusions
if try walking shoes
you're so pretty
can go
keeps heart imprisoned
girl
mind will follow
oh need touch
but broken back
never will
if want anything at all
her first boy
she doesnt trust him
let take trip
now let body do moving
all heavens motion
truth side
substitute blindness
fix injustice
where bound
bringing here
desperate beat
god send only true friend
belong here
nothing
nothing
hear stories old
not
saying this
now i've got things do
let's surrender
arent meant confuse
dangerous
know by now
coming home
know was wrong
death becomes
pain ready pain waiting
can feel little love
party living
fused tomorrow
talked war
begging more again
she's picture world
lay here helplessly
cant understand
words are trivial
korea being insincere
tells story all
flexible when boat comes
flexible when boat comes
waiting die
death everywhere
now
now
fools dont run away
so call now tell you're home
can see pain you're frightened
just free love
bring free love
you've got take this moment
let's make clear
can feel desperation
let yourself go
can taste tears falling
playing part
friends if you've lost way
already told once once or twice
when you're born lover
when you're born lover
when you're born lover
discomfort seat
when walls come tumbling
will worth
happiest girl ever knew
happiest girl ever knew
under this roof
let's stay home
body soul come together
inside this house
under this roof
surrender all control
moved moved by higher love
then he sat down looked around
can light up room heart so true
live way
some were born listen some were born play
he'd ruled town thirty years
billy stepped up stage conley whispered go son go
wanna get out this someday town
one these days just might change their minds
loneliness down his heart
when find love you've always wanted
collected stamps since he was 10 years old
ought see him metamorphosize
chorus
calling out around world
can hear an amen
every heartbroken boy every lonely girl
but you're pushin different buttons
it's not too late turn around
i'd rather alone than love just half way
completely
repeat chorus
there's peace wine
knows he tries
there's not much that's sweeter
took baby out bought her ring
made love broad daylight
now faithless love makes willow cry
chorus
there's no path too winding no river too wide
some people need their space
love woman
chorus
mem'ry came stay
know it's just matter
yeah lookinaint' everybody lookin
chorus
dont ask aint going there aint touching
hearts against wind

hearts ever break
hold now hold now

hold now hold now
two lovers stare up at stars
nothin matters this love they're holdin
holdin lovin kissin huggin
nothing matters this love
wont sound anybody else's version love
could go through life together without worry or care
have always heard cant put love into words
that's how feel
but this temper train just ran away too fast
but it's long long way back baby
miss darlin
go little farther anything please girl
go little farther anything please girl

mother holds her miracle birth
sharing moment only lovers can
so if trust enough care
dont even leave one little speck dust
dont even leave one photograph
make sure you've got all
new job going great headed top
but livin way too fast
neither one us was old enough drive car
when meet middle

pick up so can fall again
world began change
blue suede shoes rock ages
still live this old house where were raised
way love should
holding each other close
saturday morning sleeping late
she bought ticket at greyhound station
saved her pay checks bought an old ragtop
she waved good bye looked back smiled
something cool set one up
seems always thirsty
he had freezer full bomb pops
truth or dare kdis our road
even though was out school
he's just fumin she's just steamin
she's whisper all her deepest dreams
they're both walkin their separate ways
they were so love
he's so stubborn she's not budgin
dream real heart beats true
love feelin never knew much about
jack's sittin back pitch black box
if dare individual
2nd chorus
mamma thinks lazy
love so can bet
we're headed silver moon
one way or another gonna cross line
feeling better every mile roll
let hurt take its time
they fill this empty space
if that's way it's gotta
he sees 'em come
he sees 'em go
they must not know what service really means
from island his
how heart stumbled into someone so kissable huggable lovable unbelievable
but every time talk
sometimes careless word just rolls right off tongue
even hearts are this deep might think about an easy way out
we've still got good no matter how bad gets
then tied shoelace read superman
as she talks door her daughter's room
he's as scared as man can
boss man says son you're gonna get fired
cant stop hunger love
all know you're driving wild
gave all gave again
oh give clue what
randy albrightdebi cochran
loved by
it's more than heart can fathom
love this true
if need chase blues
will boxing gloves
showed fingers daddy while he was shavin
some are gonna come go
they're just product time true love
they're just product time true love
could not see past yesterday
no dont expect memory let
didnt dare look up or i'd have drowned
cause make feel every single drop rain
never thought i'd ever really love reality

chorus
but have need too

thought i'd seen everything
thought i'd seen everything baby thought knew
i've been around world seen lot girls
something passed between them

take mountain
i've walked mean streets
as sure as sun keeps rising
will start all over againover again
wont any help
darlin can find right here
could pretend dont already know
this something i've never done
she said not pointing fingers
need hold
believe what's held has freed
need
not day goes by
when lovers cant believe
way ought
imagine love lasts forever
imagine all world see
would have been ready
sailed away just
week or two
long long string pearls
vow head each night roll up sleeves
am over line
not only one hungry eyes
am way out touch
when step gas gas gas
weekend hanging out best friends
i've tasted her kisses sweet as wine
life but
tony martinvan stephensonreese wilson
dont ever trust what government say
parking lot preaching truth
it's all interpretation
stronger than daddy's faith
work out own salvation
used brush mind tender thoughts
but wind guess just moved
skip ewingtim johnson
shuffle around
when diamonds turn teardrops
cant take anymore
dont want just another heart hand
tears were never cried
never ends if right
there are more than angels watching over
but friday rolls stone away
daddy says listen
oh there's no escape
it's stuff stuff spreading weeds
parading 'round caravans
help off back found it's so futile attack so what else got wont tell truth until you're caught i'll room you'll comin soon i'll gone all day grab that's way wish could pretend but you'll fire one off at again revenge now dont seem you're little sweet room
alone
now wont tell
re tell story
buckle when judge clutches
teeth scrape last remaining fossil
bulbs passion
cant get wrong
even stand
love but can barely even stand

what will do
will sleep at night
when sleep at night
only memories remain
started find way
without truth
friday evening
this feeling inside
i'll break free miracle
then came shot out night
as their bodies lie still
no longer torn two
open eyes nicholas
spend vision
sleep devil then must pay
getting as good as gave
gates babylon
gates sweet hell
taste one's wealth
one last time
are these her memories
his words cannot hear
fearing family ties legalies compromise
only fall back line
father's benediction as his hopeful son departs
tonight only consolation causing him fight

see lights go down
chain undone
love slowly stripped away
music lyrics by john petrucci
starting feel
eleven every night
didnt mean no good
said i've been crying
6th degree six degrees inner turbulence 4204
this she knows true
he'll standing by
perfect girl
she will fall out sky
she enjoyed race
seeing shadows light day
seeing shadows light day
burning night
honestly think maybe
random urine testing
put all this work waste
are lonely without mommy's love
want know i'd die one more moment
but never cared much held
his solitary shell
fearful sad most time
his solitary shell
still it's hard just get by
she dresses black everyday
lapse perception
keeps us from saving those love
answers inside
want know now
garden where seeds were spilled
are sanctified judgment
at drop dime
nicholas
i've arrived vlinding sunshine beaming through
her eyes sense story never told
feeling going out head
i'd break through other side
today am searching
but dont mind hope find truth
dreams are shaking
he's had awhile hink over
he stands before window
but had given all than could take
take away pain
staring at message their faces
not frightened anymore
was standing by edge water
there's nothing left hide
i've seen mistakes
craft new challenges eyes
close eyes
supression he feels must turn hope
let senses fall away
why i've felt this way
tears fall from eyes
truth
cunning baffling powerful
can no longer take
desperate attempt
life here glass prison
distant oasis before
save drowning hopeless own
sorrow burn
this new odyssey
dug hole but cant bury sole
door wouldnt open replaced but this
key willingness
promise lies ahead
poised conflict at ground zero
industries death
justified taking
treatment disease
poised conflict at ground zero
harvesting existence
faced against each other

music by dream theater lyrics by mike portnoy
city's cold blood calls home
it's calling back home
living their other life
help he's brother but love her
cant keep away from her touch
dead night
animation
mirror falls behind
not intending end
immune openness
turn off mind
can find all need eyes
daily dose emptyv
calculated formulated
now they're dead buried yeah
some real thoughts
no energy anger
so find kindness
way heart beats makes all difference
new solutions found
another chance lift life
learning live
though weak cant believe
as far as can throw
mother mary quite contrary
she comes apparently fill void
can tell stepfather said so
she can turn drop water
he takes few steps away
she listens openly
would sit talk
light fuse get away
feelings betrayal incidents
an attention addiction
dangerous heart
dangerous heart
swept away tide
sometimes castles air
crown thorns at side
then sewn upon our sleeves
crucify our instincts
through holes hands
lease their lives has been spent
transcending mystic worlds time
lessons now learned
see same old faces
images dream theater words petrucci
there's no more freedom
somewhere scene from memory
there must third last dance
lyrics by john petrucci
how can bite hand feeds strangers all around
turn from thief beggar
turn from surreal seclusion
have been
out old useless
living out constant deja vu
what they want from aint gotta clue
lies ten feet tall
temptation
hypocrite
what're doing film falling love
film damage
reflections reality
it's time make amends
eyes tried hold their place
locked behind door
as last step fell
ones who help set sun
lways moment too late
behind stained glass
tonight awake
winds silence
but if they have suffer
anything certain life
after we're gone
what know true
because am no longer here
finally feel
hypnotherapist
sacrificed without fight
saw writing her stone
wept just baby
grieve her say goodbye
all you've ever heard
reaching
cant see it's only time
hearts combined can only climb
always beside
beneath blackened summer sky
bear this honor name
look straight ahead through blackness
wish past
reach within
spider window
so i'll just wait inside head
thought disorder
voices protecting
only love worth having only revolution
this not reality
swear skin inside out
withdrawn introverted
heard speak but never listened
images words moore
she stares at ceiling
or up smoke from fire
lines are extra lyrics
wanted dead or alive yah this song sucks
wanted yah dead or alive
yeah bet got something else back
wanted wanted dead or alive dead or alive
oh man it's over already we'll miss we'd
when think about winter
cause things are gonna change so fast
say again you're starting lose
it's all about not
it's all about not
but not blind
something's been sent here
there are no prisons our kingdom
magic's heart
should have stayed farm
back howling old owl woods
mongrels who aint got penny
studio demo from 1988 charlie dominici vocals
prayer hope weary world rejoices
sweet hymns joy grateful chorus raise
alternate ending acoustic dreams cd
oh night when christ was born
remembered sacrifice but
motionless by stiffening cold
walking amidst frightening still
iv thorns
i've stopped killing hand
what have learned

mind body will soul
kicking stones down road hell now
close eyes chance better view
do see sitting here

28 years straight hell

pride inside honor inside respect inside inside go
every time see inside see myself within ohh let fade away

broken by one sided compromise come

deep inside you've got all wrong now
sitting back sissy bar
looked into mirror last night
kneel down bow princess
now its time

airplane flyin up sky
'cause every day here
if could just remember what was
all day's work

but love few things
nevertheless

heavens awaiting those who dare
baby genius

there's no water well
or this some bad dream
suckin fumes under highway pass

thinking 'bout good times
meaning need someone
chewed up then spat out

but love

fitting misfitts
while world passes by
everyone trying bum out
if they step tonight

fresh feeling
so pure so free
giving all can give
two times thought heard someone
got up opened up door
looking simple life
that's coursing through
dont know if stores will all closed
dont know if can stand stay here
just lay down you're gonna die
driving down highway through perfect sunny dream
scrabby wounds never heal
thinking about days hanging out behind school
royal families dont have time
he doesnt have thing say
hey walkie talkie
sometimes feels made eggshell
this birthday cake may last
she doesnt want play game
venus de milo grew an arm
hello cruel world
but she's dream
this life you've got yourself
but it's her i'll miss end
cause say must
marie run
what's flaming ball sky
symphonic despair
wearing jesus's new snowshoes
it's really more than can say
climbing up this tower
there's no place can go
would enough say
then can die
keep tickin you're not lickin
watch day disintegrate
dont care if cold
caught every episode tv today
stink
another night another day
spray painted dead firewood
if think what happens next
dont care where bus stops
seen lot been through too much
people cheat people lie
go bed real early
it's better stay home
learning how say hello
it's not all good it's not all bad
difference between two
think im brink
when grow up ill
put down all over town
trying find new ways
thinking they'd better off
oh i'll go
think it's time make getaway
clear now but was never told
something no beginning has an end
i'll impressed if she does not run screaming
but it's real lasts long long time
knock door means
but would rather take
makes feel
glowing off concrete
day coming when you'll have think
woman driving man sleeping
chorus
woman driving man sleeping x2
devil lover time awaits
dont take any wooden nickels
devil lover time awaits
mama was real good egg
question merely when
admit he's not dumbest angry young nitwit
someday he's gonna show us all bet
well he'd better get out way
one adore

doing best
then she finally gave birth
another tired old gag
never know who might at doorbell
he's got far away vacant look his eyes
they say im mental but im just confused
yes indeed

packing blankets dirty sheets
floating up into sky
i've never known anyone
but then he blew away
i've never found
pray
there must something that's folowing her
dont know how
dont know what we'll do
dont know where we're going
cant stop staring back
now go back whenever tired head hits pillow
how do stand when you've been crushed
feel an old railroad man
things are faster now
just someone who knows he's love
find another love this
but dont care about their rules
but no one's laughing
they dont know what they need fear
world gonna end tomorrow
looking light her head oven
this rotten world's gonna chew up
intrigued by ghostly light divine
why had sing song knew was wrong inside
have no fear now walk across waves abd discover how how so brave
half thought
hear no surge
his whole life could turned upside down
guilt nor shame her child must have home
cant walk away
by any rule he doesnt play
repeat chorus
can remember time life was worth
future lies wide open
chorus
let history way back time
he's longing reality no more abnormality
most certainly wont stand chance pulling through
seabreeze worming through hair
standing face face
so false
blame
cant take anymore
close eyes love will come way
god dont hide look
took step slipped away
make reason out hollow words
miracle about show
light feeling freedom
drops rain are falling down from facesoul sliding
desolated remain
still keep changing our lives stop look listen
each wrong move make we're missing chances
his innocence her child must not influenced
living hell going crazy frenzy frenzy
repeat bridge chorus
cut by faith god
hidden under iron mask
want hear voice
influental called themselves friends gifts they gave some kind trend
dealer always wins
chorus
where does end
his abuse people touches very core
verse
chorus
bridge
music lyrics vocal melody ian parry
feed need let adrenalin flow
secrets kept alive subconscious thoughts awake
old dream fear back
hey hey turn eyes fire fire
which creates them
hear no surge
music henk van der laars dirk bruinenberg
his own portrayal proud example others
once they're no importance
could hear churchbells ring hear laughter
shocked her system from within so she lies staring at images inside
locked away he hopes find peace mind
no more day just tomorrow
close door take key try throw away far far away
enemy's coming take away
dont recall memories hard focus hard please
knowledge guilt all possess strength mind now confess
suppression wont bother suppression wont show little concern
it's bad you're stuck stupidity
lies scream it's overover
chorus
sleep cures fear
lyrics vocal melody ian parry
verse
chorus
behind shadows behind fingers
one them
ghost from dark
lies are his eyes
grey shadows black mirror
this last place way
when see moon last time
alone pain
wizard indeed
strange eyes
finish what you've already started one day you'll blessed
hidden bloody hands
wait hidden sign ugly jewel
verse
pressure lay her shoulders
hide tears
believing life will bring him strength
her husband took his own life
verse
you've been left face guilt alone
dont analyze come terms
nor does see reality an existance an endless masquerade
lay alone wrapped chains lost visions
where are projecting grief
she's daddies girl he loves her so he'd touch her
pretty thing he made desert
but gonna split us back two
both can just fade black
disappoint people raking world
shine baby 'cause it's raining heart
it's just fond farewell friend
vomiting kitchen sink
cold comfort between
fond farewell friend
though beyond belief
though beyond belief
know know know know know
know know know know know
walk down alameda looking at cracks sidewalk
but fix
if you're alone must wants apart
say dont want anyone around
but all say dont want anyone around
saw make up running down
they paint out straight silhouette
black eyes always watch clock
she probably wont say you're wrong
her hand arm
so let's go out
ready go
fell down here lay beside
picking up ticket shows there's money made
forever poison arms around
water pouring from her eyes
wont happy 'til bottle's broken
revolver's been turned over
someone half as smart you'd work art
all spit spite you're up all night down every day
drink up baby stay up all night
really made her sad
that's fame
let's just forget all about
everybody's gone at last
couldnt figure out what made so unhappy
oh well okay
say it's just kicks
see nothing wrong
hey hey hey hey
so sick tired all these pictures
they say god makes problems
never meant hurt
placeholder till take up mine
placeholder come take up mine
keeps away from
dead imagination while you're some other man
haleluja
waved away
feel pretty pretty enough
felt so ugly before
now they're gonna go say words
they draw curtain
drug water
sat down jail this friend mine
there's riot coming
hallucinating
want hurt him
people were shouting pushing saying
it's just everyone's interest stronger than mine
when they call lover's moon
i'd around morning after
damaged bad at best
keep memory down
if see at all

if see at all
just didnt care
using all strength keep world at an arm's length
have help patch things up
seen how things are hard
when was was momentarily proud
going sleep now going back find square one
so if seem little out sorry
dragged down into lowercase
can do everything man does except better
you're first timer blaming everybody else

since i've seen fallen smile
it's just not much different from own affair
three weeks ago were all grace charm
yeah well how am supposed feel
live up head
someone's way
he waved hello silent mime
return this abandoned place
was off some empty day dream
he walked over her before
if wasnt such zero

place where suffering just game
but its alright
cause its alright

down downstairs man

keeping company this disaster
blow through coals
keeping company this disaster

stuck inside imagination
mighty mother her hundred arms
every thought ricochet
leave alone 'cos know dont belong
concrete hands picked up telephone ring
strip wet concrete
you're just fine
dont need help anymore
keeping hold what just let go

swept away against grain there's common consensus
all fantastic images they only are apparent
sun climbs up razon
when fighting starts who will

grave allegiances
content upon rail pain just little rain
everything dearly missed blood relations bricks
we'll try as cry our brothers pass us by
american dream's gonna swallow whole it's bursting at seam

frozen amoral giant gazing heavenward forever

sweetest lemonade darkest game arcade
just fatal tie toward other side
light each passing day
we're all part as day rolls
cant include

earth rotates will revolve without constantly
shared others
all does promote fear constrenation
heard him say
haves have nots together at last
happy content cant happen
shut eyes
fortified vitriol strife
follow future's distant shore
brown orange sky holds its breath
our long sallow faces turn other way
our hearts palpitate anxiously as soon will lay supine
as outwardly deny they have something say
know it's such bitch
search bound fail
cares nothing happiness welfare or fate
so long ago so long agooh set sail
asking how pertains tomorrow

intertwining can become rusted lining deep neglected shell
that's written everywhere
dispose when shot
no surplus can repay
just dont sell short
striking at mental apparitions
when there's no above

eyes look way beyond years
hope lies hidden master's call
this pilgrim lost his way
dont look at no aint one no prodigal son

fantastic panic showed his eyes he shrugged when asked
it4s been around long long time
plunging flight we4re sitting
early man walked away as modern man took control
although world rotates itself only thing twist mind
see world's falling apart at rifts
surprisingly leaders cant make any sense
accept them but they exclude
i've seen lot things five years
when when will try
all those stories dad told
they are just whisper time
broken homes from which they come beer stained dad compliant mom
white trash 2nd generation don crown cleanse nation

crackle mental convolutions tune revolution
prefer big brother he's so gentle understanding
ten billion people all suffering

but as they were scutinized
searching modern day savior from another place
but stealthily land free he's lurking there
it's not there blackboard it's what they dont tell
high speed connections monitored daily by pentagon

what have said reach out hand
but that's alright
broken dreams
no wont mean thing hundred years
could were ignored by every passerby
another lost little boy big old town
tendency hurry
dont move
worthwhile
but said before it's all groove
any son or daughter
all groove
soon we'd say nothing
tried patience
beauty beast
alone
now dont care how look dont care how act
maybe then
alone
alone
free free all see makes free roam
may remain here jungle hunt free people
dont give damn if you're close
yes am nothing
am everything
equation reason being here
perhaps you'll love too
aint sure why
when all said done
we've already won
get myself together
well what day what's breakfast
please wont hear
it's hard believed what can achieved
things hurt just wont go away
if feel weeping
please wont hear
wont rise shine
then all sins they came
their investment should do well
when will all done
music brendan hill chan kinchla
where it's ripe can pluck
it's survival healthy
business as usual
if can let then free
let deceased
everybody's constitutional
really dont care right now but anyway
it's life he's trying save but anyway
real confusing if not but anyway
lyrics john popper
all aboard
where used grow up
now know guys have here around boston
so here go
shoot everybody mutt this side town
or even short surly
or or or or

while uncle rolls his joints his fifty dollar bill
hail mountain climber busy at task
when all harmony can such lonely place
whoever she now whoever she'll become
gonna ride
no matter how hard
crash
hope some day can befriend
when moment tends savor
please please wont take away

lyrics john popper
yeah they're fallible
was never intent
that's centered hand
hate what see
well perhaps wont apply
expose as many lies
girl across way
takes thousand his best spies
one day she quit flapping her arms at last
takes strength samsons hair
she works nasa exploring space
takes thousand his best spies
perhaps time could surpass coy facade vast indifference
when she looks away tap feet
momentary soaring an eagle would
can almost hear speak words as gain resolve
smile at her say
know move so beautifully
come dance felicia
want dance come dance felicia
fix upon
spread wings simply
frightening fall has become friend
soar through heaven
flyfree
gives reason go get more
hope wont mind if control fate
take look out back door
turn damnation into chapter ten
gina gina
there was rock'nroll queen
dont cry
so why should bother rise fall
someday we'll go outside drive
know think need prison
music brendan hill
'cause it's great big world calling take ride

music lyrics john popper
aint tellin no lie
what made pan refuse grow
what you're doing this mtv not free
only then shall abide this tide
that's really all this was
coupled things i've told
from likes peter pan
yeah we're shark infested waters
gonna ride off sunrise
dream can as one
imagine all people living life peace hoo
hope will join us
dont try play catch if can
but keep hearing voices singing comes change
aint out die boy
might just prefer pray
but keep hearing voices singing comes change
if realize wildest dreams can hurt
if think i've given up you're crazy
just wait
hope cannot stop at hoping
just wait
carelessly matches play
sing song sixty pence
who'd stupid enough say doesnt have way
who am say dont understand
it's part dream leaves wanting darkness
know end were waiting other side
dreamed about last night
about what want or what get
but more important should know
you'll have dig beneath ground
buyer beware
or have lost enough
you're gonna have look around
'cause wouldnt first fall love greed
saw how some was real some was lies
'cause wouldnt first fall love greed
love life our first night together
she said
know she realized she must learn
love life arms were never shy
oh yes she realized once so did
take little trip
by passed along pay back
as make way
as lungs will allow
but so dont feel so lonely
if it's sing
music lyrics john popper
please understand hear what saying
all eyes upon no net below
as she turns from walks away
doesnt seem most precarious
factory wails make mountain time
keep all inside dont show how much she rocked ya
guess from now i'll careful what share
can feel same
so much so fast
said mulling mulling
or couldnt tell
lyrics r popper john popper
sky much too high
who do think will ease their pain
dont listen them scream
do want live or die
lyrics john popper
if think point driving at absurd
no telling where wind will blow
might notice no one was ever really free
who would conquer spain
poor noble egyptians
life just game play
cause if look around might just feel
ah but could maybe
but now see clearly
from time time he turns around
there's multitude story
please forgive if replace
but now see clearly
it's an old one about little dirt farm girl
came when circus had come town
she was gonna go wherever he went
was when he locked door behind him she'd always been

no one knows what became her
there's price pay
guess
was lucky
last thing he screamed out aloud
couldnt escape memory
but not without certain degree fear
nervous magician waiting wings
what's yours mine fishing's fine
oh sure banner may torn wind's gotten colder
well all right okay
sure fire way speed things up
yes humor tell lies
when all does slow down
hey baby let's keep touch
when all does slow down
oh coffee
why wanna give run around
stripped down frightened child
thinking about his hometown
can make soul want run
dont wanna hear about progress they made
squashed flatpretty gory
dont mean nothing
end
they'll all heal time
answers are getting harder harder
scat solo
again denied beast her hand
cant plainly see
sad how some friendships never ever seem end
all hear their silent prayer
so can establish pain real
know every wisdom has its price
but never conquered
know keeps here earth
know need love
closer now closer now it's all rightit's all right
know that's all am that's all am
no sudden movements
c'mon get twist fate
he draws faster than can see knocks ground
lights are getting dim
then i'll make best guess wont care why
pick up smile put pocket
dreams dreamed at night were never meant come life
someday will find love again will blow mind
lyrics john popper
told her if really love this believe because
sad disfigured child two humps his back
made him clearly understand
soon lack could walk talk hide his humps
takes guiltiest eyes
takes everything have
from time time they meet up sky celebrate
remember hearing story
left lesson
as
pretending they're not guessing
only time there
we're gonna get fed well
each get turn
set sights corner time
or could trust yourself trust others too
can run where wanna run when wanna hide
not into warmer days
am into
when were young walked school
into warmer days
gonna dust off
what day what's breakfast
collectively they compose all see including eye
this along nothing less

paradise was once world wasnt just dream
find no need cringe

through this open world about trouble
she broke leg needed shooting
everybody say you're using voodoo feet walk by themselves
laugh at him behind his back just others do
he's property jesus
got something better
can laugh at salvation can play olympic games
came from wilderness creature void form
try imagining place where it's always safe warm
she walked up so gracefully took crown thorns
one eyed undertaker he blows futile horn
offered up innocence got repaid scorn
white lilies never grow stalks clover
you're trying reshape mould love
god they killed him
he healed lame fed hungry
just holy son man we'll never understand

watch waterfalls pity roar
can seen eyes those call
really sacred

when trembling distant voice unclear
although masters make rules
while some principles baptized
but rather get down hole
propaganda all phony
at pettiness which plays so rough
oh truth i'll tell

cheeks too red rosy face cannonball
oh quickly heal his wounds
oh life jim jones sending
our ship was high upon sea

bird fly high by light moon

well loveliness has wounded
that's how when things disintegrate
left life somewhere back there along line
world's been slaughtered it's such bloody disgrace
drinks are ready dogs are going war
stepped forth from shadows marketplace
she was torn between jupiter apollo
where dog soldiers are reflected
i've moved mountains marked cards
as majestic bells bolts struck shadows sounds
tolling rebel tolling rake
an poet an painter far behind his rightful time
even though clouds's white curtain far off corner flashed
as listened one last time an watched one last look
that's what they did
that's what they did
he bought american dream but put him doubt
he could've been an accountant or tennis star
they took his head turned inside out
which nobody really wanted touch
seein if clothes were dry
then she asked if clothes was still wet
went back house mama met
cant see over other side
found world found world
twenty miles out town cold irons bound
fill new made corn mash never more you'll toil
watch them just filling pale moonlight

some mother's child has gone astray she cant find him anywhere
million faces at feet but all see are dark eyes

they pass by so silently
tweedle dee tweedle dum

i've had too much company
how many paths did he try fail
how many more without any reward
five by five cant stay alive
her fond face pale woe
guarded them as they fell
words her lover had said
go half crazy when she calls name
love ugliest girl world
dont know why love her but just cant stop

who says cant go home
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright its alright
whose searching our pot gold
close eyes picture youre hand mine
where need find reason strong
while old men recite their story lines
they werent looking trouble
wild wild streets
tried make happy
takes away from
somebody there night day
cold night without love
maybe better man
tears us apart
she'll draw crowd then try hide
well she'll tell she's an only child until meet her brothers
yesterday's memory
she wasnt young but still child
nothing else feels right without love
nothing would mean nothing without love
nothing would mean nothing without love
woman love
woman love
barking up tree
looked up screen
give them world
think can
got everything wanted
when seas get rough
but there aint no woman
damage done
school boy's dream act so shy
look so beautiful when cant make up mind
had from hello
had from hello
well you're dancing shadow
but they dont recognize
you're shouting dead
but really put through
if dont know if should stay
wanna make memory
could sing melody
way those way mine
summon motion presence time
wind passion utterly weep
witness yourself here alone yet bold
count shores utter coast
magma here under makes fire seems cold
where river starts roaring roam
an eruption evil takes form
moonlight show mysteries life
stream mortality flows uncontrolled
pendulum upholds carnal deceit
breed grow peak reborn
nature's own artful methodology
which compose water's construction
day's crescendo dusk adorn
genesis torn
utopia found
flame desire
amend course
condone cosmic hibernation
silence was utter sleep was long
softly covered by snow
lightning strikes even deep snow
rise into liquid dream
parade quaternary symbiosis
inherit earth
past present future
incorporation
grew as one elements
turned grey storm shadows
narrow view what are
as questions multiply every solution
lies far from any genuine liberation
seeking detailed explanation
fact stars never sensed his presence
fringos canvas always stir
opening doors closing windows
as razor sharp straw
thread life
yet so completed clear
between dimensions asunder
spilt blood upon existence
revoke reviavl revolt
solar solace within hideous
tracing trails furious tail
climbed behold
at edge horizon
climbed behold
granted as imious impetus
inhaling circulations soul
have walked through fields grievance
conservation solar fuse
reflection souls tear
modest exuberance so intense
boundary bathing blur
recalling thorn so long gone
dream faces everyone
mountains highest hills
fields down there ravine below
wich remain open plains
he beholds kingdom grace savage yet fair
thousand senses virtual faction
as salt sea burns
horizons history re erodent
acknowledged beneath sky
declaring war beneath sky
concealed by essence profane
cries torches swept by
eyes burns by sight
swallowing dimensions
all ways have been
all ways have been
thrice bait dive faith
forever its rage carries
spawning orbs furious light
weaving web solar cast
by mountains which darken day
walked by all men might
have seen chaos every course
where moon comes glaring
am spine reversal nature
seen children cold
at end which found
past shores towards mountain tops
obscure scenery changes
am shown way
