they're not as backwards as they used be'
schooled voice composition

but one thing i've learned from
repeat chorus
back dreamin
honey let's get back
little bitty house little bitty yard
well it's alright little bitty
little bitty plan little bitty dream
they ware little man
people go round but they seldom think
forget about little man
now are lined up concrete strip
about little man
takes more than marble tile
two old people without thing
just an old fashioned story book rhyme
cant shake it's gone too far
said come tell us what's wrong
sounds love's got hold
watchin sun bake
dont know reason
now think
searching lost shaker salt
estee lauder ooh

shouldnt have these feelings
ol tv shows
it's just who am
crazy bout mercury
cruise up down road
she's crazy bout mercury
wrapped wedding ring
then sat down chair
then drunken man cowboy suit took by surprise
smell whiskey air
see stars light up purple sky
'cause cant seem talk god without yelling anymore
left heart as empty
repeat chorus
they never found fingerprints
they all say not guilty
since they committed murder
steel guitars no longer cry
there's been an awful murder
must've had ball last night
'cause this morning hats just little too tight
must've drank away blues
but all signs are showing
there's two kinds lovers two kinds brothers
two kinds babies hold
risked abandonment stood by
wouldve baby stepped into intimate
torturous hindsight if knew then what know now
dont believe capital punishment
no hurry could wait forever
born bellies yearn cord
have relented
dispel our archaic reputation
surprised still love music just as much
after year this one
surprised we're all not weeping drunks
say how appropriate
all really want deliverance
am humbled by his humble nature
did think about bills ex deadlines
all really want some comfort
soon realized
put heart shelf forever
whoand when think time med
it's something could never have planned
are still mad gave ultimatums
course are
only potential
pursuit nirvana
completely absolve
their own essence
completely absolve
several hours several ways i'll feast scraps thrown from
cringe at thought living under same roof as god everything
but not screamin or cryin
empty
keep pushin shovin
lay awake alone bed
give love know can
every day you're always mind
because cant not
because cant not
because cant not
know there's reason you're forcing smile
'cause you've been crying too long
but change never waste it's never waste time
look horizon
am citizen planet
come alive get giddy am taken globally naturalized
now post demise at hand
but was sadly mistaken
thought we'd have children together
thought we'd adventurous togheter
but are strangers each other
estranged from mother
they're happy we're climbing over each other
sister blister fight please brothers
feel joined by only gender
such pity disavow each other how far we've come
may not hugely anti men
deadlines meetings contracts all breached
want naked running through streets
want naked running through streets
luminous more so than most anyone
let's discuss things confidence
one forgotten birthday all but cooked
hand pulling away devastated
helping myself not even considering
no one's been crueller than i've been
no one's been crueller than i've been
ignoring highest voices
treating worse than would anybody else
i'll cater hang every word
i'll opinion less silent
i'll prettiest appendage ever lose herself
thought
crosses cross hung
still falling
storm slipped away
minutes hours
think this
nuclear bombs if they're hit
love still

diatribes clouded sun
keeping vibe down
how bout getting off these antibiotics
how bout not blaming everything

how can just throw words around grieve heal mourn
she was only responsive drink he was only responsive by photo
are wise are warm are courageous are big
until out his false story
until out his false story

but something cant control
world does not recognize women are victimized

how i've spun wheels carts before horse
any hot blooded woman

all barriers blown away
said please talk
memories stir
have fears
cry until laugh
so doesnt own

looking down empty streets all she can see
wait until darkness
dreaming mercy

romance out fashion

when learn divide
you're not one us
every morning out at dawn dwarfs tramps
no it's not easy making real friends
seduced by noise bright things glisten
yes hear calling
need perspective 'cos facing wall
treat dirt but dont want blame
used an industrial giant
am standing up at water's edge dream
there no blood around see no sign pain
just let red rain splash
it's so hard lay down all this
red rain coming down
red rain

down wheel double
things dont run way planned them
empty mind find hard cope
as drove into sun
you'll have take just way find
anything at all
got no memory anything at all
was only one hour ago
still loving what's gone
they say life carries
life carries
grieve
wanting contact
wanting contact
please
come back place are
see doorway thousand churches
so much wasted this moment keeps slipping away
am complete
heat see eyes
they'll give lift i've been running adrift so easy
better cover yellow liver
feel going away this time going away
touch smell all pretty dresses wear
then beast
ride
sweet little princess
he's gonna just best friend
he's living he sleeps bed
dont have afraid
jump water c'mon baby get wet get wet get wet
living way beyond ways means living
it's only common sense
leading underground
lay hands
if only could touch guess you'd alarmed
so know how people are
love loved x2
this emptiness fear
this time believe
but cannot face cost
cover when run
know about
cover when sleep
shock watch monkey get hurt monkey
this place can reassure
when all things beautiful bright
know that's
lost time lost place
reaching into deepest shade
sky blue
crying out from heart
could have big dipper
open up fruitcage
sledge sledge sledgehammer
you've been coming through
it's what we're doing doing
dont get wrong i'll strong
get cold get hot
darlin we've got trust something
standing stretching every nerve
open doors would soon shut
back home
i'll tell them what smile face meant
give steam
know sinner from saint
stand back
know ladder from snake
room shake earthquake
this steam
aah coming alive x2
all did said
want clear
can get so scared
cant help but listen
one girl at bar
'til red light says 'on air'
more know show will scored
'my lover stole girlfriend'
dysfunctional excess
no man sea
where people say things they really mean
curves are still upon hinge
desires form subtle whispers
who loves day but lives another
all doors are shut
high up red rock
rhythm inside
spit into out hands
smash watch
excellent birds
sitting by window
can see now
see pictures people
pray snow goes bad if settles
gonna have some fun
walk through fire
darkness heavy shoulder
while building crashes
walk down below walk down below
hold hold
talking room it's not surprise
hold have gambled own life
will do what can do
thought could get along
let waters reach she reached tonight
river oh river river running deep
do what we're told
god trust
she comes out white shadow
close eyes wish were
brett bathtub
his three coned cap
wendy's windowsill
he carries martini
softly sing sweet songs
softly sing sweet songs
perhaps you'll receive invitations tea
they hang emotions they bottle inside
you'd bring home groceries
she's bitchin again
sick tired childish behavior
she's bitchin again
when hand was holding hers
see them through crystal haze
time once again bouncing round room cont
then this one
there's no one care meet
performs daily functions
before slip into night
dust arose clogged nose
septic maidens gargoyle tooth
caused mighty stir
turned blade back bitch
cushion convector pitcher nectar
confuse what can ending
all vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
rush never waste day
now convinced whole day long
checkin 'em out
lot ghosts lot houses
will find city
i've got figured out
find yourself city live
realized love
get little bit
will reap what sow
digging dime
ufo
scent mule better watch out where go
she said come over some lemonade
grass has been greater
home free
dont care about anyone except myself
buy myself some presents
glance always darting when stroll avenue
till once again bask morning stillness love so
found voice brings knees
ooh ooh cymbals are grand
saxophones cymbals 2x
sky balls sax scraper
converse ed drive jill
laugh laughing fall apart
face between hands
plunge below water line
yanked tunic dangled stash
control smilers cant bought
fact surrounding
much ado all see
cant talk talk
nothing's ever soaking through
here but dont want live
out will stay here alone without
someone else made
empty
center field stands an enormous black rhombus they climb
slander wrap paper ties
tranquil serene until he runs out supplies
look into finance box
cause he runs so fast
rowed upstream find lenore
expanding exponentially some recursive virus
so maybe could fly
he's planning family vacation
hot sand or feet
remembering check sausage
bouncing newborn elf
thank mr miner 5x
you'll left alone oh baby
tell very own
take another place she said
can lift up spin around
source was quite invisible ever present voice
double wants pull down
he headed down new orleans
hey hey
jesus left chicago
what's
think know what havent known yet
came out top by luck draw
dreams once had
dont have crown
emperor emptiness
feet tread upon
fraying bits twine
when near end
but god never listens what say
always give what lack
up from hell answer blew
trampled by lambs pecked by dove
muscles flex mother's ring
melting wax feathers brown
ohbut how i'll never know
it's ocean flowing our veins
feed from bottom feed from top
pantomime mixtures heaven earth
if swimming by
drank little wine
saw where we'd been pictures within
she spent all her money
was really just lucky hunch
move out hollywood
swiss miss girl was disgusted
tryin show her his affection
move out hollywood
this story's getting boring
should've been canceled long ago
should've been canceled long ago
seize her tweezer
uncle ebenezer
wont find moments box
but i'd see through
wasting time

somehow feel forsaken
group loyalists approaching from their lakeside encampment below
empty
leave press 2x
empty
didnt hear what had said
all times raise cup
it's person i've not known
may as well keep belly full
spend weekend no cares
whenever think only makes feel sad
but somehow good intentions just got up git
try find way but there's nothing can say make stop
empty
his lips hurled dollop murk curb
giant smile grew his face
esther knew time had come flee
they'd flutter glide
feeling quite outnumbered esther hid behind
joggers were approaching
sound laughing old man filled her ears
gather around
it's getting hard tell who love hate
you've got nothing lose
isnt nearly fast enough
far away another place
you're racing wind
desperate craving his bones
but just got bottle
so milly took paper did deed
cost nothing was free
as said was free
askin some bills
man beheaded her
level headed boy ya better bend
into deep
suction there one whole day
bound lose
minute i'll free
feel free
she lays bout subway station
if she looks eye
lucy's subway daffodils
crab crab crab shoemouth
cavern shame hall dismay
need resting place 'cause
trapped time dont know what do
he reached grab this what he said
empty
broken old man world unkind
bitter blue frozen through
grasps handle clips cable
takes object starts game
you're only true sweet one
oh if you're ever unsatisfied way life's treating
sun came up down
see life's bit cockeyed
wont steal thing again
before they come knockin at door
oh prince caspian
oh prince caspian
mutter farmer truck
bag
threw pot melted wax
would finest nation
dont get caught
revolutions over baby now
as if she were last one she thought i'd betray
drawing quite close top shelf
but from vantage point frowned
they threw locks onto ground
as friends neighbors turn away
have always looked out from behind eyes
nobody lives forever
it's only lifetime
seasons change
love by side
think
think
daddy's gone across ocean
teacher leave those kids alone
all all you're just another brick wall
there's too many home fires burning
not now john
but fits here thisss
or could reusable shows
would'nt maggie pleased
what do do make ends meet
dont accept what's happening
could find we're all alone
no more turning away
god this place bigger than our apartment
skin dying man
tight as tourniquet
or contemplate silent freeway
what do do make ends meet
no hint no word her honour defend
binds life life
binds life life
make their stand
what way spend evening
she would very much go out show
open door an empty room
playing game
she sees through anyway
button lip dont let shield slip
behind petrified eyes
would zig zag our way
make change mind
flames are all long gone
there's nothing can say
river green sliding unseen beneath trees
river green sliding unseen beneath trees
river green sliding unseen beneath trees
laughing as passes through endless summer making sea
laughing as passes through endless summer making sea
laughing as passes through endless summer making sea
heavy hung canopy blue
memories come rushing up meet now
touch silk lapel
never hear their standard issue kicking door
gunner sleeps tonight
exposing every weakness
band just fantastic really what think
if all pull together as team
dresden at angels one five
danced sang street
standing aisle
hey
worms ate into his brain
dont tell there's no hope at all
leaving myriad small creatures trying tie us ground
at higher altitude flag unfurled
friends surrounded
while light tears wept child
she bound drag down
cant much fun them
stood bird his hat straw everywhere
he stood field where barley grows
but now he's resigned his fate
away soul
show must go
dragging behind silent reproach
was caught red handed showing feelings
let him get away murder
should've talked more often than did
worm honour let take him home
all years judging have never heard before
empty
racing around come up behind again
it's good warm bones beside fire
confirm suspicions
moment when brakes lock
feelings few
forward he cried from rear
poster bearer cried
old man died
covered them up latest cut
i've been looking all over place place
turquoise waistcoat quite out sight
all lot what got
remember how she said
sitting bunker
waiting weed out weaklings
would send our colored cousins
inside out
nervous system all awry
just give time then speak name
welcome son welcome machine
he always ate steak bar he loved drive his jaguar
what do want from
can drift can dream even walk water
where waves hunger roar
contract diseases
race rats
shall buy new guitar
send flowers by phone
store up leisure
enemy tanks while
found one day
they were all left behind
generals gave thanks
form scroll
no one survived
blue skies from pain
we're just two lost souls swimming fish bowl year after year
let from cold
million mile from home you're own
now man inside looking out
man who ran child who cried
he's just same as all rest
am just new boy
ooo need dirty woman
do remember how used
by cold religious were taken hand
daddy whatcha leave behind
action brings good fortune
movement accomplished six stages
look mummy there's an airplane up sky
empty
so afraid mistakes made
please pick up camera use again
melted hearts now now now time time
never ever will they
got electric light
got nicotine stains fingers
got fading roots
blam blam pointers point pointers

no they aint working oh they arent working at all
empty
those are hash bars
know baby you'd dig most but know what funniest thing about europe
dont mean paper cup either they give glass beer
they call royale cheese
empty
she she used live his brother
first time leaves its trace then slides into second place
hours turn into days but still feels morning
at night they try fly hold tight close their eyes
can take them off if makes feel better
whilst looking at pictures
so roll soundtrack dim lights 'cos not going home tonight
breathe breathe out
rest life
god god why did he go away
he must forget face forever
now moon high sky
shalesmoor wombwell catcliffe brincliffe attercliffe ecclesall

carpet's screaming her soul darkness wants eat her whole
didnt think were gonna make
that's all wanna do
yeah jesus
cant see need too

thought our disintegration killing
candle's burned hole floor
raindrops taste tears
it's another rainy night without
another rainy night another rainy night without
anytime that's allmy sweet addiction pray will never end
michael wilton geoff tate
so we've let this happen all along
our system awaits test
all life behind
dont want an island
i've seen world through bitter stare but dream still alive
back street hoop star you've got good
time some blue sky
beholding light spell you're under
but night will reflect hunger
time moves out phase everything face
they told run but just how far
look face neon light
cant hear screaming
through streets screaming
time can change thing or two
youre begging brand new start trying
say son lets forget past
head hear song million voices strong
mesmerized by waves smile
save success our hunger need feed
peace wont last forever
treading borders sin
by pain bring
they must feel
she'll come take away
soul slipped away
dreams dying fill head
you're fading away no no no
it's ok it's just dream had
today felt something so strong took breath away
it's ok it's just dream had
down new orleans river's boiling
burning coal
resistance through din one voice should hear
resistance listen call wild
it's just power mad town
revolution calling
begging cash
gotta make million doesnt matter who dies
but now i've seen payoffs
hey are okay better luck another day this path some werent meant follow
lyrics by geoff tate chris degarmo
awaiting this grand transition
still standing here
maybe one day oh i'll meet we'll
forming figures fast behind
you'll stand atop gate
late save dream that's growing cold
dont see life's game
are one are children light
realize fate must hide its face
so take hold flame
so take hold flame
send waves devotion over take all give back give back again
now im falling falling inside
watching watching
breaking inside out promising stay
eyes see only programs give
hush now i'll give all need know pre live dreams
oh father no please dont keep from dreaming
sign times sign times
from those behind scenes yeah they take bribe it's side
so here another chance
will watching over
master illusion
so can go find now cant live way
if cant see what trying say maybe just
until try you'll never see what mean
chains wore were mine dragging towards fate
one step when look down
looking down at what used
think finally understand
think therefore am familiar most
does language define us reality words
roll out new scenery as per suggestion
need strip all away
turn another turn
bent submission
preach new beginning
seven years power
speak pain feel
empty
johns happy man
alter sacrifice
fighting fire empty words
way society
saintly faces hallowed their names she cant recall
faith growing growing tight against seam
precious cross gone made wait so long
hallowed altar burns flesh once more tonight
we're being used fed
blood christ cant heal woundsso deep
it's their training solution
there's no turning back
distant signs darkness way
throw down chains oppression bind
remember there was time when fears
empty
lady wore black
quiet shadowed woman
her mystic power calls
but her love i'll gladly pay
beside window
till sister comes wash sins away
waiting days longer
i'll hide away here law will never find
save this world we'll all stand proud
you'll never get away
wet raving
dont ever trust needle when cries
skin tight leather provides pleasure
forbidden sin relenting
fear as friend walk thin one more time
cold viper stalking night heat
free under night sun
we've had what others might call love
i'll take home
we'll walk shadows
time cry tears now cry
he's leaning back against wall
oh theyve taken all have but just need whats left today can wash all away
here comes rain
suck up buck up fuck up
game us them play
goes this insanity
upside down inside out upside down inside out
what do
watching time tick tick away
jet city woman
eyes rain rain down
are smiling or afraid
theyre only illusions anyway
aint no sacred idol or saint pretending
never was smart kid never knew good thing
you're just memory now all ones before but pain i've had suffer
worst being alone
when first met must have seemed million miles away
please leave alone this day
please leave alone this day
meditation high above
now who will come
im gone
maybe well see
so turn gaze another place
reach new horizon setting sights circuit scream
gathered from winter air warms childrens eyes
beware night all know he's loose again
nightrider sails away
oh god beware night
turn around
into code wide eyes watch
forgotten lost memory
oh cant see lies front
feel lost time you've got no words rhyme
one life one prayer one love share

another message cant read
i've lost way
supplicate myself into hands
hold peace
quit smothering

just as drinks arrive
before night owl

jigsaws falling into place
jigsaws falling into place
just no one else
that's what really hurts
do yourself yourself yourself

minute there lost myself lost myself
slipped away
too hard brakes again
they wont ever take alive
wrap up back trunk
want know
look into eyes
so knives out
houses live houses speak
if take there you'll get relief
too powerful
let down hanging around
crushed bug ground
am going grow wings
dont jump
save yourself pain
you'll never get there
low corporate
changed shape fit end just feel sick
no swear swear swear
drunken confessions
love

cant do this alone
hope choke choke
let's go down waterfall
it's nothing at all
wrecked up all inside
well if stop singing friend
handshake carbon monoxide
no alarms no surprises let out here
empty
no ripcord
empty all pockets
'cause it's time go home
body floating down muddy river
well if stop singing friend
someone standing there
restless body cracks some more
are standing edge
cried out break spell
sorry lost control
tell one thing tell one thing let go
well seems fall out sky come down
dont forget are our son
was always tangled up knots
but no one's looking anyway
we've been stitched up molasses
release
run around around around around around
nobody wants slave
it's not movies
think you're crazy maybe x6
we're too young fall asleep
headshrinkers they want everything
headshrinkers they want everything
headshrinkers they want everything
but now
used photo time magazine
got myxomatosis
they protect listen
if think belong enough
breathe keep breathing
now are one everlasting peace
cant put needle
too scared know reasons why
fake plastic earth
girls eighties
wears her out wears her out
fingers
no real reason
dead from neck up
fit
safer car baby smiling back seat
no killing moths or putting boiling water ants
concerned but powerless
tied stick
coming out

empty
over dead body
tip toeing tying down
she bought from rubber man
but gravity always wins
wears her out wears her out
you're turning into something are not
will one screaming out
no matter how starts
throw keys bowl
ears are burning
when this
when this
he wants loved he wants belong
he steals he bullies anyway he can
let out
walk through walls

there's nothing this world will keep down
even though might even thought try cant
she stands stark naked she beckons bed
dont go you'll only want come back again
playing fields

am trapped this body cant get out
21st century
i've seen coming
when you've got feel bones

easy living easy hold
you're just an angel
dont care if hurts
what hell am doing here
but creep
beautiful world
want perfect soul
she runs runs runs
there are things talk about
why wont quiet down
future's bleak you're so last week
chink armor
all past futures
there was nothing fear nothing doubt
it's just business
yesterday woke up sucking lemon
what tried say
now you've found it's gone
big fish eat little ones
fodder animals
if try best can
get off get off get off case x2
reasonable man
get off case x3
too busy see
too lazy i've been kidding myself so long
opinion which no consequence at all
why dont remember name
rain down rain down
how'd get teeth so pearly
sweet tooth wont go away
carry believing dont exist
can force but will stay stung
why cant forget
how long should
so sad seem tired
she used beautiful once aswell
now know gets nowhere
his skin peeling off
nowhere sit without gun hand
work bleed beg pray
doors rudders big ships
but they are trapdoors
sell house stands
when first bullet was shot
never cared before before before before
all things used see
all past futures
dare not speak his name
lyrics by p wagner
pilgrim's path
restless heart
you're just part statistics
all this borrowed existences
we'll gone nothing will show
all we've been through
wasnt meant so real
as walk streets feel no fear
alive but dead
make trust what am
now night has gone better days come
waiting outburst an instigation bet
kill if you're not blamed no
mass hands press market window
while shackled line
this god's land
appalachia
just noose wound
this new sound
somehow immediately down no reason at all
noone could explain
noone would believe
empty
commin upon stage i'll say ya somethin
rhyme allowed 'cuz cant philabust this
yo got drop logic
aint no fading
always control
death equals silence
mentally spiritually correct
yo got drop drop drop drop logic
music lyrics p wagner
'cause nothing thrills scary deeds
make sheets alive fill space up
when it's dreamtime i'll return
driven back time
it's beautiful world live
way they comb their hair makes want say
time changing season
from ashes we'll build up again
lyrics by p wagner
dont try get rid
between lines
far beyond belief
there's something waiting deep
pistol grip pump lap riskin
pistol grip pump lap at all times 3x
if ever trouble or double best call pals
pistol grip pump lap at all times 3x
guess some people never learn
justice will made
he who gave false witness
music p wagner m schmidt p wagner
power greedpeople shook their fear off
power greed
yes they did but just part
why cant see it's more than just state mind
they will never reach their size
check out what have learned
obey do
dont fear dreams
fact there's such ha difference all
then soul lies free everyone seeand what do
music by p wagner
but leave refuge
play dirty tricks friend
their time has come move
but mind you'll get scared
no matter how hard try cant stop us now
nothing stayed same but there were always renegades
are force another creation
destroy our nations
we're renegades funk
poppin sockin rockin puttin side hip hop
there was time when our music
say dance sucker
he bought rings he owns kin
hey revolver dont mothers make
devils painted wall
devils painted wall
say how far did come
from basement dwellin
roll right
come back rewind one time
we're all calm
sweating away first class hovel
round trip hip grip tourist's madness
birds leave down here they all do same
as leave all behind saddle wind
say goodbye from time time saddle wind
stopping all sleepers from awakening this night
but dress not tannin pure
it's gonna blow head fucker get away
when house falling
needs big kick his map
no fear what do mean security
never ending memory
will our death cellno miracle sight
higher than sky
here something cant understand
cause nothing coming from
said yo it's take cover son or you're assed out
here something cant understand
when havent been where i've been understand where coming from while you're up hill big home
how could just kill man
how could just kill man
look into our torture chambers life isnt worth dime
that's how how teat each other
music p wagner c efthimiadis m schmidt p wagner
so what about little here now
out there feel they're scared about wanting die
am every mother's son
crucified crucified
so stepped back started sprayin niggaz
'cause housin

mc's know who are
'cause housin
relate matter as drop bomb
so sweet defenceless
going down fever
so just relax spirit
started back time when something stole mind
wait sign from this old reality calls
there were these enchanted books pages i've known too well

tell taste
it's eyes
you're just fucking scared
it's eyes
music by p wagner
comes off him then
but when night falls she puts
darkest hour
if was vain will wait another time

running away from emptiness

price war
before scream revenge
this world knows no right they wouldnt see what
pain you've overcome somehow
scaffold awaits
sooner than nature planned
lay down head now you're gonna die
but this battlefield no one wins
get so close near enough fight
probably why forgot about tour can
mind's not free
dont want
risk their life just thrill
frame their gallows meet their death
when life has passed
caught time place
can join little while
what's this jungle noise
every home there's sickening
who will know now what know about
whatever may say
tomorrow's yesterday
ourselves learn
rising high know have try dont give up
how long want stay
action reaction
kick township rebellion
war
johannesburg or south central
shackle their minds when they're bent cross
just shackle minds when you're bent cross
kids street feeling cool they killed neighbour's cat
true face everyone facing lies
true face everyone conscience cant lie
turn page face another day
take time cause something's way
creature drawn into flame
leaving dreams far behind
now where's difference between life tv screen
deadly error
deadly error
restless pain
he grabs at throat
pain will too mush bear
fading hours pleasure pain
fading hours plesure pain

how does feel someone when moment has come

but there's always factor x leads tumbling dice
inner search needs more than words
keep own truth yourself as only light
keep own truth yourself as only light
hot sweet tight
gotta have baby

some those were forces are same bore crosses
those who died are justified wearing badge they're chosen whites
killing name
fuck wont do what tell 8 times spoken becoming shout by 8th time

i'll drop style clearly
so clear lane

they're teachers who taught fight
'cause reality lying mind so now
'cause stumbling it's time say goodbye goodbye

so i'll pack things tonight go
dont want end everyone
lyrics by p wagner
come rest mind arms

before life crept out water mother earth was occupied
before life crept out water

love after death this forever have no regrets
know this only bigger truth
was not see past was see youdont dare
empty
obey or die
no matter what wont true

lies are weapon kills from inside
steel from furnace
pick point tha globe
this aint subliminal
these vultures rob everyone
feelin home
what can do when sadness comes through
just make step costs all will
then start worry everyone around
mind wont let out
time time had slipped away
time time had slipped away

empty
what has happened life
you're defense only appologize
i'll never will end
deep blackest hole
when breaks into mind
when begging stay tonightdeep night
deep night
cannot see no more
just drives desperation
day come true 'bout end world an
there no more use praying
destination day
sinking stone coming through different mental spheres
died without sense
if they'd seen all before they wouldnt suffer this way now
lyrics by p wagner
clods earth hide his whole life
autumn who's got time knows nothing yet
dont fear winter come
when power wrong hand
why life mess no turning back
yeah deep night lost love
faces shine
locked wit out wage ya standin tha drop
project block
hearse
empty
empty
forced fight law order
when money talks they wont hear all cries
years or more
there are echoes evil
then when this fatal moment came
now future's out sight
free from this crying shame
enough enough those who dont know
'cause if stay weak are much better use
if want have tomorrow
believe first step has been made
please dont get wrong
fall it's big money all order this
few make race but all must pay fare
time has passed them by must all pay
speak forked tongue
but just wasted what invested
saw face behind mask
over over again
weird 'cause dont want see
look always right behind
hatred passed passed passed
no one's here catch when fall
escape from pain an existence mundane
settle nothing later
we'll settle nothing later
something's slipped into body while mind has been absent
have slipped someone's shape while his mind has been absent
will cost head dictator
know inside it's true so shame youyou pack
slink away
hour pain
why cant take back
lyrics by p wagner
hunt them till end
she takes sweet revenge hunt them till end
phone was silent no connection
as harvest all fruits come our way
find words when death it's way
something's there that's stronger than our pain
silent victory made see
more than decade
madmen madmen
sister demon mind
sister demon mind
so raise fists
sleep now fire
agents orange
there no other pill take
empty
oh greed oh yes
father's expectations soul soaked spit urine
dont just think just wake serve
since while thought 'bout leaving here
have heard they're tellin tales 'bout
stepping out gonna close door
next time leave no opinions out
never felt this way running blind way
waiting return
dont waste time any longer just start
listen listen what say
dont know where will go
dont know where will go
there was vision lightened up life
there was vision
vanished haze
leave will flow
drown into will sleeper
can make mine if want
ch turn tha radio nah fuck
let 'em hang
well truth addict ioh shit got head
tha program vietnow
well am truth addict oh shit got head
air was as bright as mind
what am leaving behind
i've got visions cant
calling her sleep at nights
they were married lucky times
oh she's heard his infernal voice from vault
covers her his caress
cmon check
boots mad guns
he spit truth
cant ya smell tha smoke tha breeze
but this little brothers watching too
just waiting moon come set free
because moonlight can release from misery
wake when dead
when grow cold cotta put spell
wake when dead
hoover he was body remover
departments police judges feds
whadda got whadda got do wake ya up
who pulled schemes dream
empty
pinpoint potential trouble makers'
he builds his homes
its its built
war within breath
worlds eye captured
everything can change new years day
war within breath
war within breath
remember how you've locked up lies
have shattered all trust
it's daily truth interfere everything
there any race as destructive as are
looking final freedom
welcome other side
keeper light
you've made now you're there
he likes keep what's transient
they are unique this earth
then he's got them all together one by one
music by p wagner c efthimiadis lyrics by p wagner

she once suffocated now through barrel she

lyrics by p wagner
mayday mayday
flying dutchman real
myths legends wind 'round treasure there find
mayday mayday
then they came down
will they come back clear our doubts
woman tomorrow might bite dust
can see face so real
empty
it's dark now dachau screamin from
so goin out heavy sorta mount tai
so now you're pullin moves pullin
indigenous farmers southern mexico
so check out
everything everyone nothing ourselves
all life seems just crazy dream refrain
eyes looked but not see
going back home
here stay
cant go wrong
mouth open but dont wanna hear
wanna all night long
can take home
silhouette lit by candle light
till see fate written there her eyes
let moonlight surround
let darkness surround
future's at bottom tea cup
beard full lice
or pay penalty
cause it's true what they say about familiarity
cause they wanted dead or alive
by spin wheel
can see what need better believe
let dream chaser take away take away
crossing all borders just take their share
looking future
got everything need peaceful time
day after day keep waking up
but dont want say goodbye
what can do
want by side
eyes cant see
so bless come down
then she played was mesmerized
i've been blinded now broken
till kill pain inside
gonna make dead stop
but never learn
red lights mirror
death alley driver
empty
want know gonna break through
been talking
how long can go this way
think gonna explode
got soul sell
gonna raise some hell
said at command yes am
hungry wild she was born night
oh even deadly shades night
she keeps burning burning burning burning down
just turn around walk away
something else cry about
where star far far far
world spins while put his wing together
heat rain wips chains
time standing still
she will still booking down at
lady's starstruck running after refrain 2
everybody laughs

rain comes falling down
version 2 yardbirds' versionsee stars come joining down from skies

oh feel stranded out here

will ever meet again friend
lines inside hand say go 3 times
tells beware no no no
now take all love gave
walk away
without tearin out heart
i'll get mule acre groun

that's when knew nothing had changed
followed their hearts they followed star
2000 years ago as everybody knows
peaceful valleys mountaintops
may every wish you've ever spoken
this prayer
took portrait off living room wall
see face everybody meet
little word oughta mean something
til said youyou made tell truth
we'll all join hands remember this moment
thankful were here 'til this time next yearmay new year blessed good tidings

all asking
all asking return honey
just little bit when get home

empty
rumor has love her too
an ocean sadness o'er which am tossed
so giving up trying
gettin over
but it'll gone soon
oh getting over youi'm gettin over
don king jd martin
when walk into room
oh use play around
from head down toes
dont mind give slow dance or two
there may come time when i'll think more
could stay here forever heart could free
it's something i've tried so hard do
one day i'll come back here i'll knock door
it's driving out mind
maybe i'll start believe
someday swear wont let
confident self assured he liked her attitude
his world revolved around her
love deep inside
dont know why cause such pain
received invitation blues
remember when first said love
fool
oh all time
what she's living
she's just wonderin
where life fair time friend
moment telephone rang

but now know now see
when one you're holding
well dont know
our love each other
or wont let fire start
better mean just what say
empty
life heart

life cant see how
do hold her all night long
think

everytime touch her
or believe when said was fooled
he'll know he's lost watching us leaving
heart has strength tell him goodbye
fallin out love back into life
silence something begins unravel
outskirts new orleans
there stood woman where half gown kid had stood
baby's gonna starve death
here's one chance fancy dont let down
wasnt very long 'til knew exactly

now this world there's lot self righteous hippocrits
lord forgive what do

so sure life wouldnt go without
first many lonely mornings i've got face
empty

love stop making clown out
their commitment each other
they questioned jimmy through night
must hold
penitentiary
coming down courthouse steps
oh god gave something
but amanda her long red hair
forget will not

hot legs are still school
hot legs scratch back
hot legs satin shoes
hot legs you're still school
but there aint any use pretending
'cause aint quite as dumb as seem

got poison lips got amphetamine eyes
always said living was impossible
then he'll turn
crazy nights spilling into days
one can never never tell
first cut deepest
baby know first cut deepest
when come being lucky she's cursed
he needed love all rest
accepted by manhattans elite
another broadway hype
georgie's head hit sidewalk cornerstone
he said 'never wait or hesitate
oh georgie stay dont go away
his mother's tears fell vain
where he quickly settled down
he said he was love said pleased
there ensued fearful fight
but ask who really cares
oh georgie stay dont go away
let's dont worry about future or nothin else
echo alley down below
there's whole world waiting out there
roof listen miracles
echo alley down below
but if you'll only grant right
very thought
you'll never know
how slow moments go
will feel glow just thinking
yes you're lovely never ever change
keep breathless charm
his feet dont touch ground
his attitude has changed he's serene contented
he'll fight tiger fly dove when mans love
when mans love
it's only heart beat away
just close eyes
never knew there was so much love
miss ya baby
let

but thought still lingers
when was man

empty
gotta keep movin positive forward direction
what am doing here

what am doing here
what do do when want get over
what do do
i've got wantless need
what have got i've got everything
not feelin too nice today
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
someday becomes yesterday
human wreckage human wreckage
heard boys talk talk boys
wont try patronize
push out anger blind see as an enemy
take good look wonderin what ya lookin at when ya lookin at
didnt need do
didnt want couldnt get away
sorry still feel this pain inside
i've got do something i've got do now
lookin toward myself all people see
can deal
from short guy dog
well life's gamble just
it's roll dice
beyond sundown life more than just game
i've seen million places branded by lord flies
beyond sundown wouldnt one blame
would give king back his crown
what once ruled show
when you're lost darkness
escape night
asking walls
our fading love tried save but vain
tried harder day by day
forever now
did scream mother but she never came
as sit at grave remember dead
did scream mother but she never came
man hatred man gain
circle pain
lightning strikes when
man must walk alone but tall
i've seen smile
all friends i've lost vain
i've been fool
all friends i've lost vain
afraid touch taken sun
behind success glam glory
someday i'll find way
tomorrow's just
world outside stay
someone stand weather
name recall
another try
rains ground rains world tomorrow
open eyes new aims see
reached sky
dont believe any word say
broken promise finds friend called wine
painted traces run
reason
dont move dont
watching thoughts disappear
nice day an end
smile back there's freedom air
nosferatu times have changed always will
so now you're waiting tomorrow
when silence holy
over mountains where no one seems care
so will there after war
thought dream would last
no cards no aces no truth no liar
no hold line vain
no heart no heartache no fat no diet
those who dare always rule show
lonely road mystery bay
loney road mystery bay
when night over
it's deadly illusion find solution
there were fights damnations
roots hate are small
some conscience fallin
every curtain fallin down
you'll by side wherever may roam
every mile
whoever are without you're small
she only sold what's her jeans
so she bought some silicone
ride long gone heading fall
gods apemen pray
well citizen future now
first come but last go
dream's gone down drain
just one line 40 verse song
aim mind
stay gold when forever's lies come true so
stay gold
suicide smiled took shotgun his mouth
some prefer insane
world beyond light
usus est magister optimus iusticia
experience best teacher justice
so many times i've been searching even though still dont know what looking
this symphony life
keep light from burning skies
it's over now it's over now it's over now
make 'em laugh make 'em cry
world always needs clown
below mighty cliff
he always wore long black coat
he turned heavy drinkin
until someday he lost race
he's tremblin his rage
this end love
come what may
made decision
call drifter faith bound die
some will leave some will fall
just fate goodbye
dont know why leave what gonna see today
dont know who's blame why cheat always will
it's below kidneys territory
truth cannot fake
even though road gettin tough
are very best cause
but cant take our pride
while chances retreat light
dance beat night
pictures destruction
kings but without crowns
sometimes act clowns
this one's dedicated
those who take dreams away
raise glass those who wait
strangers lost silence
so wake up just stop feeding dust
when all water's banned
where broekn candles burn
wheels time will turn forever
every single day
say hello fade
fire flame
now fiction rules proud
only can send our signs
their holy wars should fought just save
change course cant win fight
why dont live
where red waters flow
who told so
who force our freedom's fall
cant make this world better place
why do praise fight
believe someone's soon much too late
believe it's time go
someone's pleasure another one's pain glissando
time liar
destination face face
luther king word race war has got terrifying
freedom only treasure
gotta black gotta white
flames superstition
will call name
gloria gloria destiny
silence night
colours smile
can stand light
i'll never go back silence
watching night fall waiting start
h8 what want
face ground
bounded chained
silent scream only friend
all fun had insania
where rising shaddows ride
down drain
les chiens de la guerre
helmets filled hate
got an iron lion sighin when you're cryin
whenever wish cuts knife
tomorrow i'll gone
times have changed world did turn
well know exactly what youre talking about
empty
but there's one thing cant bought
lucifer want pray
lucifer it's now or zen
then they all went their separate ways
'cause lucifer feels kinda blue kinda blue
dont afraid besides
from hell below other side
less they care about us
'cause need them exist
trust fear until lie
soon too fast at all
took screaming mother's life
man not worth her sin
another price his cold heart breaks
there's sign saying phones rooms
there's cry missing
hate grace
presence too
hate right
hope soul will burn hell
all remains last farewell
most time
will never loose again
hit road it's over when gone
had pretty good life here just plugging into machine day then
ii temples syrinx
work together common sons
let banners unfurled
beautiful
joyously screams out its pain
voice echoed throughout silent temple hall
there's something here as strong as life
cant believe you're saying
just think about average
see still incredible beauty sculptured cities pure
an oracle confronts there
claim home where they belong
dream still head
lifeblood
when these days have passed long ago
beating down multitude
cities full hatred fear lies
natives smile pass along
wreathed smoke lebanon
we'll hit stops along way
feel way would
remember
reaching alien shore
race not definition
sex not definition
take this heart stone
remind us who are
let children rise up before
let children rise up before
empty
there tic toc atomic
pride reduced humble pie
miracles will have their claimers
night turns thin
goddess garden
alter image
secret face touch grace
complicate
wonders world they wrought
build our defenses place safety
way take us out ourselves
future eternal light
or will too weak
between sea sky
cant bring world
moving picture
promise offered east
want look at life
free dungeons innocent
lessons taught but never learned
still dont believe we're fadin
maybe it's too late
dont wanna see
said left out cold
far unlit unknown
shopping malls
cruising action
originally by eddie cochran
what gonna do
cause didnt work lick
he said whoa
he really means
empty
reality withdraws
watch her every move
was standing reef
was talking myself
rising up from surface
somewhere instincts
clouds were suddenly parted
thought time distance
take yourself friend
yes need some advice
noticed emotion had cried
truth
they play same territorial game
what international means
citizens along ride
baby feel disrespected
swear gonna leave
friends keep telling should leave alone
cause when comes love giving way more than
test echo
test echo
test echo
wind up perp walk tv
has him longing depart
call
boy pulls down his baseball cap
big money goes around world
sometimes pushing all buttons
big money make million dreams
it's fool television
well was only kid didnt know enough afraid
looking love
well was only kid gone without backward glance
way big wheel spins
empty
empty
they chase through streets manhattan
their limitless rise
green grey washes
every city's streets
i'd there if could
cant see what true
could have been worse
most beautiful words could ever say
well do
it's hard recognize real thing
so much mind matter spirit gets forgotten about
half world hates
half world thinks
half world cries
half world shares
could disappear into crowd
doesnt seem so much
swear dont listen
lay hand over hand over
tell her plea
just give her message
well say can laugh but can see eyes are glass
wont long before stop play over
people smiling through their tears
at counter store
all around this great big world
who will pay
water takes home
when water takes home
water takes home
pussy get lost treat nigga jump off
say that's
repeat chorus
nothing lasts forever agree
homes many places but brooklyns own
repeat chorus until fade
frozen moment
feel day all uncertainty
i've lost few more hairs
memory lane everywhere
take piece mind
they say we're too young
verse 2
no love real love without baby
olamide wanna love baby repeat 1x
it's got
but if think think
hey baby it's quarter eight
empty
bruised sullen stormclouds
there no lovelier sound
empty
tame trackless waste no virgin land left chaste
another ship arrives
empty
all same take our chances
have become reality
if need too much attention
right where discovery starts
scorn ridicule
carry all those phantoms
shadows road ahead
just an escape artist
there's nothing stop now
aint gon leave cos see drop
back room checkout time aint til noon
just talk this walk this
use too thin win but now chubby
heard lot about aint curious
nastiest nigga since larry flynt
something people
but livin life here givin tears joy
never thought i'd meet man made wanna say do
if should die before wake upwake upwake up
hurts head
truth often bitter
pair dancing shoes
rain burning
must carefully trained
dont swallow anger
dont swallow truth
artificial light
dont swallow pride
surge adrenaline
was only trees wind
empty
believe what feeling
i've got idols icons unspoken holy vows
murray's packed funk need know
you're not equal damn creep
yo got ghetto funk need know
yo here's what i'ma do
lod ppp gets
keith kill beef mad cow disease
local hero global player
world so out touch
handle kid gloves
careless consequence
then learn weapons
5 monsters
same old melody
midway lights
everyone would gather
reminding
no didnt listen again
know
beyond gilded cage
must put aside alienation
are merely players
primitive design
price being free
it's just matter instinct
so keep under lock key
just briefest pause
passion precision
than never have known
macy gray
hey young world
young little girls already have child
you'll see under trouble life brings
seen how old spring turned out
de pen dence words case
chorus fade
as cold as winter skies
behind us will only see our dust
satisfy our wanderlust roam
imagine man where all began
when chain reaction was done
more than they bargained
can forget about heat
more than just simple greed
flashes fades summer sky
empty
step inside nightclub own bitch
same way was bar scene belly
y'all niggaz wanna get down fuck
talk about how this beat got groovin
party bullshit
method man
see god run through block godzilla
y'all really want street now fuck
meth yo tr what's shit
tr not even serious doin this fun cause
empty
but he'd climbing bus
go paint big cities
hold fire
their fire has made alive
mission
ones without
mission
each us world apart
leave room grow
troubled sea
her hands her ears
no matter what they say
city where desperation
everyday people
we're ones who draw line
or slide
face up turn up
turn up
i've got own moral compass steer by
willows wind
tell if choice leaning up or down
only blooms at night
life yours use fame fame
let every breath proclaim glory name
can almost feel current flowing
whirlwind life faith betrayal
can get back
next it's falling
can get back
float fishes
its never ever gonna stop
niggaz worse than shiest merchandise
got drug dealers bug niggas who love killin
cuban link
killin every track link joey crack don
course dont have chance boss emminence
dionne read palm told get put army
make more dramatic quote jehovah holding scroll
cause robbin niggas way before
ooh yeah ooh yeah
yeah oh yeah
look out comin whoa yeah
findin findin way back home
fly by night away from here
find what after
life begins today
those who are broken those who mourn
there's something happening here
think it's time stop hey what's sound
starts when you're always afraid
tough times demand tough talk
attack day birds prey
heat beat lights
dance strings
will choose freewill
each us
night still threat
or caught creature headlights
or surrender reflex
or tempest blind fury
projects some these womenll have diggin
watch niggaz hatin they wanna run
they was brollic brollic brollic uhh
make brollic brollic brollic uhh
lettin y'all know this now
so many different directions
or guiding hand fate
tiny moment truth
dont believe destiny
am
dont identify inside
prison night
fountain lamneth
coldness grips skin
sailed distant lands
maelstrom near
gaze caught held
naked our unity
v bacchus plateau
crimson misty memory
soul grows ever weary
feel heart pounding
key end answer
am crying
some live behind iron gates
somethings can never changed
such lot pain earth
as birds announce dawn
helpless invaders trapped his lair
iii return prince
shadows through sky
straining at invisible chains
turn around walk razor's edge
who lost will fight
whispers morning
whenever reach
are man
feeling cant go
'bout power love
but ready learn
wont get get what after
they want shake hand
when it's bad cry
storm raging course
from two magnetic poles
heart goes out
at speed love
magic music makes morning mood
all this machinery making modern music
concert hall
but oaks cant help their feelings
oaks are just too greedy
truth false logic lost
look up see giant boy
now it's come this
them them others too
hollow speeches mass deception
while shepherds bless count their sheep
glory game power train
those who push us down they might climb
fill them up precious cargo
long enduring kind
spontaneous emotion
some pilgrim
experience slips away
can wait until tide comes around
innocence slips away
today's tom sawyer
catch mystery catch drift
always hopeful yet discontent
exit warrior
doin what always do stack
empty
make choice so start think back
since '87 that's how shit comes
tell feds aint runnin no coke factory
but nigga get paid sellin hop crack
instantly dope dealer stereotype
that's all are
roll spot try ta break hoe
go coast coast smokin indo
we're up y'all this motherfuckin holdin tank hidin snitch ass
tell em tell em tell em
any girl world could have easily known better
more think know about
or african sun
are entertained
empty
reflect upon our own
quantum leap forward
their world fashioned
not as market campaigns
sensitive open strong
each ev'ry day
knees are startin gettin weak
time spiral space curve
just dont get
hide shell let world go hell
it's just erotica hypnotica
keep his nature pure
he's radio receiver
he's not concerned yesterday
he only introduced wider reality
who plays hero's role
when heard she was gone
everybody's buying
hero not handsome actor
without memory or desire
morning says answer yes
dream walk wilderness
willingness risk defeat
greatest act can
went right by
well guess all have these feelings
between these two directions
some them burned our ceilings
it's not place
it's gift giving
rocks cradle
come rest let love bed
empty
talk time without fear
while billion other teachers are teaching them how burn
wheel against rules
here hide heart city
not one sense proportion
if could wave magic wand
temperature's rising
thrill alive
point journey not arrive
point needle moving back forth
turn up light sound
not arrive
jump ground
brilliant red barchetta
adrenaline surge
shoots towards two lanes wide
leave giants stranded at riverside
get dough figadoh
see yo' head cracked bang o see dough
fi ga doh money money figa da doh
rhyme cuz crime pays yep
cherry o bury dough robert de ner io
nigga out here hate niggas wishin he was white
captain save ya baby mother fuck these hoes

i'll just give try wont let good times pass by
ahh yes yes ahh ahh yes
ahh yes yes ahh ahh yes
space between wonder why
holding yesterdays
wheels can cut down
dizzying lifetime

though might have precious little
story makes satisfying case
tobes hades lit by flickering torchlight
by tor snow dog
cause are target are atmosphere
you're so perfect so broken here come arms wide open
top hill

some features own
empty
true profanity
vacant laugh

elemental empathy
oh but how
they called him insane
they cant understand
he held up his riches
mold new reality
sow new mentality
but dont push limits too far
when started traditional roles
pattern moonlight bedroom floor cold fire
love can turn long cold burn
star this unearthly show
cars full spectators pass
air shattered by awesome sound
standin at crossroads tried flag ride
went crossroad babe looked east west
cant stop moving
driver busy freeway
old enough not care too much
danger prepared face
nevermore grace night
or through astral door
headlong into mystery
empty
sought alone rule fate man
can build world wonder
converse among wise
bring love give solace
cities were abandoned
bringing wolves cold starvation
some fought themselves some fought each other
her final flight
have passed into olympus
warriors felt silent cry
they sat while silence
let love truth shine clear sensibility
too much contradiction confusion
what happened our innocence
monitor his station
tropic isle avalon
he's got force field flexible plan
red alert
sometimes drive crazy
red alert
dog's life
dog days
dog years every sad son bitch
as well make our own few circles 'round block
so tight
anywhere but here
angels demons at wa r

driven edge deep dark hole
driven by road somewhere i've never been

dru hill
so friends wont know see now
repeat 1
when talk teeth should rot
one turned out dog out
when angles are right
jewel out reach
stretching out hand
form dream rise
heart cannot feel
do hope or do fear
lovers pause find an open store
river running an open sore
weary land
endless winter night
it's doc way dont then move

their clothes look soooooo good but they act stupid
all youuuu fake frontin motherfuckers

eleven songs endless nights
peace mind sanctuary by loud water's flow
darkness gives way light new way
winners take praise
why are here
well who would hold price
no zodiacs or almanacs
little abstraction
if cards are cold
because we're here
all nerves are naked wires
leaves behind its mark
holds winter light
as surely as mortal pain
captain industry
know same
folks have got make choices
thought might get closer
way
darkness at high noon
gentle hand secret touch heart
if dont start cryin it's because have got no eyes
here within lonely frame
please dont destroy these lands

dress up evening nothing say
burning forever then fades away
tells different tale
each drunken drugstore purchase
so ran away
they bought name
when world has passed by
but do anyway
dont know if am supposed stay
clothes are wet gasoline
empty
money takes some time make spend all too quick
large amount money
no did not forget
doesnt kill it's not one way ticket lonely life

written by tony scalzo
need feel loss
empty
much less remove her from mind
can still recall time were not so far behind
never let 'em see sweat
can place call
through window dimly shines
had few more hours night time before i'd rise
as sleep tonight i'll dream
come along code cant crack
empty
they put alot effort into making feel clown
lyrics music tony scalzo
it's nowhere road
take highway
wheel possibility
was hard find
cant afford go very far
'cause it's raining all time
yeah all right
inside out upside down
when she goes walking by
slow drag you've been messing mind
you're nothing
sonner or later
gonna take time all right
sooner or later repeat
they love tear down
telephone calls
i've been thinking
havent had break twenty years
i've been thinking
when car broke down they started walking
can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
knowing way
mine tell now so dont let last
if not i'll just die
remember way used
you're only one who can see real
empty
why'd have go away
people ask
time beats up
she comes just daydream
stars they shine so bright
turn tv
there are no lies
picked up paper
give muddy muddy water
it's none business
feeling good now
turned tv set
which way top
just time doesnt mean anything
but i'll wide awake
get now while it's happening oh yeah
but wind up so wind up again
gotta seperate unreal from what true
oui je comprends yes understand
quand le vin est tire il faut le boire
c'est un cercle vicieux
empty
believe i'd buy whatever would sell
believe i'd buy whatever would sell
looked out distant horizon
where sleepless mind rests
was killing time
let nothing bleed into nothing
shifting sands
this desire
so will suffer
one guide mind
mislead delusions color real
anarchy divine
can never walk out
going sugarless
how do get into bed sleep
dead wall stone cry out
any kin or family
just see glimpse light
tunnels deep twisting
just see glimpse light
kaleeriorjat silm
tangled maze broken once again
dig up earth spit eye
you've trapped us world sin
listen ear door
if want know
as contemplate silence
keep distance
if want know
when comes down wire
i'll hold every ounce strength within
desolate am tempest raging silently
turn stone
now dreams have surely passed
afraid die
morning desert sun horizon rise above
desert sun reflection water
traject esoteric sisters they are mythical
empty
conquering fear
what was saw last night
each us alone silence
but cant see
here am looking out looking
arms are open heart's closed tight
hide our suspicions
facing fear we're afraid show
under world she'll have us all

passion slave her life gave
his eyes
kings queens pirate giants castle walls
past locked winter filled remorse
these walls are stained engraved pain
empty
pace hallway blindman million
unto hand unto heart
am beyond silent black will back
were born brave cold weather
how much longer can hold
this cold
but circumstance conspired
know we're not children any more
devise divisions delay decisions
let nothing bleed into nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
do think remember
this certain sadness
between
remember nights
listen rain
heart as lie asleep
breathing fire
foul temptress oh she sings seduction
perception lacks clarify
cant accept our differences
parallel lives running parallel
opinion just point view
vultures scavenge subsconsious
walls yielding crops
his seed
yours nor yours mine
speak speak words need hear
when need somewhere run
when need someone turn
if you'll shelter shelter
questions flow too deep words
while all drown tears
when stars are right you're alone
drawing near someone passes through
flame burning center fountain yearning waters
no reflection at all
girl if didnt have plan
tell
girl if was
wasnt qualified babe
if had nothin if had nothin
hook 1
would here if had nothin
straight outta luck
if was ugly
land where no one comes
run shivers up down spine
laughs at spite
father o'reilly found moors
bard banshee
there was common goal
while watch time slip through our hands
begging something work this time
got fantasy
burning up inside this space mine
are stars
cant take
believing all this time too far cross line
empty
journey through witch trials learned
cast their fate moerea sisters
she'll devour children wink
more run
corners mind
thoughts before
swimming strand
empty
but if tired people being bothered baby
let's straighten outusher think it's time straighten out
let's straighten outmonica let's straighten out usher want straighten out baby monica come usher come
hell rusty shackles time burden his mind
forever clock lives so does he
writings so clear wall
he cries river tears clock below
masque false gods mannequin smiles
perpetual ego's
wings fly away what have
as watched shadow disappear
when it's too late
only say goodbye
only say goodbye
only say goodbye
lake bottom was raked
run life he'll take away
he dreams girl he cast from this world
he knows not he's been defied
demon lords wont ride
what's this say who he us
wasnt dreams
deepest sin invision king
tarot death card she held her hand
end last fall
stood at door new beginning
stood at door new beginning
close eyes forget fear
caving
living life still water
living life still water
man born royal blood
nights cold darkened
dawn reflect from blade
his blade will avenge someday
his father reigned supreme
avenge everyone way
there's written page there's book
something save something see
fiction confession
compel beware spell jackyl
virgin snow burnt by torch
as heart begins pound
you've betrayed cursed light
vagabond maelstrom mind
misconception never had affection
lift chains from
am stone now know gave
tearing myself apart
tearing myself apart
feeling way through this wilderness
dry land getting drier
choking life living lies
wondering have said all have say
his mind never rests
replaying thousand regrets
there's shadow us
rain falling
grows this shade gray
rains falling hours crawling
taking us under
through nights never end
writing letters head
stayed up late last night
deep cool
jump into fires hopelessness forever
we've swallowed pills pain
way back may
but now she's not around
really light up
seven days sun
really light up
she looks just beauty queen
crawling knees again
make better
just take pain away
muffled screaming
would kill just same
taste bitter glass
apologies have passed
it's pulling deeper
cat out
tears roll down
wave goodbye love again
so dont try fake
anymore anymore
anymore anymore
tell something new instead
tell something new instead
she said
yeah wish could
cant dance disco

lettin out lettin out lettin out
close eyes drift away some place new
cold has got hold again

cause you're only thrill feed
cause you're only pill take
love's antidote really need
love's antidote need
dont fall back
doesnt matter when dream away
what big mistake
theres got hope
hear cry
empty
feeling too just slipped away
cold as stone no contact known
you're feeling too just slipped away
could anywhere
see yourself standing there
her mind racing she cries
she's death
lost inside dream
it's funny but seems
window pane
twenty eight
rain burns eyes
golden fields will burn eyes
telling world how let down
cause have seen this house under pale blue skies
wanna dream
been letting know
empty
tender arms
tender arms
life tinsel town overthrown relinquished all
wishing summer without rain
then can reach stars
but will wait her arms
tumble fall together crawl
come back come back yeah yeah yeah x3
back home again
find myself going through phases
looking place inside mind
it's easy forget just what you've got
picking up pieces page
feel wall as starts shake
give up when start bleed
hear now desperation
goodbye all feel free heaven tv
i've got hand inside head
feel i've been hit by bus
build fire thaw brain
cause all drowning sorrows became friends
get up shut up
chainsaw cutting through bed
will there if will come
will there if will come
empty
more wait more bleed alive alive
we're waiting changes
we're waiting changes
we're waiting changes
we're just twist seam
different color shade
but guess knew
place shine now can do anyway
as recall never lied it's true
taste piece life suck good
cause we're floating by
wishing sun
clutching at straw
could always fly into coloured sky
so easy forgive
could free
you've gotta live
if you're little late
another day melts feel heat
too late drifting away
will
but missing yesterday
i'll wait i'll wait tonight
tomorrow shines through
dont hesitate cause can free yourself
cant keep painting colours when it's grey
drug keeps feeding
lets feel new high kicking
come together feel heat
do they feel same way
takes us all away someday
wanna here
as stare at trees
going out while
reaching up high into space
empty
it's long way up without ladder
behind face see child
takes back better days summer days everglades june
brain poor brain
drinking myself sleep again insomnia drinking myself sleep again nightnurse pills keep sane
all by myself waking up at 12 clothes again
how come ended up this
cause dont want drag down hold down
you're watching clouds come over
ten feet below ground
two different views
bittersweet sugar life
cut loose crashing
gotta set free
bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu
taste something better
bu bu bu bu lose fear
cos feeling cant go
as emptiness invades
you're reason wake up
nothing real
dragging down
cause this could only day
this could only way
empty
empty
perfect day perfect day perfect day
cut free again watch bleed
cut free again watch bleed
dont see we're skin deep
empty
empty
empty
life
empty
shame pain
touch hand
waiting lights change now reaching cloud come down
cant get out
cant watch drown
here she comes lifting up moon
it's breathing underwater but just cant let go
backs against wall
growin old
drawing circles round sun
empty
children playing at feet
that's it's disease
it's pulling down
we're flowers this vase together
push holes plastic
turn over another day older
cant believe
cant believe
cant believe
know still remember
there's no real solution
gotta pull myself back
different man
an empty heart nowhere turn
comfort sound
she's novacaine ride
taste bitter tears
searching little hope rainbow when rains
get hell out while can going under sinking
we've got keep ourselves afloat going under get out
sittin back only wish
empty
feel so fragile as cry
felt so hard breath stared
alone alone alone
silent night
dove grey sands
facing life alone
lead by devotion
cant hear again
space we're getting better all time
safe we're getting better all time
space we're getting better all time
see wait
cant end another
cause drowning sin
now light comes shining
pure air need
cut away disease
can feel again
lift yourself into better place
losing direction you're losing faith
bury ashes someone
dont ever feel

deep grave
chorus x2

pain has taken over
angel life
empty
change frequency
cant breathe
you're sending love back down
then watching his mother try soothe
seeing seagull spy food
just wish could break shell
staring at paper clouds hills
would
empty
all face
moving around town
pushing up
said could should

so dont give
dont think can help myself
dont think can help myself
polythene girl

pulling under now
you're pushing senses through
what are going do
empty
empty
let's talk about us
china heart will always break
try get high
twists turns
empty

chorus x2
trying get out cause wont change money doesnt mean much him
they try hide their guilt away smile says its okay
tune might hear him
keep feet ground
further up as float
believe believe
constant rearrangement
set free
set free
falling through these clouds silver
crashing onto cotton waterfalls
cause rubberband
twist around feel rubberband
sending all right back
wanna lift myself up sky
they're hoping it's better
i'll shine sun
wanna leave all just while
wanna lift myself above clouds
climbing up free myself
twist turn
do really know
dont need this
love watch crawl
spinning out ferris wheel red
feels home feels home
lying face down floor reaching out something new
burn face storm
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
it's gonna break gonna crack
paralyse oxidise feel us drifting apart
empty
wash stain right off feet
live system walk plank
empty
between now last time met
had had known might have been
22 moment
kid way
15 there's never wish better than this
just dreaming
sing above vision sing above face
every day saturday summer waking morn
lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean

stigmatised holy water 666

trick's been played life's slight hand
filled bags what dont talk about
lost own insides
anything corrosive magnet
if turn lights out
stoppin tomorrow tonight
how many cells must die before you're legally
before see light
till know where am
brain dead this time
junk cultured junkies needs
will there no place hide when storm comes down
this turning point these are crossroads
life movie about
now revive coma
no way save yourself inside
leave this place time erase
as trip through same daily non existing life call hell
resume identity but dont overload
safely assumed not well
teach how cradle now
demon mans face
swastika horrid miscreation camps concentration
empty
pain selfish pleasures conceal
empty
longing new widow
let flesh
i've lost dream
myself
where i've never been
destructive signs
no explanations deviation
whom we're taught fear from day number one
he creates before them illusions broken truce
moment world ash
by rumbling planed metalbeast soon appear
confront master sin
here comes message from antennae
had an accomplice who knew nothing
dial double zero
dial double zero
words can boost words can break
more than world inside mind
now surrounded all by strangers
dreams empty into life
dreaming death sleep again
just very violently killing time
slamming faster just hit ground
tying another big liquid noose
when it's hard hold them down
when water keeps rising
if it's cheaper kill
if dont keep moving
if dont keep moving
know cant tell
ascends from beneath metalshock reveal
empty
if were oh just gone
not an apparition not holy ghost
walks right beside
lies then floor
as move from door door
lies there floor
seeing still not beleiving
i'll turn away from this mess burning
bet never thought you'd see dead no
monster
trouble trouble
natural enemies
introduction into
envoys are delt their hands
bustling nations horde their rotting wheat
torture from hooded nations
tell something what you're trying prove
thermo global fear
turning right feel getting tight
instinct never worked anyway what i've seen just cant say
risk runs high but i've gotta try
pretentious asshole time move aside
honorable brave bark armoured man donning hideous mask
honor even death digrace defied
no sign pain his face
repeat chorus
balance hands life blood seed
now know just who really are
hit myself hard head
i've been waiting around all day
can mother sew have her stitch' this
promise keep her digging deeper
promise keepers nothing cheaper
promise keepers nothing cheaper
dont care what they say
what they all think now
sinking taking everyone down
old lady she dont care
saturday night's night
repeat chorus
slipping through secret maze
intensity hum head
released thru sweat
laughter splits mind nothing way
she has no remorse her merciless bloodbath
repeat refrain
benefit yourself
nothing close what you've done
smoked out peeled back unearthed
pay off emotions made
take rope climb tie at noose
hold under thumb
stabbing by pointed words
what feel right sane
instinct stifled dont afraid
there's lots us around
shoulda woulda coulda sketches all our regrets
but never could fill word said
pictures down well thoughts
now free rat cage
as teeth jaw
selling rock candy suicide
best mans daughter weds wings dragonfly
delivered every day
eyes are black coals
cutting into line again
gone tomorrow here today
empty
empty
handing down anger
forced forget this anguish
tightness suffocates
everybody's watching none them i've ever met
additional tack late charge
slit wristed run over hanged
what way go
make weight run die again
every race run right their lives
numbers mind add up
all fans wont love if dont win
win lose or dead
when it's hands cant feel
when it's heart but cant feel fell
when it's hands cant feel
wears down
ears ring favorite sound
really dont exist
empty
now kill power become partners sin
alone our decision unlock door
alone our decision unlock door
why didnt get call
how soon they're gone away
everything see now
when whole world saw but
everything know past
fade black
am falling feel pain
falling faster no one here
everybody's watching
watching over
still walk
again seemed right
this rhyme picked mind
still walk
standing edge time
standing edge time
same old song different beat
book fear
cheated angels turned away
little people spit down
i'll recognize
instead stay alive
fucked up everyone's life
blacker demise
fucked up everyone's lives
high paid thief office sharpened lies cut throat
get own way were friend
equation stagnation
say you've seen horns tail
hello how are ready tonight
turn go
time show
our children need know what's going our world mess
there's never way stop music
but gonna have turn down
switch back

i've already been heaven
trains change

as long as juice shows up there
so wont buying
if cant get high
dripping humanity exactly what friend should
hypodermics gathered make bed
shooting up shooting down
again arena mine live die
live die
reaper near
cry out desperation iron tears take apart
love lies see iron tears
game love made lies dont see
this time
close eyes hope it's
all gotta do try
fake all stride
all night long dream day
another reason bleed
if get any closer
nothing satisfies but getting close
weight keeping down x2
puzzles suck laughing face
not what seems
ring witching hour
want forget about
can go another round
dream about yourself
stars will all come out
fool
but had no use
someone getting best best best best
life love
getting tired starting again
empty
if can get around
make dizzy running circles head
break right through
we're face face friend
may crazy little frayed around ends
begging ignition
breathe when gone
waiting collide
burn out beyond
never burn again x3
no way you'll silence
dont say what dont need
something borrowed something blue
not fool
you're one bothers
all sick
can hear them say
tossed about ship ocean
didnt pass by
give one last wish give one last wish
when i've had enough
hey let's call even
dont deny dont deny
sliver hope no diamond rings
fade away time oh
bring some alcohol
never coming back
promise not say another word
oh maybe maybe maybe can share
can change can change can change
oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened know
cant meet somewhere
just keep stairing at sun

no sweat yeah wow right
faded
colors start run
our ending had begun
cause gotta move
got talk talk talk talk
something i've found
this last song this last song
pretend all away

before feeling fades
you're not one
someone's always someone's one
but you're only one
save up one more try
you're not one
who could make
keep dark
done pleading ignorance
what if say not others

face have face
keep dark
what if say not others
you're pretender
even all ever wanting had problem
call magic marker
ritalin easy
put them walked away
lie around beat head
then follows back home
hang stars upon tonight
sick uninspired by diamonds fire
wont go getting tired
another one returned i'll never use
burning flame inside
not getting tired

this just desire or truth
can liar
not getting tired
voice forever heart
it's true two us
stay there soft blue virginia moon i'll wait tonight
will say goodnight

when there's nothing left use
when there's no one left use everyone keeps going down
tired wearing black blue
dress up stitches it's now or never
blood
killing do
cause everyone's just too weird
dying get blood
since putting down all
always blues delicate smile
some gone back
god only knows
guess i've been blessed but i'll damned
disappear tired waiting
you're gonna go far
did tell name game boy
could made into monster
when empty
through everything left wings apart
she's spilling over
too deep
will meet mind where night collides
as long as can fight i'll survive
show everything
i'll right there
everything fades time it's true
eyes still remind
i'd throw away long before
living green gray
blew all away
hells gard hells gard will true world
it's cold day sun
looks bleeding heart has already won
it's funny how
some time if time allows
everything fades time it's true
eyes still remind
gather round'
gather round'
think it's time all should come clean
never knowing who believe
seems only yesterday
all filled up emptiness
disappeared only thing
come alive x15
tie up transmission this one not test

will comeback will comeback
damn damn everyone
do remember
did find some happiness
was all
sing along yesterday
little shattered
what's boy do
nevermind there's nothing can do
promise promise kept check
no ones getting out here alive
doll up bad luck
can watch humans trying run
different face but words never change
do baby drive wild
make wish but not aloud
when were brand new
feeling out luck
stop so can begin
but there never seems enough space
no please dont talk about
empty
empty
goes away
empty
we'll make these promises
empty
out red
when sing along
not around much
after bliss has long ended
you'd steal show
heals soul
he floats
ground
leads away
all want home
people i've loved
these things i've done without should have never been done
how miss
miss
thought knew
let
returns when lands
learn from all came from
alone again

reading know maximum rock

he kinda pointed at
looking sky save
run tell all angels everything alright
why'd have go let die
you're so considerate
do ever think
why'd have go let this die
will all make out so well
turn insides out outside
pleasure or pain
keep out reach
one more time last time
one more time last time
one more time last time
here now dont make sound

long road ruin there eyes
running through hell heaven can wait
make weep wanna die

nevermind mannequins drunk their hollow town
calling unanswered center becomes blown out
cold rescued
tonight leaving going mia

got no vision i've been blind
one more indecent accident
never wanted any more than could fit into head
use evidence race around
leaving all best
want detonate
same stars
another early morning
i'll never tell secret holding
into sun climb
lighting way glide by
when come down

turning wheels inside head

this time think it's sinking us
keep hanging
there's song again
only if it's black or white see challenges
find any answer help yourself
patience dear
day after day
he doesnt know why
this reflection
yesterday's been laid rest changing guard
one more tear wont hear
little bit resolve
done resenting

said camel all yellow black
it's feathers were covered sand
lay by manager night
maria what brings
whose beauty was fit king
but matched him shout shout
but just would not let go
blood came from mouth nose
crawled back house
fell into fire down below
trembling hands they wiped away steam
they told exactly how woman died
lord night will only know

i've never been nobody's fool
i've never lost at love not counting
everlasting light
peace men earth

callin every friend i've had
just another way know
when daddy'd hang up she was gone again
papa came home was just us kids
he never hit brakes he was shifting gears
way feel

what they mean
betrays
because he'd rather
maybe it's bible or could lack
maybe it's sports fans agents fads
try love one another right now
come people now
gotta love one another
change
long black hair
they both can keep
but cowboy life
sharp end knife
she knows his love's tulsa
it's boots chaps
it's so long girl i'll see
it's boots chaps
broken home some broken bones
it's boots chaps
raised behind wheel
she said wanna fell earth move under
lord knocked knees
empty

heavenly host sing allehlujah
cause when comes heartaches i'd rather give than receive
begging taken back swearing i'll true
no i've never lost at love not counting
over hills everywhere
jesus christ born
she's never been much good at telling lies
'cause can see her heart heading 'cross bridge thought she'd burned
greyhound stops somebody gets
they cant drag main because kicks up dust
nobody gets off
it's christmas time city
above all bustle hear
help make season bright
merry christmas
this aint tennessee
still think sometimes she sees
deep down heart
but where she's now dont know
but no one knew her name
wonder if she knows
there no one there dry tears
make feel love
hey her wild card man
her hard workin man no doubt
really fit together
we'll find some country music radio
live out country
workin full house
yea we're two kind
hey that's what it's all about
heartaches are healed by sea
never leave dry land
heartaches love often brings
never leave dry land
each night i'd spend prayin god would make her mine
tried talk about old days
some god's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered
but all this cloak dagger stoking her heart
welcome game
she carrying torch love vain
that'll surely light flame
where little child was born bring gift love
still silent night sing
he won rodeo
he's not just face martini crowd
woman loved him through all
oh but it's different saddle
he won ride but he broke his back
mans back his feet
she stayed by his side
well he's still local hero
you're victim game
treats everyone same
you're victim game
out starlight
cryin his pillow
stop see weeping willow
searchin
but she keeps changing her mind
repeat twice
but leave handle stickin out
let dead dog lie
baby there aint no doubt
should forget about
way this world shall
shall free
have little faith
shall free
whom shepherds guard angels sing
come peasant king own him
save us all from satans power

they found him manger
from hills kaycee wyoming
as all sang along
them pickup men are at side
he would not slow down
just ledoux
more chris
good ride cowboy good ride
keep tellin hard luck woman
wipe tears from eyes
rags really love ya
make yuletide gay
once again as olden days
wind blew pyramids egypt
what it's when dreams become reality
without risk being burned
if you're down here doin
if want get truth admit
how feels hold him
how ever gonna know
so sat alone
as they opened up doors
took ring from pocket
now dont have wonder anymore
but might need this fool around case fall
so turn out lights lay there dark
she must face world without
avoid circumstance
if tomorrow never comes
another's eyes
this picture perfect portrait
tryin desperately
this picture perfect portrait
they couldnt move west they couldnt go home
so they got married they had child
she watched her boy grow into man
as shots rang out down rio grande
she learned language she learned fight
deep within emerald isle
can see rolling fields green
tell them make ready
as silence draw near
were forty against hundreds
if walk out door
so without
it's just another night
guess prince charming
party's just begun
there's gonna some changes way this story goes
it's most wonderful time year
tales glories
remember one time
was song made sing
this feeling feels brand new
was song made sing
come it's lovely weather
let's take road before us
without single stop
remember all through our lives
independence day
moving moving
chill air
some vows take
can hardly see moonlight

they spent day wrapped up blanket
she needs held tight
working overtime
whoever said

honey trying figure out
tonight's night
repeat bridge
but you've got tough when consumed by desire
they're so hell bent giving walking wire

i've been out this highway heartache
heats motor up
i've been runnin empty way too long
drive home
if tie's tight then adjust noose
burn down
'till sun come back around
'till sun come back around

windows rolled down
when need friend

marquee misspelled his name
ol wind had once again found its way home
were thousand miles from nowhere
air there was hunger
burning both ends night
chase lightning from sky
have rarely held another
written her lover's eyes
details can somehow slip mind
remember way
when held there
workers come monday

see her footprints sand
one hand
but it's not world am changing
hear them saying you'll never change things

dont even start think you're gonna change him
whatcha gonna do when he says honey

but makes cry or laugh right out loud
shining faithfully
our own time our own space

down by river full moonlight
just moving slow

ten miles out at sea
prayers had finally come true

heartache drowns as whiskey pours

but it's alright baby
she said dont bother comin home
cowboy him could anything

carrying love
will blow cold winter squall
i've shivered all day when look her eyes
empty
c'mon along we'll go down
i'll take honky tonkin old pick up truck
it's dance time texas where wine music flows
i'll lose pride i'd even step aside

does fort worth ever cross mind
there's ashes ground
cuz tonight she's out somewhere burn one down
another honky tonk down

how much wish she was still around
empty

oh oh sweet baby said goodbye
oh oh sweet baby said goodbye
let's take our love one night at time

if didnt have one
one dream dreaming
she'll walk away one step at time
she'd still by side
lady know out there somewhere
but there's million many good reasons
i'll always come though
wild wild west
so i'll handle care
come snow rain sleet or hail
because know what i've lost all he's gained
but keep saying cant take another heartache
got eyes can see
trembling body tells
well down at bar out mind
jukebox cries blues knows what about
think about san francisco now then
true love waits down louisiana way
empty
think it's best put all behind
aint never fell as far as when fall love
aint easy losing love although it's turned out bad
every time ship comes
'cause that's more than this poor boy makes
went use telephone at grocery store
well every time rains lord dont pour
wont break heart dont love
wont break heart dont love
15 years heaven
tears tell her sorry
from out mountain
same old stool
here every night so can fool him more
then he turns her memory
so christ sake let everyone know

call out name but voice fading
far beyond shining star
deep our hearts will live again
but none deeds were vain
nothing earth stays forever
so say farewell friends hope we'll meet again
colours fading turning into white again
every solemn moment will treasure inside
you're gone home brave
spread wings will fly away now fly away
show strength let's hail metal gods

tormented still heard call
burning burning desire
freedom call drawing near
hearts fire hearts fire
hammer will slowly arise
angels mercy our journey must proceed

all our beliefs fading into ashes
there's nowhere run nowhere hide
mission set let done
believe everything see every
shine wont shine
but everyone says different things
people tell b

want out do things own
our courage will unite
our hearts eternally keep flame
flame burning
wings glory will carry
toil battle

well this had been coming long long time
tom shapiro clark waters
just ask any woman who's been hurt by man
her broken heart
'cause know know why we're talking
maybe when dont have so much going
dont need waste time crying over
an unknown prescription
an unknown prescription
but getting off where crossroads meet
raw as wind but clean as bone
i've been looking at looking
sometimes laugh
dancing slow
maybe it's been little too long
when only flesh bone remain
how can doubt when everytime near
everytime think might have changed
but we've been down road
everytime think might have changed
everytime cry
ever since day heard say goodbye
tomorrow old cloud may come around
chorus want an answer as soon as say prayer
want land moment you're air
yeah sounds pretty good excuse
who bend break stretch some
yeah girls lie too
girls lie too
her voice what keeps here
could say hard hold
i've got money pocket

down at mardi gras
without paying paul

try keep this love alivei am keeper flame
mary chapin carpenter richey
last thing wanted was
sometimes what want
town where no one locks their doors at night
'cause midnights gone but not
but cant pull trigger changing world out there
it's been so long cant recall his name
give quarter
he's just an old neon flame
empty
no fear
used run away from love
woke up at 3 am
not wondering how shake
dont feel dagger
just getting used not getting over
friends tell they know things
that's not what wanted see
believe you're mine
but oh it's not what wanted hear
oh it's not what wanted hear
hold prayer touch everywhere
looking eyes
see real
skinned knuckle
can dress up
tell dirty joke
if mood right
way walk against grain
but train dont run through here no more
but he really worked over good
repeat chorus
there's whole lot love
making wanna move
'cause every girl talk
going through same thing
waitress an empty stare
say there's so much good between us
from trying pull spirit
say there's no good reason
there no between
every beat every part
heart
every beat every part
that's not loving
only thing you're holding truth
never would forget love could have kept
if ever broke down i'd patch up
wish had wheels wish had wings
keeps hangin when ought give up
long as road dont run out
there's place going
there's place going
fireflies screen door
gotta feel deep pang
aint sophisticated
it's gotta bend heart strang
sit silence shadows
while others long steal spotlight
now sing this song love
lighting up behind barn not knowing why
he's never gonna same
he'll living different world
take leap faith this time
are always gonna want lifetell what you're feelin deep heart
do or dont do or dont
not go but this goes not cause not anything
wrath misery
dont take away
they live him what he believes
day by day day reckoning
what feel inside

from agony agony agony
from agony agony agony
cant hear breathing

finding our way through hells hole

cant talk
gripping withfear
feel never did before
straight down from night
everytime encounter demon
straight up snake
caged riding snake
condemned pain
from criminals ranking high
never could sky yes or no
seven days may
raised outside law
eats what needs survive
look around anyone pure
above all gain full control
hate always eager find
said there still hope us now
death wont come form peace
so many times blood has poured
walk shadows
oh let them pray
use mind hope find
day judgement closing
slave ways system
he who lies
even if offended
who are
they'll take away
their social tribes
this idolization
they're bleeding so black
paralyzed depression
honor code defending line
where feelings are going when they wither away
know are free
just realise where you've gone
some so scared children fled
i've always saidburn bitch
some paid price thier crimes
meeting haunting night
see their dreams come life
bring back terror night
fortune fame
taken by reality
was fantasy
time now
cities turn battlefields
shadows cast loud clear
past it's too late
nobody would listen him
then what's store
when books were untold
cause preacher tells visions he sees
silent insanity
sanity
oooh what'cha gonna say
ritual call
lyrics billy james
heads held low
empty
preach their sermons ignorance
hope humanity
meaning life ends agony
rise as wait annihilate
premonitions tragedy
cops they dress black they bid their lives
he's just president
wars must fight
over crowded cause share same veins
will not
always together as
from father above
alwaystogether as one
red man proud giving hell
full moons rising from sky warrior's riding
ride wind
price have pay
trial by fire
this what people say
trial by fire
following bright stars
deep thoughts
should keep wandering
from dream must seek
nothing can touch now
nothing can stop now
ash ashes dust dust
really want go
laid him down bed steel
john doerealize dead
john doerealize dead
inbeded life entombed
sins will repent
well hidden crime
urban daylight
please just set free
war inside head
dwell thoughts
subliminal sin
try take control
take life into own hands
take number can wait right here
negligence why
they'll let
reduce life into disgrace
empty

vessel tossed turned
water was as hot as satans
death from above
darkness prevails no one save us

watch pain as disappears
no time despair
i'll show truth
i'll return serenity
take hand sympathize
ican not taken unto
smells fear he has dreamt
all have from
worst best
into pit
so sad silent watches night
into pit
jesus makes love spike
ride ride through
fearless when he stoned
worship listen
disciples watch
killing friend or foe
his evil place
or i'll burn cross
face war
no time ignorance
lies broken dreams
may not ever see
pain suffering
god save now

deadly strike bred kill
there's no use looking
throw some light upon this race

crossed fists
great warrior king

when night falls
from hatreds rise
stiletto death so het prince can watch
obsessed by spirit death
you're not justified
realize what you're giving
empty
bells shall chime as towers burn
hail those ravens once died
skies bath horizon fire
oath sworn blood given
rains from sky
neverending death dance
when brothers fall brothers sword

this sweet pure true
dreaming this dreaming there
hearing
empty
know almost lost mind
lend hand
hearing
empty
voodoo people
where do start

fire burns
but map leads her astray
dancing cool blind
something outside always blame
at least it's good out wind
stacks up badly never makes sense
empty
walk around just circus baby true
know shouldnt really bother baby here too
now their warmth forgotten gone
never dreamed we'd meet here once more
start car ten mile beach
start car violet town
how are getting home she laughed
anaesthesia's numbing
so many things need fixing everywhere
dont know how
ground air
stretching out catch slender message
civilized gentleman gonna nice
she reaches him jealous moment x3
saw him looking down
time meanders discord music birds
verandah almost seven years
she she needs her time space
wants another
you're just an antenna you're just wire
she say that's way that's fate am resigned
dreams thunder rattle rust
she's forgotten name hopes you'll do same
there's fire eastern perimeter
fool wept as starbeams crept
there's far too many
clock stopped thermometer bulging
sudden flash
it's not making sense anymore
or maybe i'll try fly
secret doesnt matter if keep or leak
who never got meet last time
an unwanted discoveryso now we're cruising down this shuddering highway
privilege privilege
uncurling human tragedy there's definitely remedy
cant take as are
thought were cat's pyjamas
i'll keep
empty
it's guaranteed live bleed
if he sees right through futile disguise
hope can see what that's done
take payment catch flight
guys brains are all bitter vain stupidity
you're down socks you're waving wand
spoiling rot indians eat
wasnt looking dont want find yet
i've been waiting ages yes i've been here all time
she calls down crows then she pulls her shoes
glad went so smoothly well never case
we'll walk giants we'll all honest men
na na na na na na na na na
make drift up float fall stone
that's what was
lie down perfect child this but dream
dip hand into their pockets
i've got say prayer daily bread
see slither away skin tail
wasnt long ago chorus
just cant tell who adore least
once while when wind has slowed down
watching how white moon melts into cloud
once had name forgotten now
crystal skulls screaming gulls
autumn he comes this town
his skin looks he slept
winter he cracks summer he warps
isnt or he
gets himself off headlines
reality all pervading
his hands under table
story really unfurls
look through eyes you've grown used
if only had been there
weddings frozen melted grooms
day they turned off great machine
there goes maven sowing his seed
he bought us dinner so what fucking heck yeah
chorussurrender smiles epiphanies
alone this room moon sea
myths made
here's all things didnt say
myths made
their teeth are bared their claws outstretched
washing away statues sharon stone
oh want life
knew you'd find drinking
he had room best part town
couldnt really say he seemed care
knew happy man who made feel sad
this
sun never comes
random choices will they ever learn
but they never can caught
hoped you'd realized
gotta get deep
empty
carries aloft you're getting soft
heard about maria she hated rat race
under shifting dimensions horizon returns
following nebula
here now here now
man carrying brow
echo another time an age beauty
imagine feeling before last jump
travel by thought
travel by thought
was working an orchard grew strangest fruit
hotel suite rich mans town hut botany bay
what else did give
right speaker
wrapped arms night
just beyond door
trinkets sing desert wind behind here
they say it's static electricity but
but out twisted metal discarded fortune's curse
think about loveless fascination
something that's shimmering white
dont want know
borrowed grapes from stores gold
easy burn
hope it's message from someone obscure
it's just joke
both know why you're here
deep room which i've never seen
another so easily sleep
who's one vulture's shoulder
who's one modified cortex
howling growling they want blood
callous future nervousness soon
got off light
but you're just too civilized fight
must have put horse before cart
took rest day
it's shame it's not game
turned up backstage at palace
at least it's artistic guess
gonna stitch up when come unsewn
as if it's never gonna end
deeper go tighter net looks medo enjoy view
empty
saw this film about some people who lived dome
destined make same old mistake
saw this film about some people who lived dome
face
ooooh dont move
ooooh dont move
dont let them heart
blown away falling around
songbird knows just when die
want break beautiful
dropping names
empty clouded sky
weather bare
from year without rain
only one thing ever really know
turn leave as if cameo
songs our warmth fades away
see future just sliding away false
ambition war take boys
hope know what mean
feel orbit moons
how could let slip by
are endless sky
tears loss feed overgrown grass
oh field mars
it's history
it's emptiness scares
all came back from war
but it's not their spears spill breath
they were more than voracious they sucked our ambition
an enemy always an adorer
beginning end
drowned moment an empty ocean bed
florian trout was distant boy he lived very strange town
furtive gestures lighting's flash
seldom even looking out into silver distance
heights above an almost perfect view
shrug shoulders they disappear
as if would tell so
i've never ever been here
guess can count
one more day may forget reason
he had those rascals hooked homemade soma
expect find life there unpleasant
brother end vigilance fasting
but punctured tires crossed all wires
can have all money soonyou're so deluxe you're so divine
clowns drag concealing vanity
we'll show pastel shades rhyme
visit sleep smile drown
shall start speak holly
oh what ritual father father why leaving
water all orchids save dynasty
testing digressing falling earth
always spoiling best things done
who this child who this man
look at things she allows
happening saymust thirsty drink drink sink forget
made this pretty cabinet gave keys
lot that's between
still thinking about all things she never saidi parked car by some memories
'cause it's here it's where air clear
how long
nearly midnight 1999's last party
all revealed
you'll sprout wild wings fly
make come back
take back take bone
take back take all night long
three free are days may
hid from people who were trying find
flattering chattering words impress
could never get off stuff spellbound
some little boys who live down lane
protect from meteor rain
help break these telekinetic chains
it's no reason sad
poppies sleep undamaged drive into east
certain ideas
but know never wanted
oceans growing hungrier
waiting those kings come
lush black swamps where mandrake grows
she hunts pack yet she ends up alone
they cannot die also cannot born
yeah they're laughing
twelve o'clock building mirrors
can leave lover just love all alone
can leave clothes
day need they can feed lions
overcomes too much
dont owe anything
could look good back street
please dont touch anything
please dont touch anything ah ah
it's not really fair
gone song
follow her down worship some god
just hope they dont believe do
hotel room bedside manner
empty
look what state
coming home finding other men hiding
god i've got get back soon
was plain see
second street
rang client banged her door
opportunity knocked up guess
he dont belong this time
pretty soon then we'll drenched bone
it'd hard know what's genuine
up through suburbs graveyards parks
it's lust sloth pride
i'll see sleep
purchases intended
cruel pinch weary irony misery monger or pleasureman leaves
magician among spirits drowning cave
see comet's silver trail see planets falter
fragile delirious cannot understand
every single night february
farewell daughters i'll see soon
all mercenaries are following him
some blackhearted actors interfered scene
instead
last year today radio plays
back metropolis circuses elephants
when standing
rent just went entertainment
echo hall
used fine
oh but she has authority
show
had feeling had failed
she opens up her door
sunburnt landlord glares all people
priceless you're worthless but it's not bad match
there's such big demand blood money
should get going
should going
when left sun was up
cant picture any time
but dont remember how
wonderful mind woman
promise her anything only if
exquisite results input mode
look at business woman
empty
didnt need any this
watch metal scene just peel away
poor tormented automan
dont replace dont upset
we're considering remaining here
goodbye there's no reason there's no alibi
king had something changed within him
dont blame any dont blame myself
someone's words reassure
empty
you're gonna get whatever choose
wait 'til let this soul out it's cage
that's rebound
thirst caked all our words
thinking all left behind
falling
cut two that's kind love making
separation there's someone here sharing
falling love again
ever been holiday
know you're falling behind
'cause darkness guests are all blind
emerging from shell unscathed
fall down sun
space between our houses some bones have been discovered
destination destination
womb night was all around
oh know could never get near
ugliness have learn beauty cant teach
blue sheet sky
surrounds 'til cant see it's there
then kick out
baby left as she lost her breath
perfect fit
just one one
accused testing
said fifteen years i've been here
gotta burn until learn
freeze until burn
empty
hammer falls it's going going gone
this ice will all melt down but we'll washed away
fed five thousand built cities spires
disconnected they displayed all discoveries they made
one these days you're gonna understand
way talk
cos everything's just right
wonder where roam
so easy round
you're soft you're strong
nothing can go wrong
you've got grind grind out
moment marred by hesitation
i've got grind grind out
wish back hotel womb
she's got face widow who keeps following
takes plane
dark suspicious man
then you're gonna cry
out reach their grasping arms
fishnet girlish red ones spark
they're washed up by foam waved sea
this where live
coffee stories lying truth
second descends through electric attraction distributing wings they've never been used
back at beginning eden prevails back at start back street
drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
so fire almost out there's nothing left burn
but fire almost out almost out
used feed fire
fire almost out
come closer see
into trees
again again again again
oh elise doesnt matter what do
there're worlds part
wide eyed front
make believe ran out
any more than this
if it's last thing ever do
always ever always
smile shake head
just falling bird
an atmosphere rots time
bites hand
an echo
as he plays his knees
sudden hush across water
sky
can cry this
empty
empty
caves
tonight going wild
all want again
no this not about running out
yeah know should care if come
want this end dont want start again
it's already been gone
held
one endless moment
kissed
never let go
stare at window
he waits hear her say
he waits hear her say
he waits her understand
how did get this far apart
hours go by
sense quiet despair
she doesnt see signs
want so much need her never turn away
am trying one her
she will never one
love
he doesnt want know what's going wrong
everything just fades away
one stops him feeling at all
makes cry
'cause can see through disguise
object object
i've got no objections
something small falls out mouth
waiting death blow
waiting saturday
painting lifeless face
sound tiger thrashing water
feels hundred years
hold up so high
just one more time
think you'll them
too close too wide
falling into strangers
yeah look at floor
lights lies eyes
where this
when life's going numb
all shapes throw
taking hold
always wrong
caress sound
realize only get stay so long
always have say goodbye
wonder
another way
ran heart near kissed as
white so delicate lost cold were
looking so long at these pictures but
cracks pale blue wall
trapped face changing
another point another view send
back body bed
world said it's so cold it's
plastic passion ladies lover
plastic passion transparent tart
tell wrong
hold arms
know you're always crying
ashes fire
but it's too late
shatter grip hold
drearily tired hours all spent killing
older grow
oh remember
so they close together
no no no
its only way
if only eyes would close
all really want
sure asked stay
that's sure
anyone but
stare at
so walk away
passed howling woman
said love said didnt say word
swear will always yours you'll always mine
if die said so do said
i've never been sure
however unwise
how each us dreams understand anything at all
pretending know end
no one's home
deep inside
see steps behind
all night time leaves
pressing close behind
when stars would fill sky
stars are dimmed by clouds tears
another night
hanging back
screams screams
but almost there
just wait fuck up again
oh sick all
all want do win
please remember
than remember
can hold onto
love more than can say
another time undone hopelessly fighting
no dread unknown
no dont need us or them
how sick mind soul
oh dont want us or them
feet were bare cut stones
want all
but however hard want
want world make wonder
any more time
i've been drifting around hours lost tired
she holds out her hands follow her down knees
then it's gone
watching scream
look could use hand
fabulous fabulous
know could do friend she said
doesnt touch at all
please leave alone
it's just us trying feel there's some sense
another world where sun always shines
it's just us trying feel there's some sense
always want so much more than this
another world
why cant
everything do quite angelicate
why cant
grip luger lock
smash them an iron rule
no one's loser
silence black
burn fire cairo
start burn
empty
empty
tuesday wednesday break heart
monday can hold head
throwing out frown
love

we'll never say goodbye
dont let this end
wish could just stop
will always want
know another moment will break heart
love vain
pig stairs
suck insides insides out
slip needles side
oh know how

kiss
way burst clouds
makes bite fingers through
cant get small
used take
cling so just one more just one more go
second place was lost space
left underwater
third time saw lightening strike
hey hey hey
promised each other
who held child upon his back
childs eyes uttered nothing
hate these people staring
how understand
at all
am so deep
am so love
empty
if only tonight could sleep
bury us deep
change time house
felt could die
know was wrong
dont walk away
inbetween without
make dead
exploit inspire encourage
tell about games play
just push away
just fill up sky
remember can fill up sky
carry love trinket
it's not
tired hanging around
no it's not
almost cant believe it's real
do again
really didnt think could
do all time
but all say we're all spinning
smile into striptease
so tell what going
someone get out here
can never stop
can never stop
because they're drinking themselves senseless
writhing
learn new smile
you've been craving
jumping someone else's train
or maybe it's more moth flame
round her night turns
one makes scream she said
make her glow
dancing deepest oceans
drowned her deep inside
but nobody opened their eyes
but nobody held out their hands
staring down barrel
or can fire gun
feel steel butt jump
stranger
trembling hand trembling man
looks good
every voice belongs
say it's same
yeah tell it's all same
blood thick head burst
it's not same
man walked
how they loved our lady
but older than now more constant more real
but christmas falls late now flatter colder
never as bright as when used fall
all over windows floors
wont say
it's just same
because couldnt rain
at all gardens looked
kissed his feet she fell
her head
holding given up
could he ever ask her why
not sure where am
stare but
so happy so young
cant find myself
however far away will always love however
love
quietly he laughs shaking his head creeps
million shivering furry holes know
help yourself
but it's always back
just walk away stop going
if cant was i've got let rest
if could just sure
looks so
there's meathook heart
here are
fly away from
this mother's love inside
as speak
oh just put outside
time
memories fade
receives her
wish was all true
as stiff as toys
fighting war
dont show much
always wait hear say there's last kiss
want us everything else
it's far too hard make see moment
as days become heavier weighted
think about tomorrow
run into night
writhing hatred
touch her eyes
side by side
empty
creatures kissing rain
heat night
hanging garden
into walls
as one by one people slip away
as all around children play
sacrifice penance
out head
nothing am
last day summer
yeah used so easy
so comfortable so habitual
side by side silence
move cagey tigers
bite scratch scream all night
wonderfully pretty
always right way round
think come from another world
strange girl
make forget
promised
needed words
promised
promised another time
less than breathe strangest twist
twist upon lips but dont see dont
just say now
not enough
they're not tears
turn face away
say i've aged
will never forget
happiest day
so scared high under winter moon
this perfect night another land
keeps alive
oh should feel

sky goes red
this feeling never goes
these flowers will never die
this world always stops said
it's hard ever really know
never die
try laugh about
but know
loved
get back by side
those days when felt snow
sometimes would spend night
girl was always falling
never thought tonight could ever
then could make safe clean
could make safe clean
ride into town big black trojan horse
mood heavily pregnant
sensational dazzling perfectly sized
way you're so carefully couldnt care less
empty
ice into heart
can no one save
if only you'd never speak
see face stone
way do
pull way once did
thickening streams greed as bit by bit
screaming this hope secrecy
holding breath fear sleep again
glass roof through roof mouth
songs about
wake up smile without doubt
get up go
but it's much too late say
tear out pages all bad news
it's perfect day getting old
doing this now
pull down mirrors pull down walls
die
throw myself fury over edge
movement sharp clear pure
finish life
knowing i'll murder again
dressing up all this
cant just carry this way
christened blood
say right words
but faith
know it's over if slip going
we've got show how much love them all
it's strange way cant say no
or maybe it's promise belief
keep changing shape
jump right into mouth
all night
light begins fade
measure life
make up new blood
captured so perfectly
same sharp pain
dreamed death
shake dog shake
you're slug girl
shiver shake
writhed under red light
into room
walked away grew old
all die
secrets hide
six different ways inside heart
it's american voice again
save 1 pound 52 recommended retail price
turntable

when told what
so please send icing decorating sets
all look same
empty
please try understand have see have feel
laughed recognition favourite phrase

so alone into cold new year without another word from her
never know how anything will change
but she dare not turn around
i'll get down sure
yeah i'll break out again

some will let eat their razorblade
cried out true
can still hear when dream
nothing left do
meant think
hate not
it's not enough just touch
goodnight always all that's heart
destroy no one
innocence all can give
pick pockets full sorrow
rumored straight narrow
shut mouth strike demons
old enough always feel this
you're an easy chair
if say will
medellia eyes
goldfish laugh
apart somehow
chasing down alleyways
empty
cause from mouths babes comes nothing
well can never tell
as all things must surely have end
can taste love so wrong
knew distance sun
knew silence world
hum blue heaven
baby makes three
i'll break into
dahlia dear
dahlia
could destroy
saliva screws

hope he never lets down again
he promised safe his houses
never want put feet back down ground
let's fill these hours kill desire
never lost
lost place
not worth saying seems free
own own

i've gotta go so far away so far away
left dead as sweep out cold
what said dont want
once while

come surrender son
make so proud eyes

all world must know loved so
lovers make amends
so far still know who are
lovers while meet
if spin love around

aching autobahn
because it's time arrive
highway warm sing silent poetry
but now it's just matter grace

battle whoever hides assault disguised as dancing
cant held responsible

listened her song
that's when river ran dry
but would walk other side
but it's too much just
that's when river was all but spill
was dealing soul other white
baby's crime veins
dont even know which way going
dont ask why
open up eyes let get inside
open up eyes let get inside

i've written this date
how similar shopping but at different stores
that's gonna make this pain slip away
wanna feel
can
those who can relate 2 months day wakeup
listen up dear father generation bothers i'll leave grieve
love not stable
if keep chin up
love leads tears
has died little
life boat being blown by
you're setting sun
sounds perfect way
gonna get somehow
whatever want
could go up one more
come
nothing ahead just deepest blue
rise then you're gone
end life
hearing stories were never would stay forever
world giving run around
smile face
may full life's frustrations
wanna find
but i'll get kicks
then cigarettes burned afterwards that's when she said
having headline
now thrill mine moment
abuse but not intended internal use
i've got tell tale
so come bed
living other men
want tell tale
dont dream away life 'cause mine
though asking please dont give specifics
but this chemistry just turns

now eyes are red from crying
almost
money
being swallowed by clown
just american between tears
oh she seemed crying year after year
though say unkind
know what i'll do
once or twice nightly
so threw away rose held onto thorn
just rub
you've already put big old tears eyes
must throw dirt face
didnt hit back
simplest things set off again
ever since left have been trying compose baby would please come home note meant
you're same as
so can watch all
peering into
empty
each beguiling alley
empty
locations
now victory sweet
empty
played america
dont change hair
but she knows man cant man
but he's only happy when miserable
he'll scream shout
filled up his purse dictating verse
science fiction twin 4x
shoes keep walking back
shoes keep walking back
has begun break down
where come back
little larceny everyone
why dont show
well was down under covers middle night
till have possession everything she touches
somehow found myself down at dockside
even presidents have newspaper lovers
oh know have been captured
no more fast buck
now she seems contrite will she make change
empty
you'll some sputnik baby
everybody's singing their hand their heart
everyone gets armbands 3 d glasses
or if name even santa claus or joe
that's why only operate at night time
that's why only operate at night time
there's no action
knowing him driving crazy
suppose you're going have play by ear
was really murder
which unpleasant fate they'd choose
he was known by several different names
as he enters madam x he things red raged faces sweet greenbacks
would they angry if thought joining
wake find asleep deep heart deep
song sung out
song sung out
want him
wish you'd known when was alive was funny feller
going meet reward
empty
it's big white beard suppose
lyin cold way left 'em but at least lips caressed them while
as door behind closes
many blooms still linger there
got command
you'd better say goodbye
they pat some good boys back put some rod
just another mummy's boy gone rotten
can please yourself but somebody's gonna get
never said was diplomat
wont ask forgive me
all time breath baited
dont know an animal
he selects plainest face form spiteful row girls
waiting lines are long
hurt look eyes
now it's gone way past
hear only evil
starts as an flirtation
people all said sit down
only thing different only thing new
only thing different only thing new
her looks can make
she's weak wanton
real gone love
sorry say dont know
dont know hidden shame
boy can see eyes
were brothers would run hide
not saying if did or if didnt
holding hands corridors power
even though signals indistinct
here comes mr misery
home isnt where used
saying you'd look cute birthday suit
must have opened up case
perhaps you'll never know this purgatory
shall abstain
time experiment
love best
so they call her flirting kind
flirting kind
lest forget
great unknown
band played hearts oak
isnt this greatest thing
white frock ring
he's always fingering
just dont know why cant see
this big decision
living thirty minutes at time break middle adverts
here stand edge disaster
new south wales
can remember when were children
cant come home might as well say life short
what am do
when come running home
did somebody say
did somebody say
all bedroom lights go out
she thought too late spoke too soon
maybe she should just pretend
you're not particular poison
they stitched up this time
now he's hit every city
when we're alone never quarrel
but blew hot cold
even an inferno can cool down an ember
there's always something that's smoldering somewhere
one day are up clouds
it's so hard pick receiver up when call
sun struggles up another beautiful day
automatic gates close up between shanties palace
pop princess downtown shooting up
casual killers
other side summer
crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother
as people's limousine
he saw romulus approaching slipped off safety catch
know where you'll found
all old gang
who leaves as couple
going home same jokes
stamping ground
stamping ground
empty
though he wasnt tall or handsome she laughed when he told her
when open mouth cant seem talk
he tries take
or trade
think going insane
well how much longer
'cause he's not singin he used do
strange things seem occur somewhere behind nursery door
frightening small children just about only weakness
beneath shadow distorted angel
stuck wall thousand faces
maureen stan at skating rink
roll up ghost train
while they make believe it's just another holiday
once this would have been coincidence
who killed kindness last night
it's tearing up
this where home truth ends
wanna loved
just wanna loved
it's moment she can keep
he stood all alone an iron turntable
he'll back another day
there's rat someone's bedroom
picture prince william arms john pope
knock kids about bit until they feel same
there's never been how d'you do
never thought would give away
life so strange
once he glanced at jackets some paperbacks
she's caught some disease
there's gonna no dancing when they get home
who cant find strength now punish length
before conclude this epistle
sure havent got wrong number
why got touch
even fools
somehow through day
through sleepless nights
sunday's best
standing socks vest
continental interference
songs praise readers' wives
two sapphires couple rows pearls
let no one set asunder
blue corner painted myself into
bell goes
dropped guard that's how ended
knocked out
then better go him
let memory come around
tonight bottle let down
there's nothing love better than free all
oh no didnt have laugh way
oh but too far gone
know i've loved too much too long
never going cry again
maybe dont believe heart right place
she spills compassion as young child's
i'll stand grave tramp dirt down
try telling desperate father who just squeezed life from his only son
who takes all glory none shame
you're big boy now face stop clocks
turning town red aah x4
expensive care meaningless
only kiss but once or twice
wouldnt give man hand
but its only show
i'll face facts
down basement
dial valentine
would have thought would have had enough by now
say you'll never know him
blood chocolate
want buy
but this only beginning
how can tell them
how felt when he came room
soon there's going another unwanted number
when moment arose
guess will wonder until
well used know girl would have
empty
as she closed her eyes upon world
saying can call anything but
they got touching all girls were scared call out
now he'd go spain or somewhere
hiding from scandal national press
why do forget what's been said
dont say anything
get out before
so punch drunk they dont understand at all
send all regards
she looks so good he gets down begs
close up sign sayswe never close
detectives come check if belong parents
it's just watching detectives
but he cant wounded 'cause he's got no heart
think you're alone until realize you're
it's just watching detectives
more than care surrender
certain as lost dog
oh baby baby want so scares death
want
want
want
not ashamed say cried
oh no darling not clown
want
empty
i'll wear proudly through dives dancehalls
you're upstairs boyfriend while left here listen
i've got this camera click click clickin head
he may hold his arms
know not kind guy
she'll out again this evening when come around call
peepshow regulations they just dont seem apply
i'll go out mind if losing touch
still he looks so neat
know who you're where are
even though didnt have remind
they dont sense faintest glimmering
darkest place
saying try find another lover
write name heaven
empty
inch by inch
told start
can still burn fingers
though sparks would fly
all powder's gone waste
where can tell by colour skin
empty
butcher's hooks
time up
it's time it's time
but all fear are nights
one where finally woke up
held tight
you're all adore
love one true heart
jack all parades
cause know where door
things havent done yet
as pretended not notice
oh jack all parades
as carried off spoils heads we'd smash right off
highly paid solicitors
but if it's she's thinking
well hope dont break
they're boasting loving daylights right out her small hours
down blue chair
pull out young lovers do
spirit willing but dont believe miracles
but not sure if am laughing or crying
lingered air
but was just boulevard broken dreams
if am frightened then can hide
but if leave then am broken
judge forgot tell how i'd live life alone
tell dont care
very busy
out playing traffic
find wave her right hand
busy bodies
trying make living out anything at all
i've got an angle
make believe we're making do
just remember you'll only boss so long as pay wage
just remember you'll only boss so long as pay wage
threw out academy garbage
empty
she just another mail order bride
oh little one take chewing gum out ears
he can only control what they look
clean money clean money
blood money doin no good
'cause wages sin
black flamingo chair
but dont have play so hard
love want do
behind all this paraphernalia
clowntime over
voice shadows
tears blackmail
says his men know
you're going off limits
have ever been had clubland
empty
empty
they'll say it's quaint as guilty ones faint claim they aint underneath this paint
say advertising agency swine
sad about girls who know perfectly well why he's so sad about this girl
get up leave without even warning
where cartoon bubbles burst air
his face pressed screen
oh no oh no
second place human race
between
expensive care meaningless
promises made
say only kissed her once or twice
but wont let touch poke
junior dissatisfaction
they took office they told very carefully
one two three four five six seven
there could but one inscription this was not his day
now shabby doll
she's just shabby doll
boy used
being what might call whore
he was openly broken
wrestling stories elegant bones
shadow jimmy now story told
let one fortune favours
bless poor 'cos rich
wont lie this poor shallow grave
what can say
cant let go
see those newly weds
papered over all cracks
was nothing really write home about
worth
somebody said someone got filled
once again
she's walking over floor
she's walking all over
but watch love turn slowly from indifference hate
lying skin skin
leaves without feeling
blue murder's killing
sittin just thinkin 'bout
we'd have made lovely couple but never had chance
girl woke up naked light said oh no not again
forget do
till near
see face every flower
empty
daddy went out rubbish he kept walking
family circle gather round from very far near
she says sweet nothing at all it's much more mess
longing thoughts go hankering old home overseas
world broken hearts
world broken hearts
there wont anymore there wont anymore
when you're heart breakin want some lovin from
oh they'll never never take her love from
these rooms play tricks upon
make want stay
so this house empty now
who they will favour who they will lose
this house empty now
but get used after spell
empty
shirt wore courage
but it's by julie andrews
this hell this hell
guaranteed guaranteed capture breath
have been selected from over five thousand
dont leave too late or you'll bound suffer
this offer unrepeatable
would lie would sell dud
this sad burlesque
keep faith human nature
still you're hoping she's well spoken
much more than she's lost
all this but no surprises this year's girl
tiny steps almost real
make her walk or make her kneel
tiny steps almost real
they put numb into number they put cut into cutie
whenever feel so amorous
but they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here holiday
barefoot girl from naples or was barcelona hi rise
teresa waitress though she's now known as juanita
they hardly mention us
we've always been worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide
but do people living toledo
so walked outside bright
does anybody ohio
but still have florence alabama
so turn back
little triggers pull tongue
worryin about common decency
they'll find all dogs outside
make pretty killing
never go further than floor floor
while dreaming
londons brilliant parade
dont let awake
second chorus
lions tigers regents park
it's going round town
if thought was fool
each tender mumble brings us closer bedlam
as lie there so lifelike below
lost sea imaginary women
headlights startled
feel anxious rhythm functional stranger
when moon so long has been gazing down
who's prepared pay price trip paradise
follow climb stairs
so beautiful fortunate
it'll make bankrupt
i've looked at every way can
go church quiet as mouse
into brands hatch
love walks where three's crowd
lovers strut lovers stroll lovers leap
will look what love has done
then you're cat's clothes
you're worried by her body
look name last night's obituaries
when he ran from
but will still love
he's got mind sewer heart fridge
who's up late polishing blade
pride pleasure
how can apologize
never asked what wanted only asked why
baby's gotta have things she wants
just because you've never been denied
her eyes were black first foot coal clutched as white as chalk dust
as confetti bled it's colours down drain
everyday she lives out another love song
lane she said went white as he could do then doubled over pain
singing so babe know this song
so just show little mercy
oh wish were queen
so babe sing this song
sneaky feeling sneaky feelings
cant let those kind feeling show
what did do make her go
so candy
here lie records she scratched
dont mind putting time it's shocking
as one
without sugar life incomplete
replace living double
break hearts million listeners
so dont even think about dont make wish
yes horse's heads up hung trees after bird had flown
falling out blood tub rolling back
saloon casket stained wood human dust
new career would probably end this
tears pleasure equal measure crocodile brine
but always cheated life just bold dare devil cheated death
or still too soon know
was way he came close touching
it's still too soon know
well admit are strange
empty
strange got five double chins
but there's no welcome window anyway
still dont understand when say
strict time
strict time
cute assistants staying alive
spend all evenings all alone
hot city day
still cant believe this happening

can believe it's happening
will look at this disgrace
now only semi precious
turned into terror
it's all over
inside he died thousand deaths
learnt everything she does
goodness sake as cry shake
outside they're painting tar somebody
who world has bitten her neck
before she let family down
it's money bank
who thought she looked easy he's not astute
sulky girl
could talk all night
he didnt crack smile
boys from mersey thames tyne
now looking little girl wonder where she's gone
she was sitting pretty velvet cushion
i'd his funeral director
enemies just think out loud
there's nothing you're thinking tonight tomorrow wont change
well try love her but she's so contrary
if he should wake up some terrible dive
she's got spider leg fingers sharpened whenever he strays
didnt notice resemblance
they are lost now forever
funny now can see
they'd settle anything disguise love
ends up trance
we're so hard find
being trapped between doctor magistrate
if could fool myself then maybe i'd fool too
pockets are heavy loot
at every little girl meet
guitar turned up loud
think feel dancing night away
matter who claim
whole world his hands
too tired have resisted
when will realise
from truth society neurotic erotica
they talked sister father mother
children animals two by two
some folk have all luck
had own way one too many times now
turn from playboy into man
empty
if got knees pleaded
this time different some way
if told life was song
luck hanging upside down
buttoned down laced
half ecstasy
save pieces
somebody spikes drink
threw away alibis
they're sober they're polite
from hole leopard skin tights can tell you've been spying
all way down pony street
where lay pretty head
baby can understand now
then know you're bound see other side
chorus x 3
changing words while ink still tacky
out kitchen she's gone wind
bad enough situation
everybody's crying peace earth
nobody knows meaning word
everyday everyday everyday write book
all compliments cutting remarks
dont alarmed am her friend
figure hanging leather band
now there's tragic waste brutal youth
when sunday morning dandruff turns out confetti
wont mean thing later
dont know what would do
searched his wallet clues lies
no matter how well he lies
'til you're powder grave
oh he didnt know could feel
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
finger running down seam
oh if customers then they'll keep paying
when they saw they said they knew were fine
got two legs got two feet always take street
sometimes phone would ring when she was half asleep
her mother would phone always keep talking
his finger traced past georgie's name someone who needed less persuading
all can do pack up run
all can do pack up run
too crowded
it's getting mighty crowded
it's getting mighty crowded
leavin this town aint comin back no more
it's not matter life or death
must have been wonder when was brand new
it's time stop pretending things are real
he cannot break heart
while were living saint
empty
between fear fever lies all rejection they require
whose ever bad intention has been purged
repeat after
lip reading threats false alarms
now you're part someone else
although i've never said this before
left just house hold
but when she's laying stretched out floor
hurry down doomsday bugs are taking over
hurry down doomsday bugs are taking over
look out there goes gordon
so you're little bastard brother mine
pains mention
sadness all lonely heart can feel
cant stand up falling down
she gave little flirt gave herself little cuddle
everybody's got new orders
dont want check pulse
dont want go chelsea
he's got all things need some will never
knew then what know now never loved anyhow
because still have other girl
head
leaves sinking feeling
twenty three years old if do get home alive
treated her fool
love as only love
will surely hurting
you're harry houdini or invisible man
you're harry houdini or invisible man
every home there will lots time
so young blade becomes has been
you're fine one oh yes are
spit polish potato parade
while could just living
it's well kept secret thought had better swallow
no one ever waives
it's not way kissed baby tears apart
it's not open discussion anymore
heaven knows i've tried
she said doesnt matter unless it's her matters
she's girl used love girl still hate
bama lama bama loo
bama lama bama loo
empty
he's living up there
first floor there are two old maids
typewriter's rattling all through night
he'd better have dream goes beyond four walls
you're looking somebody new can knock around
you're almost beaten punch
just oily slick
all jealousy
just canals mars great barrier reef
once this seemed so appealing
out
was caught suction
can talk but she'll get
so can cross her off list
big sister will watching over
compassion went out fashion that's all concernment
she's got eyes saucers oh think she's dish
it's stop press before all starts
even if he hit you'd still think it's just graze
always fascinated by weird edge town
wouldnt even if you'd never had drink
was looking at black white world
as feel finger's friction
up until saw her last night close detail
under skin
empty
well know time has come you're sorry what you've done
still see cold graveyard
poor shattered mind cant take all
those complicated shadows
i've got his name
who earth tapping at window
had better not go too far
leave mother father
she said catch taking liberties they do not impress
said now only want so dont have promise
now it's hard say now if he's only stupid or smart
it's hard discover now he's love her
soon sugar daddies will all gone
every lie tell you're gonna cry cry cry
what wars floods beggars
turn from tallow into tar
maddening smile la giaconda
it's curious
here am late again last time
but took little longer than thought would
bless light
wish today could tomorrow
you're every single day believe
wont forget single day believe
know you'll probably say spare us melodrama
life dark
sky was just purple bruise ground was iron
fiberglass tumbleweed
picture never paint
deep dead blue
see what you've got lose
put rings diff'rent finger
it's dirty rotten shame
but as his anger proves
cauliflowers flip
jump up hold tight
tell how else can boy get see those pretty pleats
cant trust promise or guarantee
are moments treasure
losing just memory
all courage never had
just about glad
said nurse was sweet
just about just about
say wouldnt kid about
say wouldnt kid about
so what if this mans world
there's wager lost an argument won
it's kinder murder
it's kinder murder
he was dreaming pigskin seats walnut dash
laughing up sleeve
still she knows kind tip she gonna get
he says 'will please' she says 'stop'
let hang hat
might even tell what comes next
as they find name fatal mailing list
know daddy's bound go
hush dear while whisper ear
only they wont mention name
better leave kitten all alone
well mister dog
top head
better leave
even mother wont detect
empty
so police took bentley very next thing
well what's woman sidney miles wed
not many people thought bentley would hang
let him dangle
listening sad song radio plays
could do yourself favour
getting some sharp practice
dont make any sudden movements
but if change mind
it's
select control then insert token
between wisdom murder she gave up her immaculate face
took blossom youth blew all smithereens
betrayed those little atoms kiss
she called her magic fingers
one day they'll probably make movie out all this
all strength can muster
push when falling
stab back
bet everything do
drowning man
how can know wishes
drowing man
you're loosening all screws hold hinges life
dont know what got
well well fancy
saw ex again last night mama
as might squeeze him too tight
you'd better let 'em lock up
didnt mean break cup
or turn down flat
pump up when dont really need
pump up when dont really need
words macmanus music costello
just look at lost social whirl
they say it's harmless know
seems belong blue room
every one those late night stations
'cause they think it's treason
either shut up or get cut out
head spinning legs are weak
though are so far apart
hide love hide love
answer need waitnig patiently
tear all apart would sin
let live life
close door
love
each time meet
riot act can read riot act
got letter
walking down rocking horse road getting lost
crying rocking horse road or somewhere quite
anyone there can talk
when out about i'll coming see
this song she dictated this evening
something no one must know
look what love has brought them
missing out thirteen
they smile just so so know
will ruin any man who moved too soon
because they're running out angels
instead having sweet dreams all about
finding it's hard enough
wonder every night day
was she mother
all suffering days nights 'til dare dream again
dont know why dearest darling
tried vain drive myself insane
look news somebody abuse
know how children can
must watch
never thought would this
one day know he'll forget
must watch
know accusing look
there can no defence
darling suspiciousness
he drinks self defense
so heavens sake
now try amused
oh know she's disgusted oh why's
oh used disgusted
speak up dont mumble if you're combo
there's only one thing wrong befriending
see friends getting under their feet
dont go out much at all
just beat
cast shattered mind over selected memories
he wants kiss will condescend
spare lily white lillies
extinguish every sorrow
mutter underneath breath echoes round world
now know somehow dont feel so alone
social circle have these cardiac complaints
they've seen face love they've seen few
pernod vodka sambuca love so

love never never dreams dont come cheap
sister said

well red face gentleman
kiss air around place should face
must she tarnished by men who can only men their dreams
why cant man stand up
same old trouble you've always been through
empty
before someone gets suspicious or someone gets discovered
might pay this king's ransom
do know how tall he was 'cos all really matters
empty
dont want just anybody
expect you're entitled know why making contact
now they say justice love are next things blindness
wont hurt now betray
bowed down bowed down bowed down
she surrounds his name hearts flowers
they say no news good news
imitation lashes flutter above
when they find how wicked are
while balancing daggers
let take hand
those cocktail cabinets put mud eye
tripped at every step tripped at every step
no matter how many foreign bodies can take
strike profile low side imagination
angel steps out heaven each night
havent saved her yet

game over
now sad reflection did gaze through perfection
remember jester showed tears script tears
do love
mourns lonely exile here
we'll tell our childrens children why
never miss till it's gone
loss regrets could never mend
wouldnt want know
separated out
so unstable inside out
can put spine plaster take home
empty
distinctly casual affair
they know what they want they sing name
fighting leaves behind
home truths tear home
now she wont believe
now she wont believe
this story so far
parading their anecdotes tired from old campaigns
take away
waiting wistle blow
but it's cost high
know what
old young
this splintering heart
heard sinatra calling through floorboards
cos know what want know what feel know what need
blame blame
sympathy what need
no there's not enough love go 'round
paranoia roams where shadows reign
if owners let
pretend you're off hook telephone
we'll take alternative way
warm wet circles
patch up dream
day slipped by tried tried
but were always alone
there's truth madness cant get beyond
but cant get beyond
would sit down street
exhausted insecure
if was child
not regal creature border caves
wash away memories friday night down at club
two hundred francs sanctuary she led by hand
it's too late
ringroad somewhere
last night said was cold untouchable
so now we're passing strangers at single tables
some us go down blaze obscurity
picked up sleeping pills crushed floor
there's presence
washing memories from her husband's clothes
does anybody care cant take any more
echoes silently around cold grey places
yet bound together hopelessly love
never loved before
she's inside
dont know he was born do down
'cause what will will always
thank god built bastard radar
watched her as she walked across coals
she was singing was born nineteen sixty weird
tyrranosaurus rex
if fall love now i'll floating seine
let sugar daddy melt his home sweet home
stockpile experience before blond hairs turn grey
you'll never have chance again never again we'll meet
where home where heart lies but where home
stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams
perform scattered shadows shattered cobbled aisles
one day they really love you'll charm them smile
what waste
saw magpie rainbow rain had gone not alone
so see it's can do anything
now you've arrived reborn shadow magpie
so it's see can do anything
light at end bottle alcoholicalphabet
dreaming bartenders bourbon saxophone
exposing bedside manners work extension
but was love eye saw or reflection mine
'makes england warmer summer
ferocious designs
meaning life
pain heaven
they look they're havin fun
material gain deserve
girls boys deserve
get what want if we're really honest
never wanted own
wont speak
you're an island
you're an island cant sleep
southern side hill
roll sea below
plough stars alight
viva brasil viva vida
chilling afternoon viva vida
ultramarine ultra serene
telling no not this way not this way not this way
watch world simply carry
when live their heart mind
they just move other side
she lives broken man
if just turn run
boys baptised war
forgotten sons
eliminate those who would trespass against
approach friend
news nation mourns unknown soldier count cost
they're still forgotten they're still still forgotten
so said all best freaks are here
airport terminal patiently waiting last call
please stop staring at all best freaks are here
provoking heartache renew licence
sheathed within walkman wear halo distortion
thief baghdad hides islingtown now
aerosol wands whisper where searchlights trim barbed wire hedges
pandora's box holocausts gracefully cruising satellite infested heavens
where are visionaries
rudely wakened from their slumbers
couples loiter cloisters
they say good god they say
mother smiles she did too
beagling downs
nothing left fight about
as she's begging please calm down
now ring just band gold
never had no trouble sleepin through night
tear up never stop again
fish steve rothery mark kelly pete trewavas ian mosley
i'll try anything once that's way should
someone must have missed her by now
get used
tell mad
was something didnt say
fireworks toys
iv slide
when there's murder street
this world sharpens teeth
goodbye all
just when thought i'd seen last
heading rave
derek dick
wooden figures pagan gods stare blindly cross sea
he knows victory secured his charm will testify
empty
hounds freeze silence bewitched by reptile spell
heroes delusion feet grave
gonna take no blame
receive punishment
stream noughts crosses ram
makes suffer makes cry
makes suffer makes cry
can bash book words
cannot sleep
where sea meets land
as light fades shortens
wild garden from another life
dance rose
heading automatic overload
come here scratchin at door
you're asking wrong questions
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
hollow men can take without even reaching out
stand us our silly clothes
sniff air something can use
king sunset town
watch big wheel turning round
injured souls came his bed
some go up some go down
opening doors dreams come home
our made up faces pr smiles
out mind you're out depth should have taken soundings
we're clutching at straws
hat full wonder
was where he found her
they're gonna go crazy when
what do do when roots have dissolved broken down
it's new day
all he wants strong
end day
end day
top girl dream hotel
but everything inside bites
everybody whole whole whole whole world
but invitation was clear
fifteen stone first footer
uninvited guest
rash upon skin
uninvited guest
gaze scans walls this apartment
celluloid leeches bleeding mind
oh please do last
only laughed away tears but even jesters cry
now leave
empty
these chains are comfortable
new day was rising
born free but scared
if could only see what i've seen eyes
now where wisdom
chemicals god
it's all brain
astronomy instead
this 21st century
she shook her head
ships railings some far away tide
strange misty visions god
everything they did
find fundamental truths
from horizon
stung him face
oh mummy daddy will sit while
stayed
this puzzle
dies
blame
this town has turned into what have become
noise outside takes its arms lamb lion
morning breaks watch awake this town takes down away from again
dont need chains
three boats down from candy
business as usual
elvis beatles
she dont know how started
they spun him three times round globe
shock world hold his hand
he just cant do anymore
it's getting late game show any pride or shame
read some kerouac put tracks burn little brighter now
took her hand said let's go together
let's go together
against world
sunday mates were toasting champagne down pub
now you're touring stadiums you've let go too far
tux look at him now tux
used rain
under sun
most every day
after all this time
something learning fly
clutch them coat
edge exploding
till they commit themselves muted journey home
classrooms shabby butterflies
as glancing headlights last bus
she'll let lovers tongue move warm wet circle
when taxis gather mock solemnity
tie angels bar sweet martini's their charms
if girl no solution
if living rough no solution
leaves child traffic
going ask her
dont do
want
perfect mirror
saw political intrigue political lies
all children
will swear have no nations
cant walk away cant walk away
where do go from here
ideals sanity they seem deserting
trying score but nobody's pushing
racing clouds home racing clouds home
but couldnt say couldnt say
outside could hear mockingbird
was almost goodbye
future was suddenly so clear
so many nights could only dream ya
but thats way before she told were through
repeat chorus
so little time when she mine know
love town but just couldnt stay
am who am
but one night while she lay sleepin slipped away
say job taking longer than planned dont have heart tell her
guess she finally had tell shes not waiting anymore
since she left by myself
spend time new next kin
just somebody kicked him
told him dont play dumb us son
reckless discharge gun
through teardrops his eyes
so guess i'll confessin love confessin love
there aint gonna no restin at all 'cause want too much
will send her home tonight
but know day has not come an end
but dont have anyone blame but

heaven knows how much need her
dont know why she even hangs around
right then there watched break down cry
repeat chorus
there's no secret lack success

mama sat there quietly between all us kids
both precious girls leave million lullabies
all swore wed honor things daddys will
or neighbor's barkin dog
down at end bed
this heartache never sleeps
wont let
now silence more deadly than violence storm
ol jack daniels
i've made home hobos
this side door

all tied up winding sheet
night when dogs from hell come out

there's never been an injury
no technician but little knob twisting
steady strong certain

so far so good baby knock wood
humming big well oiled machine
it's working
so late one night by harvest moon
but nothin melts heart grandchild will

robbie lee watchin his world come down around him
startin think
i've got under skin
empty
empty
give little then take back
broken wing
she still sings
goin through motions life
keep 'em guessin keep 'em laughin
though aint size
but when sun goes down
or held so long
havent left clue
somehow woman knows
mansion hill
makes proud
we've never been untrue
make wish baby
love can take anywhere
wont let
i'll give anything everything
gonna get dressed up go downtown
it's just another saturday night
anything's better than feelin blues
empty
an moment they can choose walk away
saw face when
no feelings have lasted
so dont thinking
he's nothing but ashes
oh yeah by way still love
sometimes what dont say
make scene
go way
she was only ten when her daddy got fired
she smiles 'cause she knows end
then she sees her little girl
these tears are gone beyond blue
sometimes sit front porch swing
here ones love
have been blessed
when feel holding
have been blessed
was born give love
as sure as newborn babies cry
seems always end up driving by
feel so at ease
baby you're best i've ever met
wake up where clouds are far behind
but doesnt really matter 'cause there's nothin said
he calls hospital her sister's house place does her hair
she's just got around
when starts tumble

tell him woman
living water
so tired livin solitaire
safe arms love
safe arms love
i've found another man

there was bunch kids laughin jumpin
tell myself live little freer love little better
what they dont know what they cant see
some say running
let's learn give let's talk things out
there wont come day
stronger than both us
even when arms are empty darlin
even when arms are empty darlin
how all began
now they're pretending
now they are strangers
must think heart has swingin doors

wont leavin heart open anymore
loved little laughed lot then were gone honey thanks lot
cant love if cant trust
not one
daughter's eyes am hero
strength when am weak
it's giving more when feel giving up
daughter's eyes
they said he was dangerous man
roll stone away let guilty pay it's independence day
let whole world know today day reckoning
connects way too clear
starts talking bottle
life precious every second
you've wasted mine it's time
keeping distance
know need too
cant hold against will
keeping distance
now standing mountain rubble
saw goodness inside
dont tell no stories dont wanna hear no lies
you're cattin around
grass aint always greener other side
you're stealing love
gone thousand miles
little bits lightning
'cause darlin know
shining through rain
now leaving someone else
when try restore what had before
losing feels good
what could say but yes ma'am
walked away hand hand love land
longest time blamed myself
love land
one they marked express
he was walkin by other day said
love's only house big enough all pain
love's only house big enough all pain
said hey i'll cover honey 'cause pains gotta go somewhere
tell love make feel
but just put them shelf
so can work out
baby just make believe
make world go away
say things used say
he loves silly he loves sad
baby loves just way am
empty
once day all day long
darkness still echoes her warning
darkness still echoes her warning
thought walked so slow
i've been longing aching
could run away run away
could run away run away
puny short little but loud
puny short little but loud
you're vessel temple
think right now dont need
that's that's
that's him know that's him
that's him that's him
washed us here
baby there aint nothin cant do
built fortress strong where
sometimes she wishes she was never born
when morning comes it'll too late
broken heart world forgot
yeah took as long as she could take
repeat chorus
i've never gone this far before
steel guitar radio
cry shoulder road
kick back let go
yeah she was little different
as soon as started doing things way
this aint first time you've fallen love
everybody says they'll never fall again
repeat chorus
sound someone's heartbreak
some cry out some whisper
hide behind unsure
these times which live
so dont try save now
step will much lighter
from ashes
he was dressed as bag leaves
empty
knew god's will
his mother said they didnt think he'd live
met god's will halloween night
who's got time hurt right now
life goes even when it's not fair
who's got time hurt right now
remember where was
wont see anymore
some better way say goodbye
happy girl
lighted fuse
cry when feel
oh watch go
cheat tell lies
but believe you'll fall
yeah got heart trouble comin
troubles by score
yourknock door
help make through night
dont try understand
provide life sure family dreams about
it's not always easy but it's all dream about
crickets always sing outside windows
oh never come back
so gonna walk away
how far do have go make understand
standin up what believe
repeat chorus
boy love can make stronger
aint goin nowhere
aint goin nowhere
cant sleep dreaming about
cant sleep dreaming about
cant sleep dreaming about
once knew
burnin inside
i've forgotten somehow
keep saying love can wait
dont tempted come around
dont want see
i've known just week or two
love
need fanatically
actin so recklessly
baby love
well if sweet talking could make come true
but there's one thing want know
at door leaves are falling
miss those arms held
wont knock door
there are two kinds love
dont wanna think
stuck tryin break into home
i'd cash all chips get outta town
never have seen river that's too wide
so love if ever gonna love
said fine baby go back sleep
said wanted all this
i'll still laugh at jokes argue over silly things
just normal girl from small town nowhere
warm breeze rocked boat until
then through dark saw rope
kissed sandy banks swore
time has come let go
time has come set free
there are quiet words pray
there are
when lost when found
there are
stand ground when everyone's giving
this one's girls
who've ever had broken heart
this one's girls
there's silence front lines
neither one knows what they're fighting
little sister's ragged dress
there's silence front lines
now then
from time time
but til then
then today started loving again
what makes treat way do
forgive once again it's just same old story
throughout days our true love ways
all know cant go forever
it's hard admit what know inside
'cause baby moved out left behind
but i've been sleepin warehouse west la
no way speak
have been waiting
even if romance ran out rhyme
but love put feet back ground
things lived
wanna join our hearts
wanna walk line
just isnt right
it's nobody's business what she wears
what crazy miracle this
before ask question
hear what you're sayin
whatever say
whatever say
all heard her hollerin
girls lock up guns
it'll do 80
well call preacher
i've stirred last batch gravy
i've got mustang
death no longer makes weep
i'll here when are old
empty
oh never more alive
feels mile wide ditch
as canyon way out west
there's not stone mark
feels mile wide ditch
sometimes think wish
or was someone else
no dont wanna slow down
if were single free
if were single free
must've been
somehow wake up each other's arms
wild angels wild angels
all tears
we'd fine
seemed pain would last
now say you're gonna take him oh but dont think can
now dont know where leave's ah but know where stand
you've been seen out runnin around
someday say win again
everywhere go hands are wheel
when everybody thinks they're mine
takes real man take backseat woman
every man sight
any love
there no certain crowd run
any love
waiting
can still stand tall
diamonds back sunroof top diggin scene
empty
that's freedom without love
well get an electrician
hear say
love god
empty
sound silence surrounded by mass
it's beautiful day well seems as such
mi chiamo 3d si sono inglese
nine five lemon looking lime
they got no one stab at
they leave rainbows dark
try see more
massive attack matt black appear wearing beads
empty
up against wall behaving de niro
paper which use tongue lick
because eight kay rig goes boom boom
if was rich man
empty
well floating air when daydreaming
here comes sun little darlin here comes sun
problem aint different kind skin tricks
so you're going tool again
really should leaving but stay
i've done before
i've been here before
see drinker
gets blue neon
empty
function better sun eyes
when you're down torn
empty
haunted by medium
if believe i'll deceive then common sense says shall receive
empty
so goodbye
dress up stussy
window indigo when they go boom
see mans face
will never see his heart
seen ya diggin hole ya neighborhood
couple specially
you're crazy but you're lazy must lazy
must crazy know you're lazy
trendy wendys know what mean
'cause when host show avoid girl called lola
bottom end's heavy know we're never even
daddy g
tokyo city's one place toured
they cant lose
massive attack explosione
root all evil
empty
ears know eyes are closed
ready sing
flickering roam
magazines
flickering roam
hear time starry sky
then left all alone only tears
big wheel keeps turning
sometime again
down within shadows where factories drone
while satellites cameras watch from skies
empty
it's too bad it's just too sad
share precious pure fair
want want baby
cant endure then cant inhale
moving up slowly
moving up slowly
moving up slowly
she comes moving up slowly
frames will freeze
caught radio waves
empty
need live need
tricky 3d
overcome sixty seconds
digging hole neighborhood
tricky 3d
something's mind cant share
lately baby where did go wrong
try set night fire
try now can only lose
come baby light fire
always fuss fight
he gets so late at night
how serene friends fiends
windows hum
you'd agree it's typical high
can unwind
all these have flaws
love not another
if basket should fall all eggs'll broken
believe one love oh girl
tracy thorn
if left her just way
dont have no fear
sometimes look so small look so small
you're girl boy x4
i'll put arms around
can pull into
there's nothing can save this
comes back
no use no use see
light ways through club maze
why want take this party breathe
they're invisible when trip flips
daddy g
toy people make boy
all will feature freakshow
see lookin back at
empty
empty
but if hurt what's mine
voices i've heard before
feel world home at last
empty
when check them use spying glass
when check them use spying glass
shakes makes lighter
fearless breath
stumbling little
looked up was arms knew was captured
what's this whole world comin
it's just so hard child
yes missing all things knew
now i've got know much more
empty
well cant help but scared all sometimes
she thinks happiness mat sits her doorway
everybody's trusting heart
everywhere someone's getting over
someone can lean
morning let down
all day
turning cartwheels into headstands
cant listen
all reasons
dont feel
it's good not angry
just need get over
not angry
any mind would think that's all she gets
funny how carry not taken over
guess something just got lost deeply saddens
somebody else
figure out just what going do
everyone here's blame everyone here
but it's over now dont know how it's over now
dont think could take another talk about
dont wanna one who turns whole thing over
there'll no rest these tired eyes
there'll no rest these tired eyes
when smile gets old faded
bent
get put back together
just touch then
get put back together
if slide over accept fate
thinks living here's just plain
it's gettin so damn creepy
can talk about
fiction romance
some things cant see until gets too late
she keeps picture her apartment city
but if bright lights dont receive
you'll find something that's enough keep
come home
wholly understated
people we've become well
empty
oh how wish could own
tell why gotta so cold
there will no doubt
tell how we're gonna make last
you're ready fly
ready crash
was wondering
was wondering
was wondering
na na na na na na na na na na
god damn change pace
would see erased
move around room circles
all needed was crutch
this cold girl well
cant sit still
yeah there's nothing at all
pulled out reason card instead
well there's nothing at all
no one's ever turned over
keep distance from
cant breathe
but leave while world coming down
makes feel uneasy baby
strong
oh some time

wondering what you're dreaming when
so thought hell if it's over
shame shouldnt try couldnt step by
shame shouldnt try couldnt step by
but there's no one around who can tell us what we're here
all know there's always something tearing apart
empty
hits so much harder then thought
yes there's times i've been afraid
but gotta give up
but gotta give up
gotta give up
you'd better stop
singin but couldnt remember all words
tryin get handle reason shine
wonder how never got burn
she was crazy
stand watching from steady shore

empty
morning falls rain into city life
we're never meant learn
move around bedroom cursing naked sky
when it's gone
these days are gone
but not crazy just little unwell
know know they've all been talking about
not crazy just little impaired
but stay awhile maybe then you'll see
how used

if follow down
there's mountain side
vision swear it's true
know that's vertigo
as time that's running slow
or pull snow
tell what see
reflection see
when walk out
when leave all behind
what will past remember
shines above onto street
as slowly every thought will change
telling myself not fair
if wait night fall will take too long
lose another day
when swear never told what do
when swear never told what do
just look eye when say why
say would rather die
do want tell something
do feel one little bit
i'll fake dont want make
moment leaves without vision
no dont want kiss
what matters
time hating think was mine
people who years have been holding
stay keep coming
much further away than appear
down below or from somewhere above
figuring out what might say
all seasons seem congregate
wind sun got together
tried call but line was busy
it's true dont really know
if you're big enough take
you've got let know
if it's worse live than let go
if mine doesnt do
why dont write own song
or might create hit
what beautiful moment
then guess it's okay think it's okay
cant believe
think leaving
if can close eyes without fear
as close as get love
speak sweet voice
an evil bigger than could know
empty
as if there's god who would understand
worry about some time
defending holy land

girl shouldnt think i've got nowhere go
how warm morning when asked stay
how cool evening when sent away
stuck inside
but then should never have choose
was weaker than thought
'cause did once now owe

but all prayers they brought no answer
every love there promise
there's no reason
but change itself change itself
bird you'd sooner fly away
tear up 'til there's nothing there
there's so much room move
should put faith
lay down evening
should put faith
this day which have fought
as soon as have said it's hers
no understanding no sound from above
no understanding no sound from above
only waiting
maybe that's someplace time wont take
you've never had
might happy just stay

dont wanna get hurt again matter fact dont wanna get hurt again
tell straight cos aint gonna wait
cos i've been there been there
go back go back just aint goin back
but guess doesnt matter any more
repeat last verse
wind blows so light
all angels are shamed
have need never wish again
i've cried earth
dont know why
this song's her her requiem
sit here twisted hurts
affection stillness
who has brown eye
lucky boy
endowed joy
snap ribs pleasure
unbelievable self extinction
deep was pain
strike down cast out
throw into own mouth
take from this place

there no stopping there's nothing wont do
before end let tell
let one only cockstar
lost angels de construction
natural born killer natural born killer

make believe
must confess was quite impressed
makes no sense carry this
put little heart intention
crowded by past
nothing but these chains
missing by mile
heart would come undone
other love we've known
can say it's all right but know you're breaking up inside
when heart's crying out baby whisper name
will lay down life if that's what need
every day
but now he says he knew about from start
sometimes dont have choice when play break rules
never wanted this
if there was any other way love
chasing rainbows
they would see
making love
secret safe between
if they could only see baby
know if try our love could stronger
if still want
said i'd never let nobody near heart again darlin
somehow ever since i've been around
ask i'll do anything baby baby
empty
approche un peu plus pres que tu m'apprennes toi sans jamais oublier
empty
j'ai si souvent prie ou tu voudras ou tu pourras ou tu iras j'irai

other love we've known
que dans son sang lorient coule aussi
qu'il est beau que je laime qu'il est ma vie ma joie
qu'il goute tout mais sans jamais dependre
qu'il ny pas d'amour sans histoire
que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand

never let go till we're one
you're here there's nothing fear
have come show go
one true time hold
we'll stay forever this way
did know would see through
did know would see through
did notice all mistakes
precious one darling one dont let lashes weep
there's nothing could hide
heart's overtaken
caught up these stolen moments
feels falling
little shy sad eye
just love loved return
ecoute c'est important
tu veux toujours tout partager
il faut grandir devenir sage ne bouge rien ne bouge pas
dirait presque
he treats all others
ne plaignez pas
when goes wrong
et pour ma fte
have gifts
yes dont pity
empty
non ne plaignez pas
empty
heart bigger than earth
lead someday suns planets love
new musics
who fly other lives let live
who are looking another life
he'll say carry new day will come
oh yeah
yes will
miracle come
cant believe
hush love
let fill soul drown fears
i've been touched by an angel love
leavin next plane out
runnin down stairs there's taxi that's waiting
here beside again
here beside again
leavin next plane out
but baby there would
each day would go just same
world would still spinnin 'round
la table est dj garnie
oh quand j'entend chanter nol
je revois tes yeux clairs maman
oh when hear ringing at sky
oh baby since left
all those nights shared together baby
oh baby might think world's been torn apart oh but you'll see
o holy night stars are brightly shining
o night divine
o night o night divine
when look at
couldnt get much higher
when reach
when reach
get wings fly
lost everything do
want love
looking eyes
then will see morning will come
makes no difference who are
how can make see
when it's time face storm
am angel
when all hope gone here
les feux de joie et la souffrance
j'ai vu les anges et les dmons
mais ce qui m'tonne tu sais
j'ai vu le froid j'ai vu la transe
comme la douceur de tes baisers
symbol faith who am
fulfill destiny
sorry dont have role love play
dont say goodbye
dont give same old speech
just how simple
but aint good enough
everything gets carried away
everything we're longing
breath let out
could sure make difference some small
empty
empty
m'en aller dans un pays
loin du monde o' j'etais ta possession
je m'en irai incognito
empty
je nen saurai pas un mot
heading ends earth lit end world
far from us
i'll go incognito
empty
empty
empty
j't'y perds
right outside window
just have admit
but then they'd always seemed right
was dead long ago
so much deeper
but it's all coming back
there were nights endless pleasure
all coming back
when see
it's all coming back now
j'ai besoin d'un homme
j'ai besoin d'un homme
need water air fire
comme j'ai besoin du soleil et d'la mer
j'ai pas besoin d'champagne et d'chocolat
mais chaque fois j'vas r'voler plus haut
spring summer fall winter
need
was listening wind sing ever
was going serene without knowing
was waiting was waiting
dear compass north
musics words from france
lives writting voyages
reason these goodbyes
empty
quand les reves de nos enfants deviendront nos esperances
je te les dirai 100 000 fois et ca m'aide tant vivre
when love will have other tastes than passion desire
empty
de ce dsir infme qui en moi se dchane
et je cherche lombre
je crains les rues le jour et les gens
soudain je sursaute en ne croisant qu'un miroir
fear promises pledges
suddenly jump while meeting simple mirror
fear world its laws
je te crois moi
there are six billion humans earth
quand la vie m'endort comme un somnifere
je de de de danse dans ma tete
even if standing subway
there's really something become insane
nous epie nous informatise
dehors les neons s'allument
laid naked bed
je de de de danse dans ma tete
i've run circles around sun
make love
just find words
try try try
well hear music
now hear music
what feeling
beins believin take passion make happen
see trees green red roses too
hear babies cry watch them grow
too many
all so want give
when need
hold out hands touch love
always wanted baby
they cant see best friend
when wrong one loves right
heart next mine
without feeling inside
where does heart beat now
two hearts needing one another
stronger
flower dies from angry rain
rainbow which leads where are
thousand dreams can still believe
wish didnt know cause cant let go
why o why
tell
when still love
o

jjg ok turn
en tout cas pour nous ici sur scene
i'd return towards past
those songs were written by
ma mere qui ma mere qui ecrit ma premiere chanson

la plus belle langue pour dire des mots d'amours
high above mountains far across sea
higher than clouds
gently turning round round
will feel
cause make feel
cause if make happy
because make feel so alive
make feel
i've waited so long too long
so let walls come down
fire burning bright
dont let get down

darkness night
light shining bright baby
just flow group without face without voice
zora smiles zora smiles zora smiles
her bare face under wind
sometimes few insults she doesnt care
but she smiles those those who are there
s'est aim cause cause
s'est aim cause cause
mais aujourd'hui tant de choses ont changes
nel cuore restera
when stars go out each night
lead us place guide us grace

baby think twice
wont slip away from
this time
know eyes have seen too much
can not have best
but this time lies
empty
dress has finished
tire tire laiguille ma fille
le chat sur le tapis s'en donne coeur joie
qu'un mariage cote bien du mal
empty
eyes get covered lacy curtain
sowing path joy
pull pull needle daughter
when she walks away
just believe
whatever takes we'll find way
moi tu voyages dans la tte
when think about
say hello door opens
moi qui lve mes yeux vers toi
talk stars
tu es chez toi avant d'entrer
have whole pages
jusque dans mes rves
open road
ces mots que d'autres avaient crits

ces mots que d'autres avaient ecrits
all voice all soul

mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid
les mots te brulent un par un comme s'ils
le blues qu'on nm'a jamais appris

out there tempos appear
out there infinite dances
islands initiate into love here
le rire aux femmes aux filles aux eclats
le plaisir en ces brulants combats
dances childrens play
les feux d'en bas ce lascif etat
les iles initient lamour ici
fires from below this lascive state
go where go even beyond
le soleil avait prepare ca
when fall asleep against body
qui guette au bout de ma route
love at any price

world leaded by insanes
everywhere around world

j'ai du succes dans mes amours
from where control universe
have second home
au fond je nai qu'un seul regret
pour pouvoir crier qui je suis
able create life
pour pouvoir etre un anachiste
able tell why exist
toutes les bandes dessinees
pour son anniversaire
au cinquantieme etage du waldorf
they spent looking
they have walked broadway
pour pouvoir mieux rever
comme un oiseau qui plane
when he saw

la raison est un fil de soie
juste en fermant les yeux

et j'ai suivi le vol d'un ange
who saw laughing crying at same time
et moi j'ai compris la chance
steps will take back
there have been loved
en se levant chaque jour
world where caresses smell good
empty

shepherds shepherds
voyant la fin du jour
qui charment leurs amies
tra la la tra la la la la la
around old fireplace
tra la la la la la la la la la la
quand marcher sans autre but
de ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer
other reality
plus assez neuf plus assez
nous serons princes d'ternit
am calling
dont know what
let tell there's no better guy
hooked feeling
do best can
till drop drop
john lennon said
cant fight feeling
et c'est bien en vain qu'on lappelle
nothing's doing threats or prayers
si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime
but if love if love
tout autour de toi vite vite
il na jamais jamais connu de lois
if dont love love
le vent faisait chanter lt
des papillons couleurs pastel
ce ntait qu'un rve
smile have kept

quelques fois je dis des mots bizarres
dont understand thing about
tout ce que je fais aujourd'hui c'est pour toi
it's am here
presence awakes dormant water
it's am here
quelques fois je parle trop
des chansons chaque pas
c'est pour vivre
que des gens s'exilent
all four winds directions sky
et peupler la terre
jerusalem was born
que des arbres tombent
as long as love alive
chante encore
sur la musique
puts our hearts harmony
alors cette musique
handed hand

qui met nos coeurs en accord
un jour s'en va
et chante la pour moi

from le p'tit bonheur
i've gathered
monsieur je vous en prie dlivrez moi de ma torture
j'ai travers sur mes souliers ferrs
shoes have passed through meadows
you'll fall if not there
c'est d'voir lautre se casser lcou
he's rich he's polite
see other breaking his neck failing
when train goes at fifty miles per hour
there was only one passenger
le train du nord
but wont one blame him
can walk rain
ne touche pas
empty
fais ta prire
ni tes yeux
nor nights
girl

le ciel aura vingt ans
quand balance
il ne manque plus que les trompettes
ds que le tempo est l

celui qui reste quand les autres t'ont dj quitt
already found evening star
si c'est ton ami
if it's friend
then succeded life

s'il ton rire s'il tes larmes aussi
goes wrong
companion luck
si c'est ton ami
don quichotte et son vieux sancho panza
s'il est pour toi
one stays when others already left
donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie
if it's friend
if nothing less than best satisfies him
together go over mountains
si c'est ton ami
avec ses trompettes et ses guerres
puisqu'elle fait de lui
et refais le monde comme
if it's friend
do world all over again have done three hundred times
i've learned how deal when fight

never never never
at window heart
whether they're from italy or california
dans un monde en feu
ceux qui vivent deux qui nont pas peur des mots doux
et quelle tristesse sur la planete
ce sont les oiseaux du bonheur
comme un voyage d'un soir
partir nest pas quitter
le premier amour est le dernier
les paradis
when walking without any other goal
when even alcohols no more make drunk
dans un journal d'autres histoires
an abandonned flower
we'll princes eternity
et le cher bambin le dimanche
he was saying while giving them her
here beautiful mom
le gamin vit partir sa mre
morning april among walkers
l bas elle m'attend
beautiful mommy
touched merchant told him softly
tiens ma jolie maman
who loved them so much
se rend compte
cours les uns apres les autres
but at end
sleep ones against others
but at end
as subtle as breeze fans flicker flame
but as gentle as falling leaf any autumn morn
c'est lembrassement du frre qui te reste
aime pour tout de bon
ou pour se dscher tout fait
et peut tre sera t elle plus heureuse
an abracaca

magic man
wonders
picture broken man
when life gets tough need
can go long way sometimes
little bit love sometimes
chorus iii
really all need
want chance live
live used
we're still together heart
asking nothing return
live man
could make crazy make crazy
lolita not too young love
il faut que tu les rendes les rendes
alone caressing
about first night love
love
telling
until end
not too young give herself
une une
have give them back back
trop jeune pour aimer
dont give dawn
let's face music dance
wont depend upon words say
no promise spoken
more than this
have chance
light way
they cant stop us
little faith
never explains
when our hearts make choices
now can feel what you're afraid say
wrap around us
hide dreams special place
are only one dream
can run but cant hide
can run but cant hide
i've tried best so long
only feeling can save us now
show some emotion
open open heart
je rirais souvent comme les autres
oh si j'tais quelqu'un
comme pour dessiner un ballon
quelqu'un comme les autres
how can make him read thoughts
si lon changeait les choses un peu rien qu'en aimant donner
les portes laissent entrer les cris meme en fermant
peaceful life where can ear every heart beating
would do dream this world an eternity
if loving was enough
qu'on dise mes fautes mes chimeres aussi
je ferais de ce monde un reve une eternite
when tears are gnawing at others shed
which weapons reply countries our fears
si lon pouvait changer les choses et tout recommencer
beautiful days seem leave so undone
all know standing place where
after all we're so bright
so close eyes i'll sing sweet lullaby
let go tiny hands drift away bright enchanted land
cause when dream doesnt matter where are
they'll spread their wings keep safe waaaarm
played love without showing myself
sola otra vez
mi corazon no aguanta mas
alone once again
alone once again
sola otra vez
alone once again
without love
quis volar
hacer mi sueo realidad
alone once again
heart cant hold no more
sola otra vez
jugu al amor sin entregar
alone once again
otra vez sin amor
alone once again
if cant feel love
could never
then i'll
but could never
touch
cry comfort
search reasons baby inspire
never walk alone no
wanna look eyes now see smiling again
no more kissin kissin goodnight
not afraid
but want more more more
it's kind sweet dreams are made
super love
super love
yeah same sweet love
monte les malles des quais sur le pont
from cabins kitchens
all holds penal section hours shifts
mais vienne une tempte une lame en sursaut
quand les astres s'en mlent sur limmense ocan
sur le mme sur le mme bateau
sur le meme bateau
des soirees mondaines des valses ou tangos
under same stars
near swimming pool pretties handsomes
sur le meme bateau sur le meme bateau
surprise surprise
guess it's do or die
cause i'll only let
river runs wide
'cause what if walk away

passions run high
good bad beat heart
shut up drive

overloaded love
urging constantly take one more chance

let this love inside start
flowing from 10 lb heart
first chorus
asked her point blank friend going die
too bad those kids were so nice
dont call lady alligator purse
doesnt know it's even there
keep them because want stay right where at
thought were stars closing down bars
back bottom drawer

said that's how this love will always
everything changes
take breath
before lie
between mother child
want feel way do
never was or will ever
sorry life let down
or things believe
but doesnt mean want war
i've walked sand baghdad
or building where her church group meets
goes show never can tell
boy did they let blast
celebrate their anniversary
it's hardest one i've ever faced
keep time from draggin
gotta keep pretty smile upon face
put saddest song ignore telephone
you'll appreciate light
'cause deep down low makes level feel so high
this 1950 gibson was emma jeans guitar
but there's little bit emma jean every song play
would've reached phone called up
what do think miss most everything
way laugh
track 9 time 231
then he told where could go
really had ball last night
held all pretty boys tight
sat here hours
it's easiest thing could have done
still best i've ever had
no one ever loses
who's long run
then i'll gladly set free
then i'll gladly set free
but i'll take chance say
you're diamand rough should mine
i'll constant as sun shines above
but listen country when were all alone
hell bent holdin
drives him wild
her parents had his never did
when doubt said cant done
two hearts beating as one
two hearts beating as one
everything i've ever learned about love
know hurts do this
all this love have inside
but could never love enough
give every possession
make passion last every night
loving all her might
into thinkin i'll never alright
who'd lie awake all night cry til were out sight
what have aint gonna enough
i've been tryin but just cant live
musical chairs at baggage belt
just when thought had gotten bad as could get
if we've learned anything it's there's no winner when fight
or one weekend mountains
big back yard where kids can play
tell what's so great about picket fences
chely wright
no hot romance display
yeah right middle
couldnt help but think again
love lost
think some people have taken this little too far
love lost
could tell will heal wounds cut down
could tell will heal wounds cut down
could tell will heal wounds cut down
shoulder shoulder back back
shoulder shoulder back back
pure as an angel
but was little miss perfect still ended up here
by packing up leaving said you'd never do
he was glued tv
she never once looked back
sun sinking low
where she doesnt know
drove
cause he dont do bars anymore
when he's wrapped up arms
no he dont do bars anymore
now satellite pictures sent back earth
leslie satcher
oh just thought dialing makes heart race
if wind up over here

still read horoscope
if feel old feelings comin back
between capricorn maybe i'll know
make fall

laugh just have laugh
baby suns been up hours
hand just hold dark
he's come long long way
got him ready
it's tragic but true
dont think all through
but now would wrong
if had married jfk
if were jackie
she had grown accustomed
empty
'cause he's gonna cheat he cheated us
feel when touch
i'll take all can get
took our time
i'll take all can get
was cool as breeze
but one by one made them disappear
that's how knew
was never enough
clock ticking loud as thunder
say words keep here
now pedestal i've put
different day different town
but know where belong
every hotel bed feels same
it's not miles
but know where belong
it's song
he'll back here arms
empty
he's callin twice night then callin again
all know he'll here minute
just another heartache
settle good laugh
oh never can tell

but it's just red red wine
i've been passin up every what if
ooo you're underneath skin
say you'd feel whole lot better
but you'll know when get here
southside lonesome
leslie satcher
but it's fire keeps warm
maybe rough around edges
he's dating doctor gentle nature
when he's out her he's never hurry
cause he knows how much i've suffered
once again did back then
when he said mommy use daddy's glove
kind love hard find
it's got here somewhere
didnt give away
used here somewhere
didnt give away
hid her earrings his pocket
from guilty lonely life she's bound lead
they tried keep undercover
there aint whole lot can do
ones came before
clothes she'd been wearin
i'd gone school christine thuro
heard they did all they could
swear i'll never go down there again
said know just how things are
years she's paid price
till all her tears are dry
this heart mine finally understands
now arms it's plain as day
not sure about hell but know there's heaven
sing when drive
repeat chorus
love that's gone by things didnt do
that's what learned from loving
that's what learned from loving
'cause what if fly
they dont come easy
what if fly
it's clear us it's serious
why do do what do

it's holding tight lettin go
way work together what sets our love apart
help make each other all can
love isnt just those words said

summer goes always has will
never saw fade away
every heart beat before
everything wrong
had share winning
everything wrong
mama's gone crazy 'cause her baby's shot down
they're gonna call sir they'll all stop picking
god bullet have mercy us everyone
but aside from all feel no pain
sirens far away

some call jesus
but now older

passed out floor

little conversation
know never could say anything
story incomplete
let others speak
all times couldnt tell her how miss her
blanket shoulder
when breathing wind
sing lullabye lullabye
miles have gone away
can see million years
look up at sky
thinking underneath mexican moonlight
so can watch all evil room
waiting time fall behind
wine dine do line
it's matter time until they find
wherever go
cant get away from face mirror
everything did
deathly cold
sip tequila give some time
by world filled
moon full stars are bright
thought heard car
wonder where are
things tried say
but you're always polite
hands are shaking lips are cracked
run run run
eyes are jaded complicated
wont give her up
never knew price would go up as such
they finally called away
she said hold hold out
wonder why
keep keep keep
glitter her eyes
he doesnt give fuck he's living under truck
show ray
show ray
as love looking down them
love killer thought
paws claws try not fall
love teacher who lives dark
they say goodbye tomorrow wendy's
any second coming
i'll get pick up truck i'll drive away
am who am it's all can do
cause if cant walk proud i'd rather walk away
when smile dont know what do
when smile dont know what do
all while behind dancing eyes boy crying
cant keep promises just keep naming names
cause was born liar albatross
from god above
i've been told things get better
life hazy hazy hazy
i've been told things get better
when process comes undone
heal these wounds
when kill mother there no other
struggle side mind waste time purest thoughts evaporate
break sun one chosen one time up time due
dont they wish they were blessed
will broken
you'll good citizen
just move move ahead
were lying yourself 'cos were afraid what you'd find
can say vengeance you'll back from grave
land 1000 nos
fucking mess
he said happens every time
wont live up image
have fun
beast you've been fighting
potential vaporization
mind haunting haunting life
reckon forsaken dead
heard too much know too much dont know if can take
constant pain endless rain becomes too much bear
you're dead
dance dead
dark thoughts there are no words
hum increases brain
sad domination by those who say more than you'll ever know
pick own deliverance
amputate shown
there's man who watches over
you're drowning daydream
living dying together never did nothing at all
an abberration deviation get spirit life
got believe
water drips from wells shame
stare deep into frigid eyes man who knows he's lying
or those who think they know their souls
cant play clubs because
think he shoulda known better
pretty soon you'll know all holy mountains fall
through goodbye window
will never forget
money security
supposed feel there must
so busy so involved inyour lie
deserved always gets served
cause stick therefore can break down end time
no more
mind you've found
powerfully twisting words he's resisting
there's no hope
all millions spent aid
empty
what if were torn two
now if was king all rotten
faint sounds alley
rabid pack sirens howling
time tear down what remains
were something
love no affection
both sides scales power
as negotiations grab attention
these are primitive times
these are primitive times
these are primitive times
what not
crippled will tomorrows pill
man they cave
empty
always wanted make difference
so go ahead call dumb
painted smiling face
hear
poisoned planet nuclear war
left rule
where are putting energy
as pressure turns rage
god's word enforced controlled
rabid dogs rabid dogs
lonely boy says come what may
kills dream so sing this simple song
sleeping wing
toobad good ones always have take blame
sweatin line doin 40 wasting time
mister clean
chances shine seven days our fears become entwined
beginning this world selled mankind
put us their hell set our souls fire
technocracy probable cause
technocracy bending laws
growth this planet but
tell what gained
by staying aboard this runaway wreck
while you're losing curve
nihilist turns scrape into gash
so snake keeps recruiting one more royal shooting
but snake just pawn remains when are gone
empty
talking about revolution
empty
crosshairs lined up dead sight
cant even think
but never condemn man
time names will change
voice screaming clear
when bays opened nothing was said
empty
listen few fueled by fire
guess bought gun
then they take their knees again
1494 he did girl next door
empty
stalk circle
filled white noise
was born warm night
she's got red balloon she's gonna sky
wanna plane am red balloon i'll never same
headed berlin
didnt drink
only thing thought say
this time better than last time
but think i'd really die
she says oh no this last time
little discipline can mess up inside
oh this time think shed little light
but feel better today
dreaming underground
cant remember last thing said as were leaven
it's one more night hollywood

every night floating over love

why does she sing
her pain
maybe she just has sing sake song
cant change plan
just because she's been blindly deceived
only lose
from whom she must hide
hold breath ease mind

rode ladder climbed across nation
took cannonball down ocean
could stay here at home alone
met girl autumn her eyes

between bluegrass wavy seas
will not release us willingly
took train form california
oh margery

back chorus
staring at ceiling
confidence eroding
another pair lips eyes
wanna scattered from here this catapult
would sing silence so much rejection
there anything different these days

maybe things are maybe maybe maybe maybe things are different
are all alone
because dying
skies dont seem as near
cant find way home
you've gotta make happen
spend days sunshine
gotta gotta gotta fake
closer
because used
am colourblind
am ready
pull out from inside
smile face
screw all friends

wish you'd make up bed
faster than sun rose
bitter heart will not reveal
crying her baby child

told mamma i'd get home
sunday morning paper dated 1992
when she sees early signs daylight fading
when she sees early signs daylight fading
it's getting cold california

wave life will capture
but need things need
cause can make yourself feel good
cause nothing makes feel so good
might call tonight
or ride downtown some god forsaken land
little boy better wake upcause walking dead
drown myself sky
husbands who said good bye
guess i'll realize day or more
wishing he wasnt suffering same dreams all day long
she walks she line
forces are teeming guns are coming low

all innocence wasted
i'll only stand here
friend implores one time only

baby lets use up
how got these lonesome johnny blues
price pay remain alive
he wound up taking much more than own
earth was without form void darkness was upon face deep
millions regardless
their tears taste wine
tempering weapons criminal lust
tiny red miracles falling likerain
devour sun
jewel more radiant than moon
she lulled away from rich masquerade
sea misted lawn where stone figures forlorn
danced blind acolyte
now know what thou art
but poised nectar within stirs
secrets dead wouldst thou inflict
need fires have lured abominations here
blind reason against thee enchantress
enrobed death's shadow swifter
our fantasies spent
damned
remember night as if were engraved
come friend fate let's raise
damned
shadow miss anne thropy
heart torn apart left rifled grave
death was swift swallow hells life
she stole soul hate had sold away
empty
all heil love fails all hope lies eclipse
but then all soon
limbs ignite
under quicksilver clouds
argentinum spurred
instead harking prophecies
come skyclad arms
buck under flames
love night
dressed sepulchre
amor e morte
bent silhouette sharpen dull razors
from heavens farthest shore
thrown east before midnight masses
this grave mistake
never fucking more
ran blood through scarred ravines
bruise upon heart lingers
empty
coming days
through rich whores corridors
as he wrote smote
stars overall
catch sight seams
knew not her name
nightfall take hand
thank midsummer rain
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons sylph
pleasured dead speak her
heart though unhealed
where feral hordes impart temper
supreme vampiric evil
love vein
satan robed ecumenical filth
empty
how storm fulfills
rule as master here
this darkness forever more
empty
am he
this response all evil chose
crippled seraph shalt cower illustrious courts
covenants are struck jagged lightning fellates
psalmed sunset thus portends
lucifugous kisses enwreathed mist
whipped welted neath barbed windsong
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed
her zenith come
her lustre eviscerates
commit this world thy ancient
where twice sliced all hope from
whose beauty fostered poets
lengths mesmerised
forever tongue
floods tears so well refined
empty
place eve bitter parody hails
heart no more maintains
side side their diversions
oh gilded cunt
teeth storm
dirty little soul frigger
waiting cold cell when bell begins chime
hard stop surmounting terror
if there's god then why has he let die
oh hallowed thy name
ascend smother light
supernal vestments hang tattered
empty
infidel soon unmasks her face
vengeance jesuit blood stone
pursuing ascendancy
witness such violent show
crucify so called lord
there's seven ways go
sea or sky or underground
can take lost soul from grave
as this tragedy starts shattered glass heart
lips attuned symmetry
their lanterns chased phantoms threw
deadly blessing hide
wept 'til tears crept back prayer
espied gleam trodden earth
sought her everywhere
their chapel ablaze all locked pain
final blessing hide
'neath stars marred descending skies
their dark seductive songs
spider eidolons
future he had seen
why has lord forsaken judgment
though she was gone
floor
downward lance
blood runs beasts
desert kingdoms dead
from waking grasp rapists dark
hellish stench
hammer gods prophets teeth
territorial thieves
oblivion our coverlid
please ease burden
no more war
sadistic souls
fresh blood children drops down
passion smell cremation
an overthrow woven light
soft white throat
swallowing her fear
covering her back
spare from wolves
setting maps aflame
should remorse not stay course
oh sweet mary
stayed within her sight
graveside cry
faith lost burning idols
suicide tried tested formula release
no light nor reef
stays within sight
blaze once veins
forbidden once bound die
winter spawn from barren thighs
will their god bridled love
are what are what shall again
death would claim
smoke has choked these vistas
lipped blood secrets pried
saw their lust still stain her thighs
was
wherein even crown prince hell
would burn morrow
pray as held sway upon losing her
cant keep living this
empty
so let's head home now
can take or leave
empty
trying find
gonna face tonight now
from grain
upon lip
but rapture
sin was
her return
break make fluttered heart amiss
love would have conquered all
thou art pale hecate
nothing will keep us apart
leave them lifeless broken
come black goddess arise
hidden lusts will break gates swarm
this state bliss
mad caliban manner
they call bad
mouldered where older
theres nothing mouthful venetian tar
passing fad
grave
wont have peace mind
hangman today
saw silver lining hidden mushroom cloud
white assassin painted black
this garden gethsemane
sip blood red wine
as restriction bled from veins neck
as wild hunt careers through boughs
stand enthralled
all destroyer
darkness will hasten devour
storming from tired centuries
there will no act or passion wrought
there was heaven
wayward stars absent marred
sculptured lips seraphim
basked glory flew
raped russian dolls
shining feriluce
was taken up as far seemed
marbled arc angels
dancing statues pale moonlight
am methuselah tribulation
her radiance again
promise overkill
those darkened waters spur
inscribe all names god has left
clutching their trinket crucifix
bathed virgin white night
where vengeful dead
lost souls begging resurrection
masturbating her dagger
empty
will yield this witch thee
her lord at war would cruelly slain
from crag jagged mountains seemingly grew unease
yet her beauty spun webs
ravens winged her nightly flights
not her coven suitors
she swore priest sighed
her confessional box
but there orgiastic hell
cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
sodomite's grasp
promise burn
hexes six tripled their fees
flanked by barbed lightning hissed storm
she feared light
half spurned from pulpit
must avert mine eyes hymns
she feared light
when her sins were washed off
than mirrored revelation
through snow dank woods sodomite's lair
where witch scholared her
through mist marsh where they showed
she was widow from god his wrath finally
might pollinate world
will always want
eve cum
tree plundered but have see
tonight flames
assure place paradise here
eastern sword must fall
sharing more than sexual excess
snow fallen thick
slip tongue
girl pearl necklace her
so paradise
this wanton witch white rapids sister
one night bliss could not dismiss her
as masters rule this flaming humanity
under cold stares mars maligned
raise hellhounds teeth edge
damnation under gods seeking recompense
when needle askewed
even death paled compare
by alighting darker spheres
her spells upon black count
when their eyes moonstruck met
beasts hand from keep
excite bleak advance
whilst pensive souls at zero sing
such elderly loins enflamed
yet still she seethed
empty
future coming
rip back out
death comes ripping
sickle constellations
soon kept
smouldering faith
nature beast as revelations arrive
death season
seraphim shall sing
when we've bled upon our knees
bored vaudeville
miss libertina grimm
though dead always pleased her more
final dance will cue
those tortured souls just
evanescent scent decay
sex sex sex
empty
black
all through red september
would dark nails faith
six feet deep incision
nymphetamine nymphetamine
than pillars salt
prayer loneliness
empty
empty
licked ransacked
at dusting ledgers seraphim
across his silent lips
as if her limbs imbibed his tongue
part ii
temptation bloomed found room rise
great sacred tree
sister midnight comes blaspheming
conceived such iniquities
hang every verb
going down as day
back crack her tomb
arching toward fabled
were as wolves preying inside fold
conspiracies secrecies sorceries laced
succulent succubus
before coronation vocal aspirations
desire fire
screamed supreme again
aeons reversed two
first degree murder ravens
abyss edge
down dark steps history
limpid rags resurrection
whose kiss glittered sleep
thief come after dark
night awaits baited thighs
cream mortal kind
their crystal skirts
i'll make pray
bleeds their borders
even man who pure heart
black side glass
sharp eyed impassive whore
thistled ruin garbed around thy heart
impaler lord
foam flecked nightmares drag moon
unto us wait patience
nakedness their ochre flesh
trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
raven feathered dress
satanic tyranny
yet all tongues are not true
mathistrises dont give damn
kindred spirit graveyard
gothic towers tottered her heels
take reins pleasure
vengefull call grace
iplintered her coffin lay floor
concern save aeons left
her corset laced arsenic
heaven where thou didst reign deeps
lips distend ending time falter
strung where crippled vultures dare
cracks grin so wide hides stars
sowers discord growing wars reap
sunset expect
lightening freezes seven
once forests spired
come drumming thunder
disintered writhe lone survivor
martin suicide notes heart strings
thanks perversebeauty6aolcom filth7986hotmailcom correcting track 9 lyrics
frowned winding steps down
burning brand countenance god
torchlit shadow theatre souled
fills void timbred pain
attune whipped trees
so came into sweet lady
she's just devil woman
then looked those big green eyes
stay away cunt
evil her mind
she's gonna get
forgive us our debts as also have forgiven our debtors
from dark forsaken time
as written damn
as lightning runs bifurcate tongues
dirge inferno
senates enemy seats
vatican satins burn
since covened ark
beyond her grace where love would die
thenceforth nile reddened
yahveh burned dark
laid bones made throne
skinning mine her firstborn
through wilderness
vengeful ancient breed
black velvet painting sprung elegant life
kisses took fever fever demise
shall flit through shadows
thy fragrant words warm within wine
dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
v empire
ebony dressed sunset
all closed books virtue
engineered by doug cook assisted by dan turner
models supplied by sugar babes bond
seven brides serve seven sins
spurning darkness
when brigantia spoke her soul
once more
rove rally once more
pour
lest hope glory are regarded as foes
trusted keep
deflowered by powers
disturbed though by recurring crimes
without her there
across shifting abyss
loose her harness
dread thereafter
as worms beneath rise
wicked acts are endless through crimes cannot name
wicked acts are endless through crimes cannot name
preaching peace mercy 'neath shadow knife
burning into fire
from cradle enslave
an ancient tryst catastrophe
as devils bay concensus space piss
see serpentine eyes
buried vanquished reason
rear tragedies
impress human failure
now what necrophagous second coming backs
hid hissing serpent libido
what use are prayers god
darkside mirror always threw our malice back
this end everything have ever known
this end everything
dreaming sodomies
she isnt hard please
she fack helpless body she just raise speed
she suck core
just when this torture seems end
golden dawn
he licked spittle from cheeks wry
erased trace taste bitter wines
shame their crawl from grace
all sharpened claws blunt discharge
seduction both woman man
as she graced her window ledge
what wicked wonders lie within comfines
born burial gown
she was found
bless foot forward all
an orphaned gypsy nymph
panther's den
unloosed chain her god given cross
born burial gown
sibiliant at last
garden swell terrors
borne by carnal winds
shall thaw this gnawing frost
set her her rightful place
upon these earthen fields
wounds lips curled
when her sheets ran royalty red
too long have skulked drifters
praise shedding masquerades
over cemetery sundown
suffer from graveless name
rise again
spirit bars annihilation
dying depart
those whores have fled darker days
when killing moon risen
red shore roaring sea
they will never desecrate soul
tourniquet topaz
society at court
as whipcord house dog
elizabeth mysterious
her dead reflection
spirits too trapped under glass commune
disciple scars
inside every gate
empty
carven deep upon church doors damned
raise stakes
beat wings glass as thunder cracks
an inquisition outs
gossamer shrouds
there was war heaven michael his angels fought against dragon dragon fought his angels prevailed not neither was their place found anymore heaven great dragon was cast out old serpent called devil satan which deceiveth whole world he was cast out into earth his angels were cast out him
surface earth covered rime
frigid return chamber ages
killing joke worn thin breath
bucks fizz amyl nitrate
bonesaw backseat
hard blow house cards
light where faith leads truth astray
at blurred edges or reason 'til was fulfilled
aah aah ahh i'll let sleep when am through
freeze romance where angels bare
kissed her mouth dark red rose
must now obey
written dead night
when heavenly judge juries
brides old goddesses all
am still lovesick mina
though her eyes still held fire
twixt her cold silent hips kissed
prophecies libidinous scourge
but this mere foreplay war
its obsidian light
reason seek life again
world unfurled at last
memories scream
as zyklon beats reign make carrion crawl
only once dark doth misery cease
using them all
curve moon haunted shore
our rites sin
always poised winter
graced vomitorium
but not one word possessed
lay welcome by western gate
as she weaves her witchcraft
samhain mist
wreathed leaves
makes stars
preachers beg our clemency
see dead stars collide
instrumental stripping gods
riding wide astride horns madness
licks royal milk
neuter lash her slaves
skewered doves
gushing from shattered silence
her laughter
perrenial gore
seeking blood curdle
shalt sound aloft crashing waves
oh mr crowley did talk dead
then scattered afterbirth
want know
am nemesis
cowled utter grief
now drown loss worth fighting
empty
when daughter's eyelids closed
bears hatred western world
am nemesis
black heart
get frightened too
it's not so hard understand
keep
empty
sometimes world as you've
everything will turn out fine
weak midnight promises love
twelth moon arose ghostly voice
rorasa enshadowed eternal life
dark nature clasp soul
rise as phoenix taloned nightly taking prey
am he vanquished death
nymph lascivious aphrodite
untold was pain
come above unto
sick weak from condition
am circled prey
christening stars
could always find
none better
lead river
faced when left
once upon time
this lust vampyric addiction
back forest
christening stars
could always find
none better
walt aldridge longacre
it's all over town
but somehow always beats home
just blue tick hound

tank full gasoline
as knot comes untied
there's memories mountains each one gets hard climb
woke up this morning made sweet love
all hesitation falls
wrapped up inside where want
river ran through howard county
was roughest kind roadhouse
then clouds rolled back rainbow came
'cause there's symbol wrath heaven
aint got no money
now could worry
there's only one thing matters
yeah there's only one thing matters
time stood still
these days seem years
one minute playing sandbox
may not from royalty
those movie stars dont have everything
million more go
this old car around
but his song he turned life
looks i've got tiger by tail
well losing weight turnin mighty pale
well losing weight turnin mighty pale
time wont make what's wrong alright
feeling all those memories black white
empty
repeat chorus
saw floatin eyes
no dont wanna go home tonight
oh one understands pain
should enough tell
we're just beginning
there's no date letter unopened
loved enough leave unopened
though words go unspoken
but please dont wave goodbye
but you're not by yourself
why should care if found somebody new
oh heart was never really there
oh didnt care enough keep around
oh heart was never really there
dont see all tears
oh say it's all head
how hard not beg stay
there was ten years old
no never too far gone love there wherever may
but instead being angry
pray god when he does
lying here
these are moments
yeah right here this moment
every prayer has been answered
no could not ask more
there's no place far
if had run if had crawl
sunrise
these dreams we've been chasing
oh tomorrow will keep
are willing
offer love
repeat chorus
aint funny how

without those kid's man aint nothin
instead stuck out this road
so when everything just gets much
chorus till fade
empty
drink beer eat some chips
telling heart didnt need
need know can see smile each morning
cant fight what feel anymore
hardly ever see face
if find little earth stand
dont want face tomorrow
if find little earth stand
standing at edge this cliff
no one's ever found way stop time
let take down
search myself everyone
adia thought could make
it's easy all falter does matter
it's hard at end day
endlessness fear
make up all lack
silent reverie
will solid ground
you'll still burning so bright
will all worth
into valleys

shadow death
empty
as edens sixth day now all you've been allowed
hills fire darkest hour
fear not you're just dreaming
all feel black white
everybody loves when you're easy
all feel black white
as walls are closing
'cause want what pleasin
frightened weak
underneath skin
but gonna take look around though
strut rasta wear
smile wont wash away
holding holding
just when need one
fun all children call
christmas time here
oh could always see
every little part
they're wanton discovery
when will only end misery
dear god
did make mankind after made
cant believe
father son holy ghost
dont tell it's too late
where every tongue wagging
know would not hesitate
conjured this temptuous rage
apparitions soul
dont know how
do what have do
all feelings they remain still life
our time gone
shelter give them shelter from coming storm
give them shelter give them shelter from coming storm
give them shelter give them shelter from coming storm
am sinking
cant help this longing
believe
holy infant so tender mild
son god love's pure light
came close heard voice
open doors would soon shut
never where want
hey said can keep things they've come take home
glass almost empty
where webs snow are driftin
let life offend
i've always tried read eyes
was pallet steaming
it's strange world
holding nothing when there's nothing left lose
but steady there now
you're no good
leave here burning
life i've left behind
take
sweet
would one fall
cold winter's night was so deep
three wise men came from country far
born king israel
his blood mankind has bought
now are scattered wind
never really tried or so seems
funny how seems all i've tried do
fades away morning dew
time here
know cant resist trying reopen sore
just need little more time
just shadows move across wall
until can breathe again
until can see again
sweet embrace
born one love gets so high
now mind struggling
empty
easier redeem
revealing all shame what's been lost inside us all
but words cut loose fires left soul bleed
crowds were standing staring faceless cutting off view
lay down beside then
oh know would death
doesnt mean love any less
empty
color sky havana lake
lord kiss once more
lord kiss once more
this this christ king
joy joy christ born
thoughts lead only see one way
everything was beautiful
was meant
will always love
every hour spent together
lie awake try recall
love
keep this moment by by
do down here
right before our eyes
light has fallen amongst living dying
bring what am able
saving souls still cold
presents tree
heaven earth shall flee away when he comes reign
worshipped beloved kiss
into night
into night
will stare at sun until its light doesnt blind
into fire
am spark fade
but dont have hold what real
was looking someone
trembling hands she reaches up
she cradled us
longing cold hollow
but go blind filled fear
silent stars go by
proclaim holy birth
dear christ enters
went lickety splickly
just wishing i'd stayed little longer
stars beginning fade
it's just another
birds winter have their fling
do want see miracle
ordinairy miracle today
at night as lay sleeping they come herds
cold wind blows right through made hollow shell
there way out
dont worry will find answer if let go
dont worry will find answer if let go
have take myself away from
already knew
until dying day
never felt before
memories trapped time
just close eyes dear
hold down
follow without pride
where there hatred let sow love
giving receive
you're one true thing know can believe
make feel less crazy when otherwise i'd drown
put little love heart
world will better place
hoping find some comfort there yearning feel free
memories stirred inside us struggle fight
face blinding sun wake only find
ice thin come dive
tried move around pain but oh
serpent's tale has come undone have no
they're putting up reindeer
wish had river so long
could skate away
made baby say goodbye
do they fill up emptiness
mesmerize all who are caught glare
please come home
this heaven no one else but
believe
live life way feel right
if choose
cost was so much more than could bear
past could undone
better should know
one slip before know
face newborn child
but fear have nothing give
theres nothing i'd better than fall
claw solid ground
havent seen this place before
know can love much better than this
if feel rage wont deny
if feel rage wont deny
wont fear love
sunday gloomy
empty
it's hell long way home
dont tell have never been there
you're shaken bone
will good
hope have fun
world so wrong if want
what have done if want
without any fear
from now
have yourself merry little christmas now
know you're best friend
see another day will praise
lie awake pray
draws each breath as if were last
seemed burden was hers alone
stretched from ear ear
let calm seek
without
too long
deep hollow earthly desires
so silent stole from bed
dont let life pass by
so tired but cant sleep
once there was darkness deep endless night
weep not memories
better than anything else i've tried
twist turn avoid
words deceive more more
so take all this noise into brain
i'll say thousand words or more
believe loved when completely by myself alone
believe only ones who disagree are millionaires
believe cant appreciate real love until you've been burned
find baby
all around want
cold chardonnay chilled day
all around want
pick up things you're star
never known
when madness stops then
do say
you've never known
will alone
groove tonight
you're never safe 'till see dawn
move closer passion stronger
carry keep romancing
it's bringing knees
it's bringing knees
yeah think about all time
feel magic building around
know feel walls are closing
when feel all alone
can mend broken heart
let one call
you're fire inside man
fever burns heart
fever burns heart
just return heart 'cause know i'll find
you're fire inside man
feelings aggression are absence love drug
cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
but heartache misery
if cant find way out these problems
more than angry words hate this silence
but lately i've been down upon knees
now dont live exist
might need hold tonight
mozambique or was veronique
imagination racing
well dont care no dont care
oh no cause dont care
get away out this city
dont talk much anymore
are still same
know never really treated right
dont recognize this place
see future an instant
there's just no rhyme or reason
am complete now found
just hold tight
empty
what live
who swimming raincoat
magenta feelings take up shelter
empty
well bet he'd cool
well bet he liked gaultier
'cos wonder how we'd deal if he just passed by
bet speeder bike he'd turn his back all
i'd never let down when you're fix
watch her mangle truth while take bait
you're just slave grind she grew tired baby
you're just turning yourself inside out no need
just sip wine could mine
just twist time could mine
just sip wine could mine
broken glass
'cause if you're making all these
can force dont want
floating high feet dont
hey baby
coffee from
am anything want
santa monica boulevard
am anything want
wouldnt know
love really tragedy way
keep locked away from all world
just so could win
when superstars cannonballs are running through head
wind hair sand at feet
empty
there's thought now decide
frightened believe
roller coaster riding love
these are things would do love
you're best thing about
could best thing about
ever since you've been gone
have given mine away world didnt want anyway
love
but standing at doorway

all her hopes stars
she packs her bags outer space

all things really matter
letter flies away
yeah i'll fly away
aint lot time left star
never feeling bitter
empty
every drink downing
if there's not another way
silhouetted against sky
his mind he was already there
youth he thought asleep
marked blackjack guillotine
dont want look across waves
empty
as tears passed between them
as they crashed thought heard them say
cold reality
but will relate
lost here glaze
i'll tell die
there's nothing can do
never ending suicide
razor sharp
leaves stain
empty
goes yards
mind awaiting its cue
empty
ocean said first time was friend
he never thought dangerous
reason still say
do feel you're captured by grace witch
power so divine
watch as
an echo night
pull back somehow
contemplating years
shadows seething
screams without sound
when souls selling
when said please listen all
close eyes close door
carries
waiting dark destiny
dark when moon down
burn night away
one kindness
should chance die
played as he stood his trance
have all spirits meet
it's time learnoh city beneath surface above
total illusions tales
will mentor
supply amusements
can tell where are
right wrong
till turn light
walked back along beach
can no longer resist
though he tried wipe his eyes
when young child he looked back
as they walked out sight
keep them shelf
they're good conversation
crying crying love
crying crying love
till took him down
hanging round
there are certain things cant explain
taste i'll taste
tied up she gets wild
skull session
seems just dont see
never even tried
instead statues
surely must care
so pled case
he never closed his eyes
watching waiting
old man tell what have become
old man tell what have become
empty
run away no delay do have show
empty
wake every morning
another drink another fight
am losing way
rides into night
dont know why
behind thin disguise
i've been runner
red eyes sunken stark
somewhere they seek day
these streets
while streets glisten
she's got hot look
empty
stuck
stuck
boy aint seen nothin yet
dont talk over
twist mind then let go
mixed whiskey
concrete terror
victims pain
prisoner hell
live dead
telling dreams
telling dreams
he's traded his life glass full tears
runaway reasons
runaway seasons
desert look water
he
could grant this last illusion
could keep our lives together
then placed sand from beach inside
did ever really want
hourglass no longer sits by ocean
their boat had reached shore
until captain had been caged
their journey at an end
waded shore
born see
or youthful king
know they brought down
shouldnt play fire
straight
well it's overdue yeah
they cut
leave rage
believe love life
that's price pay
dear god
hear
do think it's wise
believe what prophets said
world ignorance
dont hear
felt his world collapsing
though he spoke little english
miguel was held as refugee
wonder what captain thinks
old sailor before him
so come i'll draw line just pick side
he wonders if his neighbors might leavingso he makes little offer they'll understand
am word without deeds lie exceeds
all really need right now
somewhere long empty road
what would still remain
been searching years
can hear call name

bodies touching heart heart
died lady disguise
look beyond her crystal eyes

cry out
join hands pray
shatter darkest lights
can hear battle cry yeah
runnin 'gainst devil
keeps collar
sonic blast right through their ears
life trapped inside maze
pleasure victim pain
why did they send him away
doused cat gasoline
cant held by any cage
digital clone
soldiers satan
midas knight
moment undone
always calling
distance
morning's distant fear
or could only one
have waited this way
perhaps it's better world
no no time doesnt wait
cant take away
watching silence hesitate was not plans
placed our years hourglass they were never unearned
empty
cant make promises all based upon tomorrow
empty
nighttime again
but no one seems around
'cause dark strange come out
safely unknown
if there always seen
all those moments yesterday
there'd no redemption
saw too
there's no one pray now
ocean never said word
have run between dragons teeth
though seems still have time left
maps every breath
well out sight land
life i've closed every door
she once more disagreed
needs or wants men
empty
stands all alone see
far more rarely wise
as he stood near rusting dock
bound luscious chains
such an action
broken broken heart at seams
tried suicide
away from all should meet
he had sailed her round world
when he tried close his eyes
his lungs had screamed breathe deep
say this thing cannot
stared out across sea
thousand steps her arms
she tells better life
she's unusual
name
starts tire
eyes begin stare
visions fighting past
watching night turn into day
one more pointless battle
warriors warriors
warriors warriors
washed out washed out
washed out washed out
dark

christ has risen
tv mounted wall

jester drinks starts think
empty
well worn hourglass
he had no mountains left climband his last name was magellan

taking up slack

got lybia got russians
every country's got bomb
rage war 4 times
searchlight trail hear sirens wail
will not go back still run
how could break heartwalking down avenues
empty
just stepped back watched slide
no one leaves
bits dreams all line
horses never tell
when he had time
but somewhere heart know
all throughout ride
an old waterlogged wreath
from another's grave
woman who showed no fear
they never felt pain
moving swiftness
raise fist metal child
power night
screaming twisting banging
power night
people walking over turn at store
rage rage rage rage
but you've really pushed way too far
so please dont turn away

cant get over how all wound up
which inspire heavenly song
gloria sweetly singing o'er plains
empty
but what gave them right
four years smoke had cleared

they tried lose us hype fortune fame
leave guitar i'll have an ax grind

got sweetest promise there has ever been
'till dont want 'till dont want no more
got sweetest promise there has ever been
it's good life livin
who walks talks know who

talking heads talking us television
1 900 look into crystal

played toy
alice said have forgotten what will
until twilight fades
get away
said better stay
'fore lose mind
try put back together
watch shadows fall across floor
through cruel hallways
lights barriers
feel slipping every day
where do stand when it's all over
guess dont care about nowwhere do stand when it's all over
truth less little town
unconquered unreal
fill head everything find
count miles before they pass by
can go back moments held before
there's things wont believe
should stay or should hide
changing memories they fade away
empty promises lonesome town
heard wings you're going die
i'd never seen face here
when walked into room
one touch leaves mark upon hand
dont hide ashes
'cause know what's coming then
see coming way run
let us know
until destinies dissolve
certain keys were held until they must have let go
know they're just repeating
now cant come back
but know they're just repeating
walk cold rain
some experience we'll go
days within glass cube
anything here see wrong reality
i've seen what you've never seen
i've left what you'd never leave
but now can repeat 2x's
girl behind mask
never been dream where she could seethe girl behind mask
if get back her i'd walk away into forest
walking down different kind plain
can reach hand
why dont close eyes
sound ocean destroys silence
pathway
well eyes are out soul cold tired
where million images are spun just one
eyes sun
getting high alone
hands clock stand where have walk
everything inside burningwater so cool its thoughts seem soothe
what are gonna do
house dark everybody's happythe time light over
never said
lies coming light
she lies no one
walked past all life
i've been down so many roads
i've been down so many roads
if pass square
everybody wants sleep but
ah ah ah
remember only one who only had dream
cos you're this dream hanging'
see green beyond blue
cos you're this dream hanging same as first
until gone you're sure cry some more
think it's time go
troubled times worry
turn head away
drawing breath from thin air
walk through this sideyeah music's coming down
push against wooden table
it's nail into cracking ice
never know where twain shall meet
drop feathers will never fly
crawling wounded child
late last night early this morning
try wait sky fall
oh mind
if you'll only look into yourself
reflect best come back
everything got it's hung line
shine lonely light
that's what said
get lost eyes
cause mind racing just wanna stay
desert wind would have grin
empty
an unspoken claim
hardly time one last look
one that's deep inside
gonna turn only key
holding onto world changed
waiting here
know way creep crawl
blood red rain window pane
ivy wall
little water
something's going wrong inside
something's gone wrong inside
nowhere soul felt
nothing left innocence
when think suns gone dead
lines are forming circling round eyes
we're going nowhere so much faster
disappear just ghost left over from another day
lost thoughts lonely girl
wanting her still
candle burnt

counting down from ten it's time
when man at stop light catches
getting anywhere
we're speaking tongues
we're wasting our time
down wishing well
not even angels saw
who who have become
now damage done
all toil all exhaustion
shattered dreams all down
just bitterness remains
stern cold man what am hard relentless
i'll last close last close eyes
equipped hundred swordmen
awaiting winter frost
thousand men crossbows
sign dark cold
behind seven seas
confusion will rule till die
wander between these worlds
nofaded dream
sandman stab back
bleed arms wounds within
fall from grace as offer sin
no looking back life once had
life kicks us teeth
yet go onwe go
yet something makes us crawl back more
yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
hear these words say
each funeral just makes us realize
this momentary trail
now can no longer see shine
could seem doing fine
has only led back hell
flame thou wisdom greatest
set world fire
piss upon graves where thy enemies are laid
raise gun take aim blow away
put bullet through head
love death
will wait
may death again us unite
now game over it's all gone
wounds are too dry more bleeding
think about all positive sides life
when master slave his life
all tears fears lies cries
it's great lose control
leave no room happy endings
need burn reach point no return

pagan reign nature
he shall promise no salvation but let see what imminent
rocks this human cradle grave
from dark side moon
praying her soul as this blood hands stains whole
gone are those nights by side
no more beating as one no longer burns flame
remaining moments
melancholy hole soil so hard cold
freezes heart desperate heart
lay depressed hollow
now come haunting every night
oh yeah will
they had seen salute flames sky
am not one them
through all life
obsession are feeding
strongest love our death will
open eyes realize
was dying dead
slowly turning dust
hate

born fight built last
hate burns scars within our minds
battle which no one will prevail
where humanity gone
this end liberty
so long have become night
make glow go away
dying it's so bright
where there no light day
if ceased exist or was never born at all
than flutter air these wings so weak torn
shadows cast so palefuneral spring now
funeral time again
two at feet two at head
two carrying at where hands are laid
dont care
when comes onto her again
dont go yet dont yet go
some strange way
really couldnt think anything more
those hollow containers souls
i'll throw first rock
peace mind death
sacred memory myself
they're back again
rain bathes ground
as our loves wither away
killing killing
kill kill kill again love

really have left here
blood heart beats no more
leave this world behind
loving death
nicely slowly enjoying pain
as blood flows shore
below into abyss
now lay wreaths
down half mast
forward forward go into attack
our men from all around
no forward forward am not turning back
as approach our final fate
new dawn man
this end
then descend
if there's heaven heathen
forever lost

goals i've set myself are far beyond mortality
i've been before this ground
losers shall drop

russians fire another round
without tear draw parting groan
no one can show us right way
sweat feel air too thick breathe
well hey now what did expect see
disillusion
things you'd see
way gonna go not way want go
sailing our personal seas sorrow
then came snow which covered ground white
came cold wind
there no sight third eye
dozen eyes an eye
right track bastards
dozen eyes an eye
was born one foot grave
think existence as flame death as rain
that's all are
are but falling leaves air hovering down
hey little sister who's one want
it's nice day white wedding
it's nice day white wedding
streams pour through an altar
eager show those who see
but those good times were always worth waiting
what long strange trip this has been
you're light at end tunnel
when dusk falls obscures sky
empty
aching
everything's blessing disguise
does what she can
crawling through
compatibleno communication
it's mind
she calls goliath wear david mask
have become cumbersome this world
no no no yeah
she's wanting less
he said devil boy what have done
augustinians kept themselves stuck their tongues out row
i'll burn bridge 1000 times cross bear
heavens sakes
little motivation goes long way down
every situation heavy traffic jams his sound
you've got wonder moving best can do
pulls close hear laugh
maybe it's highway
i've got tricked out receiver
but think leave well enough alone
town
i'll teach them sing along
go keep yourself keep from becoming one
hang
paint caves existence colors mind
keeps her head above water
she knows words writing
dont want give or take love dont break dont sink dont think
bet them as much as her blues
there's only one sound love
tell love can king
hear what they say
liquid used surround
dont take much get right back track
i'll bet she's nervous wreck
from their dad's predicament
as start car
clean racks
maybe words dont mean thing
politic angry reason out bed
it's angry slick
talked cousins people who knew
hanging judge town
curled up stared
says gets old real quick
felt
things hide
things hide
she's got backup
marry she said dont reply
daddy said better or you'll die
away from mobility
beat sun from her glory
cuts what she cant untie
what's she trying do
spins
she didnt want play role fool again
know all right because
because needle cant burn
colossal fact daddy's ex dont let read
this kansas wheat wont break
if oven wont burn
air leaks from tire
cant look straight ahead
know will just fades
urban shopping mall
maybe worry
do things hurry
sit useless
she dont need
since cant remember when
tell what i've seen
would never believe
things i've done
reality steps
keeps looking over his shoulder
how live mistakes
pretty shame cant defile
spread out every queen see
know when old only runningonna come
as they crumbled into dust washed into sea
funny how these things come about
'cause i'd seen her minute before
this aint no fucking game
dont go down water's edge she said
know how good wind blows
know how hatred goes so buried mine
now want lovers
save from things cause us pain
they believe now
gotta earn every breath take
feel safe
it's an animal city

que pase junto ti
aprendi querer los gatos
mentiras piadosas
y fue por ti que descrubi

desesperada la operadora
yo siento acabada de nacer
eres tu y contigo
por que este amor ya no entiende
para esta intil
enterrarte en mi memoria
y esconderme para no sentirme
ojerosa flaca fea desgreada
torpe traste testaruda
mi tu anatomia
bruta ciega sordomuda
y aunque diga ya no mas
empty
torpe tonta lenta necia desquiciada
es todo lo que he sido
pero vas vencer asi nomas
ten un poco de compasin por mi
pero ese sentimiento es mas fuerte
before didnt give damn 'bout what they say
dont so hard this
'cause not here let down
dont so hard
cuentas conmigo
porque no tenemos barreras
cuentas conmigo amor
que cuento contigo
dando vueltas en pars
y qu pasa si son ellos
los han visto en los cocteles todos
la que canta esta cancin
que te hicieron por ah
ya vas ver como va
ya vas ver como van sanando
la lgria sec
ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
y hoy vuelvo ver
ayer te busqu
y quiero pensar
saliste de aqu
ayer te busqu
en las revistas
dando vueltas en paris
y que pasa si son ellos
hasta ofreciendo conciertos
o la que canta esta cancion
para continuar asi
y condenaste una serpiente
perteneciste una raza antigua
yo que soy un caos completo
y de sueos blancos
y que dios nos ampare
las mujeres se casan
y renunciaste al paraiso
un pepino tu destino
cada cosa calculada
empty
asistir al colegio
y aunque asi no lo quieran
ms se que estar bien
tus rutinas de piel
y mis labios se ven
y tus ganas de huir
how can give what dont have
but you're so love yourself
keep aiming top
que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
que desaparezcan todos los vecinos
y que quede aqu despus del ocaso
que se arruinen los canales de noticias
y el beso que inventas cada dia
que se vayan uno uno los amigos
despues del ocaso
cuando intento no pensar
de caminar
de tanto no tocarte duelen duelen
yo quiero que vuelvas
si sabias que eras para mi
y ahora que estas aqui
que parta hasta los huesos
sesenta de cintura
busco eternas primaveras
algo mas que dar
mi primer amor
que renazcan la vida
es el sueno que ahora libera
lo siento tan directo al corazon
huracan de emociones
mi otra verdad
dont wanna clear cobwebs from head
ready goodtimes
oh oh oh oh
as long as you're shelter every night
now not alone
cuz these are rules us
you'll always
chorus 2x
no escaparon con suerte
donde lo que no se quiere se mata
nunca come en exceso y jamas duerme desnudo
y las hormonas presentes
donde lo que no se quiere se matase mata
ay payita mia
yo se que no he sido un santo
no puedo pedir los olmos que entreguen peras
y no de excusas vivi yo
que mi negra no castigues mas
ay ay ay
se lo que voy
empty
un error convertido en acierto
que ya deje de verme nia
pero tanto que te pienso no te hara mirar
luego bailar bajo la luna
lejos de tu amor y sin salida mire
lo que siempre fu
es que vuelvas mi vuelvas mi vuelve
ten consideracin y no dejes sufrir
bleibe baby bleibe baby
desde hace poco algo nuevo nace en mi
dicen que hasta veo fantasmas o que estoy emproblemada
si estoy contigo en el desierto soy feliz
mis dias sin ti son tan absurdos
chatarra inservible basura en el suelo
chatarra inservible
ahogandome en llanto
necesitas alguien que te sale la pasion
siento que falta el aire si no estas aqui
tu necesitas de mi de mi
y tu corazon esta sangrando
tu necesitas de mi de mi
ya de fiesta fiesta cada vez aburro mas
tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
no creo en mi todavia
no creo en venus ni marte
de tus alas siempre ser el viento
ti nunca podria decirte que no
que nadie mas te amara asi
empty
pesa ms la rabia que el cemento
y que tu edad sepas bien lo que es
it's not her fault she's so irresistible
not mother
but you've got know small things also count
this pathetic
dont count boy
hasta que entiendas que
te quiero porque eres claro
para liberar tensiones luego ya de revisar
con quin al menos tranquilo
si falta de ocupacin
pobre de dios que no sale en revistas
el octavo dia dios despues de tanto trabajar
anda esperando paciente por alguien
si falta de ocupacion
pobre de dios que no sale en revistas

porque mi amor por ti es total
sin ti

toalla arena en mi odo
en tus ojos
peligro peligro
seras el primer actor
y decidas otra vez regresar
tal como quiere

con defectos con errores
desde la redondez de tus labios
cuando miro en tus pupilas se que dios no dejo de existir
igual yo reconozco
solo con hablar

en los dos en los dos
porque se que este amor es lo mas bello del mundo
se que no regresaras
se que te perdi
estoy enloqueciendome
es cuestion de tiempo y fe
compartimos mil secretos
si un milagro puede ser

cuando llamo yo
pues pierdo sin tu amor
el diario en el que escribo
porque nunca podre vivir sin ti
la fe con que vivo
y cuando miras atrapa tu mundo y siento distinta

constantly consumes mind
does anybody even notice
priests condemned
church will belong dead
destruction charged upon cross

waters getting warm so might as well swim
fed rules hit ground running

cool boys playing pool stop stare at way she moves
asteroids bounce off her trampoline
but joke getting tired old dangerous

today sat up half asleep stared
every day see sinking low
disconnect dots way
its time go town
under radar
we've tuned out
if didnt notice
all planets line disco ball
who did know coming up
fifteen minutes you're neanderthal
here i've gotta stay
aeroplane passes by
right side wrong bed
right side wrong bed
road man he dont mind police man
who was crushed by his beloved sound system
have known forever
asteroid will infiltrate soul
they'll laugh they'll stare
we're so invisible them
dress codes one too many people there
locomoting groove
now she's gone she turns
empty
jackie o did she know did she know
she turns
heard them say dont square
anything strange wrong
holdin old mans sneakers
were there at start we've got polaroids prove
can help us find ones missing posters
use super powers rescue
can really see future or just predict weather
there fine line wearin thin
it's becoming so insane
got hands turn this around
loud clear
got voice fillin this room
mirror it's see
going back down what worse
never seem ever let up
lose solitude
you're bull ball
all singers booted up
drink 'em up drink 'em up fight fight fight
just all other times before
mind blown but it's own
dont have move groove
get party but too late
check account money's all gone
hey that's story life
get party little too late
think it's fun think it's fun games
so dont wanna fix
no one can see
empty
you're laughing as sinking down
dont know much but have clue
slipped man twenty keys hunsay
gonna keep chrome out ride
cops kids their checkin out ride
hit as it's goin off
been thinkin 'bout what we've become
times havent changed still swimmin
tell kid exactly where not go
can taste blood
everyone wanted hear
know its over
are set
where have been
swing set
never ever ever
it's no secret
take bow
just time
duck everybody
just time
tomorrow's gonna hurt
every single day just fling
there's nothing left choose
wear underwear steal shirts
get outta hair get outta head
what's man suppose do
she was high she was really bye bye
she packs pipe as much as she can fill
all she could up this
even make jamaican man sing happy song

papers read king dead
problems should too few mention
truth almost always confidential
there was time there was place
doin hopscotch legs tied
holdin what's left real life
it's second hand story no one wants hear
he liked amputation lord above
she read story paper how she was victimized
chance feel normal but now you're too deep
if you're coming might way
beggars choosers
you'll sell children you'll sell wife
at end track two bit shack

it's bitter pill swallow
one less thing call own
that's bitter pill swallow
better get yourself little street smart
there's darkness looming but sun shining bright
beating up until bleeding
street cowboy badge says can do what please
bow down badge colors black blue
wont fill up tank let's go ride
but this place just makes feel sad insidemother do know where kids are tonight
wont fill up tank let's go ride
who'll forgive who's say if it's right or wrong
staying out all time
when everything wanted somehow leaves
they tell which way not go
empty
each one's one million
see something new each every moon
laughing at other end
just how long all this really gonna last
why dont go home crawl into hole
other corner knew i'd there soon
will always busy making misery
forever after happily making misery
money talks these days everybody listens
everybody's listening everybody's listening all those eyes are glistening
dollars shrieking ha ha ha jokes's
who hound at downtown dog pound
i've learned accept not expect
know it's hard nice when hate becomes vice
empty
it's never
do think maybe could teach something
it's not asking hold up sky
gotta home by seven
no one will know what wear
will never get another piece
but still trying find this blackoutwhere it's warm inside always open late
but i'll wake up front steps door
sold out their trades become drug dealers
pacify all killers rapist
but you've gotta show up yourself at end day
one fine day pilgrims came
hoping something cracks
now understand this no mans land
twist into shape
there's nothing have here
it's enough make sick
gonna let wash all over
when reach some understanding
there's no time
i've nothing write home about
every one just looks away just any other day
no one told i'd taken fool
know just cowboy
aint got nowhere
are all done
he's bumming nickels bumming dimes
instant millionaire without care didnt change thing
talked him that's what found
there'd enough go around if could just get around
nobody's working it's gone far too long
go sneak up behind
its hard understand things say
'cause morning might dead
but its better way
streets are filled broken glass
every little thing about this tells
every little thing about this tells
as watch walk away
put bone
do want bring him home something
ticket goes two ways
so bring down size
but growing into
there's one thing know that's perfectly clear
forewarned if hindsight all makes right
saving crowds from roar from cutting room floor
flame's burning brightly shines so lightly
almost there
away from jerks away from works
wrapped up haste by mistake got thrown away
stuck inside this fleeting moment
cause homesick home i've never had
call selfish call what you'd think it's right
now want perfection self destruction
just slips out when yawn
if never let breathe
dont know what was hoping
stop truck at truck stop need something help crash
was waiting chain reaction missing link
doorways open up close more ways punchline
but will still laughing
she walks into outhouse
cold air holds her theif
just wants so just anyone
joy pain
look out if know what mean
bitter sad
if can keep up
just keep up
keep up x8
when shine
how get out
living lies hate
dirt around
usually washes out
dirt keeps following
dirt will find
but you've been replaced
give heart but just say make feel whore
by chill gave will ride
but these rules were meant broken make myself uneasy
now if late making wait
it's more than amusement now
everything's so true life when you're not living
saturated liver
it's pretty stuffy under there
wouldnt so hard sink
should have learned swim instead
been down so far dont get wet
pappy taught how float
goin down
waving back folks shore
not quite as blind as might think she'd
they cut off wings replaced them strings
what do think makes her way
mother offers up child preaching channel two
save dear goddamned lord wont please take hand
too far
it's mountain made sand crumbling under
there's ringing ears that's heaven sent
need feel put hands around
but every day get up calm down give up hang around
everything seems darker than before
short dying just other day fell short picking up mop
i've been keeping inside
i'll always side
said want want want want
every time move lips
just stood there shaking stood there shaking
took shot cocaine away run
thought was her daddy but she had five more
where was judged by twelve honest men
wont forget day shot bad bitch down
give up give name
lose cradle chain
give up give name
stay wont stay
never can complain
am someone
if rain wants come can let rain
habits form without warning
dont do this dont touch hey
hey do last time
down up down up
you're wide awake
who do answer when
than expect anything
when watch over am blessed
can cut this diamond rough
slice life last through all years because sooner
faith all things you've come hate give
toilet aint flushing toaster smoking
but he saw world through eyes child
she saw world through eyes child
nixon was liar

day night earth sky
runaway train never going back
i'll spend rest life trying figure out
now know something's wrong
promise wont yell
sir dont even want know
dont even give damn
so make soon
ship fools drunken hearts
i've been loved hated
just ridiculous
just dysfunctional
sick song about how look at life
time flies by vulture sky
waiting by phone
waiting call up tell not alone
leaning hard yet another drug
there aint nothing cant live nothing cant live without
wasting time only find
have seen these closing doors
comes whipping comes whirling
no time choose
undermining all know
little world has lost control but still keeps spinnin
something you're good at use up time
beg some affection
say get out way
said hey brown girl seen tears through window junk shop
nobody's home
oh dont make feel so strange feel even stranger
who grow up become first president
broom knife blood his hands
preacher just left middle service
necklace broke late last night
take rooti cant take always face
she'd talk herself but wouldnt know what say
she held her breath considered death
she always though was 'cause she was too fat
let know
were county line
jealousy just game
must polish all time
she never gets paid
now you're tired day over
wake up let go from somebody used know
trapped at top merry go round
whatever price whatever crisis
whatever price whatever crisis
high society skid row bum
they may say what they say about way stay
you'll never believe things i've found
just had let know cant conceal
early years
hide no more
tearing out what's been trapped
strung out pretty pretty girls forgot about rest world
when end begins again needles needles sticking them
sunday's just another day
she gave this look could not believe
there were just three
here are just three
empty
see open mouth suitcase

right thing changes from state state
naked cold sun

altogether gone
no matter how hard fall nothing can break at all

first steals mind
empty
tried tell her thousand times

lyrics by chris cornell
just add up hot rod death toll
but ugly truth
painted mind

mumbling crying
dont feel calling buddy

stumbled all world fell down

bound die alone
along her vain paradein her uniform
fopped last night night before
shoppin wiggle floor everybody was foppin
fopp right dont fopp wrong

fopped so hard lost shoe
but when were foppin dont mean thing at all
long time coming
if sits upon tongue
throw yourself away
then one went full kevins mom

shoot shoot shoot till their minds

hands all over eastern border
then lay down their oily blanket

holy water rusting
damn water if it's life
now they run hunt down
starved dogs howling run hunt down

whomsoever i've cradled i've put down
hands are shaking
mother says it's alright
music lyrics cornell

since this storyline began
sheltered from nothing but weather

those stars
once thought had passed by

not very good at just paying attention
it's way am you'll never change
this
but should take this what it's worth

inside arms

fuck him
should take
life waste
empty
not place hide
i'd say
i'll always love
explain what have been through
so lighting up cigarette followed pursuit
so turned around forty thousand headmen hit dirt
painter paint scene
play this song
but when hope love has gone
get back up try againthough future's not plain
what you've got he'll take
money's spent all words are said
this time sky i'll sing if clouds dont hear
'cause rock 'n roll putting weight beat goes
yeah you're back into life again
so excited so excited so excited so excited
party's over better walk away
just save party another day
well near end just aint got time
go round round dont know where we're bound
baby this true romance take while see chance
dealer's made another deal
feeling nothing deep inside
feel music inside i'll there too
turn into music now never will lose
feather duster's no substitute real thing
memories i've cherished so long
staring at empty pages centered 'round same plot
every day every day every day oh lord
each day music reach till find song
from cut price lady second hand woman
love's light keeps leading us
oh sight when we're both coming through
sundown coming down too soon no time alone
it's not darkness it's just night's so long
but there was loneliness could not ignore
after spoke deep inside knew
are one needed
makes life carnival
'bout what goes real world such
half us easy other half hard
sometimes think know too much
it's fine line very fine line
spy house love
who hold game
though sometimes does get lonelyi still walk out morning light
here's players who cant leave their song
take as comes
some hot some cool
all plays end there's no curtain call
any day now curtain may fall
an out work musician plays solo saxophone
it's all they can do
woman never minds pulls shade draws blinds
we'll drink our cup laughter
will live while can
lovers try
golden dance life could
while you're living beyond all means
it'll happen as sure as sorrows are joys
see good bad eyes are sad
now free
there's choir singing
thoughts summer sky
time running out
always being criticized being his age
it's no good being lazy
everybody's got gun
there no more unity remind what used
country fresh green
but oh heart hurt keeps keepin
music high sweet then she just blew away
music high sweet then she just blew away
then this life just haunted dream
he said think beauty i've had
say prayer stranger
they say it's new age
all day through here youthe world full players night
when some cold tomorrow finds when some sad old dream reminds
old gray wind blowing there's nothing left worth knowing
laughed saints cried clowns lived up down
show world how feel gonna let them know you're real
let love come down
was there from start got power heart
but there aint no one that's got rhythm
some people get lonely while some people get blue
feel flying
luck's
all sudden so care free well alright
love has brought higher place oh yeah
professing here
love has brought into higher place oh yeah
where would where would
oh oh oh oh
'cause everytime hearing name
except show
he's prisoner but he thinks he's free
take away before day
empty bed she left cold one side
but i'll control feelings
cant believe only
love leavin
caught up flight feeling sight europe dying
did know burning deep inside
take city girl we're gonna buy some clothes
all want one more morning just know night wont stay
all want one more morning then we'll take night come

so glad made so glad made

plant feet little higher
'cause i've still got far go

dont know love will save us after all
aint got no time lovin 'cause time all used up
i've got keep image while suspended throne
watched them fly across fiery sky
can feel light inside can feel everywhere
had stars they kept shining
lived our life story
then all goes by
these three men made solemn vow
he's bound him cart
oh what shambles has been day
let tell now
see walkin car lookin something sweet eat
fill up some way
just did floor
let hear make part
crowd people stood stared
woke up fell out bed
though holes were rather small they had count them all
could shed another million tears million breaths
still love
or wear this pilgrim's cloak or common thief
their fires burn into night
i'll gone long before morning
before lonely life set
still love world
after tears have washed eyes
aint no sunshine when she's gone
hey ought leave young thing alone
i'll rock can build
'cause when it's all one it's one all
one need
now it's all one all love it's all love
she's got flying bird bright june sky
she can all four seasons one day
she's gift from lord or fiend from hell
she can kind
she can all four seasons one day
endlessly sea
if had way i'd take boat from river
endlessly silent tear
were stones workmen found
have ever had feeling
love not around
misspent angel eyes tonight
why angel eyes aint here
if africa escapes starvation
every day goes by
imagine what taxes buy
trapped by insecurities
only thing really know sure
blood runs so red face
lesson once learned so hard forget
never make promises break
from deserts west shining sea
all need another day
beneath desert moon sing
from smallest little bird crocodile
see eastern sky's fire
wanted almost everywhere now
when sat down cried
hadnt had bite eat
had this sense doom
he thinks lunatic
i'd fly away
i've had question that's been preying mind some time
wont long now before puppy goes astray
faut que tu comprennes puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que
could almost hang myself
c'est clair que je laime c'est un fait ton egosme m'inquiete
i'd faithful companion
until this alpha male
je suis consciente je vois bien que tu souffres mais s'attenuera
there's something fishy round here
ta mauvaise foi j'aimerais bien que s'arrte
well there cant nothing worse
could say lost sense direction
could lost inside their lies without trace
there'd nothing left do
there was an old guy beard
cant see nobody better so you'll just have do
had no time worry though there was just much do
he's god's best friend he's got seat board
so said had mission his favourite dove
rock steady rock steady
walk streets money
told once wont tell again
dont subscribe this point view
there no historical precedent
what might save us
i've been searching long enough
spirit moves water
all saints angels stars up above
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
i've been thinking 'bout things believe
if somebody up there likes somebody up there cares
minute saw her face second caught her eye
minute saw her face second caught her eye
it's promise or lie i'll repent before die
send love into distant dawn
but still earth moving so fast
send love
throw pebble watch ocean
fix wounded planet love healing
kind ultimatum note
it's plain see
ask if am mouse or man
if make up mind
wednesday would fine thursday's mind
he does best he can
shadows rain
know clubs are weapons war
but that's not shape heart
know spades are swords soldier
she dont things cook
she dont clothes wear
she might prefer as am
she's too good
royal astrologer was run out breath
he prayed sky but he prayed vain
heavy cloud but no rain
sooner or later learn throw past away
sooner or later
sooner or later world first day
what come here
burn burn
love flows through
horse he kept running rider was dead
here courthouse whole town there
out distance trick brain
but they were smiling subtle dolphin way
guess we'll have say goodbye
but remember all things i've said
that's when need love so bad
cause you're allmost driving mad
write piece paper
empty
christmas day christmas day
christmas day morning
christmas day christmas day
or if could make mine
swear saw
inside every turning leaf
every signpost nature
we'd moon sun
every signpost nature
if ever lose faith
never saw no miracle science
got lock up throw away key
if love somebody set them free
got lock up throw away key
so happy cant stop crying
so happy cant stop crying
something seemed ease pain
so happy cant stop crying
thus wedded woes bedded tomb
inside clocks are filled sand
inside this army's retreat hide beneath thunder's call
love violent star
outside hurricane wont wait
pain instruction
love sister love world has just begun
first son riveter's son
he felt he'd been left desolate shore
caught flare acetylene light
would carry his father he
only strange ship could fly
so far where no grey gulls fly
gentlest breath face
as squinted eyes rain
why are there women here dancing their own
they're dancing their sons
their anguish unsaid
one day we'll sing our freedom
ellas danzan solas
they're dancing missing
why are soldiers here
they dance alone they dance alone
they're dancing their sons
we'll dance
hey mr pinochet
they dance invisible ones
lacked consciences pray
you'll dog star shining tonight
would jesus strike down if should pray
this cowboy song this cowboy life
could see right through all lies told
daddy was businessman
invest wooden caskets
may ask what does profit man
there's war inside religion
war our compassion
this was always doomed fail
always knew
empty
he may driving his wife
tell him heart will break
just making living
next kin no fixed abode
one more night
another set circumstances
tutti frutti au rutti
tutti frutti au rutti
but pretty little suzy's gal
tell them coming back
til this midnight express
new york city spell
know cant late
there's no such thing as meal that's free
cause she said she wont wait
understood rings around moon
until stars grew dim until
here arms when everything seems clear
rope south wind
round cape horn valparaiso
under moonlight there she can safely go
walking moon
walking walking moon
walking moon
if it's price pay
both sighing sickly sweetheart see
trouble rewarded shall
economic theory makes no sense
three million years pressure packed down
bury waste great big hole
turning world will sing their souls sleep
work black seam together
rest peace begets
any other thought unkind
forget weather should always together
see baby makes three
but perhaps dream
when angels fall
shuffle ruins
these are feet
cant control us
turn radio static hurts ears
pick up telephone i've listened here years
when world running down
same tape i've had years
make best what's still around
run 'deep throat' again ran years years
make best what's still around
when world running down
when world running down
when world running down
when he counts buy soul
gonna find place live
hellfire's promise away
if you'll come wife
gonna try every way
wherever lay down wherever put head sleep
wherever lay down wherever rest weary head sleep
whatever lost thought was mine whenever close eyes pain
wherever lay down wherever rest weary head sleep
day will last forever
all colours bleed red
all days remaining
loved fashion
farewell farewell
sweet sweet jewel
none can see sever none can sever
kiss sweet kiss
running rings around moon
where sun has never shone
windmills mind
fragment this song
an ever spinning wheel
autumn leaves were turning
dreams
falling stone
close eyes
wonder if feel same way as do
another night
this what i'd say
they meant just
why would want put yourself through all again
when were still together
turn clock zero sister
baby wait minute wait minute
river's wide we'll swim across
you're glove hand
devil soul
you're sum equation
we're starting up brand new day
whose shadow bears secret promise
dream love as time runs through hand
whose shadow bears secret promise
hand
she runs so pretty
so fill her up son
got no prospects
let's consider this
there's music playing
you're gonna fill her up pain
you've got rest life face
gotta fill her up joy
or nard fire
when you're not around
let soothe shining tears gather eyes
let mommy sleep into night until rise
only only
jesus save us from darkness human hearts
only only
only can once again present her
only
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos
si estamos juntos y si dices que si
where child his father's eyes
these are souls broken town
'i have here cask most magical wine
these are soul cages
swim light swim light
all by myself silver light
i'd go out mind but
so going seek certain girl i've had mind
know could always good
know could always good
took courage from our numbers
our thoughts would always stray
would never have marched so far
faces mud
even when darkest clouds are sky
even when darkest clouds are sky
it's only once pass this way
dont realize you'll find next monday or next tuesday
mustnt sigh mustnt cry
picture myself this different situation
take dancing please take dancing tonight
take dancing please take dancing tonight
will supercede human kiss
would give our lovers time kill
you'll never have sweep floor
but if our love pure
you're bright star chart
i'll true no one but
noise traffic poison lead
warm wind sighs as practice swing
take sunshine
as if our minds are deranged
joy could not measure
they would pray moon
may trick firelight
remember words life
end mystery no one can read
cant see where they lead
book life
walk through day
it's easy remember
cant believe she wont here anymore
where she's gone
all hear lonesome lonesome sound
was sword his mother's hand
kind pain cant hide
birds roof mother's house
blood lazarus heart
turtles cannot sing yet they love
rob ships queen spain
where joy pirate's bride
see love again
secret marriage never can broken
no one would see
solitary voice speak out set free
it's hate say but it's probably
hate say but it's probably
you're too proud beg too dumb steal
you'll only make cry
who'd lay down his life die
thought about prophecy
i'd eat hat if came true
new moon an early thaw
everyone fought dimes
everyone told truth
everybody wants look other way
there's flag pole rag wind wont stop
that's soul up there
that's soul up there
there's blind man looking shadow doubt
have stood here before pouring rain
mes pas sont gauches
je ne comprends pas bien
tu ments ma soeur
from somewhere deep inside
though sword was his protection
i'd blood lazarus heart
every day another miracle
when troubles take mounting
when there are no more lies they can tell
dark room seems so still
let soul guide upon way
i've been knocked out race
well she's walking through clouds
it's alright she says
found ourselves down mexico way
who chased away evil gang
maidens numbered only one
settled down family
love thicker than blood
town mayor pta
love stronger than justice
love stronger than justice
though there used brothers seven
there deeper wave than this
feel rising cities
all armies all missiles
there deeper wave than this
pay love but hate comes free
cant reach bed so sleep floor
dream love as time runs through hand
this way she moves logic all dreams
sweet intoxication her love
this memory eden haunts us all
or sad melody
how song
window open
she wants him so badly
sometimes it's not so easy
strong words staffroom
sun sets across ocean
cant much longer still
cause if you're top bottom
cattle all stand
are really alone
confronted by this latest atrocity
what's become our world who knows what do
no dejan de danzar
con seguridad
sobre sus tumbas libres
con silenciosa anustia
no podra comprar mas armas
y con sus esposos
they'd chased him ever
ran through forest
dogs are all worn out
they'd chased us forever
dont take coffee take tea dear
an alien legal alien
modesty propriety can lead notoriety
takes man suffer ignorance smile
run every kind test from z
simple man it's no big mystery
steal eyeballs come back sockets
dont need read no books history
you'll still know zip bout
check if paid income tax
set up microscope tell what see
every night stay
since you've gone been lost without trace
feelings have her heart
it's big enough umbrella
long before tongue has tripped
everybody screamed they told
they made scene
was their chance
so she took her love
upon fields barley
see children run as sun goes down
waiting tomorrow just another day
bring night
no no where shadows do bodies stand
if thou cans't not o'ercome her will
better thousand times die
dont ever want see again
when nobody listens word say
but too full swallow pride
hangs above head there dark
evening spreads its sail against sky
marching through countries they'd never seen
stained blood whole generation
midnight soho nineteen eighty four
who thought all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth
some haply seeming some being yours
allied death child his blackfac'd night
come again may cease mourn
all night sleeps are full dreams
found nobody there
but look heaven live here hell
said what about our politics philosophy our history
said there must something our scientific treasure
empty
she's big lass
her stockings once was white
an they caall hor cushie butterfield an aa wish she war heor
whan aa axed hor te marry us she started te laff
noo aw heer she hes anuther chep an he hews at shipcote'
their logic ties up rapes
have words thank their positions
all want say
they're meaningless all that's true
did ever wonder what you'd been carrying since world was black
yes i've been walking now hanging from dead mans rope
shadows fall
all days life will walk
tied tracks trains fast coming
three line whip sort thing they ban
three line whip sort thing they ban
say this wasnt plan
sometimes shell orient's pearls find
there let live forlorne
fortune throwne
it's just way world evolves
negotiate peace earth
so let's just get past
our love really beyond repair
you're moving way too fast
siege guns had been pounding all through night
cannot fill chasm
if built this fortress around heart
had stop tracks fear
jamais nossa voz vai calar
que fragilidade que fragilidade
ficara fragil demais
clinch lifetime's argument
rain will say
ni se lograra
acero y piel combinacin tan cruel
lloras tu y lloro yo
all men are free justice sword hold
freak mighty freak mighty
freak mighty freak mighty
freak mighty
tem gente que nao sente que o mundo assim
un acto as terminar

mad about mad about
heart was lost distant planet
mad about mad about
las d porque si
rescue before fall into despair
i'll send an sos world
looking home
pray everyday strong
oh you'll never see shade or hear sound feet
moonlight
swept away
moon away
smooth earthy small transparent round
as if down long tunnel clothing chores
then avoids an awful lot mess
it's habit forming need more more
at least ones all know by name
when stars assume their patterns
but stayed corner
not as clever as thought was
tiny planet bigger guy
that's us
while you're arms
every kiss give
sets soul fire
bates places sheet paper top pile similar sheets his face heavy contempt he stares into middle distance framed photograph lively attractive young woman patty his daughter front him his expanse desk he glances at he caps his fountain pen neatly puts sheet into pending tray neatly lines up his blotter his desk aids satisfied rises join homeward throng
so why dont give up bring home
rainy streets are empty nobody else has woken
you're torn if should leave him number
there's nothing they can do her there's nothing they can tell her
it's time work it's time go but something's different dont know
she told him she was never coming home
i'd never have dreamt love
she'd never love mew d
never quite sure
cast light
one day she'll love
by pretending they're different world from
lines are drawn upon world

music by tolkki
precious see so clearwhat our place here

he's crawling out from asylum
prey god 'cause you're not alone

millennium show us way

there's no second chance
cry help torture wont let go

moon guiding way through land
now heat's leaking out i'd scream shout

far away sail away stay
many rare species will perish soon
we've got so little time
cant go this way
phoenix rise
know cant lose
dreaming just streaming through door
tears put out fire from soul
there's no talent this game hunting fame
hunting hunting fame terror terror everywhere
oh now need free from all
carousel spinning fast
can found by everyone
try not think about much
empty
there's time live there's time die
unchain soul from hate

duplicates all do not not but our other ego
empty

come disciples said stranger who came
tending us damnation
keeping touch aint easy but i'll have try

always condemn though never understand
would give up memories fill mind can see
saw dream day changed our history
wont take long wont live till end this song
not live slavery
beg light up sky
there's nothing keeping them at bay
words music by tolkki
forget those who really are need
arrogance fear walking
reap all what sow
universe love
tells somethings wrong
empty
away lost thoughts
tears ice frozen heart icy drops fall ground
now am crying
dont know why
feel drawn towards cant resist
time running
dont live past
without reason or rhyme hands time
well earned silver pieces falling floor
answer questions within where should begin
yes i'll back tomorrow
have follow heart
hearing voices everywhere telling what do
are getting bold growing old skin turns cold
reaching morning light
but where are now
think it's too late change man are last
have seen southern cross forming sky
let's put end all this while can
lead us into better world
nuclear end sight
questions fill mind once again clearing thoughts
reality this cant go believe
maybe there hope still left
will sun rise tomorrow will still see dawn

there's this black widow spider darling she's been walking hand
you've been long darling looks rain
but blood makes noise
think it's really
when blood sees blood
how did this come pass
question
'cause pictures lie
you'll see
empty
took urgent whisper
number every page silver
has taken its toll
might still want
am asking
bitten soul
let's see how it's been done
smoke from altar
by waling circle
how it's been done
layers chiffon
look her eyes
still love dance
or otherwise swim
excuse
if it's last thing do
what's so small
but i'll hit mark
i'll make see
fist
man wall
something's begun war
at end town
promised luck all rest
whose heads hands were taken
some things just dont get through
all know
moan words water
was not able
somewhere deep within
salt water
it's really raw
feel something's
am perfectly round
am raining down pieces
am turning hand
bleach clean vinegar shine
mama's handful thorns
see if unwind
an idiot savant
playing solitaire
suddenly remember each time we've met
see how their eyes are gathered into one
suddenly remember each time we've met
see through
or could have played wife
it's well know face
so much more than long time ago
one piece coral shone white
did shadow her young pencil marks wall
what song would air now
candle burns
wind foam
holding lyre
it's still hardest thing feel
when go back ludlow street
when go back ludlow street
yes think you've seen before
they only hit until cry
nothing broken nothing thrown
am toy tray
possible
match wits but not hearts
observe blood rose tattoo
but only soldier now
her mocking smile says all
still feel limb
or maybe vision
if they've lost limb
not feeling thing
through town back up through avenues
because this ship say it's destiny
know men will men they'll call governor
yes dont look at not selling today
men will men they'll call governor
must bursting
never noticing
i'll right here
had our
neighborhood girl she
she had had too much drink because she
she came up said
because i've got this feeling
mckinsey's bar

her you're just another guy
soldier night
but cant stop rising sun
protected by night

find line find shape
find outline things will
ante up dont shy
i'll see i'll call i'll raise
will cost cost cost
said am too young this
said must lonely
he took her little room
do think solitude
we're all one white place
cant tell what ive found
now what would have do
desert ocean floor
will break will
empty
march over millions years
mark these miles fields
march over months year
broken tongue
went got yourself into another fight
'cause know you're just kid
but guess what you've got do boy go ahead do
picture boy
he's everywhere
day
days were together
hey girl
empty
empty
what he saw so much
he's dreaming mystery
out our reach under this real life
he would have
passion does begin
i'd say she was very
this witching hour
her stockings her skin
now today
as sing into wind
let him go
sand will sting feet
wont do
what i'd forgive myself
but dont know
what hand had set this inner field alight
seasons yield
but not revealed
footsteps are ticking
something cracking
have been
afternoon when day seems forever
she watches rain birds rooftops
passions prudences
routine operation
edith whartons lovely figurines
whore megaphone man
get rid soon
get rid quick
it's all part show
get rid quick
monkey middle
monkey middle
does she hide lie
monkey middle
oceans
was all splinters
had see
though was life
sharpened dreams
there's pan floor
sing
touch
here am at last i've just jumped off train
know even that's not gonna last long
i'll go next town see what find there
love frank then they drank
they were volatile all while
love
trembling
lean against wall
do see
empty
naked grass
coffeeshops morning streets
are jester this courtyard
earring ear
bump upon head
oh hold baby
saw mind's eye
ceiling had painting
one by one old young
what happened room he asked
must have missed moment
if were weapon
said i'd gun
big black coat
examine her motive
white collar at neck
double breasted pinstriped
then cast away
there's way may appear
i'll love first let go

he's crazy he's throwing himself
told same time
last half an hour
sunday
have now if he isnt
into memory
eye
wonder if they'll take look
she will call name
institution green
into little triangles rails run round
she touches him goodbye
opens her purse
as wires cut through sky
they come up through cracks
she stops at stall
has hit mouth again
feel scolding
if are holding
when were holding
'cause we've got nothing hide
it's no reason alarm
we'd end up confusion
really meant do something else
turns herself into pawn
one false move
do love
am thinking
do love many can love one
do love many can love one
turns into very clear dawn
flies by gone
little west twelfth
gone gone
would rushing
maybe it's clothing that's so entertaining
ones here at home just dont give their best
can find
nothing much not much
if want
left center
when they ask
fringes
but give rain waiting time
blinding bolt sleeplessness
flash flooding light
cold metal
wind has swept them through apartment
where once were flowers
any more
finally alone
read newspaper
he tall
if he buys coffee
have some kind fame
touches him
walk along cobblestone ground
first they laughed then they ran
have wished could hear
have wished could pour
i've wondered who's woman whom all kill
now will tell why
as are living here alone are never revealed
highness ways are very strange
am thinking rent
dont think anybody knows
when you're living today
it's just so god damn slow
younger than nine or ten
echoed far lonely
her tears how they shone sun
but this life killing
he never more came into town
or when walking down these darkened halls
date
dont know when will
spin intact
tired sleeping
oh mom man he ripped out his lining
it's just there's so much do
there'll no dancing gravestone
time burning burning burning
he fills
says man
pretending
was no one
there's woman
she's hitching
bells
whose roots were bound
watched as struggled so
cut twine made mine
both mind foot
unbound into ground
sand against stone
would free then
would leave only bones teeth
they go down fast
without chance
without chance last respects
was drowned
did see thing go down
feel truly
wait upon will
they've gone get man
ice within
you're new new
i'd been holding inside
if could tell them this
am afraid may killed
if life were taken from
how could they weigh worth
they'll never know gold
zephyr sort out our
graffiti goes but walls retain
well wind kicks up smell rain
this end all know innocence lost so long ago woven dreams darkest schemes now takes hold our destiny decades greed plague famine war cant go this anymore living fools chaos will rule this eternal paradise
where's answer we've all been looking
path strayed from can only lead dismay
through mind
passion glory fill heart
they say time just might heal wounds love
living timeless tale
can hear now what feel inside
winter's dream i'll there
take last breath as fall into eternity
can not wait pray daybreak
risen an astral flight wander through
so falls night darkest hour justice lost travesty must undo absence light unbalanced power only then will know
twisted wings paranoia
twisted wings paranoia
twisted wings paranoia
twilight faded time
final destiny
lonely roses slowly wither die
no place forgotten ones
flesh steel intertwined
rulers us all forever cursed live pain
scream no one hears pleas

rendered prince foolsdire thoughts her begotten son
arrival dressed kill it's tragedy

start's where end's leading
when all angels cry
when watch over
whispers from calling out from above
way carry what believe
silence fills shrine giving us sign
promising charade
candles wind our echoed cries above din
try turn back years living inside smoke mirrors
feel her kiss steals breath away
desire echoes from tale ancient lore
lady snow holding

terraced house mean street back town
behind door where love reigned as queen
nothing but broken truck heat dust
got sneakin suspicion love walkin out door
when chorus came around knew every word every line was written about

was once believer till life got best
through darkness dim neon lonely shade blue

cause it's heart thats being broken
if that's not where want
said bless his little heart he's an exciteable boy
get little carried away

she once swore she loved
angel just wont let
may fall brings knees
heart drops
god made woman good day
now there goes reason bills get paid
i've got more regrets than blades grass cover up this dirt
cant drowned by all water found god's green earth
wont need keys aint gonna
never know when leaving or when i'll coming back
cause her heart doesnt notice
she always ends up right here heart

lost dreams somewhere between moon
empty
she was serving all night coffee
so throw caution wind

empty
22 years she stood by man
somewhere great grandpa says
but darlin let say before leave
now we've acquired all thought would please
stones handed one
tiny velvet box
one by one they mark our passage
years are wind
our lives are paved stones
lighthouse standing alone
who calls now then
she's strong
but when stepped off plane knew was fool
but right now heaven cant help myself
yeah old buddy leroy we'd go driving around
tryin pull down old water tank sits out county line
tryin pull down old water tank sits out county line
sortin through memories still searchin clue
he's holding
could walk barefoot through warm wet sand
but do now there aint cloud mind
dont take granted he chose cross he bears
empty
since i've worn smilewhat happened smile
i've wasted time here missing
graveyard shift call comes
someone might never need
throat goes dry at all could lose

today's lonely fool
baby know did wrong

sunset sunrise havent slept wink
dont wait up used
empty
big red folger's can hid behind pots pans
still miss her everyday
some take drinkin
watched devil dance
so walk away 'cause fire still burns
sometimes go days
pray lord our hearts keep
lotta roads underneath these wheels lotta wounds time has healed
rows houses manicured lawns sat staring back at
tried save from yourself felt every high low
never tell how feel moods they always change
not one who hurt only one who cares
couldnt save are who are
as drown eyes
search one who bleeds
can tell
so does everbody else
does really even matter have doubts
we're far away

darling darling forgive
if stray out too far
go break out
empty
you're so contagious running through veins
am burning fire there no cure
eyes give away
put mask back put mask back
not apply could never denied took advantage good thing now void
has anyone ever seen real face
dont know you're diggin too deep too deep
let know let know how far take
oh want let go want peace mind
time called space
until this echo mind
do know how get message across
we've never chosen keep what we've got
empty
hold onto calm before storm came
they will disappear so will all fears
well that's over
this not where belong
see motives inside decision hide
last time cared about anything
all time life passes by
must think this all have now
thought heard y ou say were sick this place tired or hearing cry no
how do know just who friends are
never know when begin
when nothings final
are under
want this want this
empty
if it's not this one wont find another
want let know want
i'll bring right back
want see all sides
want surrender
canvas incomplete
independence calling name
why do rush slow down
tomorrow comes start fade
why do rush slow down everything
why do rush slow down
why do rush slow down
cant ask these questions cannot answered today
will ever feel this real
can dig own graves now
are only one color
i've opened up mind so tell how think
free choose as long as live dreams
want know who you're running from or
empty
wonder if it's good enough make stay
know only time can heal scars
ready when are
anyone forgive
have word
am repeat offender
will live this forever
looks are every thing
another pretty face
make decision
so fill empty space
skin deep
skin deep
why dont let
have had enough
you've gone as far as i'll go
after insult 9x
wanna see reaction
keep inside image portrayed
found line then grew
our memories so intertwined
rememberthe way made feel when was
find yourself standing front mirror
so afraid you'll lose
no one catch insecurities
so conversational everytime
story was always based fiction
left behind
commit crime
i've been here too long i've spent much time
nothing's what seems
loneliness ritual
but still cannot leave
know use use
i've been dying let win
want eyes
it's never easy forget
wanna new victim
right here
wanna go
waiting
anytime wanted could show how feel
i've been waiting
i'd cross line if wanted
dont ever ask why
whats cost whats cost
dont belong
simple mind
doesnt matter what say own wasteland
already gonne
how will this when all said done will know where from remember
have nothing left
i'll wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll wherever she goes ever she goes
i'll wherever she goes ever she goes
when cant hear sound will silence drown too
so many things couldnt let know

so what really need know can trust heart
without knowing just one answer can trust heart
empty
go bouncin aroundin beat up truck
dealing all emotions
when fell love sweetheart

she knows nice young man
everybody knows what do about misery
but cant even walk down street
but was all
it's some reward all our time
but darkness
but compass were there point way
follow winds into tomorrow tomorrow
trust where leads
why would turn from love run
just let phone ring now isnt strange
makes happy
late at night write own movies
didnt think about
it's start
nothin else do but follow around
can live without too
tiny tots their eyes all aglow
yesterday thought walked alone
but nightingale saved prayer
can hold tonguei can hold wine
was born restless kind
when heard old familiar music start
after i'd forgotten all about us
were young were love
song remembers when
around corners have turned
how much she loved him
sweetest gift
she did not bring him
daddy told when was young
you've gotta listen whisper heart
you're deciding dark
when come crossroads
but can see
when go little farther than
sometimes think
have
must talking
till they're all alone sad
how could have love so fine
it's gonna cold hard night
sun fallin out clear blue sky
we're looking king
there's new kid town
there's new kid town
i've been thinkin about
cant stop thinkin about
still hear echoes those bitter words said
right now wounded bird
cause i'll never know what's beyond mountain
made love so bad
too bad you're no good
too bad you're no good
made love so bad
still cant keep from wonderin
could take back try again
'til say you'll come back again
between damned devout
'til sun blushed ruby red
maybe will maybe then wont
dont know how much hurts
dont know how much hurts
thought about words said
but did
love couldnt lie
but did
told wind sigh lovers do
then they start cry
would here soon
maybe it's love
didnt want hurt again
tearing down walls inside
maybe it's love
looking some piece mind cant find anywhere
went down austin lots beautiful people there
just melancholy blue
when they carried radio home
crows high tree top
it's miles at careless touch
chilled bone by waters you've tread
he said he'd change
it's not as far as might seem
thought world had come an end
can come
love was never friend mine
come morning will stand
treat mama raised fool
but two feet are strong wont take'em long
bus st cloud minnesota
just face crowd
it's strange but it's true
snow falling down around
why do keep lovin
come into arms
one love
all life had never guessed
sent from heaven above
sunday mornin when paper comes
perfect love
it's just
perfect love
throw rope around runaway freight train
ah ha
get lost get lonely
well wanted trouble now got fistful
are world
love only
want act
fall pieces
all comes down
made our break right out high school
through years
knowin can live love alone
so let's jump
started out strangers two way street
it's powerful thing
it's powerful thing
diamond ring
but this town has ears this town has eyes
throw out lifeline baby
just needed some room clear mind
but dont believe believe can ever get by
when count up odds there's still no guarantee
television seems life's ambition
do remember how used
need old friend once knew
somebody draw line so can blow right past
i've gotta set this spirit free
i've got get out
want live again
want laugh
i've got get out
want live again
i'd've loved anyway
i'd've loved anyway
would've loved anyway
i've got chardonnay chillin frigidaire
well i've got little dream about rest life
oh it's honeymoon without champagne
ask if this love runs deep
as much as love
could think no other love could last as long
every kiss
as much as love
i'll still love more
said i'd love till day die
what took so long
since let go
feat garth brooks

deepest fear about growin old
as he watched him grow
wasnt his child

we've been love right from start
but do best can
daily 9 9 keeps family alive
little hercules
sing sad song but you're not alone
know how feel lonesome dove
lookin back yesterday
seemed so big back then
heard thunder rollin
by time climbed inside
same ol house grew up
nothin here's same except georgia rain
hey tired this hard luck
hey gimme good stuff
instrumental close
do know how tight holding hard promises keep
thought you'd want them back someday
meant every word said
eyes rest
can run can hide
baby mine was harmless heart
girl she was man he seemed
oh she's got heart sad song
now heart tells different tale
harder become
no idea where she has gone
she figures she'll know where she when she's there
stared at phone
when see drawn
here comes temptation
oh looking at paradise
here comes temptation
need hold
baby would take away everything real life
baby would take away everything
oh how do live
cant understand
if love wasnt meant
if that's how story ends
get lost lover's kiss
still have no regrets
did ever want something so bad
dont fall love so easy
but fallin love
but what else can do
who'd thought was
but sink
tools trade chained memory
baby know something's wrong
once let out it's done
head says must blind
even though heart cries
tell what i've gotta
what he'll hold tonight his hands
work 9 5 cant relate
love this man see lyin here next
vixen blitzen come here
all little toys were happy too cause they were so bright new
got no business 'round here today
just feel cold rejection
well pull under
fall into river
aint gonna move 'till you're good ready
know think you'd never mine
guess sad eyes never lie
you're gonna see comin
santa claus comin
no guarantees no safety net
who offers place warm as sun
before slips by
dont know heartaches are heros when their pockets are full
just say you're looking something might have forgot
girls say god hope he comes back soon
when comes brains he got short end stick
they're too busy holdin one another
she's love boy
wasnt very long ago
what's meant will always find way
some days are better than others
just means cant find no cover
'til calmed down
it's such an unusual sight
something goes wrong
some people never say words love
it's apt confuse
seems you're never
honey trying figure out
try get phone get stuck hold
honey trying figure out
know time money
so not rest them
standin out crowd standing out
where spotlight finds singles out
where spotlight finds singles out
sweet little holy chil
de worl world treat mean lawd
puttin lipstick ruby red lipstick
aint gettin it's wishin
aint heaven it's preachin
oh can leave hat baby
take walk
but something's missing underneath tree
come kneel before lamb
tryin love
broke heart it's chipped away pride tryin love
guess i'll always
laugh at way they laugh at
movin as slow as law allows
only find yellow brick road
took little time
there were things couldnt hear
know it's really gettin
all need's heart
thus are dreams an average jane
she's gonna know matter time
so she'll ride this ride as far as can go
reaches his arm
see waiting shadows
cause it's sad when love song sings blues
make sad so sad
no couldnt taste tears other people shed
used soothe
but i'll just cut right through
still speak mind
would let forever come
believe miracles
will follow
if can love forever
cant find tomorrow
when you've lost sight dreams

magick speaks tongues fire fortune take hand
take where falcon flies symphony steele
tragic splendor death are free
distance leave behind there no meaning when promises are
they're through there'll no mourning skies are alive whisper
death bring seven meanings our love there'll no warning

hear voices calling see king's return
blazing presence rips through through
blinded by such beauty caught so unaware
shrouded angels meet his gaze
no more tears or dying his throne he's shining
anxious weary mind wracked by fears unnatural scan horizon
once so great now lost cold hungry spirits stalk these halls
god fire proclaims so
no no more from let actions speak awake
blood gasoline
another night highway blood dust air
blood salnts
light years flash before eyes
dare forces conspire against thee
face face fear death hate
cry another day
one nation one kingdom one child survives
i'll meet again through eyes our son
fatal beauty innocence
chains fire night's alive dark burning
oaths made violence punishment turn
fallin callin
dead will taste deeper treasure than youth or life
sons cain agonize bring forth then die
sorrows will multiply shall share fall
bask light fall
chained earth kongdom comes first
whiteness descending soul steals star
she moves so fine
she's seventeen tight ah yeah look outmakin love under summer night
secrets soul
then hypnotize tantalize
feel love babe
get inside
stand up walk away
nobody's fool
cant stand cant stand no
eyes blindly starting skyward gaze fixed eternity
crying no one notice
strawgirl there lover who's searching
glimpse power armor flame gold sever sky
above so shall below invoke death one final prayer
are descendants ancient ones race beyond wanderers night
she walks starlight
oh take home
she'll have knees
evil her eyesshe's always out there
oooh love real
sentenced die by sorceress her evil eye
holy fire golden pyre death
music lyrics by david defeis
watch take her as die
empty
none can ever tear asunder
when light life over calling from other side
must never look back
purgatory awaits
dont know what you've been told
godheadi am master this world ours are thorn side
humanity through blood fire promises lies through blood fire
look into eyes death
through ring fire
empty
bright are signs godhead
empty
elders elektra
onward through darkness
empty
darkness our years
heed voice calling
open up heart

this mountainside
fell fround
cold rain runs from sky
dark host marches eternal it's last great war
circle fire loud sing
bold enough stay prayers
unholy water you'rebringing down live die
unholy water her breasts were full her hair was wet
victory mine underneath savage sky
victory mine noble tears kingly pride
sworn by light moon

jealous lies
victim illusion

winners losers
keep running till day die
we're headed life crime
mist still hangs around gallows

no escape here lie
all need new world
putting myself this project

powerful magnets
no way out
falling all apart

wont change plans
new world waits seen
from ground out sight
upset coz there's no way return
changing sub rat humans
dressed skin tight pressure suit

feel so old
am alone
no more saving glory
where's second chance
b blown up flames

identity has been commanded
during night soul hearing
same message
they're going nowhere
i'd rather think
father remembers
lost machine never fails
down own son
she will make islandin suni will follow her shadow
wailing wolves at gate
yes everything's gonna work out
time again
cutting waves at full speed
gliding sky
he anark
death last breath
eyes closed
octogonal seams so much clearer
keep myths from embryos
am their league
must close
half wits spouting drool
smashed up cars fucked up traffic
caution all alert
stand mute today
no one's gonna say that's crime
lifetime handi set counter
getting closer

happy world cant imagine
now focus voice will do
diadem bellatrix mirach izar
so this end leaving now farewell friends
even if they make shit
making spider web over atmosphere
how can destroy enemy
people are gonna progress
you're gonna pay this
deep woods under stars
tell myself everything's fine
what he wants see
he says there's no more fishing lake
you'll hurt lung
go destroy those cells

then realize you're calling out loud
when said were
now crawling wallpaper
just when thought vista was golden hue
so mop bucket
if let sunshine come through
each watch smash apart
will halt flowing sands
25 o'clock
quiet or witty girls by quayside
down pearly tears upon cheeks
happy standing feet clay
dont need another satellite
dont need another satellite
flick video soothe
as scenery sunlight shifts away
silent film melting miracle play
apples cherries
battery brides ha ha have ever tried
every morning from bed
powered beating hearts
tune which no one listening
empty
said they thought was hunchtime
it's big day big day
statistics they dont say lot
big day
we'll bring back cheese auntie jane
protect from man moon
brainiacs daughter
so reach hold her frozen hand flight
love lights blink off
sea air
gorse
from her head it's growing
all do smile banish night
cant stop this grinning
turning night into day
talking
where they bake beautiful girls
love watch her
spent her
made our purses from flailed skins
real slaves
brighter than all others window sill
i'll lay upon 'till somebody else will
ones selected as audience
no longer silent
all he would say
or back this record sleeve
``i can make famous''
gave away liarbird
when remember distant days
remember many things but
drop little note through sympathetics door
but where there was dozen there are now hundred more
forgotten not lost
together surrounded by nature
all aboard sodom
empty
o ladybird
love was hanged treason became
mud hut or igloo
life good greenhouse
it's away from
myself
'til we're wading waist deep her brilliant love
she's little lighthouse when she
if ever want dock dream
down there kiss arse goodbye
if they're not careful watch wont
love at first sight
mouse takes bait
it's so warm could bake by
it's ugly underneath
wouldnt have suspicions
go ahead it's okay cry
then she appeared as giggling crew marie celeste
then she appeared brittle shooting star dropped lap
then she appeared
this
come wrong way
as dry odd numbered limbs
that's this world over
so can stand right up say did his name
when they had built
direction dublin
they shouldnt do
older engines
he's just nut he's cracking
there's no youth culture
dance goes full circle

she's giving him runaround
not it's all forgotten
has passed by
radio blaring out
blood running down gutter
there's an epidemic
patriotic romance
jingoistic cake
back first world war
if daddy could see today
doing chores
what world
now feeling jellyfish
so warning all cool cool icemen
can make grow up
late night parties
empty
heart big box paints
but dont let loveless ones sell
parrots lemurs
not hairwaves head
brings nation its feet
everything's all right
dripping slowly down
well you're good man albert brown
then along came dad
take heaven from deeper than hell ever dug
well bring colour where once had just black white
well can spill down lick up
you're wish had
you're wish are had
but if take wish away
cells dissolve when brainwave sent
oh heli oh heli
when she's up there twirling round
she laughing giggly whirlybird
shilling fellow who milks herd
people think no good
there's message up china
radios motion
spinning top
pouring down honey from above
since swinging about trees
civilisation agrees
we're smartest monkeys
we're only making plans nigel
wind are celebrating loss
have been such fool
have been such fool
woolworth beauty
dance
borne foaming seahorse herd
young boy woken
smelled soup fire cooking
he make glowing
but world shakes
drama stage high brow prose
keep saying what got
love explodes
waiting here bliss
dont know what she done wrong but want hurt her
lying beside parcel fat
just one girls
or some electricky weather
neon shuffle stick bamboo
tell world just how feel
there no muscle our tongues
but words got way
put foot upon laughing gas
omnibus take all us
dont waste time go taste them all
aint nothing world green skinned girl
selling guns simpletons
outside world
can keep animals
if all tears she cried flowed into brook
well then her garden would always green
sea her hair
take home notes coins every week
but church says remain this meek
la la lo it's iron
will see fishes drown sea
then dreams turn nightmares
all world's colours will crash into one
little girl asked should she part her hair upon left no
it's always been same
someone will come along move
but i'll swallow up fate
no wont make jealous
but there's one emotion controlling
across crowded room
felt punch punch
wish were here
hope got letter
cant believe
letting us humans down wars bring babes
guess by now they know
heart torn broken
strike up band love
food enough fill table
some so hot no man could bear
would not our world turn cold
heart beats faster when think all signs
but dont want die
found house wont repair itself
i've been praying can keep
can earn enough us
can earn enough us
they can fix rabbits up
music business hammer keep
till once again victorious
they're never too far
'cause you're teacher's pet
shocked too things used do grass
never spoke but understood
animal panicking
mister fireman bet couldnt put out if tried
she's strange strange strange little boy
he's an odd odd odd little fish
hey she's not phone at all these days
they can tape every laugh
rehearsing crimes government cinemascope
better watch tape boys
iron turns when rains
under weight crown
iron maidens will slam
remember violence only vote
'cos he realise this respectable street
never move from their front gardens
they're perfect
roads girdle globe
birds beware expect up there
rocket from bottle shot free
read from book
soar up high see semaphore from washing lines
wings night fly too above field stream
fire they cried
ring new
reign over good
may find wounds will never heal
may find important pieces gone
spell why earth do want
take her by hand if hesitate
it's growing green
bring harvest or man his wife
round round round round

all this life stuff's closely linked
nice eat

if it's all same
as payment they make love
it's just milkmans dawn round
empty
sirens sing
man who sailed around his soul
even angels wings
whistle will blow whistle will blow
smoke breath smoke breath
holes appearing lawn
bad thoughts inside head
moving facts figures all around

as winter calls he will starve
he would touch her
remembered all those many years ago
as pearl deep eyes

as moment regained regarded both same
words peace will fill his mind change his way life
brahms by rick wakemaninstrumental
root yourself ground

this disregard love's equality
questions answers blessed forgivers plus forgive us
children light havent heard

burning eden
priests fire release thee
repent sins

burn them name
all these things
twists turns inside
make sacrifice hours close at hand
walk carefully friends stab back again
burn soul
trapped by flesh turned stone set free by night
where choose live
walking subway
feel thousand cries
life wasted
watch grieving
genocide chains bind
oh ought know
let reign begin
purity innocence encourage death
son bastard
serpent gods apocalyptic smile
someone mind saying
this evil synthesis
if you're able take control
as take final step
our lives together planned
last december
last december
as grow pain sustains
soul sucking pious man
cycle's spun once more
an ungrateful troubled place
make sadness go away
devoid all passion
thrown past life not afraid
voices are calling
murmured cry was heard
burning sun turning black falling from sky
at once sun turns back
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
hell coming down fate has turned around
alien us species known as man
so there hope see but must act great speed
disciples watch prepare coming curse
good evil light sky
end storm near
axes yield daggers fly
what have done
lost souls should never look upon
reaping stone
reaping stone
scarring eternal life
he lied
ask received damnation was price
so must repent or will destroyed
everything about wrong
empty
hear what say
riders ride dismal clouds
trumpets sound as break free
scream no one hears
baptized fire ancient land
savior own devil some
mankind falls something wicked comes
coming curse anti christ am watcher's eye
sent through time destroy
hunter thunder
yes dear friend listen up well
deception eyes
souls been sold
this path choose
temptation befell
it's dark peaceful but face you'll never see no
m breathe deep darkness breathe deep sadness
y have see
gaze upon now
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
hot winds hell breathe name
that's when planted evil seed
no remorse it's too late
riding hot winds hell
profane humanity menaced by flesh bone
vengeance mine
born hell disease
there's nothing cant do
one tragic night he died
his spirit's wind
still hurts this day
oh know oh know
night comes shining through
till death
into burning lake fire
these frozen times
then it's time state mind
from bowels hell
freezing veins ice
written down so long ago
forgiveness soul pray
cursing heaven hell
tell why
tell why
ii scream out
i've seen rain wash over thousand times
cut once cut twice
know number beast
nazarene i'll crucify
from eternal sea he rises
or spend all eternity
entrance limbo not
forever being stung by wasps demons breath
vicious beast cerebus three heads blooded eyes
damned wrathful vain
belching forth agony invoking her rise
twisted beast he laughs he draws his arrow back
praying all while quick painless death
this place dark grey
realizing am not alone
fill our heads false identity
endangered theyll fade away
images flash memories jaded
i've lost all
repeat chorus
from depths hell
sympathy mind growing cold
it's called rise
music schaffer shawver abell lyrics barlow
dead profit
rise sun test time
not others so incomplete
when shadows fall unholy ground
live life among damned
life hell put through
blackness inside overwhelms
do believe destiny
this reward serving god's own war
human race will bleed they will serve need
music jon schaffer lyrics matthew barlow
creature has come take away
will bring so much pain
micro chipped dogs
you'll find inhumane
spirit born free
arrested development
we'll always keep safe
music jon schaffer lyrics jon schaffer
creating life his own hands
i've got know meaning life
jon schaffer matthew barlow
here i'll walk through field where died
here i'll stand firing line
he's our minds
died keep us free
no matter what cost
gave up everything
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
lain waste
watching them crawl
have come save
live can transcend mortal coil
utilize scroll save this one
scarred from millennia
keep running been lonely too long
do remember power flame
empty
breakaway chains he will set free
didnt know was one blame
didnt know was ball chain
cuts through heart razor
they will stand test time
bleed silence
they will stand test time
shadows mind
finding rainbow's end
lifting higher
selling dreams city lights
city's fire
that's when night rages
know you've lost control
when survey all madness face earth
countdown revolution
countdown revolution
break chains set free
everyone's got their cross bear
cards were dealt life's unfair
gonna cruise boulevard
we've got action no standing still
since came into life
every single thing
everything need
shadow loving wings forever will stay
since came into life
into eye eye hurricane
inside eye hurricane
inside eye
dont know dont know where you're going
father forgive them they know not what they do
sun will rise sun will set
comes down time chance
away from dark night
was crossing line one too many times
life was taking it's toll was losing control
now finally found way back heart
know i've been lonely love
hear call prophet
demons are calling it's turn do or die
castles are falling flames burning high
you've got grin bear
let nothing move soul
when you're chasing down star
just hold line hold line
life's journey til end time hold line
because i'll always know truth
hear sweet voice love cant deny
so ask now wont guide
i'll wait
if takes forever
i'll wait tonight
shadows night
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
another time another place we'll standing face face
kingdom light
hebridian winds blow
legends are reality
nightmare runs through day
when will learn
there she was eve paradise willing give
master master disguise

master master disguise
left bitter taste heart stone
i'll wait
take hand we'll start again
turn hand fate
cant see our love so right
i've tried everything could find
walking paradise

forever i'll share life
knowing what's line
open up eyes
now turn away
there's still time turn away
never surrender no take power love
never surrender
what really matters when cross finish line
caught up rat race playing devils game
living fast lane burning flame
she always was winner
secret lover comfort
speak silence talk
i've finally found home by side
now realize cant live without
so get out bed
but since you've been gone
telegram
out head
his spirit's dying way
stealing everywhere no one seems care
where's peace where has gone
reflecting mirror
heading from east into west la
perfect stranger stand line
together can have all
together we'll share harmony there without treason
stand or fall
tears eyes world
dying traditions selfish ambitions
silence night can hear cries
into valley sorrow
into night they will ride
empty
there's no turning back
when he's running pack
another mindless crime
papers signed at immigration
into air fly gracefully
when you're under gun it's cold sensation
when you're under gun it's blue damnation
freezing by fire while you're chilling bone
victim system living city
deadly stare into monitor screen
remote controller's hand
visual decline etched upon mind
i've got brand new band
walk inside shoes
but momma aint now painted clown
'cause life aint no crime
hope someday see what see
walk away you're prisoner lies
it's only fear itself keeps chained alive
am wrong or right
but could feel him
am wrong or right
sick tired being pushed around
cant hear river run without sound
double chorus
shine brightly while can
feel warming one
all around
all around
see rising sun
wanna tell
all people
hear voices
hear voices
nothing seems right
but wont get far
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
never givin up wrong
respect sacrifice
when you're looking out control
trying take another ride
all troubles soon leaving
empty
turns them into real things
closing all doors
some cat inside
neon ghosts city
beautiful girl stay
well do hope it's not too free
uneasy morons smile
all who never began
shadow death
endless search
when love around
needs
cant find love
push away those bitter tears
one day think know myself
mind planet
body language
body language
where has our innocence gone
are comfortable skin
some days am everything hate
it's no use pretending
love day life
dont stop
cause understand
dark night
here comes clown
wish were
read late paper was full bad news
take chains from mind
green fields grass earth
carpet lining
they will put feet very hot water
i've come see honesty
at what they're giving
sometimes kick
nothing more could ask
face
kill pain feel
eden let's
scream alleycats
sweet perfume trails behind
cause know you'll wanting more
moments could make
enough was enough
wondering what seeing
you're wondering what doing
would never have counted this
you're wondering what doing
up down inside yourself
can try make mad
rehearsed travel
we're looking out
there's buzzing station
fucking up poetry
caught between
fucking up overdrive
everybody's down their knees
are all need
empty
by fire

dont think know each other
dont test concience
that's what asked
that's what asked
loosing sympathy
you'll see
try not hate
heavy weight

or just too late
guilt debate
empty
winner

great expectations take look around
but mouth mouth shut
dont see
men women
well know just what do
it's one thing
it's one thing
storey storey
repeated corridors
climbing as fall
share same spaces
hoping gonna come yeah

what are hating

scratched crawled up wall
scratched crawled up wall
into destiny
word spoken
know are always wasting
but can keep
it's only time makes
all ever wanted
well it's only time
do lose sleep at night
should not judge
should not judge
different kind girl
past money colours make believe
what name call
all red its message
if this was easy
but everybody's
walking hand hand
'cause i've not seen miracle
it's called end rock roll
some music playing by metal gazers
learning bikes ditto vices
what could found
this sweet damaged smile
turn around
sucks spits out again
bridges too far
closed eyes no more breathing
hey here story
aint no sense all crying
cry daylight
quiet desperation million lives
who pays price

whole family's splintered
no stars revolve around
there no single entrance
feel no shame what are
fall light fall light
leave home car leave pulpit
fall light fall light
all young lovers know why
dont know what asked
so new bedroom floor
so new bedroom floor
it's overflowing now inside
how many times have heard someone say
but one thing's gone certain when comes time
take away these thoughts mine
dig holes sleep inside
dig holes sleep inside
she free
thought i'd hurt mother
back when was baby baby saying his prayers
lauraknow this song always
although door was open there's nothing left now
strange fruit hanging from poplar trees
jump hedges first
oh oh sweet thing sweet thing
sweet thing
oh sweet thing sweet thing
nevermind now heart how much he's all
i'll keep happy rest natural born days
gone astray
good riddance goodbye
there nothing sadder than
when her baby comes call
watch evil black sky
people public can ignore
let's see take another drag
will now black sky
have no fear this machine
love that's right time
do do do do
turned each other saying 'i love baby love you'
good night
come call question
please let bring back this gifts mine woman
loan shark bliss

just as long as it's not dope

he knows it's true they're our there
there's something need always coming from sky
show how we'll
you're going save end
nothing wrong little bit truth wouldnt cure
too much learn
where canyons fall below
silence fills head
not there yet
show things are brighter darker sharper softer
tounge tied
trust
know what doing
trust
know sun will always shine
meek shall inherit earth that's ubsurd
life simple when you're sure
welcome back victoria
we'll no threat when we're deaf dumb blind
trust piano legs are covered up again
mostly that's okay
but maybe should thank
what would know
give gospel according
know what's going
who am
where am
hell bent getting there seeing nothing way
these very hands i'll pull all apart
but colour now spells our end
yellow brown
build own walls
'cos dont expect what see has anything do
you'll know as do
this time we've split world once more
empty
from absurd obscene
when thought saw light
but look at stars know their lights already faded
have have motion get release motion
can twist turn bend
looking big answers getting nowhere
so want happy
hope feet stay ground yeow stop now
all things say now now
well dont know about
so can look around see you're not alone
live life it's rails
but leaves track tell
if so i'd know
real real real
do real
why dont all go away
woman radio talked about revolution
saw decade when seemed
there no other place want
watching world wake up
you're wearing lead boots growing tree routes caught quicksand
just need someone blame
so say hello desperation girl
there order
may believe luck
everything aches cant cure
stripped oh
everyone needs know stripped oh
time too fast us grasp something our own
stand back look out tomorrow
good thing looks are deceiving
next big thing
couldnt tell if it's gonna change world
round round world go
cash jim took home
first last time
luck should so bad now
little flat tin case all need
know clothes seem shabby
haze smoking pleasure
has changed his world friend
wont what dont want
ages passed knew at last
all good places
through far marches acres wild
cement fingers
giving herself chance there's no need show her how should
will still there further
will still there further
eats but one every ten
no mouse police never sleeps
hope everybody's dancing their own drum this fine morning
so take minute remember part
well there has some better way
apogee through night
tight lipped soldier
gonna get some
pink cotton undies blue telephones
watching as frilly panties run
warms his feet
when ice
stand naked telescope
under big sky
yours mine
empty
so why are holding hand tonight
so why are holding hand tonight
script blowing out sea
but rock roll star knows his glory really nothing
but god laughing up his sleeve
grey raincoats peek
blown through eye hurricane
at ever open book
one brown mouse sitting cage
low
if so patently unrewarding
because up deaf ears cold breakfast trays
assume an air dignity
orion light lights
sweet waiters link their arms patter down street
lost virginity thousand miles away
lives down some cool cool basement
wrong side table two
magic eiderdown
paradise steakhouse
will carve name care
repeat first second stanzas
candle lit table two has been laid
tell ``all right''
tell ``all right''
riding down queens highway
will pick up when last class ends
can touch if hands are clean
overdrafted still counting
international assistance flowing generous full
so we'll all sit down try play time
one two three two
our milk man didnt call
mend body or soul
across her face dancing first shadows fly
pussy willow down fur lined avenue
runs from train hear her typewriter humming
make presents government
it's been this way five long years
turning again
wearing gold tipped boots black jacket tie
well turning again
never feel thing
but keep drinking
hard liner
when rats are running
better run while can
take passport from drawer
grab credit cards
an october's day towards evening
bed warm straw coating
hide from eyes mock at girth
stiff battle harness chained world
these dark towns folk lie sleeping
was hot down there crowd
watched little black specks running down her leg
chatter air telegraph line
let first smile take home
all elements agree
sat high upon throne finest english leather
lady discrete
unsung western hero killed an indian or three
oh jesus save
was declared belle ball
now there's nothing left cupboard
glad i've got some time
get someone bring our friends here
make time go
scattered all around
you're breaking down
signals snowdrops it's time grow
well dont think so
walking down leicester square everyday
may someone's but wont mine
double locked black briefcase floor
as wheels turn biting midnight frost
law order darkest knightsbridge crime punishment at play
or should blame poor foot soldier
winds howled rains spit down
sunburst images summers gone
ooze from concrete honeycomb
it's been long time
cry song
cry song
counted his friends burned out spark plugs
now they're too old rock'nroll they're too young die
no you're never too old rock'nroll if you're too young die
can tell you've got lions heart
ladder stocking can climb
she says
long time counting hot miles
truck stop runner
no simple message scrawled
but little thin upon ground
only player
hard pressed next kin
he'll thank all that''
you'd better leave underpants
wrapped warmth
under wraps i've got under wraps
paparazzi cant break man
steal camel day
colour book
now someone's cut lines
break story heavy type
wont let move but cant sit still
she could have been sweet seventeen there again well so could
she walks out recognition her eyes look away
prance politicians' beat
teeming millions future fly
politicians there who've come take air
candy floss salesman watches ladies sand
leave wimpy bar
well was up
day glo pirate sinks at last
long red red valley they only sing valley song
but hate those people down valley
stream rushing by bed stone
walking velvet green
where scent wild roses turns milk cream
washes out wild oat seed velvet green
walking velvet green
let dance tea cup shall swim mine
way he stares feel locking door
they move so smooth without even trying
watching watching him watching
whenever get feel this way
then revisit stony grounds
each his own way i'll go mine
put us touch fair winds
point way better days can share
oh yeah when jesus came play
but his hair could have used comb
see how she moves just two angels white innocence
could have moved among her waterfalls
let her hand trail slipstream night
played right down what was worth
taught how not play game
before through i'd say prayers
pomp all glory you're poorer man than
leaves falling red yellow brown all are same
you're waiting more but you've already had share
not give lose fight
going back ones know
supporting their far flung illusion national curse
those no homes go please dig yourself holes
share our infancy
into each other
when was young man as all good tales begin
loyal unions
now equal best
two ulcers heart disease
heaven express credit card
ghosts fathers pushing moonbeams round
old crows cawing as straight crows fly
complete appliance
now we're up creek
take trip
head when he was very small occasionally cut his fingernails off
dogs midwinter
though fox rabbit are at peace
we're all running tightrope wearing slippers snow
button out button
rough wheels meshing
flies by seat history
from holding up pressures
he's gone generalski
minstrel gallery looked down upon
still rubbing parts they never mention
threw away his looking glass saw his face
we're gonna leave stereo but we'll have soul tea
`cos we're all kinds animals coming here
it's free trip down london weekend high life
as clock ticks away lifetime
most all pray may come back next week
i'll give steady push six knot simmering
his side
some friends from mall
little sparrow schoolyard wall
feel little sensation know when it's time join
she can almost remember name
it's been long time coming babe
long time loose amongst foreign hills
well i've tried best love all
careful as go
when pressure pains are building
have they ever taken time see
makin dead
down by dun ringill
empty
people moving an ocean groundswell humanity
take by stealth or take by storm
there's coast road winds heavens door
from beyond eastern sea shore
faint reminders stand
sea birds roll tumble as they fly
it's really up her
oh mr president you've been put test
somebody wake i've been sleeping too long
now all have got cheque pickup truck
they forgot they told us what this old land was
just good fun
wont waste time feeling sorry him
too much hurry ruins body
one would rather follow softer options
once again we're flying colours
again we're flying colours
once again we're flying colours
there when dutchman comes
seagull pilots flown from nowhere try touch one
misty misery
come back tell things he's seen
did hear father
blind lusty lovers
from trip made two
their rare wondrous deed
dummies no mummies or daddies reject them
dead beat from an old greaser
second or so were running scared
friend cecil damp smooth
cecil sea lion
ice cream castles are refrigerated
flip flop under big white top
same performance same old way
but it's true silver river turning blue
million other heroes drinking poor mans beer
looked through crowds glimpse her hair
singing all day singing `bout nothing
meanwhile back year one when belonged no one
wont turn head once more make peace everyone
you're rabbit run
sometimes do
make broken spirit whole
press god's waiter last dime
join together passing
paid piper called tune
really not an awful lot fun
but you're wrong steve see it's only solitaire
morning i'll leaving
chill mists swirling
white queen rolls
thin spreading fingers seek
oh feel sympathy grateful son what get
who has right
i'd take along
everyday see mornin come same old way
poppies red roses filled summer rain
am cross take nail
sent out work score
sossity you're woman
society you're woman
rubbing his hands glee he said ``oh mother england
better one
windy bus stop click shop window heel
as did walk by hampstead fair
dont believe they knew
four twenty labourers were labouring
suicidal came
magic lantern slide
before candle's dead
throw soft shadows water night
as ship moves sadly from pier
died falklands tv
there's child woman praying an end mystery
where real mountain men are kings
got nothing but sit sun
him resurrected from grave
chains history
you'll praying till next thursday
really dont remember
could he sitting left
who's got cheque this hot dinner
go weak kneed at suggestion
snatch if fall
swing big bear down
well there no rehearsal
but safety curtain falls
prompter his corner sorry he came
first violinist's hands are chilled
looked out window saw stencil black
no step no step
no step no step
wet pavements thin apartments
are routine assignment
feel steps quick headlights
black viscous bound cure blue lethargy
prices boom aberdeen london town
happy way
there's good times had
no say have answer
ceilings crash walls collapse
paint own deceiving sign
nothing say
lock ether
pleading sympathy
getting up some steam
raising steam
raising steam
raising steam
do have tell tell once again
thin diamond glistening glistening around neck
under red lights soft nights all comes back
what day laughter
while dimming light brings end night loving
looked aside walked away along strand
away along strand
seven druids dance seven time
ring out ring solstice bells
i've gone back paris london even riding
just as you're drowning well tide goes down
playing empty room empty guitar tune no use waiting
push back stool take elevator ride
shower runs hot runs cold playing
now how about little light music
if dont get enough electric love
old meanings move drift time
roots down wet clay branches glistening
she works from early am they work her bone
we're two different animals live jungles apart
long road rainbow pot gold lies there
holding windward course
walking cold corners maze
as cut into life
take horns by bull
next bar hit samovar she almost slipped right through fingers
would probably hard make scan
you've seen magazines or maybe state television
born sun kissed flame
some sweet lady singing his ear
so take stage
their hair was golden brown

so afraid
vision fire
night
you're possessing
powerless begin explore
better hope memory fails
they send back disorientate
twisting strangle grip
drawn out anger
blade destruction
it's way stand
take lead
rule roost
it's been lifetime since found someone
cant hide away ease passion
tell world how much living
lies forming
empty
they prey grief
but there's no fear
no sign life woodpecker his space
keep world love sin
but i'll go down fighting
wont make
automatic sniper
wont take
wont break
hands justice
blood stained hands
blood stained hands
turn blind eyes
life
while such predators
it's sending
bloodstone bloodstone
world see
pull plug
empty
extricate
condescending words are said
empty
drip fed
so much golden future cant even start
breaking law breaking law
fast devastating desolisating curse
pounding world battering ram
look out blastin through lines alive kickin
radio active shootin through atmosphere
blinding all sight
smack bottle open
skin begins tingle
cant stop talkin about
this beat heavy kind
rock hard ride free all life
goes crazy beat rock'nroll
we're gonna lose control
imitation sapphire shine
wrong side law
rocka rolla woman rocka rolla man
but they improved i'd have thought could
cant go
dead or alive there's nothing
never hear society
cause when they see coming
would jungle it's kingdom
present nobody but sadness suffering
till you're living world that's ruled by fear
spin round torture before dread
world defiled disgrace
world manacled place
black sun rising time running out
he roams starways
wont help them pray
cant hear their blood boiling setting them alight
diamond visions softly breathing fire
when enemy comes he will never heard
ruling earth
empty
you're gonna move ya rhythm till never can stop
if wanna keep going just shout out more
together will take all world
leave
why dont get out life
dont go mornin
dont go mornin
everyone was peace mind
floating way up high
one or two crack up start cry
rape pillage squander all rob
cling body
gut wrenching frenzy
you're well equipped take all
made metal
take pride probing all secret moves
every now then he'll take look around
lonely grave soon forgot
saw evening star rise up
then something helped penetrate haze
home once more much better
turn face each other
come live fantasies
give evil fantasies
must heaven stranding through door
who distance where love
it's running myself nothing into world
losing all control
fever fill desire
never dreamed this
slices every curve sight
freewheel burning
our road free
are poised strike us down
before grand rebirth
waiting sign
help no question pride
greet death friends extinction must
looking meat
capped everywhere
which name
empty
dont mess danger
sharp as steel
nothing stands before
forever i'll remain
find later say aint allowed
now wherever turn wherever go
oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
love writhe sweat
rule an iron hand
standing trial scrutinize
breathing exhaust as distort
ever reach ground again
piercing through brain
stab bawl punch crawl
when power chords come crashing down go
electrifies
ten thousand lights come blazing down
electrifies
get up then both get down
'cause gonna love ya' death
why dont save breath
why dont save breath
ram down ram down
screaming power air
thousand cars million guitars
night so black darkness cooks
never knowing when he'll appear
fools self destruct cannot take crown
hell bent hell bent leather
hell patrol
neutralize
soul stealers
all alone no one care
cant shake off you're wolf prowl
wanna go some place where can scream shout
somehow feel tonight right night
wanna go wanna go wanna go hot rockin
do as feel as say
never look back
it's something blood
brutality arms doth seek destroy
now are taken unto island domination
now are taken unto island domination
crouching coner
never ever learned read write so well
go go go johnny go
now let's see what you're made
predit hater
iron claws fangs steel
rib cage break
so never ever gonna lose
got contract
kept population down if know what mean
know shadow begin grow much grow
till what day not so very far from now
all alone walk through fire

take all away
then made our plans
take all away
this town

when saw
who were lost crystal canyons
how lost friends
they were waiting waiting
where vulture glides descending
just another line
unable come down

before he sees weakness
who plan counter scheme
street that's paved
empty
know what's mind
grab bite eat
river needs rain
photograph
look everything new
whatever happened saturday night
or color skin
were fought his name
when god made
when god made
old buildings coming down
we've been blowing up planet
would cry whole day through
when hold arms
when falls falls all over
another came along
then gathers strength lies
do senses tingle
when dance
river rolls
circumstance
dont waiting
arent gone
dont waiting
empty
when you're losing end
though know i'll never same
then when left her behind
coyote howls hill
where are those old days
too late keep change
they drop by die 'cause it's
answers gave later
have no lovers city
feel railroad
was adrift
where daylight
who swam upstream
i'll never lose
when shine too bright
will love
sea
got will love
get lost snow
got will love
but wont turn back
let our scales shine
will smile sail away
when winter winds greet
waited winterlong

petrified heart eases pain
over valleys hills
riding along skyline flame
dyed black
sword steel will laude one
standing lost at crossroad
whose fate will sealed
by sword settles
will keep our faith alive
below unknown truth
serpent death child darkness
eyes lit fire snake disguise
feel rage strike iron force
knight sworn valour
before fear do work

skyline was falling armies before
gotta get away before walk
as let go
were up against wall
sooner or later swear
wanna rescue
all good all bad
thank god search was search
it's only revenge worst all
hounds pursue weary step
i've been dragged through mud
seen walking side death
way you've fallen too
no one sees man no eyes appear
they'll only cut up sky
aint first braced
public cry never knowing
grand illusion radar scan
it's code red
murder sky
dream dreams before disappear
some pass buck justice
it's last old ways
backstage spray paint security rollerskates
time moves so fast
left no evidence
watch falling star
say one us
poisoned by edge social arrows
how much does matter
all pass through this wilderness
coulda been famous
coulda made right contacts
coulda jumped wagon
going down shoot old lady
took out gun
get rope around no one gonna
god damn hate blues
leaving take blame
some people put' em their arm
god damn hate blues
tried get off mind
but played
wont one who fades
where lost souls are being set free
so dont speak ill dead
drifting out paradise
disgusted by point view
touch when cry
looking through colored blinds
you've never faced day when judgement comes town
i've been noticing some changes
was looking relation
but aint worried know girl
gettin beaten broken bones
gettin old gettin gray
empty
that's gonna take different man
was easy break through
world demanding
jane will ever come back
flags war waved high
seeds war were planted
planet put rest
they couldnt dig anti social attitude
only human but time will tell
sinister love came knocking bedroom door
shoulda been smart got out while gettin was good
dont care about security
never thought being alone was being without
even lights
i've tried fight just gets worse
still look good but guess know
which bend take lonely road
was wasted was dumb struck
shake her nightgown
midnight sermon morning rain
into light
day after day nothing ever changed
used head point
had coldest eyes
used have look
flames overhead
o oh good
guard from light guard from light
took dependency tried get clean
eyes are so beguiling whisper
into elevations where everything's clear
goes doctor says doctor please
looks through cobwebs all his mind
dont want talk about
not ready
not ready controlled
how could go so quick
bound twilight flash tears blinding match
no one seemed care much
as slowly laid receiver down
minute we'll just see 'bout
what they didnt want then what they think they want now
can still remember being here long time ago
caught fever shakes wont stop
down dogs
so lie cheat
oh little baby trest right
18 wasted trying hide crack floor
aint just color message keeps cuttin clear
can see stream drowning
make wish dead
but just got lost
sheriff's lightning
know what done lotta men do
somebody talked
dont sun look good goin down
when old man aint around
something cant hide
down narrow stairway
oh can see our eyes
who's blame or what's matter
so go room lock door
but lately it's beginning show
run silent run deep run as fast as can
sit corners world gone square
going through changes working job
only have so much it's just way life goes
silver beads heat weld night day
vaccination wont make stop
close eyes
empty
wore boots down heels
all things going through
out blue
every second always run
before shadows start cloud mind
but school reality
break away go beyond
over edge
put outskirts mental train
shadows pavement never looked so long
well putting cotton never full sack
how can turn crowd still care who am
left nothing behind nowhere turn around
entering streets despair
you're playing out scene
it's all ever wanted best ever gets
head's little scattered 'cause working dead line
maybe were meant heartbeat turning black
within crystal pains shattered long ago
couldnt find road signs had been wiped out
time has come today young hearts can go
i've been loved pushed put aside i've been crushed
come writers critics who prophesize pen
so get out new one cant lend hand
maybe broken arrow
nowhere down
maybe it's nightmare really nothing at all
why do then pretend
rid life everything
but aint
there's mist coming down
wont forget her face
suitcase old car
must confess
just keep alive
walking grave
cant stay knowing what's going down
struggling arm defeat
when will stop
never knew what would go through
tried walk away but
followed dream
cant stay no cant stay
where bound dont know yet

21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer
psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high

empty
world still turns
oh what feeling

changing modern times
out our hands
walk blindly
feel love's wheels turning
who take easiest girls
we're twilight's parasites
when delirious fun
are dead night
just take good care world
oh tears weep
love they swore
love will death
they're crooked love thieves
i've read more than hundred books
know it's feeling comes from above
if they could spare few minutes their time
i've never been love before
debt pay tears pain
costs more when you're blame
or we'll have estrange them
rainfall
cleanliness only comes small doses
how suffer sweetest condition
they know better than
how can view become so twisted
about things said
need cleansed
although may flirt
do those feet modern times
told so
if things arent suited
dance dance dance chance
dance pride dance pride
exploding heart
played an american
no sex no consequence no sympathy
no radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
all cutting down size
here stand accused
should see how feels
tranquillity
when squinted
keeps us from stark reality
countless feasts laid at feet
if try walking shoes
before talk any repentance
but before come any conclusions
if try walking shoes
you're so pretty
can go
keeps heart imprisoned
girl
mind will follow
oh need touch
but broken back
never will
if want anything at all

some were born listen some were born play
he'd ruled town thirty years
billy stepped up stage conley whispered go son go
wanna get out this someday town
one these days just might change their minds
loneliness down his heart
when find love you've always wanted
collected stamps since he was 10 years old
ought see him metamorphosize
empty
calling out around world
can hear an amen
every heartbroken boy every lonely girl
but you're pushin different buttons
it's not too late turn around
i'd rather alone than love just half way
empty
repeat chorus
there's peace wine
knows he tries
there's not much that's sweeter
took baby out bought her ring
made love broad daylight
now faithless love makes willow cry
empty
there's no path too winding no river too wide
some people need their space

helping hand hopeless heart
another chance true romance
sawmill road

fishing boys
she's kept up all night
hear saying aint this
nowhere bound
you're gonna have turn around
heart's gonna break but never break even
two lovers stare up at stars
nothin matters this love they're holdin
holdin lovin kissin huggin
nothing matters this love
wont sound anybody else's version love
could go through life together without worry or care
have always heard cant put love into words
that's how feel
believe believe
i'll hold even longer if can
one hand wheel probably
from heart down soul
well baby know will
could love eyes closed
when reaches sea
just find
holding fast home at last
looks can deceiving
have see
one way mission
smile face says
'cause when looked at something do
now cant believe eyes oh baby
was meant
must written block stone
as sure as rain was made fall
streets their madness
through struggle
oh let this world slip away
wont care where i've been
if you'd some lovin
he brought many heartaches
just walk away let go
there's no doubt about how feel
empty
but can tell this
said wish was stronger
dont want afraid
oh love still
trying believe
imagine love lasts forever
we'll just take day by day
do believe enough handle resistance
week or two
week or two
sometimes dont do thing
week or two
hear them talking but they dont say thing
every pocket full hundred dollar bills
guess that's just curse being born poor
man givin thrill thrill thrill aint never known
want great big house hill
emptiness became house
blow through soul
golden touch heart becomes whole
set soul afire
now touch golden
when ants so feast upon flesh
fable time no longer blinds
heart becomes whole
know why came here
know it's same sheer fear
staircase has one too many steps
lady wouldnt give taste
even if just pretend
how can tell
i'll go over bare foot
empty
empty
place here bureau
train now but soon forget
mean everythign
cant move this along
cant move this along
as eating sandwich small cafe
he didnt do no good
way heaven heaven
why dont
there's truck out four lane mile or more away
what's latest thing neighbors say
it's sweetest thing know just spending time
said hey it's good back home again
shapes know where heartache will lurk
stone has come if could cheer
forget swan
it's always weirdness while
weirdness flows between us
just dont let fuck up will
how did believe this fool
forget where was standing stood
you'll split
one more day
'cause only jesus christ can slit his wrists he says
if tides have turned
let's just get straight
wish all these things
empty
world has done enough
if guy right
where people lived was filled lies
mountain man
another tale slips mind
are
give all
so why
listen when feel serious
when want love
dont want love
dont need body
when want love
wont take heart
every dream someone replace
empty
every creep's friend

was blinded by paradise
holding at bay
let's feed upon his misery
realize there's no turning back
now life done
unity our five day sessions
trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion
until everybody smiles
place within eyes
angel you've been sending
it's power look fire
answer prayer
one one
but now cant turn away
what's left behind
will dark bright
hidden conclusion
will dark bright
steal from innocence bleeds
dont wanna alone
wounds never heal
where do belong
dont wanna breathe air breathe
live another day
so die another day
said maybe when it's right they'll fall
beauty starlight
'grant this request please
'i gave word now love
bono u2 from album unforgettable fire
i'd leave this heart clay
into light
oh no no no

so fade away
headline murder young girl killed
but he'd turned weapon himself
but he had another plan

our deeds have traveled far

lyrics by james labrie
understand our fears
empty
no sign around
still life pushes
hope hear
empty
twisting turning
who can think instead
responsible thinkers

burning soul
cant hold any longer

bare all am
spinning lies
cant heal wounds soul
spinning cage
bloody but never cry submission
life aint we're cure
damage incorporated
empty
day today
days disappear
gave hand
aspiration drop name
graceless intrusion
change opinion
draw bottom line
now turning away
another whole life's waiting
there's girl mirror
one nobody knows
mirror's shattered girl
missing key unlock mind's door
just cant help myself
but will raise shelter sky beneath this star tonight i'll lie
from an ivory tower hears her call
when angels waken kiss
but will hold this one high above still
guess he wont singing rain'
tired this fight
please dont let rain
are gone somehow
take away pain
empty
there something feel
it's time take them time
if there's pensive fear wasted year
close eyes
all seasons
can see

everything need around sample mary beth hurt from
are slowly coming into view
i'll never hurt again
there must have been time
you're immunity
felt hands upon wheel
this time real
we're past time
there's always one more mask
when there's no answer
maybe they wont notice
there lies silent man
they say life too short
spirit carries
but know still have try
but please never let
at peace girl dreams
are once again surrounded by brilliant white light allow light lead away from past into this lifetime as light dissipates will slowly fade back into consciousness remembering all have learned when tell open eyes will return present feeling peaceful refreshed open eyes nicholas
victim her circumstance
felt would suffocate
as lay awake bed
relive anguish past
etched upon memory
too far away
here
wait
taste memories running from eyes
praying time disappear

tragic reflex shattered calm
sometimes if you're perfectly still
swept away tide
conjure up our skeletons
there's bitterness harbor
are fabrics our lives
stages his royal ascent
there no time no distance ahead continue
awe
van halen from album fair warning
this mean street
sorrow pain
as child thought could live without pain without sorrow
third arrives
love dance eternity
trying wake
leaves state disconnection
have been
how can know so many
leaves numb strange
tide turning now baby
keep head up
not go insane
tide turning now baby
'tis night our dear savior's birth
his law love his gospel peace
oh night when christ was born
beginning at above
this tragic ending
one last time
as standing here right now
feeling as cold as outside
just sign this line
an audience ticks walls
mariner soon from an open cocoon
every rising sun yields no sight land
at odds our senses we'll climb
under peruvian skies
hey hope know
battered bruised
vanessa regretfully waits
clouds roll by roll them
i'll take seven lives one
all feel honor spite
pull under pull under
coal face cracked
you're all that's left hold
can lose myself
scorch earth
you're all that's left hold
lights go down red hill
subconscious mind
friend
how love baby love girl little girl
lord yeah aint right now now
about lose about lose lose worried mind
grey green together
surely now can all hearts free
make stone heart
there so much love hide
have ever been used
thirst revenge
feeling ceiling walls closing
what trust loyalty have done
what trust loyalty have done
she never felt so alive
he says i've never seen her get this bad
endless drive
all she wants do cry
much her advantage

iv test stumped them all lyrics by mike portnoy 0503
hoping find
curled up darkness
answers test stumped them all
goodnight kiss nightgown
tainted blood's still same
just healthy normal boy
but every other way he was fine
he was helplessly behind
his solitary shell
feel strong
when fall out sky
but she always wakes up
hope face our human distress
losing oneself
alone at night
he talked night
without faith
as stand there all alone
now time see how died remember death not endbut only transition
must act fast cover up
ran into julian
their love renewed
one last time
familiar voice comes shining through
we'll meet again friend someday soon
much what chris collins actually singing
power what has been before
gates babylon
chase wind
sleep devil devil will take away
when are going land
going back plough
there's plenty found
beyond yellow brick road
his hobnail boots
mother superior jump gun
because happiness warm gun yes
getting lonely getting old
out there own
but was only fantasy
breaking bottles hall
he never said word
over head disappears
carry shoreline
over head disappears
lifted off shoulders
once stone
sound you'll hear crashing down hollow years
cant shake this charade
cant have this habit
no matter how hard try
she's taking home
help regression obsession
heart goes leaping at knock from door
dead night
innocence faded
empty
opinions are calculated
open eyes
just close mind
just let breathe
then sales go through roof
all heroes have failed
feed head
there was no time pain
some people never will

she was mom
would wreck day too
crawling down through muck
gina clocks broken hearts
44 skulls buried ground
souljacker cant get soul
if dont what they are telling
one day world will ready
picture etched screen
secret shelves hidden rooms
if thought would help
but dont give damn
but she sure upset
i'd welcome her arms
she said this time it's end
think you'll get under ol monsieur's lid
falling from ceiling covering ears
you've got kidding
nothing hiding behind this picket fence
whole world see while they put him bag
thinking must her sister
she's sweet li'l thing
nose against hers
she's got glow around her
think know it's not so bad
but now it's daylight
so brave
halfway truth
afraid reality
does he listen wishes his kind but stressful mother
she tried teach him right from wrong
empty
now he's keeper no one's fool
empty
beauty word
war greed illusions all caught fight
build walls up high
love destiny
so sad say you're no one's child reflection part
flower black blood
flying away distant lands feelings
where's light sky
gave freedom dont hand pain
surrounded by water problems are oh so deep
words left unspoken not return
close eyes tonight
allow fly up beams
enchanted by friendly face
what's worth
love will come around
touches godless happiness
touches godless
drops rain are falling down from face
it's destiny calling when destiny's calling
each step each day will get harder harder if go our own way
surreal nightmares they appear
unknown eats soul alive
empty
hidden under iron mask
wrung by painfull disappointment
silent night cold light
do float silence praying night fall
but couldnt let win
down dark stand
his nervousness takes form it's own
empty
empty
empty
however any trace his original character
thru' those naked eyes captivating
repeat bridge chorus
they know about fear
from shadows trees
dance flames dark night
only steam
took time just find there aint no way back
all our dreams left them
surface he portrays person being caring consideration
wait dont fooled by him
an acts friend offers comfort all
sorrow took her mother so castly so she was
music henk van der laars dirk bruinenberg
all money you've made
empty
hide fear away
repeat chorus
separation between soul mind as one each other
though innocent eyes dont lie it's hopeless subscribing retaliation
after dear
telling heaven they dont have enough
by side while inside
brother isnt mine know
black night
as years pass she slowly gains his trust
there stands lady inbetween shadows
empty
its corners
hiding true passion
you're his grey tomb
ghost from dark
i'll lie down frosty autumn leaves
then
but now want
strange eyes
old tired tired old without wings
chance say what's mind
when starting over new
last powers are drowning swamps
dangerous environment single mother fights against tradition
it's easy them say
empty
her efforts are vain
sadly his mother watches helplessly
empty
those memories still remain
close eyes try recall
responsibility or shame
where reality thought drift through time
who are projecting crimes dealing pain
under body soul
who are projecting grief world gone insane
instead they just left her die
pretty thing he made desert
but gonna split us back two
both can just fade black
disappoint people raking world
shine baby 'cause it's raining heart
it's just fond farewell friend
vomiting kitchen sink
cold comfort between
fond farewell friend
though beyond belief
though beyond belief
know know know know know
know know know know know

saw make up running down
they paint out straight silhouette
black eyes always watch clock
she probably wont say you're wrong
her hand arm
so let's go out
ready go
fell down here lay beside
picking up ticket shows there's money made
forever poison arms around
water pouring from her eyes
wont happy 'til bottle's broken
revolver's been turned over
someone half as smart you'd work art
all spit spite you're up all night down every day
looking at all rows
break off someone's laughter
placeholder come take up mine
pretty words whisper maybe misunderstood
pretty mary k off somebody's room
pretty mary k

call monstrous reprobate
there's sleeping resonance hold
it's surest way
but if mute them they decay
melody key
restitution pavement pomp show seek thousand answers
swept away against grain there's common consensus
all fantastic images they only are apparent
sun climbs up razon
when fighting starts who will
was twenty one stories tall
grave allegiances
content upon rail pain just little rain
everything dearly missed blood relations bricks
we'll try as cry our brothers pass us by
american dream's gonna swallow whole it's bursting at seam
american dream

cant someone protect turn away turn away
operation rescue may wonder where they come from but just
there's an ocean unpleasantries are not prepared face
there nothing can do ourselves or only what should
as watch our foundation crumble away
we're one nation under god stand above rest
our specialty infiltration

our diety's omnipotent oh yeah

subconscious minds when we're asleep
filled poignant morose wonder
resonating its screams forgotten victims cries innocence
which carry deep inside
while human masses their vague conceptions
so far away from home
all gets pointed same direction
so far away another abyss
spear ahead forge our destiny
we're trying everything can stop this fall
wonder if living too far out bounds
too much ask

he used touch when wind was blowing high
immolation incorrigible delight
then i'll turn light i'll burn lika roman fucking
diamonds sand
'cause noises house are terrifying
over agin one part per trillion unacceptable part per
our progeny silence thinking what about us
consciously omitting losers plight
pain was brimstone but kid hardly bled
among parade crowd there stands decorated man
evil sits inside them torpid timing its escape
ban questionable books contribute many other godly services
hire men change law protect serve one small flaw
love money god's name religions now tv game
today after 40 years toil he just stood up walked away
rotating ball where man comes first
they will all soon put rest
so now it4s time watch die

want laugh want set free
we'll share our secrets our little white lies
it's way too soon talk about forever

white metal burn phantom mullet
all night long
i'd forever wondering why
i'd forever wondering why
jeans wearin look dirt
instead feeling foolish pride fear
show her she special one who shines life rising sun
say love her strong true
think back yesterday being lovin arms
people come hear about truth
choir sang 'amazing grace'
love needs no space or time
she only smokes when she's sad
fightin way through rain
baby give hand one more chance dont go dont go
why did have go why am missing so
why did have go
i'll beside
i'd show them picture
first falling knees then hanging by tail
called psychic friend channel three she confirmed without doubt
one night stands would end up from midnight rendezvous
never ever thought would fall love
story goes rest
years passed young got old
nobody wins
but mem'ries i'll caress
then i'd happy i'd take home
give one last kiss one last thrill
he sent from heaven just make dreams come true
there aint no man who could steal hand tear us apart
made mistakes made some too guess there's things just cant undo
little boy running through yard fell skinned his heart
as he looked baby's eyes as baby cried
says daddy miss

light head weak knees
holdin close feels so right
crazy bout baby what can do
lordy mercy can see crazy mama come back
there's cross around neck

there's cross around neck
cool night reveals spark sweeter life
there's pale light shinin from bare refrigerator
dreamin color livin stone cold black white

board room squirrelly third world government
knowing one makes smile
everywhere wanna
something much more than her mother
somebody out there speaking
makes think may looking at face god

you're late again
flying by

'cause may it's over
evil woman dont play games

fatalistic ships froma distant shore
she took hand then she started speak
when awoke bed she lay beside
so wanna gypsy come now
from life escape reality's way
so drop acid pill dont stop think now
eyes no longer seeing life's reality
children playing dreamers praying
sing along
let's sing again
oh it's hard road
living easy where sun doesnt shine
dont believe there's any future cause
through universe engines whine
hateful battles raging
love upon land world unknown

reckless abandon
change better
cant hide while running
help another want someday
cannot bought
was brought up without silver cup

all remember's way her bedroom smelled
another blade next from ground
can see girls are waste time
there's black shadow wall
walking through grass
but as look into mind
what have said reach out hand
broken dreams

think it's time leave
'round yon virgin
just when think they are gonna stay
but how fuck am supposed make understand
so here's holiday

must wrong this cant right
do want come party
this place so lame all these girls look same
maybe we'd watch sun rise
how she's down iwise well constructed disguise
some girls try too hard
she's one she'll always there
17 without purpose or direction
if ever got another chance i'd still ask her dance
i'll never forget tonight
six years long
no wont mean thing hundred years
could were ignored by every passerby
another lost little boy big old town
tendency hurry
dont move
worthwhile
but said before it's all groove
any son or daughter
all groove
soon we'd say nothing
tried patience
beauty beast
alone
now dont care how look dont care how act
maybe then
alone
alone
free free all see makes free roam
may remain here jungle hunt free people
dont give damn if you're close
yes am nothing
am everything
equation reason being here
perhaps you'll love too
aint sure why
when all said done
we've already won
get myself together
well what day what's breakfast
please wont hear
it's hard believed what can achieved
things hurt just wont go away
if feel weeping
please wont hear
wont rise shine
then all sins they came
their investment should do well
when will all done
music brendan hill chan kinchla
where it's ripe can pluck
it's survival healthy
business as usual
if can let then free
let deceased
everybody's constitutional
really dont care right now but anyway
it's life he's trying save but anyway
real confusing if not but anyway
lyrics john popper
all aboard
where used grow up
now know guys have here around boston
so here go
shoot everybody mutt this side town
or even short surly
or or or or
empty
while uncle rolls his joints his fifty dollar bill
hail mountain climber busy at task
when all harmony can such lonely place
whoever she now whoever she'll become
gonna ride
no matter how hard
empty
aware different shapes
ensure he will die
have our sights
will
dreamed about last night
dreamed about last night
last night dreamed
i've tried
but yourself
simply put them down
if want peace then live alone
it's up
music chan kinchla
man love willing go half crazy
could see prison bars or call home sweet home
just couldnt cry
showed potential each
pain feel just cant understand
she needed learn once her own
do love but know
then only then started cry
take little trip
or let assholes decide
but when thinking about
if it's sing
but what does mean
i've looked searched her over countless times
we're talking about forever after
so soon chance will have come gone
feel wires swaying fro
she doesnt know but really she loves
why does feel big mistake
keep looking till this very day
ooh looks rain again
ooh looks rain again
ooh feel comin
cant seem fret now
twinkle twinkle little star
know he's strung out future
they lie there all forgotten
dream prophet dream
current savior risen
what will our mighty future
keep eye
truth well it's here too
cause if look around might just feel
hate price pay
barely see barely see barely see barely see let's see
who had gotten there first
judea enslaved
throw drowning man rope
could so far we've only earned right barely see
her navel there's feather
swear i'll never forget again
shall honor disgrace
if you're sold or if you're bought
dawn coming nearly
swear i'll never forget again
she'd do anything she could
he promised he'd return her come next spring
her heart her sleeve
something began hurt
guarantee
think she did okay
lyrics john popper
so satisfying would lying
he's finally rid
what's daddy gonna do
are there any more out there
good book says it's sin
are there any more out there
rays sweet illumination
never burn or char fire
please please wont take away
smooth perfection can only dream
can find when play
sitting clover looking fifth leaf
or did think everybody else feels completely at home
but maybe if told informed out loud
will come
just wait
will come
dont really need see
didnt have play
was hey dont leave alone
it's busy night
it's too loud here words but those staring eyes have much say
by providence sent
decide
come see what madman sees
all sudden find just dont care
being scared choice made
empty
decorum has its place
empty
yeah fallible
moment come gone
forgiving nothing
do her any good
everything love
she'd soon inspire him stand
takes everything have
he said everything am now because
could take weeks say
he changed his name luck because he had so much
takes everything have
but end only makes want more
come dance felicia
want dance come dance felicia
spite her momentous groove
was never any good
moment can barely see
but maybe if you'll dance
raise head
has grown too small
fight rise above
clouds separate reveal warmth
earth
he could dead supposed walk away
guess that's what it's
it's what i'd fight it's what i'd bleed
think there's money book about
take look out back door
gina gina
she'd dance till people liquor were gone
've really got clean up room
but these are things tell ourselves
till floor comes back room clean
eventual stories designed amuse
amongst crumpled letters mood's quite perverse
mustnt get foothold but usually does
but these are things tell ourselves
really have clean up room
but these are things tell ourselves
till floor comes back room clean
eventual stories designed amuse
town one by one
so hold this great big world only get rent never get own
it's great big world singing come see come inside
then suddenly you're done
cause know want more baby
diamond ring
sweet talking hippie
makes feel i'll convey
there something amiss
hook brings back
love
wanna bust all balloons
hook brings back
said have moments now again
coupled things i've told
leaf kazoo
do our homework way
said have moments now again
hope will join us
lyrics john popper
just take yo medicine help go down
feast well avenging madness
not goddamn anyone can do
show thee fit continue
might just prefer pray
could not believe eyes
but
hollywood's calling movie rights
why wanna give run around
shall drink always full
there's something left say
woke something head
when you're feeling open i'll still here
about great many things
so what feel becomes mine as well
seems ship still stands no matter what drop
still got this dream just cant shake
but
guilty nothing more than fear
brings him back this painful place
his last breath he cries out
well fear not cause fear soon turns anger
shall overcome what they tell us
music lyrics john popper
empty
answers are getting harder
might faint from fight but you're gonna find
empty
once upon time
sweet pain
what did them not suicide
sweet pain
there's got reason works out this way
when will embrace this life see
sweet pain
cross killing floor
we'll sell tickets honey
why would wanna stick thing heart
thank
bullets start fly
if dont so what cause dont scare
if it's who will lose or win
only have lose once
if want talk well then i'll relate
keep all inside dont show how much she rocked ya
guess from now i'll careful what share
can feel same
something about dreams as fragile as bubbles
takes thousand his best spies
but lack started take an interest
condemn man who dies
unaware how love lack was she
finally realize
featherhead didnt quit would finishing flight school soon
condemn man who dies
music lyrics john popper
were just
everything can
hope can forgive them
story that's only just begun

life itself
got know him well only now do see
feel are driving but just took ride
sweet surprise does work out way
into warmer days
go ahead do thing
how dare even complain
well here am
get good eat
have see what comes along
but we're just monkeys
hilltop we're still trying find
this corner
but gotta wonder how
it's this frustration yields relief
empty
from fossil fossil
hope can see
as hard as may try
empty
up above world so high
empty
empty
price piece mind
again again find it's yet another
again again find it's yet another
ad lib from shopping channel

anytime anyplace anywhere
fools making laws breaking jaws
there's no time think
come gather 'round friends
may mother took sick
friends they couldnt have been kinder
then shaft was soon shut
south american towns
this silence tongues was building
shadows are fallin i've been here all day
just dont see why should even care
every nerve body so naked numb
fewer words have waste this
sooner come up them
yes 'n someone must explain
man must swim
fella who never blushes
take care all memories
i've heard said before
dont let down
outside yard
fifteen jugglers
callin

hold so tight
run fingers down spine
let burn burn burn burn
there's more frost window glass
then ask why dont live here
well asked something eat
grandma prays pictures
even butler
loyalty not
so no stranger does intrude
pleasure knows no limits
lighting ev'rything sight
one more night will wait light
slipping sliding weasel run

now ira's folks were hungry their farms wene crops weeds
call him drunken ira hayes he wont answer anymore
call him drunken ira hayes he wont answer anymore
yes call him drunken ira hayes but his land still as dry
such are promises all lies jest
looking places only they would know
where new york city winters arent bleeding
but fighter still ramains
mistake shyness aloofness shyness snobbery
i'd done anything woman if she didnt make feel so obligated
see burning stage
see groom still waiting at altar
if keep raining levee's gonna break
look eyes see nobody other than
some people got barely enough skin cover their bones
woke up this morning butter eggs bed
cops were called his weapon took from him

didnt even talk people at table
courtroom honor judge pounded his gavel
william zanzinger six month sentence
take woman kind
everybody's building big ships boats

when quinn eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want doze
you'll drenched bone
dont speak too soon
dont block up hall
dont criticize

there was wicked messenger
until one day he just appeared
he would not bow down he would not fight
dream beauty they could not burn away
there was man named mahatma gandi
only one called jesus christ
love second cousin
well old men 'round here

why dont just shove off
i've seen enough heartache strife
not always easy kicking someone up

needs worried man

lost sand
only pleasure he gets out life rambling from town town
pistols shots ring out barroom night
another man named bello moving around mysteriously
number one contender middleweight crown
they jumped into white car out state plates
yes here comes story hurricane
remember said saw getaway car
want put his ass stir
but then they took him jailhouse
all white jury agreed
now all criminals their coats their ties
all want do take body home
well well well
jesus gonna make up dying bed
up stepped sherrif thomasville
they crammed back into crowded jail
forty four smokeless under head
saying master tell why man must born again
did they speak out against him did they dare
when he rose from dead did they believe
summertime when were
summertime when were
summertime when were
or must explain
do understand pain
wild unknown country where could not go wrong
gave him blanket he gave his word
still cant remember all best things she said
there was no jewels no nothing felt i'd been had
cursed her one time then rode ahead
leave at own chosen speed
go lightly from ledge babe
no no no aint babe
lover life an nothing more
dont wanna boss baby
wouldnt mistreat baby
dont know really dont know hurts too
shinin through trees
but could not get across
it's all over now baby blue
has taken all his blankets from floor
shadows even silver spoon
he not busy being born
foreign sound ear
made everything from toy guns sparks
sometimes must have
all around
insure not quit
speak jealously them are free
while one who sings his tongue fire
limited sex they dare
life sometimes
they'd probably put head guillotine
oh would ever suit mind
before step board sir name i'd know
among dead dying her darling love she found
how across sea from england
or else you'll surely hang says he
but i'd rather have joined pirate ship
now it's day night irons clang
i'll shoot those tyrants one all
larry was oldest joey was next last

out barn
well hittin too hard
it's million dollar bash
ooh baby ooh ee
driftin out dreamless sleep
feel talkin somebody but just dont know who
well there's voices night tryin heard
well aching jumping all laid down
who's gonna throw minstrel boy coin
was raised country been working town
well devils alley mule's stall
need something strong distract mind
everybody's moving if they aint already there
only one thing did wrong
where geese into countryside have flown
wont meet out moonlight alone
yellow fields twisted oaks grow
gonna let pass
but know how hard try
but he's badly built
but this time not gonna tell why
can follow path
can hold own
dont even remember what her lips felt mine
dont cheat myself dont run hide
there anybody home
dont shoot please
she looked she stepped out
well by dirt 'neath nails
dont touch daughter
knew had split
so yelled out
'bout her mother hill
as seen him get his gun
there spell
might swamp
or maybe say hello just glance
upon beach sunny mozambique
he grabbed his pants better stance oh he jumped so high he clicked
he shook his head yes he shook his head heard someone ask him opleaseo
have no one meet
ready go anywhere ready fade
if hear vague traces skippin reels rhyme
haunted frightened trees out windy beach
crimson flames tied through ears
lies life black white
flung down by corpse evangelists
ah but was so much older then
yes guard stood hard when abstract threats
they got him outnumbered about million one
seen his family scattered his people hounded torn
'cause there's noose at his neck gun at his back
now they wouldnt hurt fly hurt one they would weep
he took crumbs world he turned into wealth
neighborhood bully standing hill
if dont do anybody any harm might make back home alive
world has gone black before eyes
could get wrecked this dance
dont have wonder no more
when through you'll learn keep business straight
life time some heavenly day
now you're here beside baby
where secrets are hid
now cant go back what was baby
you're baby
i'll always do best her give word
poisoned bushes blown out trail
took too much granted got signals crossed
old men broken teeth stranded without love
beauty walks razor's edge someday i'll make mine
look away rollin river
look away rollin river
look away rollin river
well give blues guess you're satisfied
seen shooting star tonight
if ever became what wanted
seen shooting star tonight slip away
doctor can hear need some medicaid
why would want take life
what makes wind wanna blow tonight
sign porch says three's crowd
built cabin utah
wont buy back beat heart grown cold
charm whistle off an evening train
give something up ev'rything gain
find out something only dead men know
moving simple twist fate
brought by simple twist fate
blame simple twist fate
just when she left
an dont worry
down yard
now she's gone
she said boy without doubt have quit mess straighten out
home brave jefferson turning over his grave
they say loose inhibitions follow own ambitions
wont let go cant let go wont let go
it's ways flesh war against spirit
someday baby aint gonna worry about any more
so many good things life i've overlooked
gonna drive from home just was driven from mine
rainy days great lakes walking hills old duluth
something there about cant quite put finger
but am no longer part plans or dreams
why are eyes just staring off night
can feel dust as get off bus outskirts town
hear paupers peasants princes kings
all good people travelled
every day memory grows dimmer
tryin get heaven before they close door
but dont know what all right even means
i've been sugar town shook sugar down
moved closer got up toes
will destroy family happy home gone
crowd began riot they grabbed hold man
they pass by so silently
tweedle dee tweedle dum
brains pot they're beginning boil
they're lyin low they're makin hay
i've had too much company
how many paths did he try fail
how many more without any reward
five by five cant stay alive
her fond face pale woe
guarded them as they fell
words her lover had said
go half crazy when she calls name
love ugliest girl world
dont know why love her but just cant stop
it's indescribable can drive drink
all sweethearts can hold
he stood beneath silver skies
it's unbelievable go down this way
there was an old man
let wind blow low
let bird sing
if ever want reach know where look
baby they ring head bell
well shoes they comes from singapore
sure was good idea
well it's sundown union
when costs too much build at home
they used grow food kansas
this world ruled by violence
aint just night play tricks when you're tryin so quiet
all night girls they whisper escapades out d train
he brags his misery he likes live dangerously
but mona lisa musta had highway blues
but louise always says
harmonicas play skeleton keys rain
intercedes 'stead casting blame
dont want love that's pure
think better talk this over
feel displaced got low down feeling
guess i'll leaving tomorrow
why should got watching each other through telescope
ever since walked right circle's been complete
thoughts dont ever rest they'd kill if lie
oh cant see were born stand by side
he smiled when he saw coming
go back see gypsy
went back see gypsy
can call right here at home
oh i'll right there
hey 634 5789
but fire's feeling really good tonight
hey baby you're one
just little sweet talking pretty native honey
got radio blasting old mans chevrolet

who says cant go home
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright its alright
whose searching our pot gold
close eyes picture youre hand mine
where need find reason strong
while old men recite their story lines

wild wild streets
tried make happy
takes away from
somebody there night day
cold night without love
maybe better man
tears us apart
she'll draw crowd then try hide
well she'll tell she's an only child until meet her brothers
yesterday's memory
she wasnt young but still child
nothing else feels right without love
nothing would mean nothing without love
nothing would mean nothing without love
woman love
woman love
barking up tree
looked up screen
give them world
think can
got everything wanted
when seas get rough
but there aint no woman
damage done
school boy's dream act so shy
look so beautiful when cant make up mind
had from hello
had from hello
well you're dancing shadow
but they dont recognize
you're shouting dead
but really put through
if dont know if should stay
wanna make memory
could sing melody
sea gleams lethal cold
primal wisdom from natures own longue
facing cold stuck mould
minded mountains old
loop convulsion
wisdom set mind spirit free
arranging pieces vivid perfection
universal ritual aesthetic beauty adored
mind nature's argument
flux strengthen earth's ability
while fire fed by air's viability
sine curve an endless loop
contrast condemns answer insults
enigma solved
gods world behold
amend forces
gather storms asunder
by visions divine
branches hung low
high up there where his ravens once flew
source life course at sight
pulse time shades light
pre eminant sample hastins ions
inherit earth
inherit earth
raised by dawn existnece
raised by dawn existence
springs out nation expand
think therefore we're cursed
notion our emancipation
lies far from any genuine liberation
came death his fear corollary
expansion constant alteration
clutching at straws climbing air
would cut through his fingers
but fragment time
as weak stunning flare
where oceans rise
fed fire flesh desire
northern notability
an illumination all illustrations
spilt blood upon existence
upon ruins future
upon hands fold
upon ruins future
denomination grandiose demise
observation foresights
entwined by senses fantasy
spear hallow star
soul sphere pulse energy
premeditated by nature's sense
fringes canvas always stir
cells forever redeemed
token flood
leave no shores where torrents stream
up there mountain above all fire
tender are havens
fields down there ravine below
twine existence sense serene
wane as circle zero
gephyr sullen breath
path wandered high
path wandered high
prior forces primacy
see fear so clear when die
see fear so clear eyes
reversed time proceed time
circles spine universe
gloat characters gods
am circling twice visions
furious are storms
fierce affection
fierce affection
awakened beneath restless sky
winterway
when moon goes hiding
random fields tension
can spill all water
have walked silence yet furious fields
heard sorrow groan
frost force ocean up
ride radiant waves into unexplored space
fathers before
way those sinners kind
beware sight those
wind passion passion fight
