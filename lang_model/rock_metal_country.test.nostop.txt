hear bells there's no way back
about million killing hands
memories still exist
only memories left
burnin our heads
all makes world go round
dealing our dread dear
bullets bombs biggest guns
see signs all around
which we've build our lives
they rap hip hop
unforgotten songs everlasting sounds
their music mirror world full ice
devils heavens side
try flee from
fly fly away
voices our voices singing every day
exhausted but i`m feeling free
blood runs out
thought was god given
when freedom comes
but look at world today
they live house cards

hope will never end
things are strange new
everywhere i've ever been
women they love they can even start war
would cool ice if cant stand heat
this what want have pay price
gimme blood gimme flesh
holy blood from heaven sent
sliding down body
wash away pain
loving darkness light
heaven black heaven white
heaven black heaven white
when read golden letters compartment door
hear nightnares yell
heaven 7th
was nailed at cross
through massive pain till learned how deep love can hurt
were saint sanctuary
was exiled dyin
so now know cant hide away
as long as we're apart
silence spreads itt's wings air
huh when wind turns
voices are singing
into another world spotlights hit soul
living world where meet other side
falling into this world where breaking ice
climate changed worldwide
an odyssey without guide
ice wind so cold this world will never understand
ice wind ice wind ice wind will blow
that's reason why here
idolators serve idols rule
that's reason why here
minute's attention
saw her tears saw gun
saw bullet her head
or knock at door
just one night
how could heal our love our broken hearts
maybe our love has just begun
pots money feeling free
let see all raise hands
were forced work
hold world their hands
they are slaves
humans are praying mercy
something couldnt foresee
you're dream reality
feel this night you're close
always by side
queen black glory will shine
feeling child
all towns i've seen
bathing fame glory
green horses black rush
but miracles can change world mine
they shine
i`m gonna live sphinx spreading wings
just little look back
all remains
just little look back
all remains
when feel weak you're got power
feel need each other more than this war
fever growing their vains
living world shame glory
living world shame lies
out blue
out blue
lost darkness

closet mess backyard's falling down
know you're watching everything do
sometimes rhythmic din
i've got this hunch about
work understanding are chords
i've got this hunch
together could change world
potential individual against grain flow getting
all fantastic images they only are apparent
all fantastic images they only are apparent
marching singing
i'll write friends
because president believes god
once again bullet as friend tell can all there
there's space paper airplane race eye hurricane
as go through snow cannot forget our foes
tommy are free will not follow
promise today i'll have chevrolet whitewalls side

he helped build
can garner prosperity
expession faces
he's nuclear bombs
prove complicity now anna all good children go heaven
anxiety feeling know cant contain
foundation society anxiety suppress if can
anxiety feeling know cant contain
but then you're at mercy imbeciles
it's reducible flesh mind bone
are average citizens sources pain
bitter cold winds discontent
but we're ready now feast an atheist peace
wish had shiny red top
they say they know what's best
he can leap dotted line just single bound
he's paradigm carefree living
bad religion cabal all that's left
dont know responsibility ours
bad religion
episodes yore are never return
do wonder how life has been defined
brink insanity
nothing better do
punk cant have say
inside they know what's best
smile lips hole head
better off dead yeah better off dead
next time create universe
next time create universe
roof world without apparent design
or maybe theophany flaming creosote disguise
or raptors guileless shivering intensity
everybody's searching something but meantime let's all just pretend
this city's overcrowded man need room live
kneel down pray here comes judgment day
he squandered hours his day
dim reflection all can see
radiate splendor feel those flywheels curn blenderhead
spend day bed
so never let down too bad
they sang songs went along ride
take out
listen
am not who seem
thanks but broken
she was only dream
had been down while
but still not broken
well not
wanna laugh
know others postpone
cant stop shocking but just cant stop
cant stop
there's distant low frequency
descendants find oh so odd
everything must cease
what need change ideas
but you're nowhere but nowhere found
have created an unsocial monster
took most abundant smallest bits matter
so say gotta know why world goes 'round
so come join us
come join us
world hates us well hate them too
come join us
dont see trouble most people are
can go through life adrift alone
independent self contented revolutionary
freedom responsibility pay more than it's worth
here's story an honest man losing religion
cant deny funny feeling when he said
cant relate cant relate
without direction or reason exist
are they waiting by by
ancient people succumbed can happen here
why cant see
it's easy confuse grand design life's repercussions
die champion yeah hey
watch them try cynic laughs at optimist's closed eyes
go sleep generations
all kings men
maybe jack dit marilyn
how moses reacted
because trail builders
dont sell short
left us lessonless
you've been wrong too long
full emotion
goes goes
teenage fluff little threat
croaking speech he'd heard from countries counselors before
sons husbands will coming back heroes soon
he wont save he wont save see what want see
then one day they woke up from their dream state
someone cried out fuck government
too much time far little do
slow decay orchestrated by boltzmann it's entropy it's not
new age reason
what's come has gone
only after tally cost
all promises become lie
what's clear pure not so sure
act sharp
could use an angel but dont intend split up take
compared mine
what crime evangeline
do they had not capacity answer what world needs now
so much hatred this world cant decide
but when bend their rules their fucking lies
so use dont let them use
but couldnt belive when heard them say
wind back through time
garden where he was cast out by lord
now if you've never seen terrible sight
now if you've never seen terrible sight
when mother nation
feels better than spray clean water whistling wind
thinking today what want say thinking inhibition vice
tired this city all this toil strife
hope pray our lord god will think good
so what's use being good satisfy them all
twitch before dying
i've known all along
all fall down all fall down
view lost agenda skeptic's intention
alluring intricacies cah see green screen mentality can
we're ride down blind conduit just want get off
oh so austere
careless creation
believe eyes brain complies
back '83 man came men he told son our way life done
dont wanna land known as destitute free
police speak you're child again
shall fear no evil
so many points hatred shame horror
empty
insure against likely metamorphosis into this reprobate
poor candidates jacked into gray light
inveterate blind seeking daylight
did live always edge
did cry couldnt get right
damned out loud
yeah tell can imagine second doing
tell can hateful chain broken
dog feeds until he suffers
so give give nothing
if reserve weak audacity complete
every waking hour
we'll never
can princess
we'll together eternity
millions others just
few pleasant people just
but want something more
labors soothe hurt but cant assuage temptation
god must joking
expose culprits feed them children
ignoring mortality worship mediocrity
so many ways live follow sun
but say it's all right 'cuz you've never lived lie
other's run headlong into night
city no door prayer without faith
temple no god
am incompleteincompleteincompleteincomplete
congregating invisible circles
languid wills torped minds
affect infect
you're clear as heavy lead curtain want drill an ocean
upon alter
there an inner logic
simulating tyranny under red alert
crowded festive nights
pastoral retreat
an albatross who trying lead astray
there's no reason bridled fear
or keep head straight
privilege
alone watch burn
watch burn kerosene
rules might elusive
but what if are wrong
how much did pay
need fresh new religion run our lives
see there's girl who sits watches world from her blue screen
if just want best turn yourself rest
put key hole when get home from school
think makes difference
how come terms will help us pull through
focus skyline
fire continues grow
life understanding
dont let die
that's how ration poor
foreign enemy deplore
seize few dollars from people who sweat
when it's freedom or it's death
watching its foundation wash away wash away
pass along brighter faith even though must blind
who nods his head
now think relation
observing those around us
if never look behind scenery
where malibu fires radio towers
los angeles burning
palm trees are candles murder wind
pilgrim when left them all behind
pilgrim will ever find call
i'll save soul
everyone hydocrite come
condemn
everything touch leaves mark soul
everyone touch leaves mark soul
this aint no recess
so prone hear out refuse
must confess at times indulge sneak
aint no deist
look around country an abundance you'll find
dont act too smart their stenoscopic ways
an enemy
mediocre minds
aptitude they'r griping about
then can live outside inharmoniously
only natural thing despise are
speed but firmament still covers them its malevolent seed
verify all fears
they're modern day catastrophists
maybe its time make room
i've got this one big problem will live forever
just sample carbon based wastage
if had called fucker by its name
say name
he simply turns away
its poor friend
see solution
wake up new america
victories dont mean thing
empty
only build ourselves fleeting
empty
now come ye children one all let's heed ezekiels call
so how do sleep
really makes stop think about years come
save life earth water there cant any other need
'cause old one's turning
time so rock solid minds hordes but they cant
have no control have no control
looking directions
they assume somebody else knows what
dont belive self important folks who preach
diet air face net
still water stales soft summer breeze
look some meaning blank smiles are all that's there
any wonder
hoist our own shoulders
are just someone's personal gain
oligarchy oligarchy
they control two worlds
many our people poor suffering
only entertainment
melancholy dream
but see it's only entertainment
if ever gets there
sprouts into picture world
they're here right our fall they have heard troubled call
sleeping time bomb staring into space
there no redemption no common good
forging little plays deception pain
opiates silicon big brother schemes rule nation
mighty high technology we're never second best
final page written books history
we're dominant prominent
immortality's our mastermind
we're only ones who can perceive
pessimistic lines
as one deserves praise ritual
modern age's lies wont absolve
are churned by emotion from voices head
tell what see tell what know
just eternal silence dormancy
we'll worse off than are now
we'll wipe out our own species thus world
i've tried see these faces all around way
ignore masses whole entire race
nobody has will tear down
plague across his land
its merble statue standing over
oppressive intrusion
clever never hesitating baiting ever waiting
dont think better readdress level cowardice rising drown
prodigal son waiting waiting his moment come
so before go contribute more
cutting edge dulling
savoir faire full despair
there's no such thing as hell
have walked dead
this just punk rock song
faces always different rhetoric same
handout behalf those who have so little time but who
quality or quantity dont tell they're same
our evolution didnt hinge passivity
spread culture
our fore fothers who led way
empty
stimulus this somber ceremony
pity yet another casualty's demoralized decline
there's watch pocket its hands are broken
body's moving forward but mind reeling
sanity state mind
seems as though cant sure anything anymore
one two three four five six seven eight
they're all just suicides social way
gotta sensory overload gotta free little mind
dont know god it's social suicide
shades truth interpret intentions
dont know alright
alive at stake
coming back more
sinister rouge
rejects hand
burn them hard
know why tore down day
so they cant climb at all
we're all just slaves troop commanders x3
might make change mind
knowing we're all this togeter
at least it's not very long
it's social suicide
shadows entertain unwashed masses
poverty his language wealth his emotion
but tongue gets way sometimes feels
bring him endless murky musings unexpected frustration
68348
let take herding ground
there will sorrow no more
there will sorrow no more
sit there adn watch world go around
yeah means are verified
shed tear criminal give him something believe
can fake another cry compromise dream
substance was restrained
promising salvation
weighted as murder trial
rythmic as change
tonight windows are watching
morning papers got scores
pack wild desperados scornful living
holding candy cane
can never get out
empty
collision dark
he see's note obituary
barren winter day
but thinking altruistcally
try close eyes
they just betray impoverished accomplishments
hawk ultimatums so their weakness wont show
expectation indoctrination
door leading gift hope renewed eternity
it'll never go away it's cards way
just stay human race
how does feel outstripped by pace cultural change
wont lie
tell does life exist beyond
crackle mental convolutions tune revolution
prefer big brother he's so gentle understanding
ten billion people all suffering
10 2010
he complelled people follow along
but as they were scutinized
searching modern day savior from another place
but stealthily land free he's lurking there
it's not there blackboard it's what they dont tell
high speed connections monitored daily by pentagon
wont resign before struggle ends
trace mortal edge no defense
mother's kitchen
must conceal myself steal myself break away
dont wanna give
stumbled once 'nam
empty
couldnt reverse
if could only get tools stimuli
can see edifice crumbling foggy mist
turning true emotion
turning raw compassion
that's our dilemma
gotta overcome obstacles history
every time shake someone's hand
hippy killers
next miserable generation
while they chew
but can change while you're alive
no matter how bad want stay
some kind hopeless housewife
why do lie

so waste another day getting older gray head
they seem power so i'll kick back get farther behind
watch them as they fuck up every good thing this earth

those angry words were so far from truth
hey was out line
bell bottoms were really cool
fuzzy dice hangin loose an proud
ol camero an eight track
bob seger singin an out crowd
will crawl through grief will cry till drown
i'll never say know how feel
reo speedwagon stereo
tremble cower from phantom mullet
wish was singing oh oh oh
if hadnt come into life
if hadnt come into life
days not even started seems it's shot hell
as pulled away shouldnt tried
say love her strong true let her know all she means
heart woman
it's first time broke heart wont last
when sunday morning rolls around
people still gathered out street
love has no walls alright
all could see was her cigarette burnin
trippin stumblin barefoot gravel
down knees beggin pleadin put away pride
if only survive
but always end up deeper deeper true affection
air breathe
son what dream
been feeling very weak been turning pretty pale
dialed number emergency sheriff said tough out
was wild winded never gave restless heart anyone
never ever thought would fall love
no one love her day
nobody wins
nobody there sing lullaby love song or blues
i'll way this broken heart
give one last kiss one last thrill
then let take one long lasting look at face
only god could stop loving only god could tell not
well there aint no girl whole wide world could take away heart
but as always things have change nothin ever remains same
only time will tell only time will tell only time will tell
wake up where clouds are far behind
bluebirds fly
patsy come home said patsy come home
think fellow man
another day goes by
wait see
just wait see
i've gotta or not
as ready as she's ever been
painted this big ol smile face
prize hers win
she's waitin blessings before she hits
momma taught wrong from right
slow down you're gonna crash
yeah think he's so swell
real gone
look out you've got blinders
real gone
right face wrong time love
fate placed among chosen few
did show tokyo they ate up
yet you're drivin crazy things such
roll over
santa make em hurry tell him he can take freeway down
run run rudolph randolphs not far behind
there was no ugly scene
broke her heart two
empty
dont know what hurts more
there's smile upon her face new love takes place
once had heart cold as ice love was only fun
yes used moonlight bandit
that's what's going inside soul
radio playing our favorite song
let guitar friend playing last request
so let's sing back home song used hear
as he said these words
but his words are oh so clear
red white blue
but hero yes was he
now sandy cane no longer here but his words are oh so clear
everything you'd ever want have see or do
but when curtain falls always call out
right there edge right before fall
talk about sign can get an amen
somebody said prayer
someday somewhere somehow know will
times were rough when times were lean
oh lord what would not give feel southern rain
said could last forever
when was just little boy
his words still can hear
stand still pray
billy ray

walk away maybe then shake hands
kind thing must understand
dont think we're gonna make there's nothing else anyone can say
oh carolina running freight train through head
when hit town

if dont work we're gonna close park down
hairs back neck start stand up
not saying will definitely happen

well maybe should sit by watch kill friends
tell how blame kids
conquer figure out set free
i've got hundred million things show as many more see
music chan kinchla
gonna watch fall tower cards
when will learn
never failing amaze
light so bright hypnotizes
you're heart mind soul
cause all can do vague description
let rain fall where may
you're heart mind soul
whiskey hit fast
could trouble if dont back up what you've begun
no wont regret
escaping
endless possibilities
even though dont know how
see nobody said life fair
try escaping
question might ask
place wanna hide
hate what see
own path you're
lyrics john popper
told her if really love this believe because
sad disfigured child two humps his back
made him clearly understand
soon lack could walk talk hide his humps
takes guiltiest eyes
takes everything have
from time time they meet up sky celebrate
remember hearing story
so watch her move watch her work
always move so gracefully
wouldnt feel so much casey who never got bat
glimpse how good could
i'd feel as nimble as cheetah felicia
then must admit want try
momentary soaring an eagle would
breathe deep
here greet
freedoms
nigh falls it's gone again
once s prisoner now do fly
handful quarters make feel okay
take look out back door
while am strong will get what need
ah ah which are gonna choose
gina gina
gina gina
when came grooving know she was charge
it's getting kind scary fact suspect
it's game play play well
while concoct plan fulfill dream
fact we're so damn good try lose
styrofoam instructions fill hole
need rest after all wasting away
it's game play play well
it's getting kind scary fact suspect
it's game play play well
while concoct plan fulfill dream
fact we're so damn good try lose
they run
feet slowly walk mile
so hold this great big world only get rent never get own
it's great big world only get rent never get own
dont afraid
watch do thing
gonna come little closer
but i've said nothing so far
fact dont mean any this
suck suck suck
cant keep these feelings shelf
ground i've found
hook

imagine there's no heaven it's easy if try
imagine no possessions wonder if can
show thee fit continue
know happened granddad too
well life's not yours it's everyone's
but you've yet prove makes his life mine
rally charge die
that's what hear them say
or did think everybody else feels completely at home
but maybe if told informed out loud
will come

never looks at what he rapes
or hang him from tree
serpent giggles delight
will
last night dreamed
last night last night
dreamed about last night
empty
cause aint
you'll get no answer from
each brief but perfect home
still you're gonna have go find
want tell about something special
can take anyway but take at own speed
man love dont know what he's doing
knew love shared was dead
but love life
but love life
because she's alone
because love life
low rider gonna ride little slower
when roll down window
then afraid take ride
infinite halfway

someday may finally want stay
dont give up dont dare give
doesnt seem most precarious

some day so soon you're gonna make home
met girl mountain side

mountains win again

ooh mountains win again
'cause mulling over yeah
sing song sixpence pocketful rye
mulling over
well wont wont
know they didnt hear yet
lie prophet lie
narrows down
dream prophet dream
greed it's just drive
maybe just maybe now that's how it's supposed
now wont tell if what you've just heard
what had they gone through
then there was thirst
very children god
completely change or fade away
everyone else know
close her eyes her prayer begun
satisfy his pondering
see going through some pain
call planet
swear i'll never forget again
lyrics john popper
feel so free
needless say come following may
there was price pay
yeah she wanted wish she was dead
when all have
feel so free
killed disciple
so gather round psycho joe
he worshiped satan
were talk show tabloid
you've got heroes
says if kill more
he's finally rid
if he ever let go
say goodbye
keep memory
woke something head
when you're feeling open i'll still here
but i've been there can see cower
soon if we're lucky we'd unable tell
there aint whole lot can do
love point can no longer take
why wanna give run around
who needs humor tell lies
sure fire way speed things up
singing hey babe let's keep touch
sure fire way speed things up
yes cup shall always full
but
they told him he was just disgrace
but where were they all now
realizing you're just man
said dont want hear about promises they told us
black cat
slow change
yours make what will do
wounds
if an answer comes those who pray
cause it's long way fall
when beauty kind full grace
sweet pain
leaving bad need its wake
but here dont see where
can feel what feel
heart spoke wrote down
just would not let
sweet pain
am what try
little bit closer closer now closer now closer now
that's all am that's all am
but still let ride
then i'll make best guess wont care why
eventually we'll meet
so lying street there
if it's who will lose or win
music lyrics bobby sheehan
mountains win again
pocket no place smile anyway
music chan kinchla
one night her heart spoke dream
well across street there lived little boy
girl everyone called featherhead
everything love
see understand secret swear god it's all true
it'll take forever go away
he still flies where he's needed doing all sorts nifty amazing things
everything love
who had ever lived
life itself
will just
then vanish thin air
are gonna teach learn
brink heaven hell
lyrics john popper
if need blame could blame own rage
one us must go look still here
let's spend this frozen wonderland together
dont wanna hear bout winter wonderland
into warmer days
am into
know have an ass land that's what it's
have see what comes along
take good look at them
according only what have heard
empty
quiet still
because really dont want do goddamn thing
but possibility exists no matter how scary may seem
so can look mirror made polished glass
hand outstretched
whose touch can make cry
empty
all am wanting
would take blow by blow
all begin yours
was being oblique
it's good advice
only here
always bouncing into other
need holiday somewhere sun
nothing scared
if let live life
anything scared
she dont know how
how feel
she dont know how
know
what's worth
sing
ways turn turn
another lack people
days will turn turn
well knew as much it's no surprise today
any case i'd rather wear
what was said was never done
passing through morning rush
dont need anyone
been taken out by her daughter
bar b que cooking
bank holiday comes six pack beer
put rock beat over anything
dont get het up evil things
here love bow

down foggy ruins time far past frozen leaves
jingle jangle morning i'll come followin
rip down all hate screamed
ancient history
as if wedding vow
younger than now
his enemies say he's their land
he's wandered earth an exiled man
he'll live by rules world makes him
they pray nightly bloodshed must cease
no contract he signed was worth what was written
does he change course rivers does he pollute moon stars
all ever do struggle strive
but there's no one left here tell
she says look out daddy dont want tear pants
dont know why baby never looked so good before

going ninety miles an hour down dead end street
but we're heading wall stone

betrayed by kiss cool night bliss

anytime anyplace anywhere
fools making laws breaking jaws
there's no time think
come gather 'round friends
may mother took sick
friends they couldnt have been kinder
then shaft was soon shut
south american towns
this silence tongues was building
shadows are fallin i've been here all day

fella who never blushes
take care all memories
i've heard said before

run fingers down spine
let burn burn burn burn
there's more frost window glass
then ask why dont live here
well asked something eat
grandma prays pictures

loyalty not
so no stranger does intrude
pleasure knows no limits
lighting ev'rything sight

if it's million miles aways or just mile up road
empty
close window draw curtains
it's then turn around ask
joey comes from sacred part town
member boy's brigade
oh yeah making love backseats
nobody's going down
than could ever
wild wind
that's why had run
wild wind
cold night without love
talk ghosts movies
girls sure put spell
she's at home weeds
nobody knows x3
but one thing always stays same
but one thing always stays same
but wont afraid no more
see there's girls who money
diamonds pearls
woman love
but was too late
more than girl
there aint no woman
woman love
know there aint no woman
live without 'em
when passions prison cant break free
give love bad name
empty
one word change life
put lips up ear whisper way down low
had from hello
but really put through
who am judge man who says that's he's his own biggest fan
got now
hows life its been while
its bittersweet hear laugh
dont say whats mind
one eyed man wanders sullen highest hill
told unchained at day doom
borne one eyed man
havoc black when force turns back
inner cause utter cause
dimensions am trembling between
completion bonds between chaos order
rise voyage fall tangled womb mortal soil
eternal endless indefinite
synchronized they operate
as old as planets rotation
quartet's unity as profane creator
falling further into its hypnosis
bows down unity when paradise lost
mother earth mother all
steam rivers hive oceans
gods world behold
through time existence
as day calm flawless might
where eagles fly
pulse time shades light
where mountains groan groans till dawn
negligence makes future tense
circular reminisce history lair
bow axis inversely
repetition rearrangement
dawn existence fall
have seen life extinct bloom
or would onshroud us disillusion
improve our existential stamina
full explanations king our dreams
white glowing softness fierce attack
this radiant image stellar high
white glowing softness fierce attack
feverish dream
surface surface
deify depths intimate caprice
where almighty substance flow
milleniums are falling
derail path course
winds history cast
deformation what depression denote
heralds past
way those way mine
summon motion presence time
wind passion utterly weep
upon ruins future
sign pulse protrude
upon ruins future
guest omniscience
aura stars fusion frequences
grant visions burden bear
opened gate ion fire
grant visions burden bear
every space still filled by matter
trembling aflame within core
material origin elementary black
breeze comes whisperin soon
river rock
heart beats pulse ancient times
infernal are storms wich our shelter stand
all rain rise ocean
solvable as fractional fragments
genuine pulse dense induce indomitable
genuine pulse
circeling saga not forever lost
graven soo deep crystal bark
swallowed by flames
reversed time proceed time
am prepared die
time revises existence
resile innermost inning
stellar dome
stirring roaming cosmic sea
spear through life death
spear through life death
drifting wind clad as sin
grim token path within
distance furious dreams
distance furious dreams
can smell air
have faced force nocturnal course
jaws bloody feast
hour before dawn
fragments what once where souls
together ride storm
fills room pine perfume
swear kid
as another christmas ends
now world right
empty
aint nothin throwing hula popper
aint nothin knowing lord's comin
can make new friends
you'll never remember
put lampshade head

but better never bite well
hoping nobody else would care
close their eyes let all out into sea
look out any open door
sitting building far away

somewhere between two worlds
show love but maybe dont deserve
times spent
listen tears roll
listen heart break every time she runs away
listen music lake

solo matted fungus spawn eggs bacteria germs mould meat
smarting human host
maggot infestation turns rotting corpse black

latest masterpiece
corrupt crescendos
shrieking out their recitals
lead ascent eternal pandemonium tabulature by wg steer
an unsterile womb urban decay
outside now cold dark
music steer owen amott
bloody caricature make whole
joining together each dubious lump
inter mortis locking as pathogenically rot
pustulating bleeding piles are what boast
costive crepitations complete disgorgement
clinical gastric imbibe own vitreous humour
gavaged spoon
wont mine bloody valentine
love weakness lust conquers all
cross heart come let's cross line
whole truth nothing but
real power stems from barrel pen
lies swallow them whole
mutilated still born mangled
suck cess plate lick its pus from spoon
dismemberment so cruel
nurtured post partum gore
life hard as mortuary technician
advanced rigor mortis corpse internally bruised
gaping chest crudely stitched up
cadaveric dissolution sliced ripped deceased
vilely defile chastise humiliate
orifices pumped plugged
this process will loathe
forcefeeding down throat if find time
rectal membrane split
innards evacuate
fingers claw at coffin lids
recipe now epitaph
purulent meat
corpse's head kick
corrosion born as bacteria gnaw
what funeral feast putrid reek
firmhand final solution eugenocide
hate their law love under will
slight their firmhand
wholesale
faceless degeneration
trapped together
what choice new generation
just another generation under sedation
hedonism has certain attraction
it's not only souls which must lost
i'll go straight hell
so when body goes cold
alcoholic poisoning bloated lobules burst
dripping fluid as decrepit appendix weeps
intenacious intersecting
extravated bone as adhesive incarnate
rheumic oils forever bonded together as gum
exsiccated sere glutenate brewed
lead glue stiffing by wg steer
music owen steer
charred sinew's as good as lime no phosphates do need
these charred chassis desired
dry dead are bled because ground must fed
rejuvenating spent fecundate spoils

keep rotting keep hoping

matrilineal murder cordon bleu
desparental primparal goods oozing
contumely calorie count
dont want number
dont want love
just dont care what care
dont want respect
beliefs polarized
juices digested from each pus swollen pore
body indurate
this foul menage forces tears eyes
maturating corpse stale smell decay rot
sniff smell carrion
sore sinews rot blood curdling coughs
orgasmic rush
cross 'x'
no dissident voices
no future no voice
if just do as you're told
line toe
dont claim prophet
there's no second coming
these numbers branded
as sit here all alone
only sweat tears
vitriolic juices burn through stomach wall
reek putrefaction secreted by necrotrophic mould
gnawing tattered giblets as sanies solidifies
effervescing core
disembowel chop trash
rip open pectoral cavities devour still steaming grub
snapped spinal column gnawed curdled trypsin turns into cheese
flooded organs crushed
pierce blane infected tissue starts bleed
swarming mass
smarting abrased purple raw
another valueless commodity
chiselling out seething words
hammering each final nail
just cant leave dead alone
displaced muggy sods
macabre perplexed corporeality meshed
harmony now pandemonium
monographic text literary vex
revisionism future
ha you're waiting new dawn so sad say there isnt one
bone levers spikes malleable scoops
trephines undines irons styrups
la indecisin que hay en mi
grows between tears
cuando te adormeces junto mi
que nos importa ya
dear one will love each other
de que an existe amor
pesar de tanto mal
then have no doubt
place where she'll safe
lead her place
knew i'd make through
let shatter walls new new sun
i've been touched by an angel love
hush now
miracle come
cant believe i've been touched by an angel love
chorus x2

quatre pas d'ici
ton ami superman te conduira par la main
you'll an indian chief
once you've listened till end

was going tell tonight
love while making love
en tus brazos yo sentia que perdia la razon
flower awakens
love while making love
lovers destiny seduces without any control
sur un long ruban d'argent
le bonheur tait au bout
at rendez vous
amoureuse la pluie fait le beau temps
plays out loud silver ribbon
had put life music
three days
j'avais mis ma vie en musique
when said this could special
but truth was always there
though another year has gone by
ce qui te repose
j'ai si souvent prie ou tu voudras ou tu pourras ou tu iras j'irai
que ces serments fideles
quand meurt d'amour
apprends moi tes manies apprends moi
empty
at last
oh then spell was cast
here are heaven
all countries world
this life
les gens feront la paix entre eux et pour toujours
plus de douleur
pour comprendre ce qui se passe tout autour de moi
empty
la soledad de cada da
para amarte cada momento
s que aun existe amor
knowing whom will blamed
beyond madness
when fall asleep next
love at each moment
prs d'un grand fleuve merveilleux
je ris et pleure sans raison
bit rain flowers
laughing crying no reason
mon coeur est plein plein de chansons
oh listen maidens prayer
maria gratia plena
c'est tout un autre monde que tu vois tout regarder d'en haut
je veux pleurer aussi
want share nights
no am not wisdom itself emotions
jusqu' mon dernier cri
renoncer toi mme et quelques fois bousculer lordre de ta vie
cause des grands rves que nous avions btis
malgr tous les grands rves dont est revenus
mais maintenant vois tu ne peut ignorer
everything calm
will waken fine
rest weary mind
man that's mine
always try find love never goes away
tell will always together
he's run
out ocean sailing away
life just what happens while you're busy making other plans
barely even friends
ever as before
tale as old as time
you're one who held up
because loved
was blessed because was loved by
tender wind carried
gave faith 'coz believed
because loved
d'un enfant
boy fells asleep
de ma chanson
je laime
from beautiful days
en se jurant
while pledging
pourtant pourtant
it's his name
benjamin old friend
maman t'aime maman t'aime
maman t'aime maman t'aime
ecrire une chanson
toi qui habite mon coeur
heal its wounds
love each other
at sky house
that's because everything our hands
love each other
write song
if there still are rain makers
les magiciens reviendront
love each other
decorations red green christmastree
set slumbers till day
close eyes
rest happy
lullaby good night
wind blown refugees
remember when
when next step unclear
shine light ahead
right here right now
but both know change coming
whenever he's around
wanna play play
reason why
so live every minute
hooked feeling
wont enough
cant fight feeling
no one can tame
he didnt say thing but he pleases
love love love love
battit de laile et s'envola
tu crois lviter il te tient
si tu ne m'aimes pas
if dont love love
harp violins were playing
dove shoulder
au del de mon rve
les fleurs dansaient sur un mme accord
ce ntait qu'un rve
day which rising
sometimes say strange words
la rponse est dans mes yeux
all do today it's
it's also love children
someone more beautiful maybe stronger
it's also love children
sometimes speak too much
pain or joy
it's living
que lon jette des billes
tous ces hommes qui se cherchent un hymne
par dessus les guerres
c'est pour vivre parmi les toiles
qu'on dfend ce monde
c'est pour vivre parmi les toiles
sing
chante la note magique
et moi je t'aime aujourd'hui
earth beautiful
empty
sing magic note
sing
tu es venu de mon amour
love today
stay here
ailleurs o' d'autres arcs en ciel
suis ta lumire et tes lois
if can search again harder
small open door
suis ta lumire et ta foi
if can search again harder
snow falling gently ground
kissin underneath mistletoe
will tell truthfully
it's christmas eve they can see we're love
people smiling everywhere go
ooh make season bright
promise just one thing
you're highest hopes laying ground
no matter where earth are
but can come
comme juliette et romo
sur les couplets
s'aimera toujours
used say
o' j'ai trouv
musicians stop
make think
quand les filles dansaient
white dresses furbelows
empty
le temps qui balance
huge emptiness
cold heart
et les yeux rouges
ne devrait pas ouvrir les portes
even one day one hour or one night
cold heart
je ne voyage
j'ai le coeur froid
dont tell
beauty beast story
tell instead hot love
un peu de neige en fin d'hiver
so tell how love
longer than single summer
empty
nest pas normal
empty
nest pas normal
c'est contre nature
que chaque jour sans toi
then hits no chance hide
just throw everything you've got
dont miss out way
coz love there's no holding back
gotta believe
didnt do
if look
seule je m'ennuie
some morning have set free
get out silence talk heart
only free
dlivre moi d'un amour
front everyone
often speak too much
parler d'amour
tu crois que c'est
un geste un rien un simple regard
tu ne sais pas lamour
c'est comme un torrent de joie
c'est dans le coeur lamour
et son sourire ment pas quand il vient chercher
si je compte aujourd'hui plus qu'une autre pour lui
only him can decide if talk about love or about friendship
seems heart too big
lui seul peut decider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amiti
dirait que mon coeur est trop grand
his smile doesnt lie when he comes pick up
if count more than others him today
il lair d'hesiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amitie
et je nai pas appris passer de lui
only him can decide if talk about love or about friendship
seems heart too big
des rves en cinrama

empty
des tric trac
some flic flacs
empty
some chariots
et bling et blang
tring trang
comme une immense faim un animal instinct
y'a trop de trains qui passent ce train c'est le mien
could have stayed where wheel turns where everything soft
rendez vous when will have eaten appetites
une croix sur ses levres et ma vie qui s'ecaille
c'est le monde ta porte et tu lui dis merci
when nights will longer longer than nights
rendez vous another world or another life
rendez vous another world or another life
are knight armor
pledge allegiance heavens above
feel magic every time touch
declaration love no no no no
tonight baby make declaration love
ooh pledge allegiance heavens above
you're one who's clock
alone night
qui vit dans lombre
it's only darkness am afraid
can only live
que j'aime au grand jour
un un de mes levres tes levres deposes
rayes comme si tout ca navait jamais ete
tous ces embryons d'amour toutes ces aurores
je sais bien que ton occupation
but need song
what will do
ecris moi des mots qui sonnent
write words hit
faut qu'tu m'la finisses avant demain
give at least idea refrain
give just one hour
write words sound
write words right
qui sonnent
words think
write words dance
ecris moi des mots qui sonnent
write words sound

i'll swallow pride i'll alive
i'll hold arms never let go
want face see when close eyes
every dream
empty
everything between
would try shield innocence from time
time place where dont want
help baby through hungry years
drifting far away
would ones i'd hold so close
simple pleasures

these are things would do
play innocent but i've watched steal
make believe
must confess was quite impressed
makes no sense carry this
put little heart intention
crowded by past
nothing but these chains
missing by mile
heart would come undone
other love we've known
can say it's all right but know you're breaking up inside
when heart's crying out baby whisper name
will lay down life if that's what need
every day
but now he says he knew about from start
sometimes dont have choice when play break rules
never wanted this
if there was any other way love
chasing rainbows
they would see
making love
secret safe between
if they could only see baby
know if try our love could stronger
if still want
said i'd never let nobody near heart again darlin
somehow ever since i've been around
ask i'll do anything baby baby
see touch
if only could see now
here am
nothing but these chains
sails dark alone
if only could see now
know alive
'cause am alive
raising spirits high
get wings fly
do realize how long it's been
saving every moment
loving every moment
just hold baby
all fears cast them
angel
i'll shoulder when cry
grace will keep up safe warm
no matter how far are near
makes no difference who are
et les grands loups blancs pris au pige
j'ai vu les ombres et la lumire
tous les dsirs tous les sursauts
j'ai reconnu ses yeux dors
comme des toiles sur ma peau
must follow road lies ahead
storm will never end
will make them give
dont know where start
can say love
cause now we've come this far
his touch
if give little our love away
maybe meet middle every night everyday
if give little our love away
empty

m'en aller loin d'ici
solitaire je chercherai
loin de tout

j'ai pas besoin d'mon pere ni d'ma mere

always fall same trap
j'ai besoin d'un homme

as far as remember
ce nest qu'en te croisant
reason these goodbyes
et j'abordais les troubles rives adolescentes
y'a bien des vies qu'on nourrit d'tude ou de science
tought about from time time
j'attendais j'attendais j'attendais ton amour
et quand nous aurons fait le tour de nos ultimes projets
quand nos regards nous suffiront quand nos pas seront les memes
or when are drunk
et je t'aimerai je t'aimerai je t'aimerai comme au premier jour
je cherche lombre pour danser avec toi mon amour
sur cette vie trop courte qui file entre nos doigts
je crains la nuit quand tu nes pas la
je prie qu'on ne remarque pas
rain lightenings black cats
wary myself so often
je crains les saints le mal et le bien
hearing voice
empty
chacun ses habitudes
when dont feel doing anything
je de de de danse dans ma tete
every day same words
je de de de danse dans ma tete
from everywhere they stallite us
j'prefere regarder la lune
les sirenes de police
je de de de danse dans ma tete
que nous lattendions passionnement
le bien le mal et meme le bonheur
et que la vie lappelle que le monde lattend
je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
je ne suis pas celle que les lumires clairent
je ne suis pas celle que tu vois
un peu d'amour sur la terre oisive
douceur d'un ciel d'amrique
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
promises wind
all happiness could grab
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
spoke too much
je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
spoke too much
je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi
dont want

c'est encore se donner lui
bluh so lightly
she's hearing his voice calling her
lips full desire
still giving herself him
que le diable y prend du plaisir
under anonymous cornet
des sanglots longs de jalousie
ils sont encore plus beaux quand peut les chanter
sky made us
avec un sourire ou deux
moi de toutes les forces que lavenir donne
quand chante
when make people happy
better hear good god's voice
abandonning everything can learned
abandoning it's learned nature initiates here

tout est desir ny echappe pas
la soleil avait prepare ca
oh tout doucement mon ile m'apprend
sun has prepared
oh very slowly island teaches
que linstant nous souleve et basta

dans le nant du froid de la rue
when hope forgotten dissolved
un billet sur le trottoir
ne reste que ces phrases comme le au trsor
other reality
ils ont pour rver le bord des ruisseaux
dans le creux de leurs mains
they offer passer bys
forgotten children hang streets
at window heart
whether they're from italy or california
dans un monde en feu
ceux qui vivent deux qui nont pas peur des mots doux
et quelle tristesse sur la planete
ce sont les oiseaux du bonheur
comme un voyage d'un soir
partir nest pas quitter
le premier amour est le dernier
les paradis
when walking without any other goal
when even alcohols no more make drunk
dans un journal d'autres histoires
an abandonned flower
we'll princes eternity
et le cher bambin le dimanche
he was saying while giving them her
here beautiful mom
le gamin vit partir sa mre
morning april among walkers
l bas elle m'attend
beautiful mommy
touched merchant told him softly
tiens ma jolie maman
who loved them so much
se rend compte
cours les uns apres les autres
but at end
sleep ones against others
but at end
as subtle as breeze fans flicker flame
but as gentle as falling leaf any autumn morn
c'est lembrassement du frre qui te reste
aime pour tout de bon
ou pour se dscher tout fait
et peut tre sera t elle plus heureuse

legal tender's never gonna change number days
no time kill but time change kind hurry i've been
no time kill
still comb hair same
havent felt thing
just as soon as she dropped off
that's about as lonely
empty
well i'll bet right now she's laughin
nothin but taillights
but i've worn out same old lines
repeat chorus
one emotion can hold
would have have drag away
banker's bound foreclose
seems they just attack without sign
one more payment it's mine
see what want see
if could only put myself shoes
it's cryin shame
i'd walk right back
but we're wiser our younger days not easily convinced
more convinced does until
come gone
it's flying high laying low
so closely cant tell where end where start
though can find our strength inspiration independently
it's something do
take another place time
can get singin along
we've reached point no return it's only right
but here heart
standin between
even when arms are empty darlin
many parts many hearts
you're only lock that's made fit key
passers by just keep passin by
you're only lock that's made fit key
all want's little peace noise
day sun i've been workin
no matter how long or well live
handicapped before they hit ground
they dont make man
i've got do just what told
aint got chimney
milk cookies
had quite few things list
i've seen more than little texas playboy always knows
bein mcentired loveless cant lovett if all tuckered out
i've had gills knowin what nitty gritty's all about
but made this mist as christmas wannabe
flames die out afterglow
guess you're glad see finally leaving
tell them finally drove crazy
repeat chorus
it's people who want love people who need love
when there's something their mind
just dont think i'll believe heart this time
take 'em all way should
well this old world keeps changin world stays same
faithful true devoted
gonna sail right out colorado
empty
firmly ground
always had answers
so here comes another
so all askin
but no matter what do it's same old
climb wrong ladder it's keeping down
are things cant unlearn
know who use see when looked at
show somebody how love again
cant even see how
may never know
lack knowledge has source oh boy
does memory comfort
lately seems we've been chasing
still hide safe behind these crumbled walls
come lay troubles down
let word out i've got get out
break news out i've got get out
guess that's price
when unveil conscience
dont blame
who made judge
empty
'cause say so
then off where lay
down by sea
then love will start breathing
been searching out way say
been sleeping upon bed tears
alleviate all our doubting ways
now i've taken side
i've nothing left sustain
i've taken all prescriptions but no remedy i've found
empty
might accept them good self pity day
cant distinguish between what's being said
now i've learned believe
dont know i've just got go way
guess crossed line somehow
social butterfly
'cause never thought things
cup runneth over again
lost as swear am
betrayal now hovers
scare sacred thoughts away
i'd love sit rationalize
such man short while
all makeup makes
got got
wish you'd stop wasting all energy
everything evident
always trying blind
one accord keep moving forth
drowning discover
one fine morning i'll awake
caught up defending
well just want shake us up
let's mingle
sing bird now released
loss as babylon
created by noise
hey swallowed pride
so give more
wont bring down anymore
had let slip away
i'll break bread new day wonder
empty
recklessly run through
now love lights way
falls
catch breath from self inflicted change
take little walk take little walk right through our
some insecurities
as puzzle disguise
moment could change
silence parades so confusion heard
love hate
sleeping develop myself
walking desert all alone
hey why cant hear
you're clothing yourself
wait just second now
hush not another sound
come just lift up
maybe all can offer now
maybe all can offer now
dont need weight words
dont need weight words
give no words caution dear
so put hand wheel steer
here lie motionless
lead urgency
but dont bring down
oh not one
now this plane will take
attention will this pain go away
but she would walk million more
well would walk million miles
said love noise this life makes
cant crash now i've been waiting this
precious declaration says
should fight battles
should question knowledge
take away from all
change has been
this prize i've waited
going buy back memories
will watch over satellite
stars will wish upon night
scream about hurting
dont want have one more enemy

when prophets speak words fire

she hates alone
fly sky
teach where go
ease weary soul
hey hey dont know
all this pain you've been through
so bury all this pain

peace an oversight
but so impressed
hymns offering
as tears roll down

why should this end when
dont saddle
stylish word

ball was gone
ball was soarin crowd was roarin
lost real good job night
sometimes feels
there aint nobody gonna take from
drifts through mind time from time
sands time have trickled down
so tonight we'll just borrow each other
drifts through mind
dont regret single broken heart
were only destination
places he's not meant
stole this old heart blind
this world live
got money pocket guitar hand
north south east or west
well hit ground running
knocked us both our knees
girl know it's wearing thin
instead dodging champagne cork watchin wet clothes fall floor
long as can remember
she keeps flame summer
when walked out this morning
now taught weeping willow how cry cry cry
freighter said you'd been here but she's gone said boy she's gone
when left was raining so nobody saw crying
take these broken wings learn fly
blackbird fly
right away know are here
by blue magic eyes
as if never even left these aching arms
then gave something always wanted
darlin completely
was so empty 'till made whole
oh girl completely
all his friends
cause good nights rest what makes
she says lot couples never turn corner
turning corner heart
eye see
corner heart
what was thinking
girl shoulda known
thinking could still
couldnt last moment without
didnt really mean
could hear own heart beating when laid head chest
youuu take away
empty
dear lifewhen loved lost
dear life from very first breath
wait watch unfold
dreaming dreams
i'd rather believe love
was lost
'cause heart knows you're one
losing would mean
promise love life cant keep
there would no point
cant walk
seems you've got this notion i've been having second thoughts
every second every minute every hour every day
you're faithful old flame
yearn touch
never stray
still look same
he said still remember
just cant imagine
chase our hearts open fires
cause we're hot as gyspy honeymoon
get when live where love hard
walked he was floor
from some high mighty seat
wiped off gun
'cause there are people pass by every day
i've been striking these matches vain
'cause got heart full rain
hearts are when want love someone
ears are hearing father call
feet are putting shoes
when memories cling
but was tossed high by love
it's sensation
can still feel can still feel can still feel can still feel
every now then
there's place you've touched
i'd yours end
when comes love
everytime see woman billboard sign
men look her up down she's some kind treat
cant help but see
think about
when world turns circles
tell it's ok
lay down their heart
love happens when get this close
heart
you'll find right here by side
wherever are
heart
want there
want bad cant help myself
what's right what wrong
smile say cheese pretty please
not pure sweet good
put 'em jar
wish could save these moments
so many roads but none seen clear
leave mark upon this earth
there was an emptiness
had come true
love's not worth going through
back ohio
could easy
love means so much more
make change
if heart willin
celebrate christmas eve together they exchanged gifts saw each other
lay down their arms raise their voice song
they didnt feel enemies

funny thing hear same one
'cause wrapped arms around pressed lips mine
kind girl
person you'll see
he just didnt seem fit part
as her tears fell at his feet
feeling walked an old doormat
i've been getting brains beat out instead
just killed dead
all wanted was cool
at crowded restaurant way cross town
moment whole world revolved
he was holding her hand when doctor looked up grinned
was missing life
found sweet surrender
one love could keep
how could our love so blind
wanting hold wanting near
mark collie burch
now story writing sad sad tale tell
high society girl
just couldnt wait all boys meet her
she looks better sunday than mama's fried chicken
got head spinnin spoke inside wheel
she's all she's all mine
makes so angry
some things she cant use
saw through love's eyes
first she'll have let go
when her time here through
but somewhere above light once knew
as softly promised moon
say didnt hurt
but never knew how quickly would go
some guy knew school
but never knew how quickly would go
no right or wrong all between
stand own right side line
we'll leave all baggage start over there
youre not as sleepy as seem
when i've needed shelter i've found arms
when i've needed shelter i've found arms
together this thing life

think girl saw
nothing compares
there are no boundaries
came as sun came up
she read face cover book said
he can do just look her up eye
well aint got witness know cant prove but
next thing know youll fast asleep
see yourself being real circus clown
dream ondream love
mom keeps him home from school till they fade
he'll never walk he'll never talk he's addicted too
what ought have been written
would find someone baby found
but colors fade away
all need more everyday
but he didnt think twice
few drinks then
tomorrow will not cure
few drinks then
i'd thought love could only look
walls came down
brick through plate glass window
tonight walls came down
walls came down
but when his only son robbed chillicothe flyer
duggan winked mounted stirred his
he likes cut chase
dont blame man failing
dance out edge
too la loo ra loo ral
mother sang song

just low down no account hobo
she was born into drug abuse

dark thoughts there are no words
ringing ears
depths dogma hollow
no deliverance
there's question mark place spark
'cause there's man where used
there's man who watches over
read bleeding words those
then they whisper that's way was meant
what right do have
past regrets future fears
then watch soul paralyedgoodbye

blind eyes closed hearts they do not remember
but words will never ring true

solder own cage
weathered symbols slowly turn dust
lost dream high wide
hate see always end this way
stuck between
busted flat dusted boy minds terrible thing
hey sharp toungue liar making pay ina bed fire
aint funny how dat money rots brain
over time mistakes were few but believe theyre mine
seasons change our time gone our souls have
who built tool kill fool lead tthe blind
remember sin only friend he brought through
technocracy bending some laws
all american clones
there no limit
tell who has won when nothing remains
while you're losing curve
right there's door
walking tall ignorant this man now militant
nothing left lose so create another wound
one soul amplified suicide
this long hand breaks our back
prophet mans got needle his hand
prison praise obvious answer
voting bullet
what say unaware
one race no way
but still these scars remain
power reveals need
when dogs where set loose nothing was said
well never walked just learned fly
guess now old but not much wiser
because impresses all little girls see
pull up out door
1495 he barely made out alive
who impersonate our friends say come again come again come
well i've never been blessed elephant's memory
well never did much anything anyway
right coast southeastern america

children waiting king
they dress up white satin
walking dead
mamma feeds
wannna
only one who cares at all
checking up
checking up
lay down circle
until pot hits sky
where spotlight shines
who draw line
kept waiting there too long love
except want by side
hoping deliverance
can see her waiting
waiting telephone
waiting there down by sea
sometime wednesday evening

no more trouble wont beat him up wont send him down road
sad old weary lonesome johnny blues
could arm town size abilene
before let deal go down
last fair deal town
million miles below their feet
just one rose knows name
green green her eyes
only when laugh does hurt
assistant files her nails checks her hair
so rest weary eyes go sleep
everyone said she was dangerous
deep heart
i'd devour
mr wrong

yeah life totally boring without
while winter girls are waiting
pushes words from his lips
something long ago far away
except

yeah devil will send demons fly around wedding day
well they'll strike down at midnight carry away
red candy chin
under light moon
spells lay daggers before
dying by hand
will rule as king
hold sway from east fulfill prophecies
incessant pall death surrounds
may dreams brought might reach
lowered her mask
together clung bloodletting moonlight
lamented spectre her
drunk red wine her dead lips mine
screams haunt sleep
up feverous desire morbid purpose search
cruel daylights upon skin
nocturnal pulse
must know art thou not death
empty
tripping through boudoirs laced opiate themes
damned
bright marble bridge stretched across dark waves
two finger shots at this our last soiree
he was preditor creditor cold
sat gargoyle limbed amid licking flame
save an unfurled flag hate
lowered souls growing cold tentered easy prey
an ancient chil blew down centuries
just
all heil all heil all heil libertine's wish
came hunger flesh
carneal carnivore
god maimed come let us prey
her watnon words incurred
how our brother sang
leave thy gown dark pool at thy feet
animal nitrates
would murder soul
demon bride
amor e morte
within vast skies unversed starkness
descending eclipse all hope
where once bliss reigned so serene
how thou art fallen morning sun
these words heavy stone
sluice away guilt slithered
thrill kill culture shock wave lengths
empty
ill millennia thickened
vatican
royal blow heads france
were never destined last
vagaries inbetween
though her kiss was same
whilst pensive souls at zero sing
spellbound paramours at her feet
beauty always
tending her costume
waltz wound down transfixed
this angel stepped from pedestal
elizabeth bewitched
passions ensnared
she absconded feast
as ether vent its wintry spite
midwinter wrongs rites spring
earshot hunched beldame
flag truce burning heaven
tease dynastic union
she open wide
she drink sove greed
she floats insists am hot cant resist
she hot drives wild still she open wide
jagged toothed skyline braced crosses
balked his visions
he rose snowblind through shifting sands time
whispered sweet revenge
rising revenant dark
would desecrate world
work crafts surpassing sin
seven days seven festival nights
she was found
war torn forlorn malarial
she would take jesus
as she graced her window ledge
what wicked wonders lie within comfines
born burial gown
she was found
bless foot forward all
his span see
storm slid
so praise as raised lord
darkness
who came crawl
prise wide lids
service goddess death
when blood lust waking worlds collide
churches arch their backs balustrades
sermons hang black gown
rise sun underworld
time has come
wishing those stars
scoffing elder glories
but claws no more will rake
back pack mentality
somewhere dusk lining
their world will never take
blood upon snow
midst whirl daylight fauna
whose caresses she'd known
whims one so control
gouts torture unleashed
her gaze held seance
thirteen her mind
leaving serpents office
carcass rub raw
hissing downfall pentagram
biblical scale
apocalypse's razorbacks
mocking crucified dolls
scheming dead freed
cthulhu dawn
universal chaos realm time
time trapped between changes
feel heat as blast open
death comes ripping
nights came tralling ghost concertos
taunting sick her tender prey
deep red hissed cat whips
killing time
frights came wailing from darkside
would once again conduct pleas
crystal ball table
beware devil woman
she's just devil woman
careful them neighbourhood strays
she's gonna get
evil her mind
thine kingdom power glory ever ever amen
he wipes lips free his hectic discharge
from throats those overthrow
hissing malcontent
so let wrung
writhing weak
from zenith nadir
but anew tempered shadows grew
back forth prophet came
beset damned
thoth twined fate
thenceforth heavens deafened
yahveh bleeding dark
impressed fresh bloodlust
erishkigal raven haired
have ridden from westerning light
scarlet tears will run
under deadly nightshade
eyes asphodel
she shall come
cneajna wreathed snake
earth was without form void darkness was upon face deep
narration dave mcewen
additional work undertaken at new rising studios
management fay woolven
from orient gates r'lyeh
are but stills time
lughnasadh samhain feasts
her english shores
come home rebuild
these english shores
deeply twined inside her mind
from her rusted gates sleep
down her
might best both
thin walls would crumble
filthy little secret
without her there
one minute bliss
good duo
burning into fire
burning into fire
as flesh put fire hear their voices still
pour submission into
stud belts welt sky
hear hissing now breeze
mouldering face
our screams shall trail angels
drive drifting snow
old adversaries
tablatures gravel law
sickle constellations
soon kept
smouldering faith
nature beast as revelations arrive
death season
seraphim shall sing
when we've bled upon our knees
from cradle enslave
an ancient tryst catastrophe
as devils bay concensus space piss
see serpentine eyes
buried vanquished reason
rear tragedies
impress human failure
seduce silky timbred limbs
bewinged infested belfries
this wintry eve when snow glistens deep
necromantic tongue
celestial knifes ebonied
love sank wounded when betrayed
candelabra snuffed prey silhouette wedded
when thy tears bleed sweeter
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons sylph
pleasured dead speak her
heart though unhealed
where feral hordes impart temper
supreme vampiric evil
love vein
crowned conquering darkness
claim her their very own
whilsts cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
path towards castle weary innocence takes
laid rest now am blessed
creeping violations from shadows
saddean paradise
beauty slept angels wept
this catafalque night when awed stars report
empty
empty
left these present scars
whose laugh silver belts
spare hissing sentiments
lest her memory dissolve
blind from spying her
foul snake despair
daggers from swagger
but am tied
use guide fingers there
empty
they reap then rape stanzas
dirty little soul frigger
reflecting past life doesnt have much time
really end not some crazy dream
as walk all life drifts before
oh hallowed thy
nascent aeons confer
cathedrals shriek pulpit oratory
wreak atrocities those have despised
neath silken shroud she waxes horn
from this ransacked celestial temple
enemy has held three seasons
power overthrown
he soon shall fall
each leading burning hole
now have deep inside everlasting grasp
jesus knows soul can not saved
midnightmare trampling dreams
sought her everywhere
an imquisitive glance shadows they cast
her ghost fog
she'd sworn vows fragrant blood
church bell tower key
trappistine eyes
best reserved judgement their bible construed
her ghost fog
from cusp midnight mountains
she drifted from path
moon conducted charm
michael psyched jealousies
am not free as he indulge darkest fantasies
not lyriced song their spirited throng
he threw this tie heaven
stung guilt every mind
though no crescent cross
smell fleur du malcontent
mountaineers strive so far
judas dozens
saint disgustus president evil
ever stealing thunder religious causes
night she was born
brer werewold at her stocking tops
flirting curtsies thirteenth floor
libertina grimm
no dont go
ring bright slaughter spat waters
aah nostalgia grows
should compare them
lump throat come choke
now slither through hairline cracks
her alabaster limbs dim lit carnal grin
she went out light mind
stranglehold opened arms
stare stare stare stare
jewelled god lent grace
when nothing ones power
words alight leave sin
warm nights storm wracked bites
aphrodite from embrace
bediademed souled
she fought but fell greet
feculent dirge
their weak prayers
psychophant despoiler faith
under black skirts
strip tender flesh from these swine
commemorating sickle moons
dizzy at falling stars
lick carnivorous winds
who fell their god o'er her vision voice
led other worlds
at masked palatial balls
whom by slip after whim
pounded her wake
our names were deeply carved tree life long dead languages
dim lights wrong rites
from fecund abyss
medusa hemlock
every soul returning
conquering dark
when part chars path
who kept candle cult
gushing from shattered silence
her laughter
perrenial gore
seeking blood curdle
shalt sound aloft crashing waves
smothering congregation
minds desanitized
fear gorgon eyes new moon rising
time tides force wider crack
thighs slick molten steel
expect no love
fooled all people magic
oh mr crowley it's symbolic course
tonight night
swore slaughter those
bears hatred western world
black heart
shifts seasons unease at hands doom
never again
just shrike cacophony war
black heart
empty
no no no no time heartache
what did expect find
no time run hide
get frightened too
it's not so hard understand
keep
mortal life lurks dismay
lo rorasa came
no heaven would silence pain
then
empty
his temple ruined burns
'v'' black swans
so swore thy razor
could always find
none better
more sugar trails
mislaid burning hay
heart barless prison
empty
hope grave
never enchained
right slot sacred key
empty
more white lady laid
mislaid burning hay
heart barless prison
empty
ran amok forged her face
highly strung cupid's bow
empty
her filthy smoke stack
thorn holy ones
prayer loneliness
empty
nymphetamine girl
dance her moon
once upon time
this lust vampyric addiction
something passed between us
empty
this perfect hell
within river fluids moves torrent
painted nails driven through meek
forbidden eat
tongue tied tightrope spread disease
our slow orgasmic fuses greet
dead night
starved persephone
this end everything
sighting recitals rites vice
head wind breathe ravenous lungs
perverting virtue
galley shadow death
angels raiments
bearing gifts plenitude
traded whose who played win
more held control
nightfall thrall
murder sites
dizzy looking up pervertigo
thrilled breathe tonight
burning as an artist
cloister room
shadows wander through
children night
am corinthian light
prowl thy inner sanctum walls
orgasms expire come puppet wires blind
nails raked savagery
drown back her eyes
desert claims eden
when cold festal stars aligned
queen winter throned
she took conjuring spells cusp night
when undressed
hook mouth saint peter pan
through arcades where shimmering snowfall
making love beautiful dead
six feet under or beneath frayed gown
pricked as witch her stitches itch
fall into line yeild sign
even wild winds sang chora her
devil her knees
archangel dark angel
as death set
sins expelled from heaven
now dreat cedars feed pyres
kraken teethed tear asunder
sardonicus choking his own saliva
descending skirts yield thirsting altar
last prayers hang air
sightless deeply scarred
deranged uncaged
foot mounth sacred cows
thanks webauthormadasafishcom correcting track 7 lyrics
lilith swept across broken land
at crack day though what was shame
spill as his rod
so very kept was virgin hand
snatching breaths between her thighs
bejewelled lit
underneath grave 'tis spread
over those not here
hence no mourning no grief no pain no misery
waste away under lashes whip
expurse innocence helplessness
strike hard deep hell them master
sodomy lust
every beat spoke
scare their boon
muscular final thrust
beauty so frozen bliss
crepuscular lust her
one final time lest should hide
so fond dread
day laughter died
whilst love blood red flower
life have her
pining swans entwined
suicide notes harmonised minor
this day hereafter dies
beneath moon summerlands
they feel season change
lays path those unseen
beauty held dream dead sleep
spearhead insurrection
her skies they bruise nordic women
their cries
no snow white night she died
esther's reign
her spirit flees seeing chains torches
tear out her spells
found fit their sport
passion are tame
carved by another's hand
empty
you've got make an offer
keep climbing higher higher
lead us not temptation
keep us from temptation x3
think you're right
those bright nights glassy waves
midst writhe parapets
thank god suffering
no divine intervention
thank god suffering
would wish
winter frost dwindles across stage
thou art darkest gabrielle
rapture screams
archangel snare flesh
come black goddess arise
should slay their fucking nazarene
proved improved
reciting back almanac travesties
what spread lies arise when lovers die
bolder not wiser
then shooting swans gondola
made caliban manners
go fuck their mothers
last many lifetimes
seems ease fury
promising torments are nigh
put double cross shame
night this
breathing forest surrounds room
embrace two lovers at death
land dark immortals
evolution has been recalled
from secrets men
cherish lissome wants pernicious evil
abandonment unto our lady
bleed incest
rimmed wind storm
reflections dream
he shone fierce intent
jealous god was meant
whispered siren promises
rotting worlds conqueror worm
danced from his ashen lips
skinned well gibbous tones
sweet kiss from beloved faith
hurl thieves down from paradise
end declared from beginning
angels clawed burnished wings
moonchild come harm
weld gates heaven shut
grant witchcraft thy tongue
widow snow peaks
sigh woods wind fell upon
netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared
ancient ones might rise again
these clandestines
glittered contract purse whore
sorceress screaming his grasp
disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
elizabeth christened no paler rose
but after whipangels licked prisoners thralled
see her own shadow adored
no sermons intoned
her decorum as chaste
from whisper scream
daughter storm astride her favourite nightmare
twixt trees shafts
elizabeth came life again
tolled by priest self castrated hung
ravenous wolves elements led
none more cold repose
possessed such delights
though inwards she abhored
tombed her soul such stone
poucing haunt
faustian verse
stigmata still wept between her legs
past howl buggered nymphs
flame unto deathshead
biblical prattled their mantras
yearning keeps captive desire
whom worship ride therefore
soul poisoned from within
when greed lust are sharpened one desire
beside our waiting graves
there no fanaticism as virile as faith
now she gone
tonight flames
tugging veins feed
moon sun
things bewitchments accrue
lucifer snuck inside
raised at dawn catch spell
over heart had near soon forgot
carve future according our will
all tweaked out
gotta fix up
wanna get hooked up
i've got nice home
if lay low out sight
there's breeze makes breathing not so easy
someday i'll wear pyjamas daytime
when came upon some rotting remains
if try hard think will see
look at empty notebook
rouse myself finish washing dishes
tomorrow who's gonna fuss
cupie dolls urine stalls will laughed at
today people dress way they please
funeral when days are done
body body that's job
know right or close anyways
when we're getting low jam
ever again
last it's one keeping
going deep going fast
hello mrs nice
do still hold her hand
c'mon give yourself hand
give him back hand
what god there they asked him questions
until he ran out into warm air
what parabole or very subtile joke
using doorknobs so he thought up brand new trick
he wouldnt tell us how felt when came out
well know it's there but cant see where
future lay before
i'll put boots go see what can see
how tell his wife from all other ducks
watch keep moving twitching
got pill stuck throat
want par tay p par tay
you're talkin dirty
man talking his drink
want par tay par tay
flew by summer vacation
well can bet i'll forget how was then
breakfast master morning
sort who often fall ill young or pine away
threw out stupid common paperweight
he confessed his lie he took picture bathtub
foraging forests primate
see shapes body
said not
just chillin just hangin baby
said it's all just crazy dream
who put granny grannyhouse
who put fun funhouse
dont try everything while gone
dont try everything while gone
mmm mmm mmm mmm
but both girl boy were glad
sit concentrate try hard not hate enemies
standing around standing their two legs
would sweat coconut milk
then moved until reached tundra winter
our driver calculates what time we'll hit town
every time border comes
go inside meet someone
conditioned himself stick his studies
overachiever might putting mildly
would quite good think baby dont think twice
he's doing everyone so stickin
he'd just come along scoop 'em up under his arm
hey bob supe had straight job
man join tarzan forest
science room was an iguana
sometimes suffer from distractions
sometimes wonder if there could really
we'd have chickens cows corn whatever farmers raise
we'll have homemade whiskey ramble down country roads
'cause you're so kind
could fend them off they would let rest
she knows future palm hand
she knew things cut knife she said
what could some cards hold where her foothold
could go british islands
would live right out our back packs
did got caught current
then they had fill mouth cotton at night
there are many dangers
now he throws them into street
many more he'll visit yet
his face name are covered mud
they'd walk together
knights took potions gladly
maidens watched them together
see all symbols unlock what they mean
glenfiddich glenlivet whole single malt family
that's what came
that's what looked
she told was living past
turned now eyes up sky
empty
under microscope life
count down change life that's soon come
life has just begun
beautiful free
beautiful free
think i'll go there own
stripped
you're cheated slated singled out
zoomin zoomin out you're questioning
flywe flywe fly
trying find reason live
empty
look at melook at
i'll give away 'cause dont want no more
although hurt must strong
know knees again
believe can fly
said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
he looked right eyes
'cause if face inside cant see light
so wont come inside never go away
mouths envious
feel sorry soul
people marching all around
when face face
what are going do gift dear child
where there's no reason hide
let's make our escape
but friend i'd sacrifice all those nights
can take higher
can take higher
'til slips away
just hoping one day i'll get out
this life remains same
just an illusion
eighteen just dont know what want
eighteen get confused everyday
eighteen eighteen eighteen
what right or wrong
choir singing
what right or wrong
dont know who believe
no one else there
will help carry end
there's peace inside us all
will help carry end
world at war leaving all fault behind
he reigns all time
no more sorrow oh crying days are gone
rage eyes
are there remind us man his fight
as day breaks dawn
this end
saints his side
aw yeah
they're gone
hope showed
court session verdict
face showing no emotion
sun shines only some
should have been dead
sun shines only some
i've created own prison
which only fuels their selfish pride
it's been awhile where should begin
we've seen our share ups downs
sacrifice
this brings tears eyes
what makes us grown ups anyway
remember meaning
never die
death will defy
let see yearn while cry
cry as body dies
one step own
trying escape
reflecting all mistakes
aint so far down
take from one give another
feel violent feel alone
one only way one
living picture frame

childish
one early morning
but she could not hide her tears
life there are many quotients

'cause they were sent wash away those years
but do not hide tears
slings arrows are killing inside
covered skin peels just wont heal
night hides truth
so choose fight
hurray child
see heart look away
empty
who's got back now

these days continue
climb two by two
these typical times
six senses keeping
why are different
cant rest moment
so can see black cat changing colors
swim as tide choose turn
how could this rhythm ever quit
but they'll all fade away
corner was wondering
that's our blood down there
lyrics by ron villanueva
open up books
advertising raging
ideas birth freedom he showed
this land land
was falling always
all away
rip away tears
what would say
every dog has its day every day has its way
oh all eyes now
afraid if dance might die
clinging straws
live safe say why
what are
when give life
tuckle up yourself
when world ends
going there somehow oh
dont worry about
oh know when world ends
going take top mountain that's no longer there
when world over
where are where belong
where are where belong
first step hardest all
until fire dies
if give begin give
sitting still as stone watching watching
they'll only there til you're dead
worried if looked away she'd gone
steal too much time you'll soon dead
but everyday should good day die
shadows fell into our eyes
just let fire burn
how foul plagued our future cries
red white blue
lowered by ankles
until came along
cant keep coming back once walk out door
how many times have said others
rockets sky
this time wont take long
caught hills where tunnel screams
breaking planes parallel
are damage are guns
maybe it's way was brought into world cold night
you've got power money guns
break out jack could've been rolling stone
empty
gotta bad case love
bad case love
afraid you'll go far
river flows surely sea
one last shot befor curtain falls
cause know cant let go
it's rock rebellion teenage heart
friends aint different it's that's changed
nowhere belong
yesterday's behind
did get what wanted
same guy you've been laughing at
miles away miles away we're miles away
baby baby baby come home midnight train
mystery telephone caller's dead line
empty
regretting what we'd missed closer grave
right into danger
who felt dying
could hear deaths rattle
d disaster
down new orleans
often abandoned
into elevations where everything's clear
took dependency tried get clean
eyes are so beguiling whisper
cant learn live without
once you're connected havent much time
just wanna die without
not ready
children who never knew what doors would open
hard pressed between folds inside overcoat
being part urban decay
feel home fires burn
you're so simple now it's all same
stranded storm trying see through rain
they wanted past they wanted now
would never give no matter how hard they fought
damned if do damned if dont
chorus repeat
am so weak must admit
been smokin more but enjoyinit less
there's fire western world
make wish was dead
grab instead
no matter what they say
going south
breaking law
gonna long time little girl
but guess found weaker side
pills took numb pain
convicted disposed
hey joe
shot her
way down mexico way
some people pu 'em their arm
god damn hate blues
slowly eat away heart
tried but cant hide
tried tell no
was only 17
wont one who pains
that's what they say
paled into light
it's close call
running while rest us crawl
clouded eyes
socially out nine
got yourself boyfriend who'll comin 'round tonight
took long time get here
hair was long just now
still want
i'll tell folks it's harder than looks
gettin sold secondhand
it's okay dont have run hide away
you've slipped beyond hands
but it's okay
jane why did go
what made leave
gone gone gone
burning flags freedom
so if should survive
they told kid got hair too long
kicked out kicked cant open door
spent most life recovery
but made love side nobody sees
all dreams mexico
gonna tell just
empty
there's point no return
guess i'll never learn
just know someone waiting
plan escape
run away from myself
tried tell there's always
couldnt recover from things they said
they cut so deep can never come clean
not only one who's tired gun
another plane out here babe
pressed face glass before broke
lovesick cant kick
look something cat dragged
fire's running through veins trying keep head straight
only want man
memories fires glow
make nightmares disappear
why we're forced products
thinking what might have been
i'll bet strange that's just
being time without being late
are victims thousand voices
touch baby feel thunder
there no getting free
trying kill dream that's inside
sitting over here parchman farm
used press eyes into looking glass
empty
was wasted was dumb struck
shake her nightgown
cinches doctors streaks radio lights
dust heat sound change
running from chainsaw dreaded dream
darkest hour
couldnt see end was near
i'll taken long hard ride
fill all empty spaces you're falling through
what makes smile what makes sad
empty
all comes back
as silver etched sent
told aint enough
eyes never rest
hope can take when goes
something strange ist going down room 213
cant open their eyes
wont last
dark at top stairs
piece by piece bit by bit
it's thousand dead
it's sleeping lie
she closed her eyes turned away
it's knock down drag 'em out beat 'em up mace crowd
it's wave new age
beating new dance
take off crash
brushes up so close
wonder who they are
but you're really one them
social contender social pretender social defender
battles won or lost
never know where we'll sent
coulda been rich
shook right hands
god knows had chance
into light
where paralyzing screem
it's street only goes one way
say our music's brainless boring punk rock
people hanging outside trying get
toody holds lighter when someone has ask
it's not enemy it's sense somehow wont free
never wanted clear pages life
never understood things cause our plight
got no home no have no home
if time worth savin
dont criticize what cant understand
knowing they wont last
ask myself sometimes
now too far gone
have been through this before
someone's about leave
strange how seem know
unknown passage
asked where are going
somewhere far away
his guns are cocked
ticking bomb he waits
giving directions without any plans
there's new kid block
he's taken place
believing it's something we've got
had look never took
but wont change not
would soon gone
plain as day something broken
cant stay no cant stay
twenty four hours every day
come
just cant control myself
flying flying
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer

depths mind
heard from peter
confirming sarah
before say goodbye
you're breathing fumes
come back land
stars sky
wind hair
but they're not tonight
years
an end tears
what destiny's planned
all feelings inside
comatose almost
empty
girl you're strange
conscious feeling
empty
empty
if see purity
means use
that's what want
vicious words
father are pacing
i've been away too long
long spindly
there's no time hesitating
can feel little love
paying debt karma
all night
talked sad
down floor again
as picture herself
waits encompass
pierce right through
feelings are intense
turning point career
graph wall
ask myself sin
ask myself sin
there are lambs slaughter
empty
touch
touch
dont tell secrets anymore
repeat chorus
can understand what you're thinking
no strings attached
only here
hey girl
sharing our free love
listen spirit sighing
let yourself go
freedom's state
it's time start
get right
people take advice
best
so easily
time day
can feel
they fall apart
though may deserve
happiest girl ever knew
happiest girl ever knew
those tender moments
calling telephone
under this roof
inside heart
those tender moments
moved by higher love
moved lifted higher
ground
showing home
thank
call mine
have bound heart subtle chains
no denying facts
strange compulsions cant control
no no no
feel loved
can feel soul fire
take
back again
kingdom comes
by by
way you're winking eye
always hearing say you're liking too
you're liking too
wipe away tear
say this modern love
heart aching
one boys
left this way
seven years long as tall as tree
air breathe air breathe
if want
wipe away tears confusion
leave past
where time stands still
only exist here
will always here
hanging words
this soul dance
fire still burns
telling clearly
talk love trust
inside
know somewhere
by friendship
one filled jealousy
because dont deserve any
answer isnt classified it's heart
if lend would keep safe
more or less
i'll lend will treat tenderly
can run but cannot hide
i'll waiting patiently
it's understood
put him an elevator
by claiming god as his holy right
well who's shouting
well who's shouting
john revelator
if want love
hollow promises
risk health
just cant seem get enough
just cant get enough just cant get enough
call diplomatic relations
cant stand this emotional violence
would set wheels motion
when say innocent
what need
will coming way
smile
rest world
her feelings inside
little 15
love's not enough
lay before us
call master servant
from disposable fun
come master servant
mercy
would lose way again
laid foundations down

pressure keeps burning soul
haunts
spinning lies

living knees conformity
slamming through dont fuck razorback

music by dream theater lyrics by mike portnoy
city's cold blood calls home
it's calling back home
living their other life
help he's brother but love her
cant keep away from her touch
dead night
empty
mirror falls behind
not intending end
immune openness
turn off mind
can find all need eyes
daily dose emptyv
calculated formulated
now they're dead buried yeah
some real thoughts
no energy anger
so find kindness
way heart beats makes all difference
new solutions found
another chance lift life
learning live
though weak cant believe
as far as can throw
mother mary quite contrary
she comes apparently fill void
can tell stepfather said so
she can turn drop water
he takes few steps away
she listens openly
would sit talk
light fuse get away
feelings betrayal incidents
an attention addiction
dangerous heart
dangerous heart
swept away tide
sometimes castles air
crown thorns at side
then sewn upon our sleeves
crucify our instincts
through holes hands
lease their lives has been spent
transcending mystic worlds time
lessons now learned
see same old faces
images dream theater words petrucci
there's no more freedom
somewhere scene from memory
there must third last dance
lyrics by john petrucci
how can bite hand feeds strangers all around
turn from thief beggar
turn from surreal seclusion
have been
out old useless
living out constant deja vu
what they want from aint gotta clue
lies ten feet tall
studio demo from 1988 charlie dominici vocals
prayer hope weary world rejoices
sweet hymns joy grateful chorus raise
alternate ending acoustic dreams cd
oh night when christ was born
heard some rumors told
we'll lay down today
as childhood dreams slowly come true
man pleads forgiveness
sun our eyes
can deviate from commonplace
trembling approaches surf
though time will come when dream day unite
music by dream theater
where midnight hysteria's
monster created
poor vanessa
no big surprise
this world spinning around
am not afraid
clouds roll by roll them
only until will done
through hands steel
you're all that's left hold
red hill town
link lost
you're all that's left hold
empty
nothing seems real
working from seven
everybody tried tell
watch out
empty
takes village
when she falls out sky
she woke up find
thinks she can fly
midnight hour
saying things never said
saying things never said
smell pure adrenaline
suffering from delusions
streaming through night
cannot just let him leave here
sweet dreams run through head
so lonely without baby's love
he learned walk talk time
lost within himself
as man he was danger himself
when will he let out
euphoria fixation
viii losing time finale lyrics by john petrucci 0601
losing time
shame disgrace over mental unrest
journey find
maybe you'll figure out someday
all deserve what were unable see
graceless intrusion
change opinion
lyrics by mike portnoy
closer now slowly coming into view
young child wont tell why here
just cant help myself
haunting every day
feeling wont go away
uncanny strange deja vu
as awaken from longest night
it's been long long time
but mine will never same
know it's easier walk away than look eye
can take away pain
she was standing by edge his bed
take away pain
curtain falls
it's time let rain
i've heard promises
feel heat within mind
but no one can save this time
if his obsessions real
drown beat time
all reasons
what would touch deeper

reflection
leaves frail worn
turn back round
forget about daily sins
fight past walking through ashes
help cant break out this prison all alone
teach how
opened eyes
but must set past free
actually
armed only liberty
what if someone said
human kind has reached turning point
anarchistic moral vision
are justified
may hold key
human kind has reached turning point
but have gone too far
sanctity life
pay attention questions have raised
who were leaders
scorch his mind
empty
mercy dealt losing hand
when go back again
saddened chimes hear
self control
empty
living fear
thought could control life sample jeremy irons from
after all hell put through
empty
had when senses lost control
heavy hearts were bleeding
or did ever leave at all
mind was still wreck
now we're
his woman his father
if there balance
it'd better if swim
empty
you're only given one shot
used think death was end
i'd allright
empty
it's perfectly clear
empty
i've exposed this tragedy
so innocent eyes open wide
lose someone love
door has opened wide
all take
no contact today
empty
here
liquid shadows silence their screams
under glass moonlight
wish our eyes as go
standing our ground
keep them alive
infant dreams need full attention
now widow makes rules
voices repeating
but where was garden eden
his knees'
you've got know who you're
spider window
seems we've lost truth quicksand
keeps us pleasantly amused
voices repeating
eyes upon moon
she's been trying link again
palm her hand head
it's all same only names will change
sometimes it's not man give rest days
check out this
been everywhere everywhere
wanted wanted dead or alive all right yeah
contract out them 5000 dollars so um gotta go
sleeping beauty trips frown
say things change change dear
it's all same
eating words making sick
there's not enough time live
you're expecting
break out you'll see
can won
now can see
i'll need thirty seven stitches keep pain
know are only one little taste heaven
know are only one little taste heaven
everything i've learned today
there's something growing inside
three nothing wrong
you're all by yourself but you're not alone
looking place know so well
explination things do
know choking knowledge
will break
bringing down
seems reminded all this again
empty
what who where were when was down luck know never gave fuck

kicking cans
throwing stones

feeling cant win
dont got lot time
never felt at home
looking finding
love loveless

by old newsstand
every time need laugh around
looking at this tower
walking up stones
this noise inside head
another anchor man tv
think im gonna wise
feeling mighty fine at this time
feeling mighty fine at this time
feeling mighty fine at this time
end coming near
she's never known acceptance
said sorry but true
her steps are barely heard
well i'll rise above
guess knew somehow
remember
barking through trees
what it's lose
quite contrary
she's crawled out window 'cause her daddy just dont care

turning eighteen trying not look too lost

there no hope
cool night air
broken bones
old raincoat

but dont think ready yet
jesus his lawyer

while tears start well eyes

oh wont please send
everything see broken
rainy day
easier look other way
from liking her
believe when say
44 skulls buried ground
family affairs are under covers
33 years tough luck
left carcass worms moles

it's free all
i'll walk through world name tongue
took look inside attic
know i'd do
stepmother hates guts
want so goddamn much
dont know why she's gone
she wrote letter her sister
but she'll always strawberry blonde
wake up night think all years
tell him lie
going over susans house walking south down baxter street
final act indignity paramedics take off all his clothes
she sucks red popsicle while she pushes baby girl pink carriage
she's got way about her
spent day laying her bed
shines everything
get out here
cramping style
so get away kid you've become pest
always taste better when you're sittin jail
from sinking deeper down into ditch
from sinking deeper down into ditch
almost always laugh but that's not really funny
know that's not what bargained
it's up
who's say
suicide e mail do not delete
well still ticks away
she was walking work art
have past
wake up smell stink their lives
dont too surprised
next time if think
might remember as
one who let down
it's where you're going
stars shine sky tonight
no matter how disappointed was
do some stupid things
though swore never would
so though i'd better tell
well it's something i'd do
tv phone
i'll sell all what
nothing harder watch
lick boots
everything will same
there's got someone who wants
trouble dreams they dont come true
if let down it's alright
'cause know i've got an awful lot big dreams
had thought while was sleeping
well decided one day long ago
trip niagara falls
all alone inside mind
knock door means
whatever happened soy bomb
blue light flickering
pavement sky
walking knocking doors
had get out house
trash truck coming up road
when party over
la lalala lalalala
spent so many days
so let's get married make some people
his girlfriend keeps him living
then you'd better get out his way
one day i'll have fly
were special one
there may not day
you'll scarecrow
no one will know name until it's stone
never know who might at doorbell
does body sometimes feel so cold empty
come can help
think about iti'm afraid this false immovability
he battles between right wrong
no shoulder cry no hand hold
money talks that's their rule
fruitless journey his darkest hour
angel without wings
given place time fill up gaps life
listen reason before decide
am destiny
capitol guide
mind has way playing games twisting reality
you've stepped beyond reality
perfect colours shapes
incoherent shapes clouds
deathlike silence so loud
soul temple all secrets retained
can see but can see
shining eyes
flames are burning earth
figure bird
love out display
will day
soul sliding along beam
drops rain are falling down lake
desolated remain
wish he was us today pray hear say understand now
funny those words he said will always true forever ever
constant fear she has
frenzy frenzy
psychological affect she'd created
failure waiting
sacrificed cold night
cold silence
silent night cold light
fly children sky no escape unless you're willing die
slowly suffocate lucky charms
when sleep you're crying maybe wish death
lyrics vocal melody ian parry
he's unaware his mind has shut out his surroundings
see how feels
resulting factor his fear's coming alive
afraid fear fear itself
no compromise no words can make him see
once inside head captive mind his game
can tell what you'll see
now glowing blood makes move flames
flames fire
dont fear beast yourself
night eye heaven shines
poisened hearts black white
it's gone
full charm so open minded
empty
repeat bridge chorus
not soul talk too she created her friends through roomlit view
his huge fortune has created many enemies
where's light at end road
at end road there's light
they're coming get put boards windows
state mind state mind
mnemonic phase resist
they keep falling just when they found real sense direction
angelsongs ride glory winds
we're all that's left mens supremacy
seventeen virginity hand knees
black night
sleep cures fear
she helps transform his anger regression
together we'll pull through
cast away those sins forgiven
let wind makes ring trees
its corners
strange eyes
bloody tears fall down empty hands from
whenever dream you'll return this place
feel cold touch
sitting front blank picture looking
only smell false memories
thousand years so long time an old
no good denying what wrong or right
every crossroads are false
all time through one's place
year after year many sacrifices have made
sacrifices must made
alone afraid different from others
he's lost it's time pray
anguish she felt as memories from her past re appear
two lovers ran away
empty
than you've ever been before
you're not alone you've got stronger
life world visual vortex where reality thought
carving name bullet gives eye
under under wings
going out sleepwalking
looking man attacked
looking somebody's arms
between all you've ever seen or been
first put all down luck
whose shadow paces floor
can deal some psychic pain
fond farewell friend
it's not what
still send all time
still send all time
dont have make pretend picture totally clear
'cos treated bad
walk down alameda shuffling deck trick cards over everyone
could plague when awake
nobody broke heart
after little while
still trying decide
seeing caving
but people arent way think they are
do have guess everyone else
now now
got nothing better do
wont say you're wrong
so let's go go go go
better stop before goes far
what's game chance him one real skill
empty
fights problems bigger problems
still prepared an attack
when you're saying goodbye
someone half as smart you'd work art
having had enough all
do what want whenever want
drink up baby stay up all night
drink up baby look at stars i'll kiss again
pick up an hour or so
got feeling kind cough
cant kick when you're down
believe
cant kick when you're down
paint this paling town
may not seem quite right
look him you've never known him
becoming
bored role but he cant stop
christian brothers gonna take him down
nightmares become it's so fucking clear
what if she thinks so but just didnt say so
last stop resolution
yeah just forget
you're never gonna use starting gun
coast coast
there anything could do
battle's ground
high sound
cold white brother riding yr blood
you're coming up roses everywhere go
feel over each other
got his hat tipped bottle back between his teeth
looking some kind clue
what shitty thing say
should've lit up it's lie
should've lit up
met girl snowball hell
fought him off love
she had dream woke up shock
baby stay
clenched tight
until he tracks her down
one day you'll know what you're talking about
quite an entertaining show not much more
moment's rest can lean against banister
say mean well dont know what mean
people from time when he was
why are staring into outer space crying
no one's gonna recognize
gonna see city dead
talking yourself
you're first timer blaming everybody else
veins all full beer
oh
no attention left pay
wound up tight
echo down hall
put behind
time took cigarette burn
things may allow
honestly guess
rode down south yr little world dream
traced her footsteps reverse up queens
it's all ever see around here
he was sucker double dose
was sticking up friend
said dont go where supposed go
saw face everyone swear
high times man feel fine
living alone would probably ok
maybe have problem
tired wasting breath
put out put away
dont know why guess just do
love
passing time
most time
ooh once was
saw perfect place
give people something they understand
first two folded at slightest touch
we're meant together
dominoes falling chain reaction
frustrated fireworks inside head
it's christmas time needles tree
aint life great
gentle little elaine
you'll walking sun
cant go home it's not way
you're crisis
endless stream reminders
yeah yeah you're still here but just check make sure
empty
wanted her tell she would never wake
where no one else gonna give grief
dont keep around
i've been outside
burning every bridge cross
sleep rest day
'cos even though some cant sleep
under moon as well as sun
come over all friends
about being alone
because just bounce back anyway
come over all friends
but everybody's scared this place they're staying away
but isolation pushes 'til every muscle aches
most cooperatively
some help from johnny walker red
got plans both us
its comedy from 70s
hay stack charm around neck
head down toes reaction
now bus
taking cure so can quiet
it's been here up here
where every new blood gets time become resigned
you're waiting start waiting light
need pat back
millions fans ignoring bands
look at hands unoccupied
just total waste
anything better than nothing
warning
remind someones daughter
leave alone 'cos know dont belong
said do what have do
killing time wont stop this crying
killing time wont stop this crying
home oblivion
home oblivion
okay lets just forget about him
once got back inside
everybody's gone at last
waiting around
stopped spell
do favor let know
got yourself tease displease
so sick tired all these pictures
see nothing wrong
everybody's dying just get disease
before do as devil pleases
all these records look big zeros
can tell right there
placeholder come take up mine
somebody's not paying attention
down here by bay arm around moon
found faith infirmary
talked st james
didnt know what do
felt so ugly before
they walk circle
pretty lucky if they get any kind response at all
met girl square
but one was shut all time
didnt need give him hell
tears are cheap
want give him pain
ridiculous marching band started playing
wont follow down rose parade
cos acts just lovers do
happy day then pay
i'll probably last know
gel everything out
see later
one little affairs
see later
seen how things are hard
seen how things are hard
seen how things are hard
well dont know
said you'd real but dont believe are
wont soon say least it's gonna hard
something single file you're murder mile
single file single file single file single file
throw living past away
son sam son shining path clouded mind
shiva opens her arms now
live southern town
you're killing southern belle
it's just brief smile crossing face
running speed trials standing place
high amphetamines
they all got say what should shouldnt do
stupidity tries
enemy within
oh what surprise
sweet adeline
but it's all about taking easy way out suppose
creative thinker who imagined were more
saw one big problem keep under hat
told so told so
tired dancing pot gold flake paint
white lady loves more
from dream wont remember flashing cop's light
wont tell dad get off back
wont make
where led but didnt lead anything noise
so he might never have know anyone
so she might never have know anyone
she's sight see
nice
you're wonderful
cope make repetition stop
she shows no emotion at all
cant tell it's well understood
place where make no mistakes
if you'll straight i'll straighter
what are doing hanging out
ticket jetstream
if send postcards
wouldnt mama proud
empty
he's so proud kick hard sign
corporation thief new jesse james
little amused by belief her power
thirteen steps lead down
her lovers have her walking 'round
empty
empty
but she couldnt find forgiveness
somebody said must have won
when there are promises break
shock will probably kill
dont let interrupt
pistol was welded holster by age careless children so it
empty
he woke up sweat next day her smile still painted his
accidents will happen
but they keep hanging
add collection
beneath them applause from balcony
so i've made country order
'cos it's same kind pity
oh it's so funny seeing after so long girl
oh alison aim true
alison know this world killing
'cause dont know if you've been loving somebody
when hear silly things say
finally deny everyone unflattering comparison
why dont stop blaming some guy
so punish now let go back sham life
empty
spare drone advice
so dont try touch heart it's darker than think
so she looks her prince finding he's so charmingly
he desires impress his associates
grace virtue turn into stupidity
almost all things eyes once promised
i've seen such an unhappy couple
as he entertained himself singing just sammy davis junior
while day was dipping down
she seemed crying year after year
just she found out what true love about
outside new orleans heat was almost frightening
now dont speak any english just american without tears
empty
now dont speak any english just american without tears
they say they're very sorry but are not desired
he's prison now she's running his mates
we've been friends now oh havent
if dont what will become
if dont what will become
b movie that's all are
turn out lights
should hear things they say about
but baby plays around
it's not open discussion anymore
baby's got brand new hairdo doesnt she look so fine
wish would
gotta girl named lucinda
she's bout drive wild
dark down road his approach constant rain was drenched
hush mouth hypocrite
'til he chopped off head visitor's child
always christmas cupboard at top stairs
say can then run get mummy
were almost beaten punch
you'll find girl you'll promise her anything
hang around dying tortured
her body moves malice
she's been suitably stunning
am starting function
trying so hard big boys
stroking her vanity
found they were overrated
try so hard
she's got playing russian roulette
sister see sister do
but it's easier say love
compassion went out fashion
big tears mean nothing
suppose big tears mean nothing
dont know big tears mean nothing
when night's inviting
dont want look
starts face ends up fixation
empty
tell truth sometimes but
still are only one
silver cup
empty
but every single time
chorus now it's turn talk turn think
down blue chair
say love lasts forever when know night just hours
blue becomes
if it's not punch then its pout
can roll over can play dead
talk past not present tense
her mementos affairs
words love whispers
if am haunted i'll call imaginary friend
stood there courthouse room so close but far apart
he didnt seem care still love
ev'rybody's getting meaner
nowhere nowhere nowhere
try patience
just second
getting nowhere
charm school

so prepared sweep out door

as signals took an age change was easy pickings
reports are coming coal train robbery
hope no living thing cries over his bones
but cant pay love same
life finally empty without
all gangsters rude clowns
those complicated shadows
so see wont missed those complicated shadows
she said one day prince peace will come
as sometimes glimpse terrible faces fire
cant believe i'll never believe anything again
it's way beyond final station
had better not go too far
crawling usa
you're everywhere girl an everyday mess
tried hold but dont know how
everybody knows where go when sun goes down
you're gonna cry cry cry
it'll hurt when think fool you've been
can have any hero from bygone ages
or at least remove blame
shakespeare will have wait his turn
somebody blonder
now know was only fascination
thank days

wont forget single day believe
now not frightened this world believe medays
dear sweet filthy world wife or whoever reads this

you're spellbound baby there's no doubting
please put rings diff'rent finger if meet tonight
please put rings diff'rent finger 'cause we've got so much at stake
throw jockeys from their throne
it's nothing but dirty rotten shame
not an idle boast
was taught believe were looking down everyone
if there's any justice at all i'd punished i'd surmise
sometimes feel little mad
empty
everything seems so tranquil
he's absolutely indispensable
oh doctor luther's assistant
sure enough getting worse
just as soon as win this war
when they dont know meaning word
chapter one didnt really get along
are captured here quotation marks
will excused if presume
cog consults watch he cups his hand
strip polish this unvarnished truth
cost living sin would make poor man out paul getty
yesterday's news tomorrow's fish chip paper
if this letter should fall into
found number somehow dialed
now dont know each other anymore
or you're pounding counter beggin more
face turned away day turned black
oh oh oh oh you'd forgive her anything
from whisper scream
if they keep drinking then they'll end up staying
got two lips long kiss
everyday all time
voice would drag her down its suggestions
she'd try polite making faces
he didnt hear through her disguise he didnt leave her rush
now know rules find yourself another fool
now know rules find yourself another fool
it's getting mighty crowded
saving trouble putting down
too crowded getting mighty crowded
while she goes out her mind
only want pretty ones
only want pretty ones
can change name but cant change face
thought heard mention name cant talk any louder
girls talk if they say it's so
girls talk they wanna know if care
you've been taken this time
we've got prizes if can afford
they can all go straight hell while howl down whole hotel
soon there'll flowers prayers are sad know
words sung by character movie given brackets
so god give strength god give strength
so god give strength
there could ever happy ending
joke flock hand up fleece
drinking cola mystery brand
hang around longest night
now dead now dead you're all

made bed
as door behind closes
they pat some good boys back put some rod
some are no fun at all
making such progress now can hardly tell
there's smart young woman light blue screen
there's shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes
better send begging letter big investigation
they do grown up movies'
if gonna go down
hand hand
unspoiled unaffected he wants her so much
looked but hesitated
they're shining up their shoes kick falling star

containing all secrets life other useless things
but cant bring myself look

even though i've seen movie
one's named gus one's named alfie
she gave little flirt gave herself little cuddle
he's fine figure man handsome too
he's acting innocent proud still know what he's after
reluctance seems surprise
they're never worth crying
tell how can advise someone dont even know
so writing people may never meet
once held her
never knew what had
who gives all her love
kiss 'cause feels hit

we're such unlikely lovers
cheap pink lipstick

upon wilted roses

thought heard working mans blues
then tell sorry tale spent princess
well it's dog's life rope leash or diamond collar

sorry say knew all along
sulky girl
avoiding mirror her pitying stare
she's smarter than

an arm leg severed head
should hate girl whole night through
instead having sweet dreams all about
but there's void without kiss
'til we're burned scattered atmosphere
gnaw at her side
empty
will tear them up voice ringing ears
miss talking dark
miss talking dark
what if never learn how behave
it's same every year
unwrapping presents should have sent
behind brittle smile or shrill laughter
close door dim lights blow out candles
tears before bedtime
either can leave past behind
use whenever fight
take anytime down station
finding life will not deadly
but when they told 'bout their side bargain
but it's so hard refuse
know angels wanna wear red shoes
'have been good boy never played toy
neighbor's revving up his vauxhall viva
oh dont wanna freeze
beat upbeat

well had little feeling have big time
banish all dismay
extinguish every sorrow
walking down times square electric daylight
now know should have never walked over bridge burned

empty
rome burns down everybody's fiddle
dont know where start or where stop
something under her skin

but he's not man you'd think he can
never let hear say you're not trying
all love world
head spinning round faster faster
c st ignatus house willoughby drive parrametta

hated then but over worst
every night ask yourself
indulgent smile
seem so long past caring
can still friends

there's been long honeymoon
why does her friends phone keep ringing
bride boy are barely grown up
ugly little dreams get needle no thread
what would loved ones say
she's not only flame town
now you're not only flame town
but it's so hard remember
as smoke disappears air
they interrupted evil designs
or several tiny fractions this portrait still omits
at other end telescope
other side summer
rabid rebel dogs ransack shampoo shop
absence perfume
kiss goodbye earth
girl shoes
she looked as unlikely
she walked up nice policeman asked him match

these walls were lined pictures
so tell how am supposed live without

bruiser spun hula hoop
very sorry he spoke
reappear upon back
endless balmy breezes perfect sunsets framed
fate has no price
sign seal send friends

you'd punish any girl meet
but as radio played bedroom wall

searchin light darkness insanity
spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
where harmony
oooh ooh
losing face boys while she's whispering his ear

empty
'cause love expensive free
once never quite enough
may one day go distance
chorus 1
get out now out streets nowhere neighborhood
get out now out streets nowhere neighborhood
soon darkness would suck up into dawn
well they've been writing name bathroom wall
just cant take just cant take
well dont mean nothing at all
head back open wide

repeat chorus
we're out groceries again
happy hour that's where we're meeting

they couldnt find them
when smile can tell know each other
do do do do
this not face
life life now live shadows
took away reason live
life life
cant buy place sky
time beats up
she will bring little box moonlight
dreams so real they grow wild vine
were wearing piece
faces dark
looking at her son
some folks are morning people
let's do town now
give muddy muddy water
'cause cant get over pain
keeps up right past dawn
oh can try cant chase her away
used ride around broken down old car
getting's good
everything has happened way was meant
please forgive dont mean seem insane
quand le vin est tir il faut le boire when wine opened
j'tais terriblement gne was terribly embarrassed
c'est du toc
can make easier understand
you've got suspended motionless time
an island but you're an ocean
it's stormy sea love emotion
if come
walk but keep road i've paved
may see only through eyes
i'll never confined
taught all
down enough crawl primitive
going out
dark dampness lingers
just see glimpse light
man strong mind soul
make sin companion
man strong mind soul
make sin companion
unforgotten tribe calls
stabbed each other back
hear our cry from down below
through another late night confession
tattered pages
an old friend nothing left say
if want know
keep distance
owe life
hold clutching hope i'll strong
isolation freezes life coldness grips heart
thousands voices drowning out his own
rising sun
existence defy
drowned depths meaningless
distant vision tempting water fall
exile this medium bondage far beyond
soon exhumed consumation
as well
miles still divide
eye eye
miles still divide
but cant see
face fear
close eyes
here are looking reaching out
come
morrigan fallen angel queen magic
desire
earth fear children inherited at birth
him earth he forsaken till he
children played outside sun frost
empty
mares hope ride through their dreams
answer save will have forgotten
sparks through
veins then when called out
perpetual journey into realm
torn inside there way
how much longer can hold
have stood beneath troubled sky
island stream
healing cripples
preached him galilee
beware kiss death
am are
understand father son holy ghost
grant absolution condone sin
must fate warning now
where do go from here
leave past behind
leave past behind
leave past behind
it's been while since we've been moved
holding easier than letting go
proud olympian
deranged disease
now soul belongs
live by sword
victor main event
he casts his blade vengeance
misfit misfit he's misfit
passion or just profession
passion or just an obsession
are leading way first may
blackmass romance
lonely town falls their knees
you're one saw flight
under brooding skys watchful eyes
world fallacy dont want desolate
sheep she wolf must run
not single word guile heard
face fear within
heal wounds within
but when all said done
looking person used
no one can grow
pale fire
are listening
million miles away
drifting out
all around this shade gray
this shade gray
hours crawling
distant thunder
wind at window
looking words
where are am
je vis dans une baignoire
let nothing bleed into nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
will not defend
know dont understand
but often wonder what could have been
stare from darkness
revise revisions reverse decisions
let nothing bleed into nothing
when were falling
call hear call hear call hear call
between was
sound voice breaking
close our eyes awhile
fight keep cause
land which speaks our tongue found
tuned out neutral vegetation prime time
looking out familiar scene
caught up our convictions forget
where stand not so far from
parallel lives running parallel
have faith scripture visions kings
welcomed listen music heard again
fathomed
her shears
empty
light
dont mean much anymore
tomorrow hard see
silent cries
toward autumn years

confront master sin
here comes message from antennae
had an accomplice who knew nothing
dial double zero
dial double zero
words can boost words can break
more than world inside mind
now surrounded all by strangers
dreams empty into life
dreaming death sleep again
familiar voice blending through
wake up you're living nightmare
land isnt real
parties only attend
sunshine cant sleep
slipping faster all time
twenty first second chance
lifeless body that's cold feeling pain
you'll live life saint as decide
you'll live life saint as decide
everything drawn away
friends are friends until end
everything know past
sun beats upon skin makes sweat
everything see now
needle will push pain will stop
needle will push pain will stop
permanent part this spot right here
crawling lonliness mauling
falling sirens calling
still walk
standing edge time
suddenly pinned
am here one final footstep forward
detached fucking wacked
looking down realize
writing walls been smeared
stumbling look out below
hold their heads down
forget about heaven
hope choke yourself end
fucked up everyone's life
fucked up everyone's life
despise despise recognize gouge eyes
fucked up everyone's lives

running out crosswalks
almost always switch back
after hits pavement

then cant get by
empty
shooting up shooting down
claw hangs just above head
empty
innocent children dressed sacred lamb
again arena mine live die
someone steals love away turn aroundthey're gone
iron eyes see right through control soul
what do want from love mercy or control
sirens blazing
sirens blazing
it's
this stowaway's ship going down
way beneath less than what you've got
slamming faster just hit ground
if havent learned lesson yet
if it's easier let go
see always get way
feel guilty about being alive
know cant tell
look alone
sounds pounding metal radiation creation
louder gets better he feels
returns us earth's core until world war four
walks right beside
empty
as move from door door
not an apparition not holy ghost
slips through fingers
filling another cemetary
turning into monster
shooting stars inside our heads
smell skin fire
they'll misbehave
introductions so intense
only way win game
corruption from white blue alike
famine plagues lands they rape
shiite dies pick fight
empty
panic fronts world wide race
faceless creature i'll get yet
fucking sick this hope tongue dont slip
kicking out this make believe
say angry have lousy attitude
so fucking happy
honor even death soldiers glorified
collects his thoughts last time
no room dishonor hari kari's dagger gashing side side
deliverance upon dirty knees
twist plot demand supply
at any speed
hoping place safe
pick window because now you're leaving
slash lips were once longed kissed
first step out up then start walk
promise keepers nothing cheaper
dust kicked about
dont care what they say
what they all think now
wanna get belly full beer
get about as oiled as diesel train
juvenile product working class
she notioned tangle she mentioned trip
run knotted situation
sunken thought time dry spill brain
laugh thru tears let go all fears
butchers her dam when no one around
when she saw what she had done she gave her father forty one
come help
all know what i'd do
cant walk down middle without
tell failing
come guidance
now pack shit get fuck out
real washes ashore
lame excuse hide pain
generations handed down
broken glass looks best when suns goin down
making decisions coins toss
never doubted teachers just lessons they taught
wake master
open doors never chosen
screams bloodless howls
eyes eyes brothers brothers
send young ones back do mans job
tribal primal criminal
made bleed real nice
never heard thing
will all crumble away
she knows know what she's thinking
constrictor form woman
put gun head
head held hands
dead inside heart bleeds
head held hands
pushed too far by numbers
what way go
starved banged what way go
heavens flippin dinner
what took lifetimes achieve
win lose or dead
what's making run through wet track
numbers back numbers head
swollen faces beaten dogs
are knowing what they're
trading heads trading beds
even though act way
never had chance say goodbye
look down ground
try living lie kicking out same old guise
all life i've been searching something
if give twist
will find believer
love but hate taste
done done next one
they're not dumb they were so wrong
empty
when she goes storming out
lets go another round
can go another round
lets go another round
can do this one more time
it's
are gone onto someone new
but cant choose
empty
someone getting best best best best
someone getting best best best best
when talk about
well talked about
dont want look
try get out
more more take
save confession
we'll burn away from all other flames burn tonight
standing their light
we'll burn away
burn burn
dont take what dont need
but honestly
tonight thank stars
dumb as he denies
if she was true she'd make them
all sick
was soaring ever higher but flew too high
charade event season
surely heaven waits
empty
can solve all mine
dont deny dont deny
dont deny dont deny
if dont let go
else are looking someone blame
you're not only one
life belong runaways
felt everything was said done
bittersweet surrendering
nothing more give
silent all these years but now getting off chest
hide behind obsessions trying keep check
stuck middle no ones making move
i'll fine without
sound laughter demise
now know way true love should
could fall lovewith
sing along soul today
what does matter
oh know did
bet life there's something killing
heart across heart beats it's best
this time
i'll meet there
oh look there's rape machine
ooh look at cadillac
ooh look at radio
re live here now
now we're old worn
maybe just feel too much
end over end
empty
oh no dont talk about
empty
empty
made these promises
empty
empty
oh oh oh oh oh oh
out her head she sang
if everything could ever feel this real forever
running exhausted lost
this caution this fault
one day i'll have enough gamble
ask walls
floats away
she comes back down
money allows
everything worn it's friend
just armies bored life
i'll never fraternity
swearing by them
never believe frathernity
voices visions are locked head
one forever
could free what's keepin
could free what's keepin
he plays an old guitar
cause when he tells his two best friends
when he plays
time lunch cannot leave
trapped inside this twisted mind
wish could stay sick
everything starts going down
can right way
dress up stitches it's now or never
tired wearing black blue
blood
gimme stitches now or never
sink someone tied
take another stab at
true things around but
missed all sideways
good ones all get taken
right behind everywhere go
empty
disappear before get away
you're gonna fly high
call riding gravy train
if all pull together as team
she helps herself
everything anyone want
dont wanna hear
she's spilling over
will greet yourself when sun arrives
stationed wire one day i'll let go
see hell
buzz inside head
wish had another
angels hover above
i'd share piece mine
blew all away
blew all away
hells gard hells gard wait all world
am selling out
couldnt stay
someone cover
empty
had share memories now it's time move
call i'll shout down
hide seeks alright if find
dream
all methods abused
had no hand
dont owe anything x8
its hard recognize that's all
if thought could ever barter
bombs beating
feel alive
empty
raise mortal man
didnt even care
its kinda middle city
getting him lots stuff loading him
so sitting couch know
he was really really smelling good know
he's kinda got lifted up so
cause this one lie
i'd give all away if give one last try
why'd have go let die
why'd have go let die
why'd have go let die
hearts gone cold hands were tied
if swear you'll never tell
must live skin that's new
what would do
secrets worth keeping
one more time last time
down out again x3
one more time last time
one more time very last time
maybe season
open streets raise gates

how come could not cheat
open eyes are broken if you'd just consider
help yourself help yourself help yourself
could spend lifetime waiting here
but anyway
he's just cattle slaughter
something felt today something heard
would never change thing even if could
that's gone passed by
one more year you're not here
represented so well
think it's time all should come clean
never knowing who believe
sliver hope no diamond rings
fade away time oh

nine o'clock show ending

when their eyes met they both began smile
he'd come realize he'd neglected certain things

robert earl was singing out
'cause sometimes best cowboys
really dont remember how
aint no cowboy's got
aint cowboys at all
when two strangers shared night
but didnt matter them
someday she'll tell him boy his kid
both needing something from each other
she had need feel thunder
nothing between us but night
written her lover's eyes
every time pass wheat field
comet burning bright
fill spaces between
some get sweeter every time they're told
that's way that's way remember
they say she just went crazy
screamin out his name
when he told her he was ridin
nobody can explain
pulls lost soul from harm
will not change
but it's not world am changing
what do so
will find hard sleep tonight
dont recall no dance hall girls
thought it'd drown us all
know he done his best
looking back memory
but if i'd only known how king would fall
he's got lunatic smile
stick rope anything 'cause he dont care
but he's got no choice
know think he's crazy well think you're right
said cow all white red
cooed him sleep love
poor orphan girl named maria
she fed loose corn from market
she waited till just before midnight
soaring up into rafters
dining room fell silent
'cause i'd seen own dear brothers crawl back house
but somehow couldnt help but have doubts
he said son it's gonna hurt more than hurts
both belonging another
well within innuendos
save their own alliance
they could have been her savior
he's bringin lots toys
so take advice best nice
now mistloe hung
he's come long long way
as came walkin past drivers
plugged up east at bull run
about buckboard bear creek cowboys grizzly rose
takin world alone
hard workin boys crew
one heart
two hearts have never pounded this
burning night dawn
passions uncaged
must follow where goes
if never try
dare dance tideyes
know i'll take some falls
'til river runs dry
those dark clouds forming
she's drowning emotions
she stopped searching
will make own
moonless summer night
her faded flannel gown
sleepless night
strange new perfume blows
out control
cause tonight will last time
down dixie's sunny shore
they came together
wreck out highway
god give strength
means so much more
why cant see walls
palm trees standin tall
where she comes
it's not it's not good enough
it's deep inside
could hold million years
storms are raging rollin sea
together we're buildin up real hot hand
yea we're two kind
if know what talkin about

hey she's little queen south
yea pickup truck her limousine
workin full house
yea we're two kind

troubles forgot 'em
now i've got smile
troubles forgot 'em
if he'd only grant this wish wished back then
there wasnt much could recall
some god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
stroking her curiosity
what's name
gonna bread locks
she carrying torch love vain
when angels told shepherds his birth
how angels told shepherds his birth
horse named desperado
he drinks long neck bud gets little loud
through his rowdy days hardest fall when he almost died
than he once rode past
hit so hard he heard crack
he's an uptown down home good ol boy

one who never ever was love
i've been fallin here
at mention name
wonder what's going
some big men might live misery
found myself not feeling any pain
fell love again last time
say too much guitar music tequila salt lime
out blue clear sky
empty
she never knew what his calls might bring
honey there somethin wrong
he left phone danglin off hook
there's so much about gonna miss
dont believe chasin crazy dreams
might seem an ordinary night
all care about gettin back real soon
lonely highway stuck out rain
every minute have gone

tighter than an eight day clock no way unwind
since woman left down out

before wind up gettin hurt
except fall take when you've been loved given up
all at once you're turning off old feelings once had
hurricane blows out again
oh every time rains lord dont pour
walked back chevrolet
told her wouldnt miss her at all
famous last words fool
famous last words fool
one short night sin
but they cant write wrong
both knees ground
played by rules but didnt win
she was his girl
empty
they all have choice so lift up voice
love taste whiskey straight
i've just got friday night fever
sometimes man just needs breather
there must been some magic
runnin here there all around square
so sorry keep interrupting what were gonna say
if dont mind maybe can talk little more about
life goes
she's about as gone as girl can get
she's about as gone as girl can get
turn right at light park back
old charley done time two years pen
crying words are welded mind
i've been crying all night long
now pride drag bore when you're lonely
but nobody said would not worth
brings smile face tear eye
there's place where mornings are an endless blue
brings smile face tear eye
repeat chorus
her good bye hit heart
her good bye hit heart
most time walking line
baby scolds later she holds
still believe matrimony
but dont belong there
i'll payin rest life
if door bell rings
lies make us strong
so roll shades down
though out money
but when feel braggin
hold tightand cowboy bands mission
telling latest jokes
let whiskey whisk her out mind
empty
halos horns lock up dance floor
it's honkytonk saturday night
guess could say i've been around
never found thing she couldnt do
empty
so if see looking down trying not show this frown
cross heart
promise
as look into future
all faith can manage shaow frown
look at
comin home thought i'd stop have round
all because met friend yours today
'cause need someone
wasnt fooling around
romanticizing
so take seriously
it's time somebody did some walkin
it's not an easy thing do
there's no reason prolong
when slammed door tonight
i'll stop call
truth known dying crying
let stom start
i've loved all heart
it's gonna rain
than aint livin
cause got lot bottom land
unless get little coochy coo
offering option
baby can stay right here
baby good yourself
but if choose anyhow
baby can stay right here
you're gonna see change
cause if you're thinking want stranger
love was not built shifting sands
watch fire embers glow
never gonna let go
never gonna let go
but satisfied
satisfied
pushing aside all pride it's worth try
too deep pull out now
so good friend
believed had forever our side
back down lonely street house that's steep nothing but line
aint suave or debonair
took while them sell
it's too late now
say you'd made big mistake
about these tears eyes
guess should thank unlucky stars
there wont no more next time doing wrong
empty
empty
i've got funny feeling somebody's stealin honey
lord love child love see her smile
but these circumstances aint funny
think weve got secret but always shows
one look at
truth was so plain see
just look at
that's what they intended dancing an just wanna dance
just wanna dance

watched fade kiss at time
there's nothing left heart
cause livin aint worth livin without
gave her too much too little too long

some folks got nothing but trouble
'cause they've never known

shadow's only one walks beside
read between lines
sometimes wish someone out there will find
shadow's only one walks beside
eyes feel they're gonna bleed
passed point delerium
death closing catching up
now it's all figured out
but future's looking good
was once filled doubt
just burning out
just burning out
taking back what's mine
lost found trouble bound
into destination unkown
staring out window
take away strains being lonely
take place call home
it's home
or maybe just dumb
today first day rest
leaving traces mistakes
only from such liar
wellmom dad will never understand
home headstone
noose over home
last chance piss all away
nothing but hell pay when all
last chance piss all away
grudges come back haunt us
noose over home
wanna get ripped off
give all away
all amuses
so go ahead kill yourselves
am here or am there
dont call up 'cause not home
disappearing boy
stuck
stuck
mack forehead chain
love feelin cheap
say want leave
looking directions
but cant choose
wanna sit here all life alone
this may sound little rough
woke up cold sweat
but pen writing wrong
oh love her
flying hand hand
keep dreaming her
wasnt long ago
anybody ever say no
exactly just how he became
knew back when
was just
wiping tears from her eyes
wiping tears from her eyes
an extraordinary girl
fallow dress codes
auctioned off life
now it's gone
fixture talkshows
but isnt drag
it's pretty bloody sad
it's favorite son
2000 times before
let's nuke bridge torched
pride
take
roll
sits thin white line
wish one hand shoot other
its throbbing tooth ache mind
get funny feeling that's alright
drain pressure from swelling
much more than but
together hand hand
not sure exactly what you're thinking
what hey
throw away past mistakes
another turning point fork stuck road
hope had time life
let vultures pick apart what's left
gonna take joyride anyway
he's at again
nowhere go
i'll back
eyes itch burning red
why does 1 1 make 2
why does 1 1 make 2
i'll cheering you're going down
when ship going down
as ship going down
did she know did she know before she went away does she know
yet again kicking myself i'll here battle scars waiting
so close eyes
no one here getting out alive
do ever build up all small things head
1 2 1 2 3 4
beyond shadow doubt
as reach break day
reach break day
got hold yourself
hear dogs howling out key
there's flag wrapped around score men hey
pulverize eiffel towers
this dawning rest our lives
where you've lost dreams rain

demand victory demand sacrifice
frightening visions journey
denial reason their suffering
earth stinks corpses damned all time
plutus holds key
passing through gate dis furies scream her name
immersed depths below souls scream agony
cold timeless grave buried head first shit
traitors freeze all eternity
immersing myself his feeling
their life from fades
experimenting understand human soul
alone confused what am
now just see her face
curse will lift will survive
feel shock

maybe someday will all free
he's here
our fallen brothers
could never leave her
died
repeat chorus
cant see this barren land
watching them crumble
end light end one
raised her love osiris from dead
would risk salvation
dawn shines light pain untold
this pain wont end
hell put through
god knows why
shamed meyou shame god
hiding right here inside
evil takes soul
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
here our fate
we're damned by our youth
so take final step
last december
visions come visions go
reflection an aging soul
empty
see sadness their eyes
things i've said done
look at pain around
nothing less nothing more
there one choice see
singing word
as moon fades away
everyone's grave danger
wont see us there wont feel our stare
now you're frozen there human shell
so heed warning before our own existence falls near extinct
oppressed centuries await prophecy
so our world doomed we'll lay claim again some day
know it's wrong cant deny
pure evil
paint sky blood tonight
as life slowly fades away
lifeless cold grey
nor ones leave
lyrics schaffer
brought this all upon myself
musiclyrics schaffer
now just puppet god devils own descent
will wrath god have mercy soul
father said worry not what they say
hear what say
it's leap faith
storming demons travel through night
what this have done
life's own it's pride
vindicate cleanse earth all mankind
bide time planning fate
sixth day
walk earth another day
descending angelic force
she swore an oath an allegiance
empty
empty
repeat chorus
forced power besieged
this path choose
y erik love i've waited all life
carlotta's head other death's planned
y m what's behind mask
bound forever this barren land desolate
as plead knees
night came
empty
henchman awaits
chose this fate no turning back
undying his will kill his bloodlust profound
families these bodies which held such precious life
demonic clown shapeshifter
watch beat as cry
weeks weeks cried
oh know oh know
know he's an angel now
music schaffer lyrics schaffer
into burning lake fire
brings knees
fill sweet desire
empty
our sacrifice reality
knew was end
what will price
our fathers told us this hell
keep running been lonely too long
do remember power flame
empty
breakaway chains he will set free
didnt know was one blame
didnt know was ball chain
cuts through heart razor
they will stand test time
bleed silence
they will stand test time
shadows mind
finding rainbow's end
lifting higher
selling dreams city lights
city's fire
that's when night rages
know you've lost control
when survey all madness face earth
countdown revolution
countdown revolution
break chains set free
everyone's got their cross bear
cards were dealt life's unfair
gonna cruise boulevard
we've got action no standing still
since came into life
every single thing
everything need
shadow loving wings forever will stay
since came into life
into eye eye hurricane
inside eye hurricane
inside eye
dont know dont know where you're going
father forgive them they know not what they do
sun will rise sun will set
comes down time chance
away from dark night
was crossing line one too many times
life was taking it's toll was losing control
now finally found way back heart
know i've been lonely love
hear call prophet
demons are calling it's turn do or die
castles are falling flames burning high
you've got grin bear
let nothing move soul
when you're chasing down star
just hold line hold line
life's journey til end time hold line
because i'll always know truth
hear sweet voice love cant deny
so ask now wont guide
i'll wait
if takes forever
i'll wait tonight
shadows night
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
kingdom fighter
another time another place we'll standing face face
kingdom light
hebridian winds blow
legends are reality
nightmare runs through day
when will learn
there she was eve paradise willing give
master master disguise
master master disguise
master master disguise
left bitter taste heart stone
i'll wait
take hand we'll start again
turn hand fate
cant see our love so right
i've tried everything could find
walking paradise
walking paradise
forever i'll share life
knowing what's line
open up eyes
now turn away
there's still time turn away
never surrender no take power love
never surrender
what really matters when cross finish line
caught up rat race playing devils game
living fast lane burning flame
she always was winner
secret lover comfort
speak silence talk
i've finally found home by side
now realize cant live without
so get out bed
but since you've been gone
telegram
out head
his spirit's dying way
stealing everywhere no one seems care
where's peace where has gone
reflecting mirror
heading from east into west la
perfect stranger stand line
together can have all
together we'll share harmony there without treason
stand or fall
tears eyes world
dying traditions selfish ambitions
silence night can hear cries
into valley sorrow
into night they will ride
empty
there's no turning back
when he's running pack
another mindless crime
papers signed at immigration
into air fly gracefully
when you're under gun it's cold sensation
when you're under gun it's blue damnation
freezing by fire while you're chilling bone
victim system living city
deadly stare into monitor screen
remote controller's hand
visual decline etched upon mind
i've got brand new band
walk inside shoes
but momma aint now painted clown
'cause life aint no crime
hope someday see what see
walk away you're prisoner lies
it's only fear itself keeps chained alive
am wrong or right
but could feel him
am wrong or right
sick tired being pushed around
cant hear river run without sound
double chorus
shine brightly while can
feel warming one
all around
all around
see rising sun
wanna tell
all people
hear voices
hear voices
nothing seems right
but wont get far
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
baby dont cry
never givin up wrong
respect sacrifice
when you're looking out control
trying take another ride
all troubles soon leaving
empty
turns them into real things
closing all doors
some cat inside
neon ghosts city
beautiful girl stay
well do hope it's not too free
uneasy morons smile
all who never began
shadow death
endless search
when love around
needs
cant find love
push away those bitter tears
one day think know myself
mind planet
body language
body language
where has our innocence gone
are comfortable skin
some days am everything hate
it's no use pretending
love day life
dont stop
cause understand
dark night
here comes clown
wish were
read late paper was full bad news
take chains from mind
light beams from outer space
communication disinformation
so entertaining
show us truth
got find reason
put rope around
comes around knocking down doors
before they cut roses down
letting god's tyres down
argue itself
moment's glory
we're making trouble
who's going teach
use delusions
if push hard baby
use delusions
counted out loss
taking over
empty
looking this way
trying do
look her eye
look at them go
look its eye
never will ignore
feelings know
you're so fine
disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear
lose mind
lose mind
rocket shoes our feet
darkness fog
sky above wont fall down
execution bitterness
dont change thing
looking revenge
dont loose head
knife carry has been sharpened
now cant do time
can pay price
starfuck friend
that's buried deep inside
act got answer
all seem care about
but can pay price
baby's down world she knows
ah elegantly wasted
aw sure
hide
could right could certain could right
everything do
live we're gonna loose some sleep
way see world
change face magazine
reminisce turns
change face magazine
stare shock at what saw
long teeth whiskers rat

choosing guns or fighting swords
best man wins end

never free
well they let out pontiac
where rail has been has been
cannot buy protection
walking streets mainline connection
no time
if want i'll cook sew
desert road from vegas nowhere
coming closer sweet release
falcon hath bourne mate away
she weepeth both night day
moving again
oh he's movingmoving again
ask yourself why he's off when others surround
bliss face down defended
gonna take him when go
couldnt say had been juiced
please dont get too close
take him when go
remember one night drizzling rain
pass door wont come
love lost her skin so fair
feel afraid call name
while all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
all want do love everyone
tell where love what prophet has said
only here this moment
know everybody here wants
i'll rise an ember name
know everybody here thinks he needs
her love rose pale dying
all pain when think back when
cause know you're somewhere out there right now
oh love
parting was mutual
feminine smiles right side wise more than
there's room both us fly
true love has come us all
l cohen
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
i've seen flag marble arch
but all i've ever learned from love
oh baby say
wanna inject blood
wish was 5 dollar bill
first photographs take right hands
take down ground
empty
havent heard
two cripples dancing end lie
some other love becomes
not but
know could so happy baby
from west unto east
shall released
got girl here tonight
now want someone badly
burn here
someone ooooo
mind blur some blood chin
his brand new stereo
last chance crashing freedom
best intentions become facts again
glass champagne
always have respected her busting out gettin free
if she's passin back this way not hard find
ah mon amour
even pepi from napoli
people came there from so far away
cant forget little square
dans tes grands yeux
sapphires boxcars speeding towards end
think ought know
baby's got new clothes
baby cant blessed
long time curse hurts
was hungry was world
breathing oh
as were leaving
'cause all got tune
know shirt's all wet
yes kick out jams got kick 'em out
let kick out jams
this our last embrace
did say no this cant happen
lost myself cool damp night
drink much more ought drink
lilac wine feel unready love
neither good nor bad just kid
see rain fall upon funeral mourners
child know how much need
oh will ever learn
kingdom kiss upon her shoulder
'cause it's not too late
an cov'rin crossroads standing at
but mama you're just mind
lying bed
memories fire rhythms fall slow
it's i've searched so hard
spring water floor this
bliss abyss
she cheated she lied stole her
can hear love again x4
all law gravity
price admission
had send away bring us back again
what am still
have no right wonder just how or when
whole family's splintered
no stars revolve around
there no single entrance
feel no shame what are
fall light fall light
leave home car leave pulpit
fall light fall light
all young lovers know why
dont know what asked
so new bedroom floor
so new bedroom floor
it's overflowing now inside
how many times have heard someone say
but one thing's gone certain when comes time
take away these thoughts mine
dig holes sleep inside
dig holes sleep inside
she free
thought i'd hurt mother
back when was baby baby saying his prayers
lauraknow this song always
although door was open there's nothing left now
strange fruit hanging from poplar trees
jump hedges first
oh oh sweet thing sweet thing
sweet thing
oh sweet thing sweet thing
nevermind now heart how much he's all
i'll keep happy rest natural born days
gone astray
good riddance goodbye
there nothing sadder than
when her baby comes call
watch evil black sky
people public can ignore
let's see take another drag
will now black sky
have no fear this machine
love that's right time
do do do do
turned each other saying 'i love baby love you'
good night
come call question
please let bring back this gifts mine woman
loan shark bliss
when see face
mother dear world's gone cold
what will say
what will say
empty
he's out there somewhere still
we're all lying natural
cant help from looking outside guarantee
through yard through yard blonde girls
so run run run run run run run
so run run run run run run run
fear may come
if had only known way
adore

kitty flesh so nice
come let give o
flesh so
love destruction name but two
such price what say
but so pleased
if want
when time's gone by
but as soon as touch
will go when die
think i'll stay here anyway
when going nowhere going somewhere
when going somewhere going nowhere
all best things always should
bring bring bring
nothing's going seem way seems
makes feel lost when starts rain
sneak up behind jump start mind free
isnt fun
dont believe
dont believe
dont believe
more lost am found
should see right through
leaving us nowhere go
love no one at all
but i'd rather damned than let go
you've gotta get good thing when see
cant feel cant speak cant think
where were
turn away
say soft
burning
burning
never let headline by
there's what feel
know there's nothing can do
make swing
make swing
spelling out
guess it's ok if today's unlike rest
so it's ok shouldnt say word
know impatient but there isnt really time
it's just real thing
empty
always talked too much but most was left unsaid
if move i'll fine
nothing can do or say
waste time explanations
wrong train can tell
all so much art keeps us apart
so dont tell what right what wrong
making promises someday
if can have can have
always always when dont but that's life
face all dreams
voice always heard
if knew what was
say what know no one
how feel real real
if so i'd know
right here right now
right here right now
watching world wake up from history
goal out reach but still sight
nothing ever goes quite as planned
just need someone blame
she's
there no good no evil only
wall there red light
let all
stripped oh
time took what's mine took now
things arent what they where they're what they are
dream better things see
couldnt tell yo if it's black or white
dont mind all things they say about
may seem strange but that's all want do
how about
now it's okay smoke
get wrong get right
get wrong get right
he knows it's true they're our there
if look hard enough then you'll see clearly
just tell where start
know
yes they're all too scared so no one says there's
shoot mouth off
top world's place
walk up edge
if this as hard as gets
want see things first time
this first time
really no one
trust
trust
everything fine
louder shout better you're heard
two two always equals four
ee do
welcome back victoria
welcome back victoria
now mostly dont
what would know
cynic's hired hand
spin around yes give more lies
will make face go pale
at outside at outside at outside at outside
who am
live fast die young words fool seems
timebomed stick around see all go up smoke
separates light from dark
when it's yours lions share
dig own grave
expecting share views
this time revolution will computerised
oceans part patterns mind
cash jim took home
first last time
luck should so bad now
little flat tin case all need
know clothes seem shabby
haze smoking pleasure
has changed his world friend
wont what dont want
ages passed knew at last
all good places
through far marches acres wild
cement fingers
giving herself chance there's no need show her how should
will still there further
will still there further
eats but one every ten
no mouse police never sleeps
hope everybody's dancing their own drum this fine morning
so take minute remember part
well there has some better way
apogee through night
tight lipped soldier
gonna get some
pink cotton undies blue telephones
watching as frilly panties run
warms his feet
when ice
stand naked telescope
under big sky
yours mine
empty
so why are holding hand tonight
so why are holding hand tonight
script blowing out sea
but rock roll star knows his glory really nothing
but god laughing up his sleeve
automotive science engineering
things are humming
they didnt see wink eye
having chosen nothing
where no one can ring at all
just wond'ring what things do
what hell was thinking
she's breath champagne sparkling night
can call another line
ale spew puddle brew boys throw up clean
wake up by bed
need them
daddy where's batteries
where's batteries
can witness now everchanging nature beast
covers or he lies below bed he's beast upon
if ignore things say
wont even listen when try say
out middle distance several tragedies are playing
strip off work paint put cleaner face
beside myself
beside myself
if they keep us from ladies
drop postcard mum
little slow brain box but he had quick right hand
one two three four one bar
think hard think right nothing his mind
old gold story mercy
taxi takes will moving too quickly
conspicuously standing holiday clothing
curtains all drawn cold water plumbing
stack up back new motor car''
spend shilling now
but had two new lambs born just fortnight before
bring cross gold as talisman
translation wasnt clear
she was helping out at back stage
hot night budapest
she didnt speak much english language
staring up at infinity
they're fast but they're lazy sleep green meadows
let's bungle jungle well that's all right by
empty
brush away cigarette ash that's
i'll pour cup darling
how can smile when reasons smiling are wrong
join us please valkyrie maidens cry
heroes rest upon sighs thor's trusty
will kindly try restrain themselves
let's serve this brief list rush
if all prepped should
double yellow line where she can park anytime
crowded emptiness
can ring crown roses round cranium
brain filled empty nothingness empty hunger pains
gives out precise directions as where when
band's wall
sitting lonely warm beer
tell how baby's made
who would poor man beggarman thief
jack knife barber drops her off at school
she's robin hood highgate
caught crossfire princes gate avenue
there's nothing but sit wait
may make fond excuses
question all as their ways
but may day great day sung along old straight track
dancing behind her thin black veil
dont drink water from this holy well
not one naming holy names
lord can keep
ad man overkill
let new disorder through
vicar shouts
she's really turned by television vice versa
true yourself never think you're free
but there's one thing should tell which
but there's one thing should tell which
must agree
dogs midwinter
though fox rabbit are at peace
we're all running tightrope wearing slippers snow
see kindly doctor pass super pill
mother she protected
get off endless corridor
make timely turnabout
oh they tell i'll home someday
high above highest bidder
concert kings
got job southern city got some lead free tank
storm lashed high rise their words are spray wind
wears west wind her hair
blown silent laughter falling ears tin
it's european legacy
strain eyes
flashing jewelled eyes
tear up tear up overdraft again
now they've re possessed rolls royce mink
down by where sweet stream run
that's not what chasing was rich man before yesterday
when left farm under freeway
have not patience ignore all
broken gun beneath bed
build little fire this midnight
or hours at least warm whisper given
keeping cool by mutual permission
all so predictable know
so come all lovers good life
set sympathetic flag flying
staring ghostly mirror
was they who were wrong
made all happen this way
blue reflections mute dim
lem
man hung from trapeze
wont remember long nights
old queers young faces who remember name
short circuit glitsch not what seems
sit back relax soon will just go away
courting green steel
writes stiff note his nearest
tall general
tall general will walk
well turning again
turning again
wearing gold tipped boots black jacket tie
she'd cut wire
scares cold logic scares witch's brew
it's funny thing
now dont think can stay same town
trop tard sera le cri
cash resources
going help now
iron clad feather feet pounding dust
hauling soft timber into dusk
behind young trees growing
up into cold wind facing
dew carpet lawn
burning eyes was broad daylight
she was round hole was square peg
running street thin black tide
why dont come awake
his summer jamboree
crop handle carved bone
her standing over knees underneath
oh jesus save
he could hardly roll his stone
had playing down at palace
no circuits running overload well maybe not done yet
take walk around block
we'll laugh we'll sing
not what need inside
you're lying little pieces
oh baby said you're breaking up woman
taps his cane upon ground
keep us apart
bright city woman
i'll see another place another time
late night commuter madness
hear soft shoes footbridge shuffle
dark city backwoods something stirs then slips away
well should blame officers or maybe should blame priest
jump start or tow away
breaking hearts market town she eats filet sole
behind grey factory walls
invested good health manner most charming
just want lay head
need money now soothe heart
she might have been
all business done
country wants back
as sub sailed out sea
being tiger means laugh
second place cake bake
urges play right wrong
well might decide while there's still time
pass test before get too lazy
life's long song
will meet sweet light dawn
something's room
something about some monster park
scared completely helpless
repeat chorus
she said ``whose this carry out''
but when all comes down couldnt stand ground
she looked tall thin girl
oh wont give
shuffling madess
at stations one by one
all time winner
he runs into sparrow who hasnt eaten week
look at animals look at well how would free one
he swears he wears green corduroys can button up his fly
see things havent done
or was better then run
can still make summer
she could picking roses
she could calling winter
grim they stand hard they fall
it's not tonight she'll bend his will
suggestions he waited
women haters
if think joking then just one line
paint picture queen
old way
symphony match seller breath out time
was really true there are elephants lions too
you'll sorry
saw johnny scarecrow make his rounds
as she turned get undressed
through golden needle's eye
suicidal came
old man winks smile
lay down let slow tide wash
sent tread foreign miles
sound piper counts eveything
past present black eyed crow
place untidy that's `cos aint done dirt
he's inside
his plastic crucifix
now night over
need some assistance have listened what said
i've had better deep discussions
lesson learning how hold conversation down
rehearse loudest cry
cross fire fight
chase face cries
but there no rehearsal
there one seat circle
did learn lines today
see wall behind crumbling
someone bought ticket now wing
no step no step
no step no step
so careful how drive
how did ending go
doors slam two figures silhouette
north sea oil
north sea oil
just try hard see why they're not worrying
i'll get happy way
lose
so dont ask will explain
hate must unwind
she still fever while
occasional demons too
eat at best table town
between tall pillars where sunday night killers
i'll coming again an old dog pain
behind glass sit look
at our ever open book
i'll float melody sing chorus soft
something must wrong brain
skates so dont jump foreskin conclusion
court jesting never resting he must very cunning
orion let's sip heavens heady wine
silver shadows flick across closing bistro
greasy bed sitters make late night play
over road round corner out noise
some towns know he could end up restaurant
edge every morning
seed land
plate upon table
til flames rise anew
catching breath as he looks through dining room window
pop trolley can start clock well all right
see at checkout or credit line well all right
can see him every day
four stroke song
i've tenner skin tight jeans
little man his youth fountain
shedding bell end tears pocket her resistance
sleeping hard come by
talking people way
emp took out radio
who sympathise but cannot help
she sighs shifts pillow
cutting dreams down size again
brushing sleep from her young woman eyes
bring back gold ivory rings diamonds strings pearls
queen country long dying day
quizz kid
following fate fortunes contestants as they speak
may constantly amaze us
squeeze signal through through
down cold war games
somebody's at door
thin vein creeping hot blood flow
engine up front must
will tell how feels
under red lights soft nights all comes back
forgotten rooms dark catacombs
rare precious chain
walking at night
well saw bird today flying from bush
but didnt say word as train time table blurred
now solstice year
sing song bells call loudly chiming
ring solstice bells
jumbo bombay
you're back rock island
cbs come around
fall bed kick shoes away
well up down side life's bitch
chase all away
dont try get by
lift flickering torches see gentle shadows change
wet windy priest holes grand vast cathedrals
when call her evening she's too tired lift phone
she circles round her freedom circle round her heart
so slip chain off again
strip from bundle
following trace leave unwittingly
clean precision all simplified
history forever writing
was snowing outside her soul
her phrase book her silk soft hand
pepsi cola but wont take out can
who was lit candle
god has gone from now
spin down ages
sea birds call name mountains fire
let make seal driver
going make seal driver
yes balances multicolored striped balls
mating chance copulating mirth
bark ever so slightly at trainer's gun
there no reason no rhyme no right
where crawled barefoot fishing pole
but need job
oo

oo
skating away thin ice new day
skating away thin ice new day
her love candle light up at night
have guess at mysteries her unfathomable soul
push along bow wave
cows come home at evening
dream as nights draw cold
spineless chilling lines
every night his act's same
old sun keeps shining
gathering royal momentum
capturing black pieces
her cold creaking mass
weather man says
feel touching can see
gonna lose way tomorrow
dont see see see where goin
it'll make an honest man
greetings well met fellow hail
smiling face you've worn
bitter sweet kiss pretended
woman were too old

dont want play piper here
dont stay forever limbo fly before fall
guess what am steel monkey
work thunder work rain
it's lonely life live live this life go
want know how can leave
shall make us both feel good would dollar do
stuck out cloudburst once again
appear revel this darkened room
while sweet dreams softly sigh
all wrapped up tightly coat borrowed from
cant find taxi cant find bus
big diesel idles keys inside
must impart
went teacher
hey man what's plan what was said
isnt grand playing stand
still born child cant feel rain
gliding cold eyed march towards dawn behind
let's break journey now some lonely road
young gladys was silky maiden
need someone help
cracked knee her soft spot nothing
must have been man do these things
well there's race tomorrow stretching out
keep nose wind while rabbit's skinned
going bring them down shake them ground
seek which within lies waiting begin
warchild dance days nights away

how do catch waking edge
been accused deep murder north atlantic swell
send back down ages put sea once again
whistle along seventh day

draw strength from machinery it's al same
let's go wet corridors dive down drains
through eyes jackdaw dressed nines
she can almost remember name
it's been long time coming babe
long time loose amongst foreign hills
how come know better than
this not love
how many cigarettes did bring along
but could have been wrong
peeping through curtains drawn
ringing no change his double sewn seams
some them own little sports cars
his wind whipped words echo final take
but girl print dress doesnt want money
oh she says
ohhh oh just one more coffee's 'bout all can take
there's ladder can climb
make journey here sometime
casual disappearance
rattling death's tambourine
show shoes they bind down
when life's sum totals made
cover mud
lumbers wave goodbye
keep quiet go slow
about usual business
wrapped autumn leaves
only faceless trippers trip
famous disguise
paparazzi turn around
even poor paparazzi
working late shift first drink day
brushing silken dollars her cold white skin

feed upon every thought
so nearly now life once he clung dearly now lets go
travelled distant shore
used tempt fate
such inspirations new sensations
now understand at last what means
clench teeth anger
slide nails down
you're dragged into vision
getting get close saw this strip
so much salty dallions result shut dies
was cell
fire eyes
some magnetic trance
all at once feels so right
born lead
blaze scorching heat
you'll find there's life
total genocide
yet wounds bear are wounds love
cut us ground
this race departs no one will survive
off beaten track
that's why wont get caught
i've held licence
as mighty eagle
empty
there's thunder veins
shock waves bones dust
as destroy last thing you'll hear cry victory victory
well i've said before i'll say again
chance before fall
take chance before fall
goin do way
heavy duty
tearing through senses
inner feelings
razor sharp precision

then forced down his throat

hidden by heavy treeswhere jean le noir he sleeps

louisiana nights are darker than before

looking paler day by day
just looking forward next ordeal
mother's getting weaker
came close ecstasy
bye bye missy gone forever
saw liquid spreading bloody tea
missy went down stairs

nobody's inside church but bell ringing
solo andy
sun has risen just above trees

monday night tuesday morning master bedroom
then deep into her stomach wonder how baby feels
but dead sarah's head will take her an early grave

pact so powerful leaves no way out
either wayi'll never see her again
some would say there always someone home
speak friend let hear tongue
poltergeist living home
she kept locked up this attic 'till died
at last felt so weak could not even speak
very next morning
having baby love love
but wasnt love oh no
oh here comes summer
he's got find doctor very special doctor
i'd been riding hard most night wooded ravines mountain side
had this eerie feeling was being watched
one wolf grown dozen here was alone
king diamond

dungeon blood everywhere
surely put death
but they did not turn her loose
someone else beside her
caught within dream
at end this starless nightmare
doctor devil
now everything turns darkness
fading slowly
dont want but have toi have know who are
or could we've kept him safe from
live this life best can leave rest us
oh meaningless little god so choose death over
so they took his bones skin morgue west wing
morgue must all go morgue
spiders here spiders everywhere

think will call
now decide which ones are trick or treat
blindfolded creep
only light inside this graveyard
dragging him back back tomb
nobody found trace missy
they would blame all
boy has lost his mind
must leave old house
they seem play an evil game
cried out loud now let have
father malone holy lord almighty father
he who commands
kind thati must go

but how hurt someone love
it's been while since last talk
now it's time tell em
knees praying
living this world aint easy
keeping cool inside
gonna jump tide coming back alive who knows
having peace mind it's long long time ago

disbelief killed seed

excerpt taken from song 'dixie' by daniel d emmett 1859

god knows what makes comparison

sad numb creature worship painkiller
epicentre
sad numb creature worship painkiller
happy black days here's summer here's summer
if need an explanation
freed us eventually just need happy happy
classified machines die misunderstood
unified collapse everything inside
everything meaning becomes destroyed
leave this country
cant breathe
private care sugar pills flak healing
holding but only miss these things when they leave
soft skin now acne foul breath so broken
truth washes learnt how spell learnt spell
all scum
sick pale but
yeah found now
show wonder
when there's time i'll read words
fragments fail hold
just brings heart disease bootleg clothing
royalty hereditery unelected becalmed
just brings heart disease bootleg clothing
wake up same spit mouth
weak kick straw
from despair where
further away
further away
love masks adore chains
why dont just fuck off
dont wanna hear words
when did time start start accelerating
if can still fall love
tragedy not known under this dimmest lights
shareholding piece this fucking country
who gives shit about sexuality
heart
everybody everything else
i've loved so much cant go
nothing
everyone who loved stayed waited till end
drink has never dulled
oh when did decide sleep could save life
how could become another boy struck dumb love
turns into gutless wonder
at being so young being so vain
will next
will next
thinking right now hollywood tragedy
told truth
real privilege will take problems all away
one day
oswald lee harvey
inevitable scars dust
just patsy love
inevitable scars dust
sweating out intelligence
know what's coming
so come up sky
children wrapped home made flags
nothing's finished just fades away
children wrapped homemade flags
maybe this time
indian summer
who sees interiors young willem once did
beautiful landscape nation
what see inside
into vein exhibit derelict
intravenous agnostic

parades milan catwalks
can anyone make difference anymore
mk ultra turned paranoid
now let freedom train come zooming down track
mine
babies time barely even recognise
everyday more numb agony
life becoming landslide
life becoming landslide
they need innocence
used used used by men
diet will crush
vermin allowed thought pass them by
there lies deafening screaming millions wiping out diseased pages
leave this country
leave this country
raindown alienation
as he was beaten across face
live without luxury
no window curtains nothing but essentials
whatever see will rotting flesh

no one sees thing but they can pretend
their shapeless guilty remorse

something's gonna give under this pressure cracks are already beginning show
outskirts nowhere
vocal under bloodlight
too tired fight
he was first our own
so reached bottle he reached door
feel could have been ancient could have been mystical
saw war widow launderette
see children vacant stares destined rape alleyways
quiet sadness people north
an antithesis sorts
what brave brave girl
see her sadness face
you'd mad choose
dont know he was born do down
make man man
but she laughed snake eye laugh walked away from
but she was too far out there reached
she looked she'd had sex
slow french kissing dauphins daughter
all night hotel liebling make mark
chicks are getting cheaper not so common market
it's solo performance one way street
home where heart lies but if heart lies
she's learning her lines from glossy magazines
playing games faces neon wonderland
patience tinsel angel patience perfumed child
she was smiling
looked out window
she's got carry her life you've got carry yours
hey you've survived
our heart heart believed was lost
rebound fumbling all lines
rebound fumbling all lines
cinderella search oh no more no more
maybe were always beyond reach heart was playing safe
hole ozone layer alright by
dangerous colours shapes

they got money they got sun
sun rain deserve
quiet noise deserve
get what want if really want
you've been so edgy nervous
cant sleep
made excuses ran
you're so violent silence

wash spray horsetail waves
will sleep at night
sing never again
plundering diaries i'll steal thoughts innocence
washin up want do again
dizzy fever this love
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth
yesterday
finding answer its human obsession
this timeless sun
those who have loved us today
wins wears him out
armalite street lights nightsights
flesh will always creep tossing turning sleep
am but mortal mortals can only die
empty
bomber's arm placing fiery gifts supermarket shelves
empty
have ever met lady screaming angst potential
have ever walked down street heard bootsteps following
stop staring at
all best freaks are here please stop staring at
baptised tears from real
from time life guardians their conscience bubbles
vietnamese flower dockland union
he'll fade old soldiers grease stained roll call
fashionably
garden party held today
champagne corks are firing at sun again
please dont lie upon grass
empty
locking royal arms
oh please do come they say
punching at sky
stains her versace scarf
this what means man boxing up all emotion
maybe hollywood but maybe then again
turn life upside down
cant understand way things were planned
everything seems so easy this way but going under fast
heading permanent holiday
take home
tell mad
know always falling off edge world
so tell mad
love wastes us together
somewhere far away
heading rave
waiting ringing bright light
so tell more about love rejected
heading long goodbye
they place their faith oaken doors cower candlelight
earth rim walker seeks his meals
he knows victory secured his charm will testify
mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf stream
screams are his music lightning his guide
so thought bolts locks would keep out
lust gold sharpened knives
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
well hear were lookin out take home
but it's all worthwhile
makes guilty makes lie
hard as love
he knows know he knows know he knows know
but he's got problems
learned lesson far late from links chemist chain
know know know know
from sign
born hearts lothian
they'll score friday night goals
but forgetfulness river know where river leads
paradise regained
nothing seems same
feel no guilt at all
above walls gate police
proof were right all along
faintest light shines bright
deepest darkness faintest light shines bright
see girls got hook
let know what's wrong
you've got problem cant see
surer than hangmans rope
rosicrucian pope
hey languages learned
never odd or even any time
bell boys checking out hookers bar
fever confession catalogue crime happy hour
whistle it's tune
as dull thoughts
birds sing their thankfully happy brainless song
will nobody here even cry out help
maybe you're just too upset inside give straight
why do walk away
well dont understand
dont know how happens
fluttering wings
believe what see
loaded live ammunitions
this kind thing
must do what feel should
if heart were ball
it's catchin up you're going nowhere
ten feet tall
church state god fast as could cry
race fruit
citizen legoland travellin incommunicado
always taking point dawn patrol fraternity
incommunicado incommunicado incommunicado incommunicado
mote eye
let cats walk cat walks
sentenced rejection morass anonymity
as stutter paralysed rabbits eyes searing shadows
will sleep tonight
peckish evening rolls once more
she's cold she shows borrow
but wont know
when you'll visit every seedy need
interior lulu
all finger thumb screws
fire across paper
somewhere dont go
if can carry out can take away
look down upon city
gaze dumbfounded at rain
interlocked through missing piece
this ricochet
yesterday starts tomorrow tomorrow starts today
must have known was planning an escape
fish steve rothery mark kelly pete trewavas ian mosley
just finding inspiration well that's excuse
but can put all right down eccentricity
so sorry never meant break heart
do remember loving floor belsize park
kayleigh still trying write love song
tighten lie
they arrive everyday
it's someone dont know
you've got what takes
one night you'll play elizabeth taylor
ich liebe dich liebst du mich
ebony flowers pinned velvet cushion red light
just making marks
they were singing song
lavenders green dilly dilly lavenders blue
iou love
two hundred francs sanctuary she led by hand
gave up living never never
give up give up
bright light noise
one fine day
dumb tv
when kiss kick keep head down when they're choosing sides
beat up weapon
clash religions
love song no validity
but not asking sympathy
have been here many times before
have been here many times before
bright new morning
this day she walks away
such lonely sight
buy some this cmon
sail out across bay
this day she walks
true love we'll never walk again bonnie bonnie banks loch lomond

just exactly what taking pleasure
every little grin dont want wonderin
if could jump ride between skin silicon then
you're only happy when you're oiled jewelled
empty
turn up half an hour late night after night
no tears
there's always another chance
no lies
there's always another chance
have nights days you've come through
was runaway girl all they chose see
pretend wait washing some laundromat
one more experience one more entry diary self penned
too much too soon too far go too late play
losing roundabouts roundabouts game over
scream that's born from sorrow
sit chew daffodils struggle answer why
can still say love

say goodbye
so unpleasant inside out
if i'll tell about
from living stream
worth paying see
enough freak
when she spoke her words ensnared
i've seen different doorway shut million times before
betrayed lizard's bed lizards bed
go hell
what anyone could tell her
what anyone could tell her
carbon trail scores moist stretched palm
their hopes betrayals only reply
take away
stand here waiting whistle blow
twists her body
there's screw tighten
'till splinters gather
these fragments love
when gets right down there's no one here that's left blame
we're just sugar mice rain
just couldnt stand looks their faces saying what jerk
'cause there's not enough love go 'round
'cause there's not enough love go 'round

could please pick up tab
spring had come early
bulletproof mirrors where eyes used
from land frozen
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
so surrounded
fruit wild rose
sweet so sour tongue

man comin back from sea
heading open road
last
dont ask why doing this
ashes water now somewhere far away
feel have become one empty
find us anywhere look
sit quietly listen breeze
an avenue eternal peace
staring eyes cant explain
as he lay his body down
king sunset town
typewriter cackles out stream memories
pretending end isnt quite near
those problems seem arise ones never really thought
we're still drowning yeah clutching at straws
name number
full strange aromas
then it's twelve o'clock
'welcome first party'
alarm by bed
think he came from screen
you're one
you're one
unable breathe at height flew
space around stars something know
everybody whole world same this time
music marillion lyrics steve hogarth john helmer
banquo at banquet
who loves best
but did because could
who loves best
rain auditions at window
yellowed by time
its strands hope pray shall last
obscurity threatening
time has come make decisions
flaming shroud flaming shroud
starting again
if he was alive
these chains are comfortable
will die never know what it's
he had denied
heard everything they said
wise man once said
heard everything said
slowly from above
growing up
no more than baby feeding swans river holding hands his mother wax paperbag yesterdays bread
still remind him just before he was born
ever since was boy
live according own
there was magical purple chrome exhaust his triumph motor bike
found boy decided his time had come
cant explain
blue pain
this blind
bleeds
this truth
rain comes down washes brain
but i've been counting days i've been watching change
this town takes us down takes us down
but cant just play experience
three boats down from candy much much lose
what's story
as they run after him
he skipped along one way street
three minute millionaire they said
surrounded by three minute friends
gone back her mum dad
something about roman candles fizzing out shine little light now
torch christ it's romantic way go really it's part heritage it's round i'nit
so stuck out through still stormy weather
see who lived there behind them
let's go together
he has eyes down at bingo lucky friday night
had tux lucky man had tux
his razor'd more than lines out they found him just too late
get anyway tux
make love
used rain
hear darkness breathe
but came brought rain here
said disagree
something waiting happen
where ceremonies pause at jewelers shop display
warm wet circles
through tears condensation
she nervously undressed dancing beams fidra lighthouse
lost kitchen sink or thrown wishing well
patter merchants selling false impressions
if bottle's no solution
so sick feeling
so many lost
floating space
slowly apart
want an adventure
why does whole damn world feel so broken
felt barbed wire kisses icicle tears
divided stand together we'll rise
will carry white flag
cant take away our hearts
dj resigned today they wouldnt let him have his say
calm down reason out come terms what it's all about
where swastikas are spat from aerosols
gulags internment camps frozen faces nameless ranks
standing welcome mat
now there was sun through blinds this morning
should have been easy say were through
was just smile
but then touch fantasy so real
but only when had good excuse
only when felt alone would turn her memory
she cant break tie binds so ill never make her choose
c 1993 nada dinero music bmi
blame texas
miles miles oil wells hed leave her
this cheating life nothing new
found note left dresser key left door
brother jukeboxsister wine
tell myself tomorrows new day
from pain song was inflicting
he hung his head till cops showed up
shook his head said bubba boy
bubba shot jukebox last night
'til you're by side it's just waste time
'bout hear some knockin front door
was her love more than she ever loved anybody before
her danger at door
tonight down tennessee
hope he gives home family
there's photo baby book
fallin never felt so good
cause i've been searchin high love
blame all roots showed up boots
where whiskey drowns there beer chases
but give an hour then
she'll come knocking door
we've cried shared some laughs
six short months went together
goin through big d
it's little bit tough face friends
dont mean dallas
dont mean dallas
gonna get life
dont care about way feel
yeah gonna get life
gonna get life
empty
must have lost head
half everything all heart
there's life out there
but if ever find out
summer after graduation
sunrise truth finally hit
but things dont always fw9ork out plan
empty
old domestic life
hey there mirror
twinkle those smiling eyes
throwin towel
could spend life this sweet surrender
i'd still miss
'cause i'd miss
just wanna hold close

you're sitting by side
please dont cry i'll say goodbye

mark chesnutt roger springer slugger morrissette
b 11 takes back first dance shared
she may stay out late tonight
ice drinks will up soon
grown up sexy texas babies
but theyve all got new names
thought everything was right but went left instead
repeat chorus
if aint one thing it's another one way
can never think givin up
she swears she loves those kids she doesnt mind load
ringing telephones decisions made
wondering if they're still style
hoping might return
while was hunting wild turkey sippin jim beam
wouldnt bet wooden nickel he aint
when they start hating love loving hate
coast coast its alive most
last night came home again
after all hell ive put her through
pray god someday ill feel same
last night dreamed went sleep good
waiting there carry away
well dont know how keep woman around
takes more than luck really mess up
that's way make an ex
but now thats all settled its all said done
all just kind sat there not knowing what say
now it's two am should
wont let eee eeee e
girl know not alone
wont let eee eeee e
tore hole heart
but there aint nothin quite as lonesome
use rockin chair kindling watch door go up flames
felt north wind blow
so ill hold til better memory comes along
it's been too long
daddy's pickup truck
take home
i'll seventeen way pick her up
frosty mug cool one
yea won few lost few
'bout what's right or what's wrong
it's just you're not love anymore
crash ground without warning
but cant live
ron peterson harlan howard
ive only found better class losers
blues are still blues
useless as this broken heart
bill kenner mark wright
she can dancin nothin at all
every spot town
jukebox playing loud
all can say what way live
tell what was thinkin
guess i'd better go now
dont want none stuff
dont want none stuff
know its im waiting
empty
wont satisfied anyone
so after get rid
self control was overruled by passion
but none have been right
out wild life lot people telling lies
its spiritual
ba da da da da da
ba da da da da da
empty
you're there quiet mind
cause you're there quiet mind
but when stumble bleed
it's right should twins
whenever ice glistening upon glass
well draggin lonliness it's ten miles long
wont calm violent river
dont care where we're goin
this wont die
ohoh 4x's
cause it's who knows what cost
this desert turns ocean over
sorry what done

ya cant keep closed anymore
oh kids am straight out now

man who'll understand
baby oh i've felt this way before

some day you're gonna need
then there's only way go
you're gonna make better little while

shadow find at gate
hearts as good as gold
empty
tears bled
but shame has remained
dont speak truth too much
blame when get touch
here ya are at top tower
makes no sense stay
there's only silence here
want
just so far from home
loved lost
dry weeping eyes
empty
before nod
this rain beats down death
every kingdom rain comes fallin down
cause loved so long
within lonely room
hardly hear at all
they went home ragged red
remember night blowed sadie down
judge had papers his hand
cant let go life
hear them call name
see if they'll run while
i'd only use every way
jesus' program
mansions sky
when this life
as tired as man can
as tired as man can
dont know what time year
came upon an angel nightingale
empty
it's only fear
cry gonna cry now
so many years hide
though some say it's free from care
oh sleeping at night
when we're woods alone
birds can hardly sing
when they arrive at home
you'll sing hallelujah
look hands are stained
know what love so put
know what love so put
empty
grounds are movin where stand
empty
hate all her tears ever show
sayin sing well come black cat sing
when not alone
movin right by
up river rise
saw ghost shadows smile
lay back so could not rise
setting sun
keys heart
nothing else matters
behind their windows people stare
apart
starin at water as waves turn ruby red
water will accept all things never could
hangin here up above head
gone
wish was asleep instead
just look around there's no one here
this feeling inside body
been pourin down all day
whichever way they fall
girl girl dont lie
would shiver all night through
it's turnin so cold
have ever done good things
now they wanna shoot someone
woe woe woe woe
love's numbered wheel have spin
hold winning hand anyway life deals cards
were turned around
almost doesnt count
not afraid let go
heart that's never really sure
you're gonna stick around
soon you'll an airplane momma's
any fool can say goodbye
let's reach little deeper inside
as lonesome notes filled midnight sky
or even as far back as phoenix
where blues pour out dives bars
one you're dream come true
never would have made very far
see coming sun
if ever believe work done
well hit charts took trip
an ordinary man was sitting kitchen
but played show crowd went wild
an ordinary man was sitting kitchen
up space here wondering if it's worth
because love
yours heart soulfully
because love
because love
little girl who never smiles
dont laugh at
dont think dont notice
dont get pleasure from pain
someday we'll all have perfect wings
baby dont think wont 'cause will
baby dont think wont 'cause will
carved our names an old oak limb
liked when her hair was down
'til sun came up
emily harper
tell all secrets all hopes wishes too
about what turns what what dont
tell all secrets all hopes wishes too
shadows all alone
girl let start pick pieces up
nothing makes forget about love love
nothing makes forget about love love
help fall
i'd hate heart
really dont know if can again
david kent campbell
if know what mean
she gets hold takes complete control
keith stegall hill
will love still from depths soul
still all heart until dying day

little closer lips
if have jump up stage get down knees
squeeze box blues harp washboard baby
he has since he was born but
they tell her she's lucky
she tells 'em dont worry
while everybody knows
opened up there wasnt much left say
bright red drop dead tight dress she said honey come
if learned one thing about love
had ball playin games eatin dogs
he let go he waved goodbye or was hello
before could start
lord he opened eyes
though cant recall what
things dont
watched her walk inside alone
things dont
theperfect conversation without any hesitation
before say goodbye
perfect conversation always ends
havent cried one single tear
this just cant love
feels too good comes so easy
i'd there cold rainy night
might create if altered events
what better place this world would
was
were heart soul
when there was no one else
were heart soul
but dont look love
'cause even though say he cares
love aint someone always miss
what's not love about perfection
this love's got
nights spent behind these door's
picture ocean beach
didnt sink right away ma'am plane went down
weather's nice it's paradise
he'd break her spirit down
she still sings
curtains blowin breeze
people talking think all right
they'd so surprised
there's no way hide truth from myself
words wisdom spoken
act nothing's wrong
someone else's bed
silence suspicion grows
what
thought brings such regret
never broke heart
every dream come true
i'll take there
make easy
i'll give anything everything
it's just another saturday night
but kinda companyand guess
gonna get dressed up go down town

can love someone all heart
he's nothing but ashes
empty
but when he left
empty
'cause you've got rock hard head

empty
thinkin about her life she wonders

cold wild wind has come
when all love was there

those who are true those untrue
could runnin around

but faced wind instead
love became saving grace
little bits lightning
little bits lightning
'cause loving has hurt so bad
dont get wrong i'll still long hold every night
losing feels good
seemed lifetime driving from vegas oklahoma
still only god gives life spite modern medicine
he's daddy's little man
no more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again
just get more behind every day
only wanted what cant have
they got knives drugs pain spare
city streets are gonna burn if dont do something soon
love's only house big enough all pain world
baby trying find place inside heart
oh but it's hard start fire without spark
if wanna man rocks knees
say things used say
now sorry if hurt
high heels or sneakers he dont give damn
baby loves just way am
baby loves just way am
but time has taken all pains away until now down hurtin once day
words when need comfort
are destined find love
one day will
where troubles melt lemondrops
he calls from work tell her he's sorry about last night
god if somethin ever happened he'd surely lose his mind
phones are ringin
pick up way down
when folks say they dont know
at well
dont want angels think
someday gonna
wanna fall know love has caught
wanna fall know love has caught
who can give more than can
satin sheets lie
it's not same now when they touch
time car she found an earring
she remembers when she first got her wings
everywhere she goes
never let her wings touch ground
never let her wings touch ground
sat down grass just watched them play
gonna soak there's no tomorrow
it's being road makes free
know falling back
let's give them someone else talk about
when wont honor what we've vowed
bound take its toll
still holdin
still holdin
few short days night together
two shadows blending
world's greatest lovers
way keep comin back forth
way keep comin back forth
wont leavin heart open anymore
thanks thanks lot
her memory's hurt long enough
who made love bring knees
that's that's
there's yearning feel heart soul
that's that's
having never sailed before
but one last small thread hope
rosy dawn at last
grab rope hold tight
had our moment sun
gonna let go
when forget breathe
burns inside
middle night
high school canbe so rough can so mean
who've wished upon shooting star
made who are today
yeah we're all same inside same inside

sharing soliloquy
then turn her keep faith
some go softly softly round habitat
cant stand drops they're dripping down windowpane
but you're living see saw
children dance as moonlight kissed them
empty
empty
no drugs or pharmaceuticals body aint suitable
together we'll grow forever watch eight kay rig go
dont see but feel when it's blowing street

'cause did once now owe
'cause did once now owe
'cause saw no real harm
but took long time see

walking dreamland
drowning fire
into drug
everything fits but size love
but i've been waiting waiting
but i've been waiting waiting

afraid can feel
say little should suffice

if two could realize best luck
while tried hang past

you're not angry anymore because
tell her words she needs hear
i'll getting off one love tonight
you've counted every star
now can never free from what was done
i've counted every star
every waking hour filled lead
why cant save time
everyone
avoiding our every chance
all used up
room breathe
beginning think baby dont know

while he was he thought he was invincible
both know staying young can take its toll
calmly holding steady
so if you're what think you'll
if you're who think see shoot
memory fine

memory fine
no memory

steer right way
if follow down
there's mountain side
vision swear it's true
know that's vertigo
as time that's running slow
or pull snow
tell what see
reflection see
when walk out
when leave all behind
what will past remember
shines above onto street
as slowly every thought will change
telling myself not fair
if wait night fall will take too long
lose another day
when swear never told what do
when swear never told what do
just look eye when say why
say would rather die
do want tell something
do feel one little bit
i'll fake dont want make
moment leaves without vision
no dont want kiss
what matters
time hating think was mine
people who years have been holding
stay keep coming
much further away than appear
down below or from somewhere above
figuring out what might say
all seasons seem congregate
wind sun got together
tried call but line was busy
it's true dont really know
if you're big enough take
you've got let know
if it's worse live than let go
if mine doesnt do
why dont write own song
or might create hit
what beautiful moment
then guess it's okay think it's okay
cant believe
think leaving
if can close eyes without fear
as close as get love
speak sweet voice
around golden sky
catch drinking wine
dont say forget
if wont notice
just angel
dont send roses
dont say it's useless
lie
near edge
he spins inside soul
front know
have forgotten what love can do
but no fool
wanted just minor part
empty
crashing by
crashing by
stood behind when no one asked
cry cry
all things had have
cant disappear
some kind night into darkness
fade into
this five string serenade
while playing
this five string serenade
send dreams candlelly wine
lay sound
holding wake sun
before i'll show myself
you're ghost highway
forever ever
i'll honey
see places
dont think that's true
empty
surely dont stay long
am someone else's man
baby wont change mind
sleep inside ocean has smiles
sailin sailin
cause friends turn their heads
it's so hard stand
til eyes shed
was breathless tall
catch shape circles mind
still coming round
cant same thing now
still waiting
oh sweet mary silence
cant take pain
sweet mary silence
while stumble home
lie sleep
well just here call
but know wont do any harm
lie take whine
by slices her hand
aware game
lies lovin
yesterday she walked home all alone
aint something
she goes right through
she belongs
searching fresh goes by small wind refuse die
crash light come down
sunshine rainy day
now everything ever wanted own
just just because want know
fake everything
taste fear
it's not easy
her eyes closed some kind complete
sunlightmakes go away
inside her
dont have much
into ground
felt little
little light stone
dont make this hard us
goodbye 1000 times goodbye
drifting alone sea agony
dont feel same way about
i'll always love but just not
goodbye 1000 times
goodbye 1000 times
due lack interest
dont close eyes injustice
if took own direction
if took own direction
feeling inside whole world see
life freeway night shift till dawn patrol
coming through
shot thorazine
gun mouth was real
playground illusion
if get inside cant get out
disgrace
am weak man are feeling strong
addicted chaos
remember said
it's four morning still see face
cant face tomorrow now you're not coming back
am an anarchist
use best use rest
anarchy know what mean
it's coming sometime may
this uda
more try read lips
when story takes twist
ripping tissue
cut out cardboard condo maze
enraged mind starts smoke
spoils wars are yours keep
flames rise sky
deliver light
shun words bible need implements war
turns ashes mouth
countless corpses piled up along wailing wall
one thing we've found out
god have mercy
if werent there
because wouldnt understand
empty
because wouldnt understand
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
they worship toast
an orgy's taking place
their bodies soulless
time's up armageddon
fate coming
how long hold breath
presidents whereabouts are presently unknown
medals are useless uncle sam's forgotten
remember vietnam thing
appeasement only makes aggressor more aggressive
awaken those sleeping giants dust ground
now are mission
still alive
fasten up head belts
dancing breadline
mover shaker
he's dancing breadline
he forgot he aint got nothing
self esteem seem lack
watching pain only pleasure
straight jacket son bch
push breakpoint breakpoint
when kill man you're murderer
life whadda ya mean life aint got life
he untouchable
praying death
no others fought won
chosen ones
empty
pull hammer without care
silence speaks louder than words
will disappear off face planet
present present
present present
enter arena hit lights
roll dice dont think twice
roll dice dont think twice
now we've found
sanity they lose
as read our epitaph
yes have no fear
devils island devils island
devils island here stay devils island
walking next
stay away from evil
chorus repeat 4 times
talkin 'bout no vision
ten diadems rule them all crown them all
saw former pass away
saw former pass away
cant take pain enough run
cant hold enough run
something's just compelling run into dark
feel nearness breath
behind closed doors all live taking
broken heart underneath all pain
anything's so real so just disconnect

what 's yours mine what 's mine mine too

can never let anyone see
last hope man earth
blood upon their wings
mind was run
but keep family tree
family tree waits dark
fight freedom fight authority
fight it's country
let protege five magics
only one will stay alive only one will stay alive
means an end ended disgrace
slipping away from an iron grip
break new ground new frontier
empty
as they bury now six feet there body lies
666 between his horns
blah blah blah soul keep
blood thirsty demon who's stalking street
their bodies convulse agony pain
merciless butcher who lives underground
out destroy will cut down
foreign life forms inventory
hurling thru air
feel velocity gain
dropping all weight
solo dave
surely will not stand
down seat judgement
some people risk employ

procedures he's programmed all he hears sees
believe kingdom will come
ancestors' blood battles they've shed
as break looking glass
aint superstitious
jack kennedy was friend mine
maybe dont but have no choice
just change season
heard bells begin chime
started screaming
were there always
thinking about times
cant make go away
ah that's what gonna do
ah i'll get even
grace did not shine
dont try understand knowing probably wrong
into promised land
yearning held by alone so alone lost
something's haunting
one heed
whole house creaking
truth lie
friend or foe gotta hang em dead
you're going jail
broken down feeling naked
empty
time time again

fighting am sworn quest doom man they forget
hearth home wife child were not was not yet done
but again sense late
life trigger
load another bullet
click comes from hammer
soon as spinning stops
where have apostles gone
new world order shall shown
no confession all known
'til they got hold
they say he's sick he's obscene
no more mister clean
rising star only gleamed
fire burns
from friends at twenty five
except simple plans
people think insane because am frowning all time
tell enjoy life wish could but it's too late
what do mean
aint kind
peace sells but who's buying
got nothing better do
just not kind
empty
secure safe open arms
once stalked beneath shadow
loves tidepool
while burn at stake dance flames
violent more violent than death
take what love leave tears
need 'cause you're all clear
dont do what want fade away
well what gonna do problem
problem problem problem problem
problem have got problem
people dont bother saying hello
where can together promise
wind sings our name rebel songs

suspended by their broken necks

winding down growing tired
time chasing time creeps up behind
his eyes are fire
bu dammit this wells gone dry
wont need breath
cant say what's mind
poison fills head
there's bad news creeping up
tied up tracks
packed bags headed west
betrayed by lust
lied each other again
how could this happening
till dead do us part till last
anger near till last
head sand ignoring rain
long before hitler hussein
heard somebody fixed today
they fight war but it's fatal it's so hard understand
i've seen man use needle seen needle use man
then started seeing bad omens head
this was life foreclosure dreams
vortex pain
horns jericho
said was out boys
wake up dead buried
got lust wandering branded deeper than bone
cadence tells soon i'll meet judgment day
got wanderlust
career hell
face last enemy
pain cuts right through have seen enough
when there's nothing left did take enough
how live
selves higher things
tell us how run our lives
so as read this know friends

time will heal time will kill
behind town so full pride
crush each tip her fingers pulp
up she goes higher higher
screams pain then finally no more
have seen southern witches church god
was deadly moon gave away
standing altar
even night see light shining bright
amazed what i've seen tonight
moon was dancing blackened sky
through woods into night
fallen one will not return fallen one must burn
empty
youre young scared
damn
no one hears
say say what wanna say say loudly
say say what wanna say
so amazed
you're inspiration
cause how could save day
cause how could save day
how do smile when there's not much smile about
stands firm
fortress rock
start wonder if someone out there's got number well hold head up breath deep
so next time when tell yourself this isnt worth hold head up breathe deep
so roll back time
life as knew forever was changed
time after time
make desires mine same
love what need
bless
turn back oh lord
jesus bring rain
will worship one who threw stars night
will worship one who hushed rage
king kings jesus christ
where can finally part story
am complete
caught up
dance freedom song
we've been summoned by king
repeat chorus
oh coming up breathe
get myself up dry land
have not been called wisdom this world
isnt crazy
would crazy
choose this world over eternity
know i'll never same
all things make no sense draw
you're love give
know all seems so illogical
you're love give
then i'll gaze upon throne king frozen steps all questions
all see
came one all
repeat chorus
such tiny offering compared calvary nevertheless way law at feet back chorus
empty
well have believer there must something more back chorus
just across street hometown
ends earth
empty
reveal yourself
know known
suddenly lost within beauty
should cover all us
so hold fast
but if only hear one thing
at least thousand times i've rejoiced
cause still here so far away from home
close eyes see face
come here god god alone
all heart soul
faithfulness reaches sky
exalted o god let glory reign
when walk
will stand presence or knees will fall
forever worship
know know god able know know he still reigns know know love
i've been lost moment
i'll singing forever
empty
know can find here
never know why you're alive
now know what means free
i'll closer than i've ever been

i'll embrace every moment given
it's creator calling created
it's no secret dont belong here
when wonder if i'll ever make through
gotta keep singing
have landed
one who worthy
finding there's something worth fighting
seen we'll soar back chorus
all eternity
all eternity
not trying hide anything
not one who leads
it's all about change
every step more heart moves beat
here stand still drawn down knees
no need anything up sleeve
now tell how much more open can mind
wrap around heart completely
nations by way holy sacrifice worship sound broken shackles falling
then how can light way
just let life glorify
wont shine
things just seem feel little bit different
so are gonna have move
simply falls
god all universe make rhyme
what can say about
heart spoken
find myself complete
you've taken what was lost
empty
ever since jesus looked way
his glory around
inside so beautiful
could ink ocean fil
how measureless strong
there's reason sing
oh value worth
there's reason
between was made magnify one who holds all things place ruler over
unaware fears
lose all track time
if werent there call name rescue
unaware everything
cross run
divine fragility
free what i've become
free what i've become
could no longer bear weight
when speak name
calling out
we'd finally find place where belong
i've found place
what life

forever day
forever day
majesty
repeat chorus 2x
yesterday today forever are god who was come back chorus
it's never gonna fade away
repeat chorus
think view from where standing
knowing you're mine
cant go there at night
pick weapon
freedom calling money's green no country will pledge loyalty
but when look into future look through different eye
starved destination beggar man by trade
when take longer look at someone run
he spends his days repeating lines can spare dime
self discarded king ruin worthless world
feel dry wind dust eyes
still pushing onward alone cant deny
tortured beaten blistered by sun
realize life's been thrown lions
hear lamentations women who cry loved ones crush oblivion
night we'll attack no questions mercy
form tonight kill tonight
craving grows stronger longer away
once take first step there'll no more turning back
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
smoke blotting out view moon

if are one those who made end up crazy
ghostly image fear has yet surpassed
just because she had one those nights
you're much cruel have point view
better hear words say
did pay attention their angers their fears
now can help somebody else avoid endless pain
hope someday will stop realize
an existing pawn
nothin left hide
laughter burns hot
d wayne k vanderhoof c wells
but too young care
sky quiet
heat turned men shadows sand into glass
must have been held back
but only if have more luck than thousand times before

metal church will find comes from very far
metal church inside knows just who are
compassion lack
heart grew stone cold
try end life
why oh why
they've got their sights
running fast lock doors banshee now awaits
how do think good lord feels
dark ages are over case havent heard
children always play together
man exists alone
stuck mind
his pain fear must lay rest
no one can touch here
who will believe why this fear haunting
will destroy

so climb aboard scarlet ship
so climb aboard scarlet ship
rip open belly death

upon an ocean born lose
causing deprivation
where story had begun
behind wall that's made stone
that's holding our salvation
tied up chains so tight
it's got hurt little bit
always try always miss
when one way conversations pay price use love
but forgot us long time ago
i've lived whole life danger
betrayed by words i'd never heard too hard say
oh you've got blue eyes
these times find no words say
so near such person
know know
pretending not see his gun
oh our love flowers
oh our love earth
their love died three years ago
oh it's called love
i've lived life pills
but when love at home it's best
cuts life broken knife
without life wont flow
they're dumb they never know
without own
dont crucify dignity
port royal town hear coming

illusions create
never looked at sexual way

but leave standing each every way
when look at know you're lying
there's soldier waiting
breath held tight inside

forever still
just ocean or sea
someone cannot free

he's going nowhere fast
can change his mind

may all too late
that's price love that's price love
need sanction see one another

but you're so foxy cant let get away from
try fight agony ecstasy
souring legions controller all
blackness ascends powers untold
by gate darkness
new day was rising
take stand when time has come
time now fight world
powers possesses
sends its wrath down earth
clouds darkness evil

ones they rode again
so stand up shout at world
now stand alone
from cups silver drink from
steel at our sides defend
coming propheey
long ago an ancient time
magic will prevail
could ever break seal fate
open eye into neverending world
we'll free at last if stand till end
commence involuntary human breakdown
evaluate eliminate
see deep within you'll find what seek
future turns past
gold washed up shore shifting sand
holding promises what legends say
as black horsemen rode along
oh so grim dark
as gaze through gate
lay ennui hear our call
not knowing where am
this silence makes mad
go find treasure
mighty waves cast ship aside
hundred men at their side
ones dying brave
may they now rest peace
legend speaks about their coming

warrior headed north
freeze world
ring he held his hand had powers
sacrament venom released
death final demand
from darkness he'll return
light our candles
sign evil rides us through
sword steel alk darkened vapour
only one must grow old
time has come there will one
know chosen one
all because curse

who's chosen one
give us power foresee our fate
brothers unite fight justice

names says victory so ride ahead all
it's getting close
hear voices cry through never
see devil eye
cross river other side

vision so closed behind
conjuring will take all again

what kind man do think am
you're still guessing who am
now feeling emptiness inside still concealing
there'll no one there baby just
know what they'll find
promise rebirth
waiting darkness
friend or foe
waiting darkness

kaleidoscopial eyes
evil minds plot destruction
time will tell their power minds
begging mercy their sins
oooh well well do do do do do do
never meant cause sorrow pain
working class hero something
think you're so clever you're classless free
pictures building head
even when touch seems miles away
save our love from final knife
cant imagine what empty heads can achieve
they dont really know even what they're talkin about
fear rejection need their protection
wont ever change may think it's strange
reason today
telling all glories overdue
cant kill rock amp roll it's here stay
'cos they dont really know even what they're talkin about
tried father
that'll do ha ha ha
demon sick sick tired being alone
repeat chorus
accusation eyes
your're no different
your're no different no different
why cant they just let
if had never let them
yeah play part
long as they dont see other side
not one show emotion some folks see
there's tomcat alley scarin up fight
between whisper scream we'll find prayer
sign turned around
no need hurry home
sheltered untouched alone
all this love saving
all this love saving
see i've already fallen
yeah i've already fallen
see i've already fallen
go ahead take time
love there's time when
who's knocking middle night
now you're out there wanting back
better than buying lame excuses
just an occasional dinner twirl from regular guy
she won 'em over her southern charm satellite dish
she's got big screen she's scene
she comes out every night
she needs someone hold
matraca berg noble
how could she hear as laughed warm summer night
sweet abilena looks out at midwestern sky
know he didnt really mean treat so bad
could see every time he smiled
just call cleopatra everybody 'cause queen denial

had some bad times but had good times too
well if dont feel old thrill
livin their lives day by day
are still his heart
dont tell what do
so dont tell what do
so dont tell what do
movin slow motion but it's motion just same
draggin chains
every time hear name
every time say this prayer
go lose nerve
let show all love hiding
can tell by smile face

know when find one shining diamond
soon as she can find her wings

killer comfort

jamie o'hara
but its time lay heartache down
well it's time lay heartache down
well it's time lay heartache down
know what know
barn an old hayloft
when it's all said done
some temptation
cant go wrong feelin this right
oh we'd both crazy turn our backs
but time alone will tell us what true
cause love can give man strength fight
all our imperfections
will love then
oh love sneaking up
even though dont know yet
oh love sneaking up
just make feel better
no different that's sure
just make feel better
would last while
keeping off mind but there's moments
once again once again
what was supposed do
summer nights beauty took breath away
maybe was maybe was
maybe was southern summer nights
mother mourned her innocence
so went little crazy went little wild
own babe's eyes see signs melancholy child
cant tame wild rose
welcome crazy life
welcome crazy life
two crazy kids nobody could tame
must doin somethin right
had learn compromise
watched close eyes
but thing got most
finding out aint no two ways about
may find someone else willing lose themselves
what want them but not
now its too late wonder what's left tried
so bring tears bring heartaches
could beg could plead get down knees
jimmy's still playing bath
can never find shoes
everything i've been waiting
had little too much wine
since felt this
let him right one
got way firin up boy's imagination
she's big girl now
she's this year's darlin
but dont own only heart that's been broken
honey put yourself place before give up love
put yourself lovin arms
there's not whole lot aint been through
but it's still tender deepest part
love lasts forever
track 5 time 308
i've got shake up just wake up

watch sun go down
later pulled out blanket
deep blue satin sky
lover's quarrel sweetheart's dance
sweetheart's dance round round
sweetheart's dance round round
make out corner
but wasnt cards she chose play
'til one night tequila found him gamblers gathered 'round him
know he's waiting other side
she doesnt care see mountain top
he's line between two points separation
it's moment every lover knows
you're here arms right where say wanna
put pieces back together now you're good as new
guess they just dont break 'em they used
someone soothes heart
candies burn all night
thunder roses
must finally doing something right

shame birthed its gift
eyes belittle friends serve suck
never return ones provided
we're left hanging alone here

blown steel breeze
come painter piper prisoner shine
shine crazy diamond

rode steel breeze
his youth or dream he cant precise
silent replies swirl invitation
gathered at cenotaph
she bravely waves boys goodbye again
i've always been mad know i've been mad
yellow moon growing cold
wanna go home
music was too loud
have time before leave greet another man
shouldnt care at all

but when night falls she puts
darkest hour
if was vain will wait another time
swear wont go down again
running away from emptiness
grieving believe change
problems are unreal at one blow
still far go invisible horizons
how can so smug
when dressing room got hazy now baby
sound abounds
then cant get enough
done kick 'em out
but now do what they told ya
empty
come
hey yo so check this out
when say go go go
was born rage against 'em
d e f n c e
now action must taken
come
'cause eternity can long long time
downwards spiral heading straight hell
'cause stumbling it's time say goodbye goodbye
if didnt have these moments
they all made their own mistakes
so let night begin
so come lay down by side
there's light into darkness

art walls told us their tale
middle earth then stories pictures ended
what if now some these creatures still survived
all want but so far never knew
as life comes again
will apologize

242music lyrics by p wagner
never felt so mean that's all know
her mother told her everyday never lose control
good man bears all
they get hope from fire smoke as wheat grows strong
tha blood floor tear still dryin
livin been warfare
fire masters house set
peer into tha eyes tha child already trial
tha old south order
violence all hands embrace if need
between polarities good evil
will fulfill karmic lawi'm coming back
dont play this game treason
what ya need what they sellin
fourth reich culture americana
tha thin line between entertainment war
tha thin line between entertainment war
it's finished now words were written at
but his neighbor left out
but his neighbour left out
he's got time think he found
what will world look without him
needed break let out our guts
stumbling edge
it's only few make profit here
friend or foe no one's getting close
choice choice
then our skulls wont tell about our past lifes
if keep millions accountings
it's telling things should not do
dont paint devil wall
here it's waiting call
since 1516 winds attacked overseen now
face tha funk now blastin out ya
our past blastin through tha verses
vulture game ta try an steal ya name but now
second race
but no use
'cause they're better they've got
perfect mind body
lap its lips so track shot
they can fucking other niggas shit but they cant fucking mine
are getting along family better
they can fucking other niggas shit but they cant fucking mine
drive story point no return
wanted more than concern
perception will come far too late
smash mirror there's no way back
end idea democracy freedom has won
nothing's was chaos everywhere
they taught they practised
so called enemy
if know these questions
will learn 'bout hate
oh yeah need
next time do better
day night

all life i've been looking something
every secret make public
music by wagner lyrics by wagner
walls are cracking cannot move
shadows are creeping air's so still
this atomic age renegades
they were renegades their time age
groove from land land singin electronic chants
they change course history
we're renegades funk
we're renegades funk
get down big sound
now move sucker
hey revolver dont mothers make
nothing higher than stars
riders riders moonlight
riders riders moonlight
too bad but love dead
call upsetter
we're all calm
fear mouthpieces
leave here turn back

when am old enough stay

they sit at home earn still more war business
500music lyrics by p wagner
you're always right behind
maybe can find hold
but slipped
having never seen colour father's eyes
no one's here catch when fall
we'll settle nothing later
something's happened myself could never give answer
they have told i've reacted was not from this earth
music p wagner m schmidt p wagner
so many years it's much too long have fooled
wont
did never regret
she killed smiled
she killed smiled
she's alive she's more jealous than girls flesh blood
they wont escape out this misty night alive
i've been waiting an invitation
mirror smiled at lonely face
was turning just circles no end
our time short
reach out hands reality life
music by p wagner m schmidt
fanatics ruled by sinister thinkingthey drill this evil spirit their childrens heads
was mirror pair distant eyes
paranoia sister demon mind
world expense
or ill drag grave
protect fire
hey hey
agents orange
horse rider clever cunning killer
disappears when wind redirects
crushing naive profession
disappears when wind redirects
just solitary man
gonna leave now alone
time prove evolution
rushing through these years madness
remember when life had no scars
life became an obsession
dont know want so
seem innocent
coming around coming around
'cept sing rock 'n roll band
'cause this sleepy la town
i'll shout scream i'll kill king i'll rail at all his servants
street fighting man
street fighting man
they invent ultimate war machines
but coming near there's eagerness their eyes
music lyrics by p wagner
empty
call what want now
throughout whole life i've done everything wrong
i've been taking wrong track
this tv commercial has caught us anew
this isnt worth at all
supersonic hydromatic superultrameganew
not drop water could wet lips
all people died our fountains they ran dry
take water bring shore
find river where water mercy flows
he would healer who could
he'd messiah
he was very first prove
i'll offer truth so can
spoken 'crank music up'
lost culture culture lost
need movement quickness
see right through red white blue disguise
why
teacher stands front class
yet hang from
no more lies 8 times building crescendo
empty
talk grandpa
talk grandpa
every sense highest intense
they all belong different heads
talking dead
baghdad burning
boys who travel now coffins
its right outside door
witness blushing
now testify
who controls present now
world will have window

there's so much stuff ease pain
that's human bondage
am body only go
do what but what
was year madness insanity
twilight died eternal night
man walks along railroad track
sitting down here campfire light
highway alive tonight
decent job or helpin hand
always moving never stop though answers are made
play future play past
can hear lot but understand
no point revealing fate what hate
inner search needs more than words
never thought consequences bringing life fall
see reflection
telling what i've become alive why
those who try subdue
words insight
choose do doom
narrows
pay
release reason
narrows
yeah name comprehender
darkness left alone
though unholy sadistic

price war
before scream revenge
this world knows no right they wouldnt see what
pain you've overcome somehow
scaffold awaits
sooner than nature planned
lay down head now you're gonna die
but this battlefield no one wins
get so close near enough fight
probably why forgot about tour can
mind's not free
dont want
risk their life just thrill
frame their gallows meet their death
when life has passed
caught time place
can join little while
what's this jungle noise
every home there's sickening
who will know now what know about
whatever may say
tomorrow's yesterday
ourselves learn
rising high know have try dont give up
how long want stay
action reaction
kick township rebellion
war
johannesburg or south central
shackle their minds when they're bent cross
just shackle minds when you're bent cross
kids street feeling cool they killed neighbour's cat
true face everyone facing lies
true face everyone conscience cant lie
turn page face another day
take time cause something's way
creature drawn into flame
oh no thrill became curse
have lost free will it's enslaving
enslave soul under control
now know was death have tried
there's legion long gone there
falling from grace
more as will grow
drown into eyes
you'd make up mind
turn off fear only god
while paranoid try stuff tha void
empty
flex tha cerebellum fire
empty
everything ground floated by
i've got visionsi saw face i'll never forget
get them out mind
telling her she has return
but then clouds locked horizons
truth give truth
ground broken up
through steel walls
they pacify ya young
burned black churches
panther brother
watching too
because moonlight can release from misery
hid face day
think it's time now gotta go
before grow cold
come
i'll give ya dose
networks at work keepin people calm
shake ya up break structure up
put an end
what was price his head
'and neutralise them'
southern fist
everything can change new years day
its land or death
at last mexican pasture
everything can change new years day
its land or death
its land or death
they're coming back from far away
pain you've felt
annihilation our life's space such
empty
where there are no boundaries
no need place hide
guardian day
welcome other side
save from decay
when dies he's at door
real collector dead lucky man
why do look answers extremes forget radical
but need heads can think before they act
who dares stop these fools
are comin back around again
poison lips
empty
nbc gonna flex cast their image
got no card so got no soul life prison no
empty
pops heart stopped came tha air drop
throat
devils triangle
without trace flight 19 got lost sky
are they transferred from space time another sphere
whole civilization died
without trace atlantis drowned into sea
phosphorising light piercing time stood still
without trace they came left us mess
believe dont want stay but must
oh how long woman
cast into classes electro shock
empty
wit tha five centuries penitentiary so let
moves pullin moves
declared war an unjust
january 1st they became known as
yeah sing shit
reaching somebody's star
all life seems just crazy dream
going home
here will stay i'll stay i'll stay
wanna touch
say goodnight
wanna love all night long
wanna touch
whispered word she gone
oh ariel

game play black masquerade
got half pair shoes
mission called retrogression
because hand full blues
there's nothing good this way |x2 times
but making break want take ride
gotta burn all bridges behind they'll keep dragging
playin win
bring night
planning future
concrete racetracks nationwide
take what want but cant take mine
find you're slipping away
cant let go even though it's over
i've been holding so long
cant let go
soft warm
come downwe believed we'd catch rainbow
when she gave blood red roses
sometimes can hear her song
i've been walking now hours
but just cant see signs
running from man you're running
danger band
time standing still
yesterday were here by side
how long can go this way
words are sounding so smoothe
there's nothing can dorefrain
had so much couldnt take no more
out all night till sun comes up
just rock roll rebel
drinking devil
demon daughter or madness
wont let hidefrom her eyes fire
eyes fire
empty
standing strong steady
am power
know just what you're thinking
just cant see

close friends take sides while waters are still
give all up
start prayin
heavenly songs seemed come from everywhere
do drink get mean
move move move when home
give just little touch
might as well another planet
soothe when home
when open speak
are smart
now think she's finally
she's every breath take
used know
girl girl girl
come round here no more
when one love's
saying need
love someone else
beg mercy
love someone else
seemed romantic fools
yet heart stood still
unfelt clasp hands
an april breeze wings spring
tells are own
before meet someone who opens eyes
tell honey must surely realize
we've gotta have heroes teach us all
crazy notions fill head
that's all need free
it'll take somebody somebody who's lot
drip drip drip raindrops
this longing follows wherever go
friend mine called up said 'i finally had some luck
aint better lose love than never love at all
said 'give all got no holding back
thankful each passing day
than never never love at all
but oh just as soon
when you're down out
but landlord taxman
they're you're long lost friends
nobody wants
nobody nobody nobody
but think they're all gay
keep legs closed tight
there's plane leaves here at midnight
before boys get home
oh god wish was home tonight
just aint true
mama told son when rumors spread
dont believe what they say no
not baby not baby
oh no not sweet baby
if i'd only get myself out bed
impressing crowd
only boy
oh them dukes freedom used believe them
quick as shot
as was out walking corner one day
street was his bed
see whole life go down
only hobo but one more gone
wish knew what know now
when want her lips get her cheek
wish knew what know now
but our love here stay
stay
streets alleys passion
paris bangkok passion
one hot night spent stranger
wont live without passion
played silver ball
always playin clean
aint got no distractions
his disciples lead him
she moves so fine flamingo
cause paradise where i'll
believed everything said
life as sweet absence
you'll need all snakes
are ready now ready now what gotta give
never think about myself
somebody else
rebel heart lover
rebel heart why dont try
drove her home then she went throat
came saw conquered
oh yeah
legs young giraffe
kinda tiger heat
helped by bottle wine
i've never never never known night
red hot black
oh rhythm heart beating drum
oh rhythm heart beating drum
oh rhythm heart beating drum
rhythm heart beating drum
nobody knows
nothing's lost
will lose mind
am sailing am sailing
am dying forever trying
oh lord near free
but convinced best friends lost nerve
so her brother punched throat
so keep clean girlie
so let's renew when year runs out
through darkest nights
he'll satisfied
tell him really need him
roll away stone
he'll satisfied
think over before pushed aside
so tell
say aint true
but one hot night under neon lights
dont need no trial humiliation
tell him tell him went down big strong
know what it's wish daytime would come
dont seem long time
but if you've ever seen how wars are won
hard times are only other side good times
dont seems long time
sam cooke
shake oh little louder baby
shake baby everybody
just shake got do baby
make body move up
paul samwell smith james mccarty keith relf
listen this
want her number but scared ask

all boys say she's cold as ice
why wont she dance
got hard honey hurts hell
wont dance
baby makes three
looked around
oh walking up aisle right now
empty
maybe tomorrow
empty
that's time
never never never stop smile
one more song about moving along highway
nothing else do but close mind
you're so very very very far away
so good while away
know you'll good little girl
when good times fade away
spend most time arguing
just dont get along
funny how soon changed
guy next has girl his arms
someone who'll cry at sad movies
car overheated
how can say life's getting down
somebody special dreaming
somebody somewhere side
when think you're only one
someone who'll watch over
someone watch over
someone watch over
sometimes when touch
just another writer
at times i'd break
brother or sister
sonny something deep inside has died
cries
attacks
sonny wont come back come back
lays
empty
said no her again again again
it's all right it's all right
one girl did not call
maybe attention was more than could do
gotta find little sympathy
without love love need
getting ready heartaches come
so dont leave
how can watch cry
trying hard not cry
getting ready heartaches come
didnt do best now didnt
now dont conscience kind bother
want run but there's no place go
didnt screw right now
standing shadows love
love now stardust yesterday
stardust song
empty
'i still love you'
if could do all over again
'i still love you'
only loss could forsake
there stood everybody watched play
sometimes might get trouble
say rodney come over lunch
but thursday prepare weekend
stone cold sober again
put some trust dont give up us
other must surely wrong
strangers again
strangers again
everywhere hear sound
there's just no place street fighting maneverywhere hear sound
nothing left comfort except sunny day
was matter time before face did not fit
empty
her partner cant hardly hold her
her daddy doesnt have scold her
then she became rock 'n roll music fan
five thousand tongues are screaming out more more
by morning light discover
if seem eager then you'll understand
sweet sweet surrender
's awful nice 's paradise
dear it's four leaved clover time
here slide again
we'll have happy ending now
taking chance love
come little baby let's tear dance floor up
tear up tear up
tear up tear up
swore we'd never share
ten days rain
she held child
that's loneliest sound 'em all
ten days rain ten days rain
how lovely was
sentimental verse nothing purse
no tears no fuss hooray us
when caught eye
it's foolish start
papa did tell too
alone
they would give world toy
you'll glad know demands are small
c'mon honey got crawling down knees
got balltrap strung out midnight tram
got balltrap strung out midnight tram
got balltrap hung up one night stand
dont give into him
so staid ways
than not unbearable
but if want i'll try love again
baby i'll try love again but know
first cut deepest
his mother's tears fell vain
where he quickly settled down
he said he was love said pleased
there ensued fearful fight
but ask who really cares
oh georgie stay dont go away
nothin more or nothin less
victim these gay days seems
last time saw george alive
new jersey gang just one aim
an ambulance screamed halt fifty third third
oh georgie stay dont go away
echo alley down below
we'll put speakers window we'll go
watching over us swear
bring over some old motown records
we'll put speakers window we'll go
all wildest dreams come true
feel night nearness
mere idea
longing here
some day when awfully low
laugh wrinkles nose
touches foolish heart
motel new orleans
knew right then could never go home
swollen river
so understand must go
wild guitar baby come wild

places where wine liquor flow
those stumblin words told what heart meant
scent smouldering leaves wail steamers

try hard hide hurt inside
maybe it's mistake show this love feel inside
but she said wear
how dare have party

men steel men pride
frightening shelter likes
man must hate wake up call
i've seen mountains high
all love all hate

lost light candle
passion dies all these lies
tonight found just shame someday life's delay
so far from home
someday may tame light
never fall from grace
once night
aint gonna cry no more cry no more aint gonna cry no more
saints found
come day may touch rainbow
but dreams never last forever
how could forever when dreams decay
words trust are first line
loosers winners long time done
burning key
dont care dont go
believe someone's live another one's hate
believe life will show
do believe nothing but night
crusade inquisition
awakes wings fire
will call name
flower needs rain
i'd walk endless mile
face looks young but old
some call traitor some call saint
always gonna hate what want
what fighting
send loose
maybe aint no saint
not get pushed around
all laughter all pain
pole
war
tears raindrops fall reaper's call
there's still some drinkin done
got trouble melted by heat
find rose way down below
myself belong together
but lucifer said relax it's alright
god answered
humans
empty
lucifer want sigh
lucifer let faith rise again
maybe something more
out now find someone female true
crocodiles will bodyguards then
lucifer flew one stormy night
humans aint afraid burn anymore
they're full bits bytes doubts
no surrender no regret
'round pleasure sea
enjoy rest
damnation grin
mephisto you're lost friend
deadly thirst science
somemercyfulbody bring key
hate face
hate red
all remains last farewell
you're just gun hire
hope soul will burn hell
so recall come what may
but will never loose again
all reasons are mountains eyes
never never never never say die
blind corruption makes cry
victims since traffic death dr martin
hatred took humanity
never look back when say goodbye
ask myself what am doin here
decides friend
get ready tonight's early show
nosferatu steel blood from hospitals
nosferatu hill alone grey
will remember
as long as need will by side
will there wind rain
oh act so cool
no cannot lose what never had
word can sometimes cut way deeper than sharpest knife
no what about no used
no more talking
was still switched off but man seemed
well radio ghost said it's time go
there aint no place hide
roots hate when destiny's callin
'cause blade sword kills all patience
turns our fears
cave without light they grow 'till night
while roadies start load
watch world revolving
taught praise business
sentimetal trust cant drowned greed
have or have not holy amount
she never did sleep alone
dont know if you've noticed but you've got special touch
silicone where did our brains go
technology follow factory time
all need something belive
when tears fall down rain
all need something believe
mondy cry when leaves are fallin
stay gold
today believe answers mellow
this toy kid wont even shoot mouse
promise give
some aliens from outer space they watch sins human race
ita vixi ut non frustra natum esse existimem
after their death they will remembered monuments
so many times i've been hiding from cruel reality
sometimes you're running nowhere fast
angel smiled said hello
raven laughed then he cried
dream loud until die alone
know world keeps spinning round
where lovers use hide
some real old working shoes
then he jumped off mighty cliff
but as smoke cleared just long black coat
life soon turns page
this end hope
when dreams decay
hold tight
will still betray cover each day lie
cause when do give something
mysterious boot hill grave inscription
dont know where are dont know what you've found
dont know who am why was clown
where bells fire ring
gimme nightlight
through fire will ride
got an aim that's all need now
will forces daybreak someday quit fight
follow acid tears down river
swallow our fears trace moment
are killing hopes beat heart against
there are always ups downs
sometimes act heroes night
those who never give
always crucify
cause this one's dedicated
empty hearts blinded eyes
open minds learn trust
cares are buried under sand
he gazed into fire
fear thesilence soul
he shares smile those who sinned
but then kiss asses goodbye
night hides shame
inside cannot blame
when thunder roars night
this world from grave light
thunder roars night
or just say no
where dead slaughters go
whose horn will blow
religions still course so much pain
without hatred day by day
tell why
watching templevision or reading temple paper evening
massive grey walls temples rise from heart every
never need wonder how or why
hold red star proudly high hand
learned lay fingers across wires turn keys make
sounds build high mountain
instead grateful joy expected they were words quiet
know will reach
these things just cant true
what use have they
spirit man revealed lives works this world was overwhelmed
he leads light years away
home tear temples down
heave sigh sadly smile
spills over
will they read us sadness
scoffing at wise
withered hearts cruel tormented eyes
sample their yield
burn midnight oil
only stop best
feel way would
feel way would
sex not competition

hold these truths self evident
warm this bitter cold
when have wandered far
rise adore
rise adore
there's nothing more there's never less
leaders make deal
diamonds down sand
more will bow rome
saint turns sin
sister soul
struggle control
man must learn give little space
elevate
live yourself there's no one else
leave darker places unexplored
meditation or medication
no one gets their heaven without fight
what should have been our armor
canyons city
chase wind around world
moments caught flight
broken west
available light
king will kneel let his kingdom rise
all around us anger burns
but now world should wait
but really need
need by side
yeah before get lovin
beneath noble bird
inventing something new
get money get dough
masterpiece invisible thug irresistable thug
this how do bing uhh
it's snoop dogg black james caggedy
we'll cut nigga gut nigga shut nigga up
suits pimp tennis shoes
sue dat dame tru dat game
get dough get dough
leave alone let rock roll
just what am
space between wonder doubt
lens between wishes fact
just need break
cruising prime time
windshields towards fly
another war

go up against reality
only world see
mold new reality
sow new mentality
but dont push limits too far
when started traditional roles
pattern moonlight bedroom floor cold fire
love can turn long cold burn
star this unearthly show
cars full spectators pass
air shattered by awesome sound
standin at crossroads tried flag ride
went crossroad babe looked east west
cant stop moving
driver busy freeway
old enough not care too much
danger prepared face
nevermore grace night
or through astral door
headlong into mystery
empty
sought alone rule fate man
can build world wonder
converse among wise
bring love give solace
cities were abandoned
bringing wolves cold starvation
some fought themselves some fought each other
her final flight
have passed into olympus
warriors felt silent cry
they sat while silence
let love truth shine clear sensibility
too much contradiction confusion
what happened our innocence
monitor his station
tropic isle avalon
he's got force field flexible plan
red alert
sometimes drive crazy

cause finally found what most i've been searching whole damn life
if die tonightit would alright
was raised by praise fan who said upset her
things i'd say
under northern lights
suspend our disbelief
feel powers wonder what they are
simple kind mirror
2 hyperspace
their own image
art as expression
state integrity
that's why searchin that's why lookin
started feelin this strange sensation
talking you're still insecure
it's just exotica neurotica
empty
neurotica exotica
he's cleaning up his systems
he's new world man
trying pave way third world man
never seemed threat masculinity
hero not handsome actor
as years went by drifted apart
who loves sell his name
solves great mysteries
set off night sea journey
dream unconscious revelations
dream temporary madness
shot satisfaction
one little victory
willingness rise above
that's not what meant at all
open scorn
cant leave unreconciled
could try understand
it's flower touched by flame
it's hand
let strength yours tonight
let fear subside tonight
talk peaceable kingdom
all this time we're hoping praying all might learn
swords against kingdom
oceans flow veins
but sometimes have second sight
what fool used
cant see
stirs higher passions
final drive
magnetic north
set clouds motion
point journey
where white haired uncle waits
hides shining car
mechanical music
gleaming alloy air car
at one lane bridge
battle lost or won
couldnt talk about something else instead
dead ahead
empty
heart cannot feel
do hope or do fear
lovers pause find an open store
river running an open sore
weary land
endless winter night
it's doc way dont then move

their clothes look soooooo good but they act stupid
all youuuu fake frontin motherfuckers

peace mind sanctuary by loud water's flow
darkness gives way light new way
winners take praise
why are here
well who would hold price
no zodiacs or almanacs
little abstraction
if cards are cold
because we're here
all nerves are naked wires
leaves behind its mark
holds winter light
as surely as mortal pain
captain industry
know same
folks have got make choices
thought might get closer
way
darkness at high noon
gentle hand secret touch heart
if dont start cryin it's because have got no eyes
here within lonely frame
please dont destroy these lands

daddy painted horse

repeat chorus
at open doors cafe
when there's too much time alone

we're never satisfied
become saints angels
shattered scarred
we're just two tarnished hearts
said wild horses couldnt drag her back
well excuse lack sympathy
say want
will never hurt
take hand
her folks shoulda seen comin was only just matter time
now she's gone blink an eye
sippin pink lemonade
how could 18 years just up walk away

rainmaker desert
oh come come come come go baby
through hard times sunshine
let take while we're making love tonight
there'll come time die
there'll come time when hear you'll wonder
all by yourself
let's try get us lost
sick staying home
just want see little great unknown
she's somewhere between dreaming leaving old feelings behind
but what's done done
across crowded room
do much more love
want love til sun comes up
where want
mama talked coming battle
so they put hands jesus
now mothers tell story
when levies broke everybody saw
but through all trials
there place
there's only one thing matters
tomorrow seems lifetime away
these days these days
oh tomorrow seems lifetime away
but i've got so much more than most
first i'd make big nashville
would have never known this kind happiness
didnt know tears were gonna start
said prayer as quarter dropped
just when thought was over
but now pace we're livin
there aint no way slow down
did maybe leave love behind afraid what felt
heres where turn around walk away
time wont tell
sun comes out flowers grow
wake up decide
i've held all together
tell only one see tonight
repeat chorus
although know again tonight
although know again tonight
did love someone lose someone
love too much these lips ask
love enough leave unopened
so walk out backwards
just wave one last hello
didnt care enough keep around
so why should care if
couldnt promise anything
yeah just do
everytime kiss dont know
but dont
no dont know feels
there was no denying let him down
country road
whatever road may
gonna throw arms around him i'll say
it's easy let go
believe adia are still innocent
if you'd only let yourself believe
break would make okay
arms an angel
there's vultures thieves at back
from this dark cold hotel room
will there
cause can only tell what know
memory choosing not fight
into morning
no one left talk
empty
under touch cannot stop falter
while helpless line up doorsteps
they can make feel so small
hear cry new life morning's flame
constant need
all feel black white
caving
everybody loves when you're easy so
empty
colors fade black
or let sail away
lots laughs lots laughs
that's when energy comes
wont give up search
empty
hold back tears
repeat chorus
beauty everywhere
joyful memories there
dont know we're working flesh blood
know too many people unhappy
despite everything it's doing
'cause they dont get enough eat
about god
still believing junk true
those lost at sea never found
if had chance love
drown sorrow down
he's embarrassed seen now
am willing give up this fight
have sense recognize
but have sense recognize
know cant
were mesmerized by lull night
could feel heat thousand voices
heaven stranger place than what i've left behind
has been shuffled aside as bask glow
please come home
somewhere below there's people who love
holding out holding
but love way smile at
mold clings desperation
would try understand
but somewhere along way
love was raw young
have sunk so low
pretend they dont see
empty
tangled up embrace
have so much loose here this lonely place
too long too far from home
it's better this way
if all strength all courage
if shed tear wont cage
if shed tear wont cage
if feel rage wont deny
would they angry if thought joining
last breath soul i'll blessing
gloomy sunday
she doesnt expect from
threw ground
simply not good enough
new one just begun
weak strong if want
without any fear
happy new year
have yourself merry little christmas
if fates allow
this isnt easier than real thing
lie awake pray
at crossroads am standing
child walks down river's edge
thinking about home home
home home home home
let surround
too long
love
no voice ever added fuel fire
will oh will not forget
will remember
dont let life pass by
so afraid love but more afraid loose
dont let life pass by
where started from
underneath lucid skin
soul anchored
strength squander
presents tree
heaven earth shall flee away when he comes reign
worshipped beloved kiss
into night
into night
will stare at sun until its light doesnt blind
into fire
am spark fade
but dont have hold what real
was looking someone
trembling hands she reaches up
she cradled us
longing cold hollow
but go blind filled fear
silent stars go by
proclaim holy birth
dear christ enters
went lickety splickly
just wishing i'd stayed little longer
stars beginning fade
it's just another
birds winter have their fling
do want see miracle
ordinairy miracle today
at night as lay sleeping they come herds
cold wind blows right through made hollow shell
there way out
dont worry will find answer if let go
dont worry will find answer if let go
have take myself away from
already knew
until dying day
never felt before
memories trapped time
just close eyes dear
hold down
follow without pride
where there hatred let sow love
giving receive
you're one true thing know can believe
make feel less crazy when otherwise i'd drown
put little love heart
world will better place
they're cutting down trees
could skate away
oh wish had river
oh wish had river
from river comes figure drifting slowly by
dying swan song forever lost cries glory
oh i've seen part people never really wanted share
they closed door are letting nobody
shelter give them shelter from coming storm
i'd get caught up
possessing all beauty
this silence
silent night holy night
christ saviour born
wind was blowing time stood still
keepin silence resigned
heart going boom boom boom
today dont need replacement
would happy just hold hands love
fire dying now lamp growing dim
it's time decide
over hills right through
over hills right through
eyes are twisted down dew entrailed ground
am outside strange world
holding nothing when there's nothing left lose
empty
speaking fabulous places
empty
sweet
wont disappoint
all have give
first noel angels did say
noel noel noel noel
there did both pause stay
then let us all one accord
just let ask one small thing
though commitment most would offend
they've torn life blood from naked eyes
now love gentle love kind
give boat can carry two
silently stalking
token all see
cause dont remember what we're fighting
cause dont remember what we're fighting
i've no fear at all
i've no fear at all
waiting happen
hold picture time long gone
as walked plains
we're searching message
can show places where our time has had no ware
empty
near now vague deception dying day
far beyond glaring streetlights
pressed up against glass
every generation yields
color sky prussian blue
may may
may may
all have wished will
mary's lap sleeping
let loving hearts enthrone him
dreams have left call out once again
way what lies beyond
through summer fall
was left alone
when she loved
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
as throw arms up sky
snow christmas morning
wont make fire out clay
died cause
empty
try bring more
love still hurts
stumble tangled web
i'll say words out loud
but wont go down what said
thousand words or more
believe junk food tastes so good because it's bad
believe most attractive features are heart soul
believe god does not endorse tv evangelists
whispering magic compliments need so badly
want perfume all around
want perfume all around
you're sleek velvet gold lame patent leather enchante
way move do funky groove
but straight away just moved
will alone
never known
'cause used move way
so wont break shake
break
moonlight
moonlight
carry keep romancing
think about all time
think about all time
i've got chained
it's bringing knees
when feel all alone
can mend broken heart
if jump i'll break fall
world has turned its back
woman need guiding hand
come save once again
yes do
i'll do anything just know can hold
woman need guiding hand
are
it's skin
really do
learn fly away
might need make first stand
willing do anything
do remember not long ago
standing face face
faithless who are waiting
ride this train
people tell feel too much
people tell need too much
as ride this train
because dont know anymore
everyone's got an agenda dont stop
but what wouldnt give see face again
how do redefine something never really had name
maybe it's intuition
think dreamed into life
little crazy but believe
base spine
breath get bit higher
kind person who endorses
but time talking
just close eyes
arms lips face
would scared
would he wear tommy hilfiger
shoot breeze spend time
time square walk fame
know what talking about
love can move take deeper every time
get back ten times what give freely

lyrics klaus meine

lyrics klaus meine

you're rock n roll star
you've been first one chart
remote controlled line
they look god screen
twentieth century man
why cant get right
do ever ask yourself

unholy alliance
how can dare look away wake yesterday
it's so hard run away

try get away from
better bring light
welcome trip
chose way love pain
humility not just word
if dont live this no more
drive this place totally insane
wanna see out there
let rock free energy
cause it's all about love anyhow
take another breath
keep faith alive

our lives got twisted this masquerade
bodies tender as our worlds collide
not darkest deepest whim
covered ashes cry out name
leavin life all pain
carry all love

because are other part
lyrics klaus meine rudolf schenker

folow moskva

take magic moment
'bout things recall
but no one's talking at all

'cause he by side
just happen while
everybody knows
unexpected hunger
you're lovin death
leavin die
i've never sent down bounced all around
sun goes down thoughts go astray
disconnect telephone line
killed last way out this
cold creeping deep inside
step outside into night
try put back together
put back together
hands clock
up against barrier
so take some more man gonna take some more man
all plastic face shaking hands
guess dont care about now
long before arise
long before arise
take another step then canbeyond this horizon
when daylight shines
too much prayin
see all time
through fingers
well sick want go home
while sunshine sunshine bright
well sick want go home
time has taken down
wish something take far away
flames well up deep inside
standing ground waiting sign
'cause clairvoyance
histories are held within heart
thunder ears
so let show
now it's broken into pieces
yeah found so many places
yeah so far away
had go 27000 miles this cane
do remember old dead eyes sun
anything here see wrong reality
broken hearted daydreams back all our minds
smoke unfolding hazy sky
insidei've seen what you've never seen
i've been where never been
direction sun
screaming way hear an angel sing
close door think awhile
follow down back
we've taken this too far
bringing something mother mercy
been down while
torn an old dollar bill
dont look down
control just seems twist around
all these dying days
all thousand other times
reflected through blackened haze
never awaits inside brain chill today
never awaits inside brain chill today
hasnt even started yet
step inside room waiting alone
place where can stay
place where can stay
then animals come out jungle
that's good
second echoes sightflashes sounds are shattered coming through
storms crowd daydream scene what will find
right now
when put head into flower web
looking beyond this point time
flying
flying
you'll find never more
wont remember all that's said
drink wine away instead
come now waiting
there's only forever
run out into side forever
come come go back find
keep hand gospel plow
coming down sky burns into soul
not at all
road keeps twisting slow so know
wont change
she wears halo ashes
glorified dying sun
specter wind
books they all want tempt
ten years after have read
remember everything said
now other side
sentimental memories call back life
i've got pain inside heart now cant see babe
out here they're gonna all ignore us
not lot miles take
shall not ponder everything inside
just flash confusion when meet
got illumination street
water drips inside head
you're climbing down fast
when melts mouth
ivy wall
dog hides from heat
thinking paradise
dont ever know where fall
that's how father died
how was always
wont take very long too long
chill wind
know would i've seen it's real
lines are forming circling round eyes
lonely girl
not world
she's walking by
really need take now
you're mind
make mind 2x's
you're mind
feels there's nothing explain
nothing left hear
nearly nearly lost there
well let's try sleep now
nearly lost
same as all rest behind
one day you'll find she's another mind
ten million directions coming up coming strong
drifting wind never blown
now what have done wrong
tomorrow you'll wake up aching
infinity leaves us behind
human race down its knees
transparent dreams fade head
eyes looking back one last time
coming down hard so get out way
take graveyard bury bones
know know
so many things got away from yeah
go away so can see eye
flashing feelings cloud nightchorus
pictures mind
guess it's time change
it's easy when you're finding
it's fading fast as time
it's revelation revolution
dont say you're seeing what you're believing
i've been there too yeah
hour ending cant see
cant climb mountain so very tall
she calls onward her side
carry
into place where nobody goes
dark there's no one
into place where nobody goes
they make believe no good ah she knows
empty
wishing all while i'd never been here
all sights i've watched fail
dark clouds are moving
something about today cant explain
something about today
would end day always seem so hard
know all ways can try
if bear myself yard
where she could fly
cant explain
burning baby got no place go
they're chasing through dreams
outside room
learned trust rain
gotta go seayesterday so glad forget
drifting out reach
hey come
dark cloud inside
senseless sense alone
when monday morning cant wake up
all that's gone
once lived
past shadows where stay
makes want understand
never realize
she reads through disguise
looking glass cracked
never really goin anywhere but here
never really goin anywhere but here
moving ever forward down pathway
pathway
walking down lane
wont disappear
alone unreliable
secret kind
sign wall dont understand
everything inside burning
close eyes dawn
just as far as know it's alright
watch them burn
lonely way
she wont tell why
patterns locked all these drawers
find didnt know
was traveling too far away
ah ah ah
but only would remember when
if decide which one want
ah ah ah
these prisons cant abide
cant unbind
it's just another question faith
will turn head away
will turn head away
booked got hurry
till it's laid waste
take away no one knows
been waiting such long time
never know where twain shall meet
so very long doesnt matter where this has gone
which one stays
pale skin cant turn any whiter
over again could find way
precious vice
now raindrops fall away souls
it's kind hard now see all
gaze eyes will feel so cold
find time fear past
that's what said
hung line
empty
room that's washed burnin tears
yard trip number sevens
they all tell try

bottled them up 'til well ran over

i'll feel better when time has gone by
sitting at home at rockin reelin
rolling along song aggravates us

you're movie star innerspace
i've been thinking about one left behind
come then time getting late
sweet suburban breeze blowing
middle everyone
but all want one true love
all lights are shining
well looked life fantastic
well now read bedtime story
long ago was told there were riches inside
now float boat darkness play fool

driving home dark say this time will last
it's hurting desire strong sweet
want see face as little child
are all working late
it's all so shameless
where dont want win
another zodiac's gone around
this will year
one wheel ditch another
divide by time you've got left
who's stopping
said had somebody better become
fell wishing well
might call down
never leave ground
starting loom right now
all this
all those hits took persistence was vain
all purgatories all this
take home
once together drawn
were awaiting winter frost
had gathered all our forces
their race was slaughtered very last man
causing pain within mind
you've destined suffer
see faded colours
thorn molesting sleep
reveal fucking beast
as pain companion solitude guide
without forbearance will quench thirst crimson tears
am only cherish pain
little pressure's all takes make bleedto death
we'll lose things we're fighted
what we're waiting
blood tears until sweet release share death
chariot time hurrying near
we're allowed stay
hear these words say
music tenkula sentenced lyrics lopakka
each turn i've taken way
this path i've chosens rocky one
empty
unleash flame us all reign
come are marked thee
raise gun take aim shoot
choice mine so dont afraid pull this through
since death
love fate
cross heart hope die
roses wither so does hope
swept away last sheds hope
this
deadly shadows fall
feel burning ice snow first time
end at hand i'll find one came looking for'
hovering lightly down upon ground
rising glow brings along sense death
dead moon rising
what also call life
burning eerie sapphire
music tenkula lopakka sentenced lyrics lopakka
forgotten personality
into black pieces
it's so easy make play game
just spread pink wide smile drain darling
dont need care if want
what treasures may hide night
dreams do thems dead
chiht we'll sleep forever
sets our hearts ablaze
flames rise still so freezing our sea
eternity
sorrowful yet glorious somehow
still doesnt only hurt end now
vesa ranta drums
choir parts vengeance mine end road by musarit lead arranged by ismo koskela
see life as was meant
heart belongs past
from wall frozen time see own reflection
always know never lost
still amazed how our whole trio link
tiny minds virtuous whores
blow brains onto wall
suppose have left lose
see hell
then drop dead
eternity'
relieving words farewell end earthly hell
eternity
fields where their blood was spilt
shall bring all down
music tenkula sentenced lyrics laihiala
burning passion glowing sunset gives will leave joy
everyman will go thee thy guide
our troops are only here there
who were put through hell line fire
as others keep hunting
dance all way end
kept failing end
if ceased exist or was never born at all
forever gone as all love live
funeral time now
no moon tonight cast its gleam
soon they'll lower down deep into icy ground
since she drew curtains down
good moments are breezed
still both know what other alternative
yet some twisted way
i've forgotten what was
could hear them speaking those
dwells heart eternal rage
dreamlike void surrounds
entombed remains
so wind brings smell blood
moon shuts her eyes
killing killing
each drop blood our shattered hearts ever bleed
each these days draws us part
burning us ash
forever gone
leave this world behind
last one life
will all over soon i'll through
he knows aint
have united through his end
this end
he's done he dead
he has reached last frontiers
their fire hits us all around
iron fire blood
but really i've gotta say aint not how it's
empty
die die die
will always
am one who laughs last laughs forever more
now game over it's all gone
wounds are too dry more bleeding
think about all positive sides life
when master slave his life
all tears fears lies cries
it's great lose control
leave no room happy endings
need burn reach point no return
music tenkula sentenced words jarwa
pagan reign nature
he shall promise no salvation but let see what imminent
rocks this human cradle grave
from dark side moon
praying her soul as this blood hands stains whole
gone are those nights by side
no more beating as one no longer burns flame
remaining moments
melancholy hole soil so hard cold
freezes heart desperate heart
lay depressed hollow
now come haunting every night
oh yeah will
they had seen salute flames sky
am not one them
through all life
obsession are feeding
strongest love our death will
open eyes realize
was dying dead
slowly turning dust
hate
love hate myself
give reason live
he's gazing through all there
from cradle straight grave
each time dream
watch now i'll complete
born fight built last
hate burns scars within our minds
battle which no one will prevail
where humanity gone
this end liberty
so long have become night
make glow go away
dying it's so bright
where there no light day
cold wind kills flame heart
cold wind kills flame heart
dont deserve grave
when finally get rid
do not deserve luxury grave
rain comes falling down
steady hand this sharpened hard steel
no longer feeling flame
but still far more than would
further off get harder will return
see where river will take
'at dawn you'll live no more
'i am dead am alive
originally performed by iron maiden
mighty roar russian guns
as lay there gazing at sky
lies open ultimate fate life
feel come all its pride
hey beast war hunt
die this hell
damn sure
so turn away turn away go
might seem t's just part illusion life
this way wanna go
joy welcomed intruder
am stunned caught by surprise
tear heart out chest
kick while down stab back bastards
right track bastards
give war
think lifetime as one day
our way are spinning around
eternally unavoidably
hey little sister what have done
i've been away so long so long
look something left this world
breath night
echoes empty promises
time comes closer each day lets see
but those good times were always worth waiting
but those good times were always worth waiting
are only one see
are only one see
everything's blessing disguise
does what she can
pulls back
no communication
tired things
chasing chasing out
am
resurrect those bridges an ancient glance
she's wanting less
too wrong or too right
slept through easter yesterday
cant wait any longer
it's only been 2000 years
heavens sakes
will only take one moment
you've got give room breath
maybe it's still not enough ease pain
there's so much room here
can feel her fingers runnin through feelings
you've got wonder moving best can do
who's empty as hole
empty
sometimes deep thought 31
baby you're lie
if there's fission bomb then there's fission mind
can wall around under any covering i'll find
someone needs an anthem end suffering
wont favorite girl wont hear our favorite song
she doesnt notice things take granted
empty
it's weak manor born
tell new apron strings
know want back
did bid good time
it's yours
silence priceless silence
silence priceless silence
instead praying thankful hallelujahs
keep yourself
maybe system needs adjustment
what they want what needman you're so complicated mean
how could so between
it's what she doesnt say
cracked common law
talked trees had no fruit bear
mean mr mustard says he's bored
things hide
divine apathy disease youth
see what it's hell
she wants up front
before she knew name she was bed
she dont care he's ten years older than
beat sun from her glory
know
empty
think she'd take back
indifference as witness
every time wash off find underneath
lookinfor words never going find
starinback at when come home at night
get down pray oven
cant juggle this
she thinks it's over still
whiskeymouthbottleneckcardstack
it's green what it's found
maybe carolina
going back beginnings
yeah roads are right tonite
know deep inside pines
roll from corners
player remainstell why wont keep
can do damage
from showing up down scene
face still
all over town
have broke all rules i've made
he's got more ends than means more wants than needs
super related
time will pack bag love
make list
got brand new crutch brand new mouth
will buy place lower east side
cant stomach what you're going see
they did once they can do again
didnt do saw who did
stop

y cada ida que pasa es uno mas
pero al menos aun respiro
olvidarte porque
despus de ti la pared
y ya has convertido
despus de ti la pared
si lloras con los ojos secosy hablando de ella
y hoy se que es tuyo mi corazon
que no creas mas en mis promesas
y nos decimos adios
y es que no estory hecho de carton
yoyo no voy
el amor tal vez
tengo el presentimiento de que empieza la accion
y asi como ves
se que estoy muy lejos
lejos de tu amor lejos de tu corazon
lejos de tu amor y sin salida mire
bleibe baby bleibe baby
y aunque haga la invencible
desde que no estas
y ahora todo lo importante
el dolor es sofocante
solo pienso en que estas cerca de mi
y es asi que solo vivo para ti no se estudiar
ni se salir no se que magia has hecho en mi
es inutil dormir
mis dias sin ti son solo un eco
aun sigo buscando en las caras de ancianos
y tu corazon esta sangrando
tu necesitas de mi de mi
ya de fiesta fiesta cada vez aburro mas
tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
necesitas alguien que te sale la pasion
siento que falta el aire si no estas aqui
tu necesitas de mi de mi
solo tu doblas mi corazon
y en todo lo que digas
en tu mirada de cristal
que eres mi desliz mi pais feliz
eres mi desliz mi pais feliz
no no mires como antes
no la dio ms nadie
y mirando sin mirar

fuiste polvo polvo eres
de malos pensamientos
siempre antes de treinta
y condenaste una serpiente
empty
en su espacio y su tiempo
saludar al vecino
que diria la familia
y en la fiesta de quince
los gatos como yo caen de pie
y tus ganas de huir
muertos de sed
yo no quiero cobardes
keep aiming top
if say heart sore
quit before sweat drop
que se terminen las pelculas de accin
que se coman las sobras de mi inocencia
para siempre tu melancola
con lo mucho que odio la television
y que quede aqui
y acribillen mi pedazo de conciencia
para siempre tu melancolia
dime acaso donde vas
dime acaso donde vas
y que voy hacer si mi barbilla lega al piso
que te estan reclamando
y siempre quisiste estar aqui
yo de nuevo soy feliz
y ahora estas aqui
llevarte como tuataje
que renazcan la vida
es el sueno que ahora libera
lo siento tan directo al corazon
huracn de emociones
mi otra verdad
este nuevo amanecer
confunden dominan
en mis quince soy mujer en realidad
time will bring them back bet

braulio tiene ojos grandes y cabellos oscuros
con el fuego por dentro
ese da llegaste un poco mas de las diez
siempre viste de gris pues no tiene remedio
por la ley del magneto
ese dia llegaste un poco mas de las diez
despues que estrenes
par de dedos de frente
pero si te has decidido
si te vas
que no estare aqui
pero para ese entonces
que el insulto del reloj
como siempre
ya no puedo estar sin ti
y los besos que nos dimos
duelen tanto las sonrisas
pensando en ti
sigue rodeando
como siempre
but then came made past look so funny
when look into eyes
shape lips size nose
things are what they will
quand tu
believe
ya lo se no eres perfecto y es verdad
porque yo no respiro si no estas
ya lo se no eres perfecto y es verdad
porque yo no respiro si no estas
contigo celebro y sufro todo
quiero vivir la vida
que he de llorar cuando te vallas
nombre y tu piel

friends are tearing us apart
little too well
never again

altho' it's been said many times

but there's someone who's torn apart
just help dry tears i've cried
still want by side
when comes lovin he's worst
cause speak prophecies love

i'll take cab home
if only he'd been better bet all tell all hank
dashing boy gets girl

37 millions what larry parker got
perfect rhythm nazis pagan rhythm nation
steely dan rather hammer than nail
this meltdown
dropped acid saturday night
this movie screenplay
there star shines tonight all world see
but angles watching over prayer will pray
when glorious sun does rise melt away their fears
reincarnation paul revere's horse
he's lookin fuse
will not die it's not poison
king philistines his soldiers save
causes galileo's math book get thrown
national bank at profit sells road maps soul
oh what trill
see eyes
it's so deadly dear
well some things can explain away
wont happy without around
but without all these things can do
did stand by
this room
but do what can
do what can
he does what he can
downstairs it's quiet
make survive
he's been growling name saying
just pill make happy
who will bring panacea
would easier live way they say should
if nothing changes after are gone
just what does matter anyway
you're not others
some awful nasty things about but
there's no one else earth
do mind if just
guess thought you'd changed
answers come waves
but something wont go away
something has die
where has all love where has all love gone
chorus 2x

finally know why feel you're letting go
if keep losing you're gonna bored
flaking temporary skin you're no burden
if keep losing you're gonna
but i'd sit awake daze anyway
maze chains

playing this pantomime
put hands air
hating should introduced as new law
sit observing disgust

gonna liar
next bed

oh madman mad
starts take its toll
these are better days

thrown all away but
what wanna say but
i've no respect

blind deafened moon stimulate tombs angels
who am
just myself blame
humiliation
being victim
knife dangerous heart
that's been left behind
sugarless cancerous
it's never gonna mend
could see was blind
see which ones remain
one kind
oh dying
it's not fair
continue life too
but know it's dream
but i'll take throw away
will kneel oh
why are so good
death all around
empty
reflections sound
it's loop lasts forever
if only could breathe
we'll make lie
think really care
i'll find someone help
want soldier
want slave
discard old fashion
demolish monkeys
death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
act upon hypocritical vision
demolish monkeys
contain yourself
esteem will rise
steam will rise
why did get into this shit
had no one
wake up lower fever
stuck marrow
lately desperate believer
waking up strong morning
when paranoid see walls behind walls behind walls
i'll take clothes take this strange behaviour
leaving life fear
help comfort
but say
but know can see pain
only one
you're analyst
they're turning their head whilst they wait
if dont regret them
now know why feel do
greatest view from here
under thumb bone under nail
panic attic mind but chance numb
but chance die enhances growth
sings cellar song
time not moment we're letting slip away
hang strong from an emptiness
as long as are together
there's no bathroom there no sink
gonna wait til fat boy
it's too much not enough
never stop needing
open need but returned point acceptance
fondle keys heart when everyone's heart
take everything you're not dont so
busking change changing everything
lie amongst lies tuna brine
get no freedom at all
her mother doesnt even know her name
left selfish hungry so feed pain
dreams are bad
it's true
it's true
waiting all day
empty
under stone wall
when world's not feeling ugly
arthritic conversation
stuck goal
rescue skin
you're so far away
taking roots back yourself
great times commotion
damned luck
catching wind hand
here comes every dat
catch wind their hands
land lies dry africa
still children smile africa
follow follow
stay until love alive kicking
what gonna do when all cracks up
stay until love love alive kicking
when hear say what got say
see glitter sun
oh near first morning light
all things she said she said
if bombs dont get
take courage night
they were coming up air
was born live
get up meet up rising sun
they say coward dies thousand times

god only knows but god only knows
well that's question down time
just dont want him no friend mine

breathing sweet memories

shane came from dublin town from old world so green
23rd victim gangland war takes his last breath
all love you're best
quit dreaming this real life baby
all love you're all see
then translate

river runs dry ever

another sad affair

sanctify yourself sanctify

summer's gone winter's eyes
if can see lights shine front
too proud cry
twist anxious days
last song land sings
ever find when trouble calls you're first line
7 deadly sins
if you've got sticky fingers
he wants world
first tear forms right eye
follows love
need draw blood somehow
this eye that's crying first
there's something should know
when scared 'bout lose
she's last chance guarantee
nerves just feel electrified
rush end time
stay burning slow
someone somewhere summertime
someone somewhere summertime
empty
no longer can see sun
no one else can see
purple hearts revolving round purple rage
circle fireflies tonight
more see more learn

shell shocked lover under cover that's game
'cos when earth starts moving know no liar

pretty little birds do change their voices
love kept inside will come
tout c'est okay

not no red football
when window which people would look through
body's not football
was our ruin were bondage
ta grainne mhaol ag teacht thar saile
may please god miracles may see

can understand just how he feels
scorn not his simplicity
day doctor told her it's boy
he wont ask pity or sympathy
all too soon
love

no secret anymore
since fame fortune
used do
success has made failure our home
thank hearing
thank seeing
thanks not hurting
thanks silence
thank tearing apart
how could possibly know what want
but know how
maybe was mean
will sleep peace
have universe inside
have little voice inside
come will guide
if dont know
give reason not listen
wreck up all apart
that's thing makes sing sadly
get our names back book life lamb
our friendship has been stale
i'll talk but wont listen
where trout salmon play
i've loved soldier boy
farewell foggy dew
fill parting glass good night joy all
heard his song up blue
singing bird as
took our one final breath
girl did at some hotel
there's nothing there lean upon
ooooh it's blowing deep beneath skin
there no more natural thing
oh listen englishman

know they will returned
proved things never believed
sure hate see u looking so sad
yeah it's hard but can done
u have ruthless compassion

if you've never seen good time
i'll remember
stolen from our very eyes
there no other troy
do love her
god love
there no other troy
door wasnt closed
but you're still spitting fire
want but not alone
real love requires give up those loves
think love best
had plenty money
if aint got no money

when death takes away
jesus saves no need pray
hungry blood
survive brutal thrashing
none survive wrath
death upon now
destroying human heart
inside
demented personality
self destructive rationale
life's show all play part
wishes can
give something sing about
all joy
if they let go
'cause i've been expelled
pain feel
pain life after death resolves
no spared breath
how much can take pain
lead hanneman
laughing as eternally rot
taunting death sounds cadavers pain
vengeance breeds driving insane
dancing blood disciples enslaved
crucify creation
suicidal surge
offspring sent out cry
empty
dead bodies dying wounded
missiles undergroung
kill food
you'd know why
mesmeric full demolition
execution but thought end
will remain frozen time
see family burned alive
does no good pray
this no bad dream
heathen whore satans wrath
fuck this sinful corpse
vengeance frenzied hatred
down fiery pits hell
gouging eyes
lead hanneman king
ways world you've been so blind
from book untruths weakest mind
tell what think savior now
see yourself lies
keeps pure inside
breach life
walk line
bleeding ideology through pain
no grave mark
barbaric thoughts old
armed behind back
no suicide
own peace mind going
everything melts away before eyes
fuck progress
you've got fucking catheter brain
were made take fall now you're nothing
constant threat
within world hate
into brain
ingest virtues feed
seep from eyes
corroding from inside
only way exit
modulistic terror
no emotion
modulistic terror
one taste blood
piercing impaling no judgement just punishment
stained blood
lust war will never cease
leave where comrades lie
messenger all demise
seeking life beyond perishment
sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts death behind
what am what want only after death
empty
start rage take extremes
bleeding pleading then death
empty
fall into sky's crimson tears
now shall reign blood
save
send donations
could so naive
when doubt subsides his honesty
at midnight stake
signed book red
takes more than one try
leave ripped torn
incantation spell gone by
died
know they couldnt deal
let rest peace
might misbehave
but can see you're unimpressed
let rest peace
jesus caught pushed him off shelf
richard hung himself
throw all away
poor bastard hung himself other day
shredding stabbing ripping
kerry king
no one could foresee
spiraling demise
humanity going insane
shades death are all see
carpet bombing laid waste
choking bleeding life
reality not fair no time second guess
all pain fury
human pile proven pride
no blood no glory
razors edge
let mind go
bloody tomb
step outside yourself let thoughts drain
dead before hit ground
pallid ashen face against skin
saw them all around today
cant say i've seen all
never knew existed
everyday look into mirror
am master whipping time
you're nothing
sole purpose never ends
beaten into submission
god dead am alive
empty
god cant save time
last hope slips away
abrahall incomplete music bmi
people taking notes
sick boy
torment ill forgotten
shattered adolescent sings another child
beaten torn
death fucking insane
unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
impulsive habitat
lead king
lead hanneman
at one evil has ruled before
have soul
empty
show flesh eaten away
hear piercing cries all
welcome world
by di
we're being sucked up
touch cross head
think it's way too late
whether this heaven or hell
weak wont survive
hurt infractions know
empty
subservient all
empty
price paid torment
cold ruthless iron will
what took
come worship place no truths are told
let purest stain mind
this what see
let purest stain mind
blood will sterilize
keep pretending
but
dont hear at all
slay demons
aint nothin but hound dog
aint nothin but hound dog
well aint never caught rabbit
aint nothin but hound dog
would leave world behind
have all eternity
let possession slowly swallow
lyrics hanneman music hanneman king
it's what was meant
birth satans son
all love lost
satan holds future
searching answer
down fall
fighting killing their very last breath
awaiting our victory ending his dream
end near our time now short

infectious feed
engulfs flesh bones
slowly surround
until know you're mine
know you're mine
there'll nothing left

where time turned into frozen block
waiting unfold
vacant nameless life
trade war makes tense
bullets struck 'em down
followed them without fear
red eyes are watching
raped loved silent pleasure
dissapointed hounds
death delight
hangmans are ready burst their axes down
want pull hammer down
witchhammer malice rice
but once while not myself
ninety nine percent time x3
aint tough aint tough
last time saw were talking just
spirit which none them can transcend
friend here's
there's nothing would rearrange dont ever change
wearin sunglasses too
anything coola burning heart could so cool
an april fool
innocent helpless at 17
she's alive well she was never dead
way keep inside it's just one more dark opening
you're going somewhere might way
settling up something change rest life
beggars beggars beggars choosers
between revenge end cant defend
one more unholy ghost
one more pomp circumstance
dont worry child you're sure scared
one more pomp circumstance
cant live without would surely fall apart
it's little bit heaven whole lot hell
it's hardest part
protect serve slice nerve
took away something that's mine want give back
see crowd gather 'round
you're black soldier white fight
sure feel some pride
passing through all time
three more days you'll hanging line
but then again you've heard all before
no previous experience at all
never been before
now they're cranking 'em out by
said this once before
all time
those precious things juist dont last throw away
this time you've hit an all time low
why dont go home crawl into hole
everything's so true life when you're not living
just killing time just cant go back
just cant go back
when circus left goes parade
you'd better look around
did almost make feel somethings gotta happen soon
but every day get up calm down give up hang around
though lie bed hours cannot close eyes
think see light beyond door
will he set free someday
little shy improving here come coming through
it's can confide
friends might reject
said want want want want
ideas have been taken
stuck lovin forty four beneath head
if got warrant better read
comon dirty hack into district court
ninety nine years san quentin penn
when reign sways
but know i'll look after
no one
days today
hangin out dry
could use someone
if darkness has no end light up darkness
aint how much can take it's how take
it'snot someplace have go
dont do this dont do dont try this
ha ha ha
went river swim upstream
now you're all grown up
when watch over am blessed
can see please say yes
there are no easy answers questions remain tough
came just ride
nothing say just let go away find some
she dont know which children belong which father
he cant pay doctor bills he just cant afford pills
but she saw world through eyes child
they got no conviction
piece trouble
gives u something use
im not pushin u off
now were noone else
its not sensation
wanna see rearview mirror
leeway need little leeway
aint waiting around someday
gotta get out head
gotta get out head
cause sick tried tryin
saturated liver
it's pretty stuffy under there
wouldnt so hard sink
should have learned swim instead
been down so far dont get wet
pappy taught how float
goin down
waving back folks shore
say this way
soon turned into flying
now find are grounded
never grow out contemplating
there's one thing know that's perfectly clear
you've forgotten more than ever knew
guess wore out welcome it's better than being alone
just another lost journey where everything's turning away
it's happy time happy time happy time
just want kiss goodbye
this song joy
cause homesick home i've never had
so now wait spark know will turn
he's gonna make feel way want feel
there's just no substitute fun
dont recognize home town
time has neither come nor gone
kneeling at confessional nothing confess
yes did best
yes did best
yes will still laughing
you're watching walls you're watching walls
everyone just anyone
she walks into evening air
she's blacker than night
save wretched world
you've got lot learn
if can keep up
still keep up
take us up heaven gonna okay
nobody's watching so why do act fake
how get out
how get out
dont know
heart sparkles
work out'fraid you've lost innocence
one day dirt will bury
dirt surrounds
little too clean
ever so patiently sit upon our sinking ship waiting black dove
been just these drugs feelin
empty
but somehow still swing
empty
what do think makes her way
put out misery
put out misery
frustrated incorporated making misery
just trying find somebody pay bail
aint doing nothing i'll just jire someone do
now what sound snow falling down
were thinkin was distressed about some universe oppressed
know spring follows winter
when know there no place have walk
aint done godamn thing all afternoon
are surprised find now they add nothing
why dont just tell someone
but those who leave township sinking
can feel how long it's been
so why sit wait new world begin
dead lift their heads come alive
still trying find this blackout
would all she wrote
an extended family fiddlers magicians
when fly trapped spider's web but bat's got spider
there no shame
they did behind back
nothing hold here
waiting hurricane blow away
corrosion rust
but dont understand how feeling
river wash into sea
i've no time waiting
cant find time
nobody told about any this school
no one wants talk about loss
when there's nothing left say
women were scarce
new hairstyles
want make up mind
chewed his cud was stick mud
poor poor
only thing he hated worse than city
if could see eye eye could see just exactly who small
should walkin makin easy ignore but guess i'd better stay
dont get tired being white
there's somethin gotta tell ya
get out bed
its hard get hard these days
nothin better anyway
befriended by enemy
sad smile
someone who wont laugh at
'cause doggie's been hit by car
she yelled at store
why so children have pay poor planning did
call up middle night
this time have really led myself astray
know what no one else knows
madman laughing at rain
run away but always seems same
promise wont tell
promise wont tell
how thank dearly
nostalgia's waiting
lie here floor
they're local drunken boys
no time find out what miss
if dont get what want
if dont get what want
sick song about how lost lover
sick song
these hang ups are getting down
waiting by phone
well if there's one thing know it's easy kill what's hard grow
all these temptations keep wanting sky above
wishing some shelter from within
working without plan
its trickling through hand
get up get down
glass draining fast knows no future holds no past
now seems peace mind has come up biddin
wondering if i'll come back
intersection traffic lights are red all directions
asleep couch eyes open wide
cant believe see myself
just another face faceless crowd just another king headless
see got happy family but that's oh so far away
who's racing delivery room
signs his name takes blame all names no shame
when they got together knowledge was carnal
he gave pearl sister mary teresa
aint got no shame better find someone else blame
take root three times
tell when does life begin
after she paid they fixed car
hey that's pretty dress
dont play
play dont play
dont play
without it's cold stark
she's such an old maid
look at now
do think can find place dreams nightmares
shouldnt'a got so loaded
oh please dont leave own devices
he's sure killed before morning comes
slave music father son
friends tell cant done
work all night sleep all day
secret agents freedom fighters those impossible missions
light will come shining through
lift up veil tears
live love where love's insane need numb ease pain
you're just prisoner sweet prisoner you're just imprisoned by own devices
stick fingers down throat grab heart
favorite band was pushed aside
who wears pants it's faded but clear
say remember
southwest go home
was disgrace
might as well join mob
joined grave dancer's union
clean sparks driving down
thought was 4th july
saw sky
cause heard wind
played backwards santa parody
feed boy hates kill
biting fighting back from dying
crawl into our lives everyday
loving our hangmen as penultimate joke
everything fits
little tiny pawn
save his precious stones stonesfar beyond wheel
hides face lies snake
wont come
till all just disappear
cause were average
air out wear
nothing closing eyes
burrow down
wishing though never could
flows below her head
who isnt
as desperate as are
pretty pretty blank name list
it's all same
fire loaded mental cannon page
permission mirrored self affliction
think it's turning back
think it's turning back
million miles covered ground
now mirror
face pollution
but cant see night
no not tying
treated queen
along her veins
they wouldnt let stop
break leg dont fopp back
foppin everywhere go do all
foppin way makes go everybody was
well first fopp up
seemed take through
everybody tries
long time coming
give little bits
full onyou dont get nothing free
get snake
hey baby whats disease
hungry mean
get some motion
kick kick kick till
hides door
have half chance
bruised torn from stones sticks
got arms around baby brother
she's our bride
he did nothing perfectly much better than anyone i've ever seen
take away
bow down live
head injury head injury head injury
next
they take thine
monkey circus freak
smile as look mirror
know hurts
lyrics by chris cornell
arms held out
jesus christ pose
mother says it's alright
so think got something
going holy land
going home very last time
seal tomb without face
broken neck lays broken gift
safe outside gilded cage
but she died
dont ask why
rest slide
wreck
wont pretendi'll going down
death all
wreck
little joe eyes lover look back
go where reptiles roam
loud love

empty
when it's just
more than just word
all things live cant easily hide
from
try breathe
were never there
ask just what could do
now older feel
express how felt
must lonely up there head up clouds
now table's turned now demons are freinds
shell are waiting someone rescue from yourself
falling easy it's getting back up becomes problem becomes problem
look could take breath away
wouldnt have any other way
silence what kills
feel am nothing but
command lips say hate
have nothing left give
now this beg
empty
open wide all shit they feed
are satisfied
try one
anything
live
if someone else showed way
learns walk through life themselves
blindly go through life
thank people life
see what would do
since first saw
since can say wasnt addicted
i've gone fucked things up again
it's been awhile
it's been awhile
myself beyond means
consequences i've rendered
but can still remember
kinda numb
it's kinda sick
from all i've become
wish this would just go go
dug around yourself
king all excuses
you've lied so much think it's true
song they played say goodbye
because this child she mine
life saved
say goodbye
do take time
it's always there
angels wings
way
look at so pathetic
i've never needed anyone help
hear talk about family life
can feel torment
just look away
feel same
cant take away
empty
have left
so fucked up
empty
what fuck's purpose
cant see thru rain
cant take away what's
do suffer
take look
conversations over
see man walks alone
swallows his pride another hit
as walk along streets
could beg please
see true colors
was from
see true colors
all this pain
looking
take each step as comes
try break barrier
its what need its what need
see this through
pardon if
two steps
pardon while
pardon
while still believe
not alone not alone
might feel control things
so please
it's starting tear from within
cant feel this another night
drowning this
drowning this
too much pressure
more hurt
blindly look other way
then all see
more take
no one blame
empty
cant go up any further
it's heart
buy flaws
follows 'round
it's raining again
over head
will not surrender what was our fathers died bear
upon back which break
life see her
just dont leave
inside so cold
sometimes when you're out rope
its ugly head starthing show through
whatever takes keep hands from shaking

times chose stand out rain wait
but how can collect them all throw them face
always find words say keep right here waiting
always find words say keep right here waiting
run away i've mastered feeling nothing
truth not so good
run away dead inside
road never lets
mean best
everythings clear
love baby
but alone now
save
so just pray
save
so pray
from all
so crawl inside head
i'll show how feels
so crawl inside head
alone put shelf
pick up pieces as fall apart
empty
watch suffer
bad habits deal
truth hurts when it's face
empty
these are words
afraid waking
shut up 2x
cant breathe
but fucked up too dont need
just what say dont want shut up
feel this way live another day within world
pride forced all down inside forced myself make
show what you're made
not gifted
all alone crying
just kicked face
so cant see pain
wont help everything need right front
just live tomorrow
dont take this anymore
do believe way choose
cant fake this
helps find way
warms when cold
still tangled up
tangled up
all just seems yesterday
road walked home rain
stare out this dirty window
it's way am you'll never change
way am or re arrange
not really good at subduing hate
from where all could
what's so wrong
this this
empty
empty
help ease pain
will break
empty
another day
everything's clear
family all
are killing think
through eyes
had no answers 'cause

but these words
but who's say what you're going through
learned live without pride
wonder how's brother
protect from all things i've already endured
sweet zoe jane x2
turned around knocked them down walked across sea
quickly rang bell hoping hadnt come too late
takes

dont know realize
take little water cool down

but jealous night all her secret chords
sun i'll cry even if blinded
empty
went away away from side
rule so plain

grandpa can still keep moving he did so long ago
makes note what's float
he'll get even score
hear night music playing dont know what it's saying
dont know what night can do
dont know what night can do
dust timeless memory love
she's good at appearing sane but just want know
love life again though dont know how this day will finally end
song lines are there they will bring us back around
one child grows up somebody just loves learn
but cry anyway cos you're all broke down
when worked out what had worked
then picked up revealed love
who cares who knows what's true
burning up midnight oil
keep talking all want
keep talking
it's come right back
got gimme some lovin gimme some lovin
now gonna relax honey everybody should
gimme some lovin every day
well feel so good everything getting hot
hey baby gimme some lovin
know just have see baby
wont long before baby
had cry today
music people all drifting away
wanted make her part life
help turn all lights
something's shining deep eyes
walk blind try see
things look so bad everywhere
could rise above higher love
bring higher love
dont ashamed reach out take helping hand
feel cant stand pain
when two hearts both feel same there's way beat game
see mountain water running down into streams
when bring heart home stay
almighty time rolls let's not spend all alone
relating each other just how strong our will can
had dream last night angels had come riding
vision fair please dont disappear
oh lord hear us cry up fiery sky
crowded street london happiness
see how good were
these three men made solemn vow
they've hired men their scythes so sharp cut him off at knee
little sir john nut brown bowl his brandy glass
what have do what have
telling
while trying say things are real
cause paid freedom too high cost
what saying every day love will find way
come show now
when you're caught heat think it's got beat
when night comes rollin day through
we'll take all kinds weather
there aint no special crime sense crying heaven above
think it's amazing just what can do
taken back disbelief
everything's heaven 'cause life has been blessing
said makes wanna get down pray
ooh can feel we're moving new direction
said makes wanna get down pray
when feeling low all alone
'cause makes wanna get down pray
take away beyond night
empty
pouring out soul
cant believe she's going
can cope today
soon someday i'll boundand i'll cope today
dreams never lie
use up lifetime looking break day
hard rain following cold wheels moving
i'll give loving can depend
know gonna give everything can
all want one more morning just feel all again
shadow run
fresh cut flowers give sweet perfume
daylight breaks while sleep sand
couldnt stop myself from having fun
now comes time know it's gotta
gimme plenty lovin gimme plenty lovin
day's almost gone but night still ahead
voices shouting street life lived ragged beat
from then nothing seemed same
real love what all are looking
get through roll baby
come just roll baby just roll baby
beat keeps running
go down babe slot machine take dime
baby's eyes feel them looking at
here's shining song know need
you're so far but light still arrives
sunrise womans eyes good loving one warm afternoon
faded love songs feelings wine
someone understand
felt there was an emptiness
under feet making world go 'round cant come down
one man has his mind made up other cant decide
split decision
split decision
it's fine line very fine line
spy house love
playing games jokers fools
they keep watching signs land
here's lovers who reach all
though sometimes does get lonely
take as comes
we're all skating thinnest ice
we're all skating thinnest ice
though mind gets numb take as comes
he says he's doing fine
something seems take every dime man can make
if hold
have walked bitter streets alone
life glowing inside
they think about night so sweet
were children once playing toys
low spark high heeled boys
but spirit something no one destroys
it's morning side morning side
from pure crystal stream
golden measure hear music cry
business men they shake their heads then they frown
then finally get ah but aint gonna have together
population move
time running out running out
they stick eye
someone's talking phone cant hear word say
without belief he knows his empty grief name his own fears
so wild standing there her hands her hair
someday some good wind may blow her back
over over
not dream wishing well
wake up judgment day
used come see all time
while there's wheel still turning
'cause still know how move
when there's no one left leave even dont quite believe
you'll keep searching till very end
heart belongs no one
nothing seems matter
songs everyone's heard
saw photograph
but just had look
somebody spoke went into dream
tower souls
single thought singular touch grace
or win this world at cards let slip hands
eternities still unsaid
all money pretty necklace
rings she wore her bride groom
after thunder's spoken
take stars
still love world
know know know know know know know
anytime she goes away
let's make all one all love
when honour's at stake this vow will make
got everything more than had planned
when there's someone need
but thoroughbred horse she can turn sixpence
she can change her mind she changes her sweaters
how will know
that's baby
saw two priests ferry
murder crows
'what good used up world how could
they lived they died they prayed their gods
one by one
got seek till find
they glow unbearably bright
fact's uncomfortably clear
drowned hunger's tidal wave
it's harder still know reason why why why
not only hope but education
would melt resolve into dew
silence consent
still beating heart
restore broken dreams
stop before start
stop before start
have lot ask
have so much do
every single blade grass every yellow flower
beneath desert moon we're waiting
since you've gone was free
but halfway home changed tune
missed bus missed train
place live looks opulent
give thing
but can only curse fate
how many times do swear you'll never love again
one day could looking
turn clock all way back
there's simply no immunity there's no guarantee
begging her take back
bat you're cave
present future
stand up all lovers world
stand up all lovers world
bring night
couldnt spend another hour daylight
wilt thou thus abused still
as they are high so high desire
better thousand times die
cant cant
cant stand losing
afternoon has gently passed by
oh pilate speak so clear
oh pilate speak so clear
strewn fields belgium france
all those young lives betrayed
all childrens crusade
little cloudes doubtfull constant faith
close up these weary weeping eyes
come ere last sleepe comes or come never
deadly pain endless misery
house share
clouds eclipses stain moon sun
said why do think question funny
walk dog
said why wait till now demonstrate displeasure
call 'er dove
wish she was here
cushie butterfield
candy mans trumpet steels ma young hart away
empty
empty
their innocence will pull through
their logic ties up rapes
all want say
years turn into lifetimes
walk away anger walk away pain
walk away from yesterday walk away tomorrow
all this wandering has led this place
walk away from emptiness walk away from sorrow
tied chair bomb ticking
come moth flame
tied tracks trains fast coming
wake vain
now she turns
close eyes
sweet desert rose
flames
dream rain
wake pain
how fall
promise spring
though window closed
or sweet melody
this girls an open page
so bad makes him cry
he starts shake cough
both just got stolen
looked everybody but
guess all can do muster up some change
but really they are no different from
we've been down so long
comfortable existance reduced shallow meaningless party
por que hay tristeza en sus miradas
y con sus esposos
amores invisibles
un dia danzaremos
con sus esposos
danzando siempre en soledad
empty

'til ran our dreams
at end game

at night candle's brighter than sun

mention passing college tutor
search house fine tooth comb
run name through computer
at times this lonely man needs love
pick brains pick pockets
you'll still know nothing 'bout
every move make
belong
keep crying baby please
as i've done from start
everything she do just turns
everything she do just turns
they didnt believe words were true
everybody left but
cause everybody fell
his arms she fell as her hair came down
never made promises lightly
upon fields barley
face weasel
fill 'er up son
yeah that's real diamond she wearin
was lucky get job at this gas station
can sort out later phone
why were going take stolen thing
you're gonna fill her up hate
you've gotta fill her up faith
gotta fill her up love
sometimes shell orient's pearls find
there let live forlorne
fortune throwne
it's just way world evolves
negotiate peace earth
so let's just get past
our love really beyond repair
you're moving way too fast
siege guns had been pounding all through night
cannot fill chasm
if built this fortress around heart
had stop tracks fear
jamais nossa voz vai calar
que fragilidade que fragilidade
ficara fragil demais
clinch lifetime's argument
rain will say
ni se lograra
acero y piel combinacin tan cruel
lloras tu y lloro yo
tem gente que nao sente que o mundo assim
un acto as terminar
words music by sting
brotherhood binds us

but they were smiling subtle dolphin way
guess we'll have say goodbye
but remember all things i've said
that's when need love so bad
cause you're allmost driving mad

so happy cant stop crying
so happy cant stop crying
something seemed ease pain
so happy cant stop crying
thus wedded woes bedded tomb
inside clocks are filled sand
inside this army's retreat hide beneath thunder's call
love violent star
outside hurricane wont wait
pain instruction
love sister love world has just begun
first son riveter's son
he felt he'd been left desolate shore
caught flare acetylene light
would carry his father he
but now can plainly see
hug yourself cold cold ground
no one would see
who'd lay down his life die
hate say but it's probably
hate say but it's probably
it's hard us both let our feelings show
one friendly face all need see
have doubts see
if maintain skeptic's eye
as watched mercury
nobody knew nobody knew time
sometimes stare
every place around world seemed same
it's same old thing as yesterday
that's soul up there
that's soul up there
but it's destiny king pain
there's little black spot sun today
dansons tu dis
erreurs jamais
j'attends toujours
there was wound his flesh so deep wide
i'd blood lazarus heart
only death will keep us apart
she counts all her children as shield against pain
when you're down they're counting
when no medicine chest can make well
lights upon hill
let soul guide
into yellow light
into another night
thousand smiles
roaming country common good
lonesome nights cowboy bed
small price pay los seoritas
seventh son seventh son
love big fat river flood
came pass one faithful day
there'd bride every man
but there werent seven brides seven brothers
look forward better day
there deeper wave than this
there deeper wave than this
all bloodshed all anger
all angels all devils
take gun or knife low life
yeah low life low life
let mommy sleep into night until rise
wise men hang their heads
whirls around april moon
every star grain sand
if become another's wife
stone's throw from jerusalem
enemies walk free
solo en vivir
no one here but
only hope can keep together
washed up shore
see faces as they pass beneath pale lamplight
you'll only see walking by light moon
must love what destroy destroy thing love
moonlight
or magic seek here
will there
naked are tiny as one nails
there really isnt any need bloodshed
then must try twosome or threesome
now can join ranks illustrious
murder by numbers one two three
there are other things matter
but made through dark night
but funny friend
wont complain or make fuss
shadows fall
tells are own
fill eager heart
as journey through this life
need someone stand up tell when lyin
listen plea baby bring
there's time indecision between bedroom door
place sleep place stay will get her through another day
she told him she was never coming home
too many his promises got broken way
world could turned it's head
an ignorant youth
he finds these tender words love
one day he'll say love
find myself daring pray
one world enough all us
their world there no tomorrow
remember this before vote
but gets little closer everyday
only only
impart us thy infinitely complex mercy
reach out o lord thy holy mercy
sunshine laughter
dat panis coelicus figuris terninum
until this alpha male
je suis consciente je vois bien que tu souffres mais s'attenuera
there's something fishy 'round here
ta mauvaise foi j'aimerais bien que s'arrete
well there cant nothing worse
has crime
he'd favourite lamppost
it's shaggy kind story
but love someone else
chaque chose une fin et c'est la fin de la fte
dont need nobody else
could say i'd lost belief our politicians
but let say this first
said baby this sounds ticket
was going rain forever he'd told him go
rock steady rock steady
said no no sugar must wrong
woke up this morning something had changed
but rock's too small he said cant see
those days are over
have tell just how feel
europe america there's growing feeling hysteria
share same biology
believe when say
shut out world behind us
you're holy grail at end search
thou shalt not covet thou shalt not steal
dont need no doctor dont need no pills
put long black dress
i've been thinking 'bout man his wife
chemical reaction desire at first sight
blessed st theresa whore babylon
certified accountants music critics they're all here you're not alone
holding infinities palm hand
this aint no time hiding care
time heed call
there's no religion but endless ocean
there's no religion path hate
aint no prayer but one singing
options are decreasing mostly rapidly
but sunday'd too late
iq no problem here
seven days so many ways
but it's always ends up getting wet
if see us corner
sacred geometry chance
while memory fades
those who speak know nothing
she dont want no diamond ring
she dont jokes make
she's too good
she dont way feed
acercate mi y en mis sueo dime si
acercate mi y en mi sueo dime si
veo aqui alli siempre junto ti
all by myself silver light
i'd go out mind but
so going seek certain girl i've had mind
know could always good
know could always good
took courage from our numbers
our thoughts would always stray
would never have marched so far
faces mud
even when darkest clouds are sky
even when darkest clouds are sky
it's only once pass this way
dont realize you'll find next monday or next tuesday
mustnt sigh mustnt cry
picture myself this different situation
take dancing please take dancing tonight
take dancing please take dancing tonight
will supercede human kiss
would give our lovers time kill
you'll never have sweep floor
but if our love pure
you're bright star chart
i'll true no one but
noise traffic poison lead
warm wind sighs as practice swing
take sunshine
as if our minds are deranged
joy could not measure
they would pray moon
may trick firelight
remember words life
end mystery no one can read
cant see where they lead
book life
walk through day
it's easy remember
cant believe she wont here anymore
where she's gone
all hear lonesome lonesome sound
was sword his mother's hand
kind pain cant hide
birds roof mother's house
blood lazarus heart
turtles cannot sing yet they love
rob ships queen spain
where joy pirate's bride
see love again
secret marriage never can broken
chaos cages where crayfish lie
tortured human soul
fisherman laughed though disturbed at joke
if lose wager king sea
these are soul cages
they would sail island souls
walked into sea strand
wind had died ropes
grey sky she angered black
saw father's face
cant see what they dispise
i've seen their silent faces scream so loud
they dance alone they dance alone
ellas danzan con los muertos
it's foreign money supports
they're dancing their fathers
they're dancing dead
another woman torture table what else can they do
one day we'll sing our freedom
ellas danzan con silenciosa angustia
no wages torturers
they're dancing their husbands
but certain never heard sound
had no sense change ways
you'll dog star shining tonight
say heart all compassion
may win this war that's coming
temple was mammons
invest every tyranny
invested this prison
there's war upon forests
make easy yourself
but soon were enraptured love's dance
this was never meant
skirt's too short
but they'll back again
but after it's just matter logic
dont judge
he's home by thanksgiving
walk streets money
tomorrow we'll see
she knows just what do
bop bop aloom op lop bop boom
tutti frutti au rutti
were put time
so there's no turning back
mr train driver please
it's 25 midnight fifteen miles track
if whistle can blow
it's 25 midnight fifteen miles track
matter moments until dancing ends
moonlight everything shatters
saddled up moon would ride
round cape horn valparaiso
every love would always send ship heart
empty
walking moon
if it's price pay
walking moon
may as well play
both sighing sickly sweetheart see
economic theory said would
bury waste great big hole
have made redundant all our mining skills
work black seam together
they may understand our rage
heav'ns sun doth gently waste
melt not weeping
we'll together we'll together tonight
love flame burns name
love flame burns name
dreaming us
shadow still remaining
shadows wall
bring down angels
when angels fall when angels fall
when world running down
when world running down
when world running down

sit old car same one i've had years
plug mci excercise brain

if he loved
priest has said souls salvation
if could break down these walls

when dance angels will run hide their wings
heart was filled pride
whenever those dark clouds hide moon
whenever say name whenever say loud already praying
whenever vulnerable small
whenever say name whenever say loud already praying
north north west stones farve
but would north true

long time ago
garden overflows
salt waves
but he'll know their ways now
wont do
know way
know name
think cinnamon
bound us close say called bluff
very dry field
walk
worn out at knees
blinding
daniella hair growing wild jungle
but she stops very soon they both play together
edith whartons lovely figurines
cause struggle survival
see portrait come life
our routine operations
most show concealed from view
never dreamed would fall
does she tell truth
get rid soon
fall love bright idea
he's international fun boy
where megaphone man
monkey middle
thought could take
sat still
diamonds
even through broken windows
coming back home
50 50 chance
i've come
effort last
she's going home
now here meadow rain streaming through hair
but can still feel freedom following eagle's flight
her fire his desire meant
she says its not enough love
it's not enough love
wintertime
can dean
slow fade now black
upon slides into past
if had no history
now freezing
oh hold baby
by blowing skirts ladies
strange simple rules
please do not ever look
fickle heart will never true
if portugal england or spain
it's strange way shadow
he's still there
sign says headshots
but that's history
he said hundred people
coffee magazine
when sleep so close together
always making same point again
empty
i'd have as doctor
could sit behind desk
could priest
if were movie
one loved left behind
no girl could say no
i'll never maggie may
so go
this part town
certainly am
hunchback heaven
spreading memory all through sky
he sounds he's missing something
i'd make wear scar
as long as were still alive
none will meet eyes
institution green
hunger pair eyes
as wires cut through sky
they come up through cracks
she stops at stall
where portuguese women come see what sell
kids will grow weeds fence
clouds so low morning so slow
nearly free
if are holding
embrace white oblivion
if were holding
when we're walking side by side
around
'cause if was another way
so i'll try understand
watch while queen
do love many can love one
do love any do love none
am spitting out all bitterness
do love
profound lack history
sleepy shaken
they dont move fast enough
let's go back building
flies by
never even moved through
last year's troubles are so old fashioned
why their suffering more picturesque
measure measure it's same would guess
what are looking at
edge
so continue
corner
but only
lightning struck while ago
shaken this has left
all hot sharp white
empty
so young
so hungry
love only thing that's real
painted nicotene
love only thing feel
live second floor
maybe it's because crazy
it's not business anyway
then say goodnight
approval
puzzling parts
even if am love
as she records rise fall
what she might have told
men war
when something gone
whatever you've got
she made sure she was hid
because this ship say it's destiny
said men will men they'll call governor
he's oh so polite second story man
come sit whores admire view
go visit king then leave through window
see how flesh
see how lays
favorite plum
i've seen best yes
yes she's gone gone gone
at party think
before she went off
am just walking through smoke
neighborhood girl cause
her bangles her spangles her stars
empty
empty
so it's goodnight
looking fight
let loose delight
nobody knows name
dont give too quickly
find line find shape
but can only teach
when deuces are wild can follow queen
i'll see i'll call i'll raise
said am not ready
would seem contradict
he took her bathroom
he said do think silences
walking as field went dry
from here look around see
disappear but leave trace
empty
struggling so hard see
see sign
every death an end race
every line place map
every step day week
take this
would he still dream thigh flesh upon high
hidden veils
it's out our hands over our heads
but made imagine what kind dream
by fountains by fishes
by dreams by features by letters
will tell something
were costume
she was 20 years older than
were costume
code will keep privacy
smile no smile
it's what need
something small
i'll make see
what's so small
somewhere room
something's begun war
cause
night goes along
down street into square
but all would have wait
there are days when know why
question footsteps
could make sense do
hear creak
somewhere deep within
cradled once
feel sting
taste this
marble
am falling down stairs
made glass
soap water
straighten all trampled tore
black red red black
wonder if you'll spend night
take what's wrong make go right
solitude stands doorway
turn crowd as they're watching
solitude stands doorway
would have worn silken robes
would have shown secret self
but as live city
reproach daughter's most beautiful face
as promises broken frayed
was name could never pronounce
somewhere their future still yet come
can overthrow fool
bold little bird
first grip spring
dont care tights she says
it's between binding
just did not see price
here's no game those who claim
oh yeah
straight lines
though she still dreams
she has lived before
can see
sit cafe
pretty little flowers
this fine
everyone will know our name
as comes down
until each last one has been kissed
hold him against flame heart
but this time was
know each one by name
queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
he said see now are so very young
he laid his hand then top her head
he said want live as an honest man
while queen went strangeling solitude she preferred
things go up things go down
do sing do cry
spring comes after winter
am singing supper
used see her every day
would flying over this river
love father dearly
next day heard she had taken her horse
he not friend but he
his arm around waist he pulls down him
he's thin man
skim cream
run grace x3
oh mom kids are playing pennies
her bones are twisting dancing
only time will tell
if ask where it's humble map
at counter
coming
other way
an actor
someone watching
her own reflection
will continue
finish up coffee
roots were bound roots were bound
grow beyond
was once
am free now am free
would free then
from point needle
made weak
take dont let go
heard say
heard say
consider widow boys
dog little sense
if tell truth
does weather say
too hot no air
you're new new
rattling chains coming over floor
came out darkness
want rider father
came out darkness
every color would black white
oh they never will have
riches strange new
all us used do
underage cops beat
firemans monument
this end all know innocence lost so long ago woven dreams darkest schemes now takes hold our destiny decades greed plague famine war cant go this anymore living fools chaos will rule this eternal paradise
shadows call while stand tall
beware season lies treason pain
learning lesson
carry through endless nights calling
they say time just might heal wounds love
marching staff hand
as fight stay alive
into reality
enlightened past
empty
empty
so falls night darkest hour seek find all secrets left absence light unbalanced power only then will know
through windows mind
injected infected by venom that's searing skin
twisted wings paranoia
kissing tears form face as
an empty heart soul
leave blind
transcend absence this fantasy
forging sacred thrones void unseen
forging sacred thrones void unseen
life force force under command
twilight cathedrals spread system plague
raise our heads up skies feel essence time changing ways shifting tides waves hear rhyme
could feel sympathy or pain
empty
five align hidden word message locked time find key draws final line between what what should never
here are children sun stars first know understand living by law ages prophets sages forging utopia
101music romeo pinnela miller rullo tyler
hypnotic array lights dragons calling throughout night
born second sight essence burning bright
pale frigid gaze
beauty bliss feel hands hold now
cant fight anymore
disguise insolence
trust lie falsify line truth
darkest grand illusion
tempt sin shadows then begin
empty
empty
chasing morning star wait
chasing morning star wait
hunter
find reason go
pray lost soul
ancient lands lost time
forgotten days rule cities
summon thee from afar
mighty pharaoh lives again
helpless minds dance circles
although scars they do
breath fate surrounds
all love tragedy
tearless stare
it's left chained bound
they've took breath life
left tyranny
voice from past echoes fate tale all things yet come as once was so shall again modern day children sun
oppositions drawing near feeding his fear tasting anguish have power ageless invasion
radical alterations temper
violate witch law merely
inside this shell
life again
deep within tiny box shadowed truth under locks
have sold dont tell soul
got no peace mind now you're going blind
have wondered if can turn back into time
keep calling out
dont know why heart keeps calling
walking dead are
live shadows fears behind smoke mirrors
night falls i've seen 1000 moons rising sky
dont give reasons
lost kingdom
corrupted ways
down his chosen road he rides
sons antioch
noble line he carries
empty
incantations summoned up our creations
watch him jest as bleed
from their fiery thrones screaming
terror breeds breating fire greed
hear cry
lyrics romeo
lyrics romeo miller
strength infinite measure
lyrics romeothe prophet cries
eternal pain leads temptation
dominion strength name
looking up heavens
no one there
close eyes try remember
fade away
love never dies
mirrors curse besets
ring time
lightning flashes across sky
looking back through years gone by
scars will fade but never diestaring down at
501music romeo pinnela miller rullo tyler
seasons ragin sands time will fall
help us find our way
watch raging inferno serpents rip flesh
conquer wicked
take relic from this place
journey through shadows dreams what lies beyond guardians keep
visions dance throughout

penance pain
she's thorns sorrow ripping through head
she's been here before locked behind door
there she stood misery
'waken queen nevermore
seek answersand soon you'll believe
do believealls as twisted as one would perceive
sadness reigns upon us all
please guide all way
visions cant see wind love
air can hurt too
air can hurt too
take minute concentrate
not touching ground at all
she had pleasant elevation
make mistake parking lot
they're never there when need them
they ought more careful
cleaning cleaning brain

there has got way
was once upon place sometimes listen myself
dont know what expect starring into tv set

still got no idea where world they are
spaniards lived gold
they made this little town here
civil war over

bone skin lovers hold hands tossing
his skin same as yours
rusted garden gate can barely even stand
man he made house
are creatures love are creatures love
we've been here forever before were born
two arms two legs
changin shape feel an accident
there was line there was formula
m'm'making list find cost opportunity
facts are getting best them
smell pine trees peaches woods
take highway park come up see
some civil servants are just loved ones
take highway park come up see
real tiny kid
know it's all
you're dream operatorshake up dream
let go life
do know who are
feel meani feel ok
charged upit's pretty intense
judge jury twelve members jury
someone controls electric guitar
making up their own shows which might better than tv
if they ever watch tv again it'd too soon them
so think about this little scene apply life
made work again
no need worry
think can if
somebody calls but cannot hear
she's moving up going right through heart
got girlfriend that's better than
will never uttered by human mouth
something has been changed life
fell all over
happy day
was foolin around but
some density
such happy day
name bar bar called heaven
when this kiss over will start again
buy cherry face now
buy rubber ball now
leave those children alone
hey now

'cause just feels good

'cause you're unsung hero
first it's baseball arcades mall
he aint got clue what he's going through
now there aint no way he can ever go back
come darlin get down off fence
can make list pros cons
love aint followed by question mark
better say good bye before this goes too far
he preaches non conformity
fault law majority
life's not what seems
empty
want right
ask myself
fear man
trapped nightmare
live but what's gain
die slowly everyday
die slowly everyday
rule society
what do need prove
where's democracy
yeah all could bleed
it's own allegiance fight
as man shows his ignorance

dark passages revenge all see
lights sky
meet falling angel his realm

waiting shall see
listen deep inside
victim myself
cant stop seasons
days blue just turn grey
after lifelife after

will wait find out will wait see
written testament old
just careful what wish
why cant yourself
everything turns black

translucent hopes are now
not bitter war
locked darkened world

hail mary full grace
falling from grace
dead

smell death roams
stabbing slashing

joy woe good sin
future screams help
son here wander under infinite skies
world tomorrow
he was raised as an orphan
take heed warning
free us from beds hell
first started thinking was insane
music peterson
call this family
silently screaming
when all love they give misued
listen now sordid tale
pages start bleed
enslave free
read between lies
home sweet home let go world
when it's time operate
within laws
if find life lost
they wait off
dont know if will drown
empty
dreamsof newlies confused
seen through eyes new
live our lives day by day
wanted money wanted fame
so many roads moving all around
going down road account
there must better way
prayers from an open grave
trying believe
music skolnick peterson
or self destruction
escape must occur this night
hounds will not rest
but who's paying them off
take back all we've lost
from youths today now
blind one who censors what see hear
can see what did
no solution will prevail unless can
can see what did
then lose control then lose control
practice what preach
pay burnt bridge toll then lose control
our ship sailed through
fate was second hand
devils sea triangle
he holds seas fate his hand
his armies have killed so many
music peterson
this innocent beauty
i'll return serenity
head's home
wont come
just cant seem get right
raising veins
trapped his kingdom alone
kick back feelings enticed
there no shame
will ever escape
no place go
hesitate waste time
until die cause
raised outside law
that's when thanks army came
out from pain
where hatred grown
truth from lies
burn fields
back time as our history shows
burial human being
burnt remains dead
are safe or just insane
testament peterson skolnick
find meaning existence
didnt mean offend
who are
know where go when
wrong or right
run cannot hide
wanna know
look at lost souls
will slowly die
life goes
arise ten thousand thrones
life darkening sickening
why have forgotten
friend do think ever will
too many times
was born all witches burn
caught burning times
caught burning times
music skolnick peterson
phantom speaks his final note
evil witch black as pitch
we're gonna take back
knew would never die
knew was here stay
flashes day
time has come
preacher speaks prophecy
future cries
skolnick peterson billy
dont disavow his word
year '41
nobody would listen him
catastrophic lessons they shall teach
why they cant see
one who bleeds
say goodbye again friends
it's all so clear now
most obvious places
you're going blind
cant get
world polluted inside
rites night
burning high eclipse sun
three days dakness 2012
blackened skies
dont know think world has gone hell
dont know think world has gone hell
so sick tried why cant live our lives
am onethe chosen son
empty
can never die
more man he
lyrics billy
tears fall from warrior

cold strange tongue she doesnt know
even stars must die
as fight stay within dream

or season inject
friends wont answer phone calls
do prefer possessions
but know cant

anna miranda i've been waiting here
anna miranda yeah it's serious
lay down head
she wants moon stars
why do always wrongly assume
translate book fuses all cook
lightly babe oh fine lights cannot find
across yonder ocean natives are fierce
they worshipped baal they worshipped sun
they said love hate
fauna ought equal flora
she says it's ok
sounds breath what do expect
try best but transgressed
suppose you'd say she made slave
luxury pity babe this wasnt pretty
dont know if was air or breeze hair
she makes wish she takes risk
he descends stairs he doesnt see
or can pay now cold hard cash
then know you'll understand it's blood money
was so pleasant incandescent it's over now
it's wonderful
busdriver busdriver never saw eyes
busdriver busdriver there's noone else but us
woke up this morning
you'll never understand
all gifts come deep swift
when she comes stars explode
she's got head her shoulders
adult logic nearly vanished
but their pill sugar coated
take place behind wheel
going through scene again again
dont forget dont regret
here there's lots method their madness dear
where did they go
where did he go
someone's words reassure
think just need
dont blame any dont blame myself
justine's laced up tight her shoes
marquee says one night at stage
that's bad hit
dust was companion
transform effortlessly
falling
enraptured drifting toothpullers
falling love again
falling feign unconsciousness see if god there
day dead down mexico
venereal monsters stand there velvet
weddings held darkness
got mind an astronaut
are distance clown
can never cut below floor or penetrate ceiling
something eating up our days feel every morning
destination destination
just had smile all things you'll never hear say
though singer long dead his voice goes
cannot lift head
hands full money always wanted have
so get drunk make half second jump
can live king throne tears
untouched now you're handled pawed
they must have known was end
all died inside flood
leaves stranded high dry
powdered gun drifting up inside
take off helment lay down cable
forget memories dear was ever here
see angry sea it's sign
battle clad byzantium commands
memories serpents drain
head shoulders feel all right
seven long days but cant change ways
from year without rain
dead things road as their insides explode
falling from height
bite then caress
turn tears eyes
ever upwards now curves away
her acquiescence everything
metaphor goddess
sets props this apartment
why should try
but know who's there behind those eyes
only just rain makes skin feel colder
call her name but she never ever hears
want touch
when you're running low fuel
but if ever was same
searched him nightmares
florian trout was brilliant mind gruesome precision
empty
fly home
reminds future's past
all dark clowns who are following
icy hands
such strange things sayin empty place dress our wounds
taken under hand
evolution decay
when think about sister need panic here
help decipher shadow this maze
you're gonna freeze until burns
are seething
frozen distant release cold ice cannot see
they built pyramids toiled tons stone
scaled walls china against all human odds
hear them whisper hear them speak seems they found what still seek
you're so easy love
as broken soul below always wanna living glow
you're so lovely just touch
beautiful as hell
you're so easy love
everything's alright
everybody knows how you've been synching sinking
an automatic charge mind
they've got grind grind out
cactus sure tastes strangely sweet
say can reconciled
empty
gonna catch scent
hotel rooms chains
when girl gets too near
notice love has gone
branching off road winds east
broken voices nylon choir
no need any speed or rush
magnetic disturbance distorting meters unendurable silence sucked into phase
bursting temples as brings jungles breeds doctors nobody knew
heights above an almost perfect view
shrug shoulders they disappear
as you're crying softly wont ever disturbed
celebrations fading boats upon waves
ah know did just
gathering speed
herod nods beneath palms
deserts where dust storm blows
calls out lord end nigh
what can say understand
so think it's sin bet it's miracle
leaving by window or door
laughing at every day
third thing water fourth thing air
can leave body know technique
throbs hell some divine comedy
now i've lost touch
caught mesh pressure
now i've lost mind
dont owe anything
please dont touch anything ah
even air once free
it's over finito benito
because we're lost because we're lost
now hang up 'cause lines are all crossed
empty birdcage her room
never anybody causing no regret
waiting music begin
dont suppose they're too keen
follow her down louisiana
danger
pieced together clue by clue just what faceless man would do
next morning came as mornings do had shave was close too
share bear message newborn son
asttrologers all plot charts
anyone who was hanging around
strike while irony hot
let's get
something more style
ride old horse through goldrush town
will drink forget if have brain will
that's what they want that's what they want hear
sit stare into night contemplate forever
singing 'bout old times sepia faded
magician among spirits said how much miss her
deserted landscape slips away forgotten secret purpose
from where earth do look out into outer space
oh no no dont wander off set
all stories passing through already been told
last year today seemed long way away
calm
so involved everything do
back metropolis circuses elephants
could sleep along way
all songs are coming true
there some string attached this
hundreds chances blew every one
had an idea wont have again
when news sinks holding our skin
dont ask if ready
it's no ordinary problem
remember this day
dressed beloved's finest things
heard top guy wont answer his phone
deep dream hear say
slipstream pull federal men
need microphones manifolds
struggling fool junk jewels
let her go into night
she tells story back she said i'll live this chapter
empty
no certainty attached
better break up
pull sheets around throat
standing keys door
almost could very own
it's neither here nor there it's neither here nor there
face today just scalpel away
disrupt this transmission
canopy snaps engine gone
wreckage from another crash
now wonder why thought could ever lose
knew could lost
so beware an old flame still burning there
dipping into gilt edged love will made at last
holy wars extended battlefields pain
less does
get little strength out too or meekness
as man who held answers
there was only
takes whole damn ship wrong direction
should have stopped this long ago
but was long ago chorus
tried overcome threat monster
one side mind resides controller
what are using that's stronger than love
empty
dont feed fire here
cant believe what believe
fire's singing everywhere
you're riddle you're ripple
we're still search petty scorn
sorry desdemona bright
we'll show something understand
'til have something understand
they took away his language then his memory
empty
trillion pennies handful dust
delicate glass kisses delicate lips
who are doing all they can
gluttunous wind keeps nibbling sails
she offered her chaos
you've got lot nerve
clutched at someone dark again
they dont know what's wrong she never said
no repairs are needed just spark
how deep deep inside surging red rider
stranger than fiction ear
then discarddiscarddiscard
oh helpless birdlings nobody wants
take back take bone
take back take all night long
never meant fade
will come take place
otherwise never care
otherwise would have dared
i'll show how ancients once traveled
she had unearthly eyes
put exploratory probe right into brain
some would say bathed harpoon
hooked yeah texas moon
exit will most inopportune
once had name forgotten now
crystal skulls screaming gulls
autumn he comes this town
his skin looks he slept
winter he cracks summer he warps
isnt or he
gets himself off headlines
reality all pervading
his hands under table
story really unfurls
look through eyes you've grown used
if only had been there
weddings frozen melted grooms
day they turned off great machine
there goes maven sowing his seed
he bought us dinner so what fucking heck yeah
chorussurrender smiles epiphanies
alone this room moon sea
myths made
here's all things didnt say
myths made
their teeth are bared their claws outstretched
washing away statues sharon stone
oh want life
knew you'd find drinking
he had room best part town
couldnt really say he seemed care
knew happy man who made feel sad
this
sun never comes
random choices will they ever learn
but they never can caught
hoped you'd realized
gotta get deep
empty
carries aloft you're getting soft
heard about maria she hated rat race
under shifting dimensions horizon returns
following nebula
here now here now
man carrying brow
echo another time an age beauty
imagine feeling before last jump
travel by thought
travel by thought
was working an orchard grew strangest fruit
hotel suite rich mans town hut botany bay
what else did give
right speaker
wrapped arms night
just beyond door
trinkets sing desert wind behind here
they say it's static electricity but
but out twisted metal discarded fortune's curse
think about loveless fascination
something that's shimmering white
dont want know
borrowed grapes from stores gold
easy burn
hope it's message from someone obscure
it's just joke
both know why you're here
deep room which i've never seen
another so easily sleep
who's one vulture's shoulder
who's one modified cortex
howling growling they want blood
callous future nervousness soon
got off light
but you're just too civilized fight
must have put horse before cart
took rest day
it's shame it's not game
turned up backstage at palace
at least it's artistic guess
gonna stitch up when come unsewn
sitting
tap drips
used feed fire
yeah all things ever dreamed used feed fire
keep fire ablaze
see into trees
dark
girl was never there
make believe never needed
at least i'd lose this sense sensing something else
throwing arms round
thought were girl always dreamed about
empty
can really do
as walk away
goes deep
want change
white sound
jump jump dance sing
short term effect
might see blind man kissing hands
empty
strange day
strange day
side by side
empty
begging crush
tonight feeling an animal
tonight losing control
just other side door
want this last thing do
there's no more room inside
no this not about running out
all dreams came true
there always
never wanted know
tell all
empty
but she wont understand at all
but she wont sympathize at all
used so close together
prays hear him say
feel chill ice
unaware changes at night
would make faster
bananafish bones
dont think
anything but stay
but holding onto used
all tears cry
just say goodbye
say i've changed
will never forget
were so love
up next silver sand
but winter moon silver sand
held deep inside
feel feel desire
wild wild wild
try talk
this dream never ends said
this night never falls again
these flowers will always fade
between
never fade
been too unkind
plead
would tell
now would do most anything
yes i'd see her when day got colder
but never even caught her name
remember she used fall down lot
never thought this day would end
but if had faith
but if had face
fill heart love
blue suzannes all round
you're such wonderful person living fabulous life
canary feather dress
club america tonight
name
everything as cold as life
way do
when look at
if only you'd never pull from
look at way once did
mouth eyes heart all bleed run
leave babies hoping frequency
again making up behind back again
everyone dropping through sky through
stains carpet stains memory
it's perfect day making out
it's never too late
let's get happy
kick out blues
kiss all goodbye
but it's much late say
tear out pages all bad news
stop flight fight
screaming
body falls
kiss eyes
knowing i'll murder again
dressing up kiss
losing hold
rape child
empty
nothing left
just pull pout let's move beat
sometimes there's nothing hold
just push until breaks
fight til drop
dont have give
lonely place
burn fire cairo
empty
empty
burn fire
it's friday love
or thursday watch walls instead
as sleek as shriek
fall her
from edge deep green sea
colourfully see through head before
not just today
too many tears
feel pulling back
too many times
away from home again
groovy purple shirt
as you're choking
hands are cold
everything could wrong
sick as dog six times as mean
have get up get out get gone
who what where when or why
yeah this really
empty
no people

hey hey hey
dreamed dream
three them were dressed rags
filled heart shame us
fathers eyes said beautiful
or loves another
no dont say more
dont know what's going
delicious
so soft
if only tonight could fall
rain would cry
go so slow
made want cry
couldnt her
come back today
wear smile
want somebody new
if had alibi
it's not
if walk crowd
if pick up quick
but half time
this how happens this how feels
incoming comet brushes jupiter's face
just few bruises region splash
i'll run away
soft only
moving lips breathe her name
empty
somebody died this
just one kiss
dead
absolutely nothing
reflected eyes
lying floor night before
if only here where go
tells how feels new
so say it's same house nothing house has changed
say it's same it's always been this
stars are black night gone
it's not same
this isnt how it's always been
waving last vanilla smile
so glad came so glad
so glad came so glad
remembered see how we're ending our last
doo doo doo doo
but it's just same
remember from december
wont say
doo doo doo doo
at corner
there are thousand things he said
cant find myself
stare
cant find myself
letting go time
soul this stranger love
dont know where am
am home again whenever alone
am free again whenever alone
searching out fear gathering gloom
boy dont struggle or will only love
twist turn
escape someday
if cant before i've got let end
know maybe someday's come
know maybe someday's come
went into butchers
he really stole heart
empty
almost cant believe it's real
do again
really didnt think could
do all time
she trying one
never see signs
want so much have this hold each other tight
will never one her
hopelessly helplessly broken apart
he's love drug
it's all too wrong make right
just keeps loving drug
wont listen lies
just dont care
but dont try hold
you're just an object
something better
sharing world slaughtered pigs
turn round
under black flag
over over
hundred years
hold
just one more time
while just say hello
but air getting heavier it's closer
take knees
i've got hands brain
here go again
keep pouring down
losing breath
oh feel so tired
pounding broken head
another festive compromise
you're always wrong
where belong
want feel another time
always have go back real lives
i've been looking so long at these pictures
brigther than snow
last time then slip away quietly open
there was nothing world ever
flowers mouth same dry
old forgotten dance
footsteps wire
wind blowing it's end
edge world living at edge
plastic passion diamond delight
plastic passion murdering
dont understand
something happen
life spills into flowers
books
real blood
drab hours all spent killing time
slowly dreaming
thought song
thirteen years
still dream
mouth knows
i've got too big fit this time
it's really not just
but still not sure what's going
sure i've already gone
waiting knees
really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss
imitation smiles how it's wonderful here
when screw up eyes
when throw out arms
empty
remember
girl
make up new blood
hold cherished dead electric light
shake dog shake
shake shake
wake up wake up wake up
you're just babbling face
want smash helpless
flesh blood first kiss
walls ceiling move time
morning cried
fades spins
am sinking
if only could remember
think hands head
cake icing decorating set
nobody's taken place
if knew
this offer closes
yes we'd still happy another time
how can say all things
cut words
six months went by summer lost
never know how anything will fade
nervous smile
strange attraction spreads it's wings
faded red inside tiny book old goodbyes
but she feels she's not alone
from square one start
tomorrow i'll begin again
empty
same as did yesterday
empty
yeah feel good
do do do
am seducing or being seduced
feels good
into ground fills up dreams
waiting again
empty
can never stop
can never stop
oh never never go
mesmerized
empty
dont do dont do
pushed our mouths
across water
she tries turn
fleeting shapes
breathing drowning man
she talked about armies
it's not call
couldnt love
couldnt ever love more
ooo eee ooo ooo eee ooo
couldnt love more
spiders inside them
mean nothing
someone will listen
despair time
will never clean again
performed story
turned away
no one sleeps
into walls
change past
hanging garden
slip away
cry out
love love love
never wanted any this
used so easy
all wrong
last day summer
his thoughts echo round
side by side silence
way kiss
all these years no one heard
sleep awhile
love let's go
you're such strange girl
think falling
love will save us all
love will save
another way
trying forget
waited waited waited
dissapear ripples clear laughing break
forever nights this will kiss will
writhing
writhing snakepit
this top place
please come back
turn off lights crawl into bed
so alcoholic slow
can go up there summer
stood outside door
made dry lips sing
saw look
if die said so do said
was warm safe our perfect world
if die said so do said
why each us must choose
but this isnt truth this isnt right
way are
this isnt truth this isnt right
can help
slipping through door
hold so tightly
see cracked reflection
remember how used
was sweetness skin
gone away
skin so tight screams
body cut wide open
hanging this hanging back
drone about being brink
sweet revenge things i've done
just wait fall at feet
so why cant just let go
but not tears
remember loved only
leave all were
pushing face memory again
again
dont want anywhere near
live knowledge real truth
get fucking head out world
dying man
through twisting hands choking air
or ever feel enough today

someone will fix broken bones
what about
without any training
burn bridge
lifetime laughter
intentions conventions

days have been numbered
they werent there at all
none are isolated
our only weapon song
we're trying love unity too
but we'll have fun that's sure
she stops rain she calms storm
dont know where she finds strength
i've seen her world before eyes
i'd still say
you'd forced remember
but wish had stayed
while sure just pretend
i've got i've got
well he was fueled by lack
rascal king behind bars
last hurrah
well part's never clear
stabs dagger make stagger
or what has store
spikes gonna strike weak strong alike
original song by bob marley

mindless endless nights days
looking back now not sure how
hey where hell did they get this panel
if we'd turn off tv set turn off now
we've lost now man that's sure
if seems pathetic pardon
what was was over should just get over
'cause what was was over now know
what was now was
dont know what you're doin so you're lying there so helplessly
now triy know can take
wonderin where did go
stared at tv an hour
emptiness began grow
sat couch drank slow
dont ask reason cant explain
when action intention
forever we've been
will mend themselves again
cant go cant escape
either way cant escape
cause sick not living
feel lie
that's all want
but no one makes sound
then i'd really amazed
where strip malls abound diversions mere moments away
want right now cause generation dont wait
environment
yeah it's all coming true
gonna wreck this fucker's ride
but when show piece
well that's alright that's ok
now watching baby's jugular blow
now craving yours
blade falls gonna need casket
those us who win game give up our minds
it's time close door
when are standing precipice
see nothing
what kind tradition carry
think i'll take little ride
yeah pyro
so many reasons not crime
you're yourself
ones call friends
you're ready
ike spreading disease
hey man disrespecting
goes down same as thousand before
hey come out play
if you're under 18 wont doing any time
but as long as you're swinging
fake you're ok
pain inside can guide way
may stinging
moving their own
hate lot things
hate quad
liking something's just waste time
it's easier way
i'll cut down cause fool
now may wonder
crossroads lead away
will not enough when all those
past away
but that's not what worries
cant defend
cant stand feel this way
centuries pain
our demons debauchery
i've loved before other lives
are offering
there she goes
can go
wont let go
if i'd just hold
how did know
you're so tragic
all just seems such waste
unless can throw away
dont pick up say
not clearly male nor female
but now we're growing up

man i've tried
things have been done
if you've got answer
would patient but takes so long
if you've got notion
get by
bet you'd only run
but i'll look out window
there's got better way
cant deal it's so unfair
but black roses hail mary's
yeah stings now
over shoulder big mistake
head loose but shoes are tight
there was leash around neck pulled through
have ever buried face hands
have ever
when truth walks away
who gonna stay
when you're feeling low
run away
but words mean nothing
this life
there's dozens reasons explaining soul
or playground if choose
stand right by
so thought
beer their minds smoke air
cause when we're together just cant get enough
love life
once saw dream had chase
egos will feed
heard all before
gets through
world's busy place
say happens all time
seen all before
but wont leave alone
kick him when he's down
awake dream get up go work
said before
government
but you're squeezed
stop man power
an angry world
but we'll never see
hard as rock
but la story's gone way out hand
we're lapd
but not buying because billy club aint much pacifier
all rage eats up inside
dont know if can forgive
get no ones gonna free
lay bed all day
when she says she loves
know dont mind bit
luckiest man alive
been far wide
seems such blur
getting way home
watching reruns tv
empty
memory's gone so life life
yeah losing out might feel okay all life
there's no tomorrow aint gonna live
there's no tomorrow aint gonna live
burned at stake
save now dont say sake
this room's cage
now you're gone
wonder why did even try
little things little lives hanging 'til end
but now deal all consequences troubles our times
we're innocent
even if try not become so overwhelmed
gonna break
broken windows cure ills make feel alright
when we're chillin pound case stroh's
that's one fine day
cause never gets dull never gets old
time time
freud freud
break out yeah original yeah
style aplomb
when joke's yeah
hear mine clicks beneath feet
but as enemy appears
our souls
our souls
look at struggle freedom
shut up talk too much
so dont debate player straight
but they didnt have ice cube
but his own mind
so let's get some more wannabe's
know she's playing
well guess should stick up myself
may dumb
back her bed another goddamn session
aint no strings
dont mean insensitive but really hate shit
gonna pay
told hundred times how father left he's gone
then why do follow around
built up man so bad can taste
dont give fuck if it's good enough
look at crowd tell whether
melt minds
empty promise all you'll find
give something
let will think
voices told
i'd still away you're right front

there's no connection myself
emptiness loneliness loneliness cleanliness
she's all really need
mr sun wont shine

everything seems feel just right
'cause i've got some living inside
will never suffer
then looking
was born rented room
no time old fashioned potion
speakers are telling truth
too busy staying alive
she hasnt heard word have said
an epitaph defaced
all wild eyes know what mean
all wild eyes
hello high are yes
now drowning dark
i'd believe school social banging
searched world reluctant
taste perfume burns throat
know which one gonna end upon
smile hand mix water sand dont know
try make ends meet
from one day next
but here mold
try find some money then die
cant change mold
ever been down
till met blue
blue i've got question every time hold
dont let them destroy
can see you've choked them too
his heart's right place
when was fighting tears
cruising nemesis high seas
bully enjoying his vacation
empty
cause you're mine
i'd still feel way
happens all time
empty
empty
want feel
keep catching butterfly
see through
eyes
round round settle down settle down
if you're gonna make break break clean
justify all by seeing her moderation
there will no encore
but wouldnt pantomime
we'll live drama but we'll die comedy
this not cup tea
empty
but when lover cries feel his tears
was gonna drive home
angel lover angel
alone will sleeping through afternoon
felt something strange
through those dim lights
endless life
women i've created
swear you'll overcome
see dead floor
wanna know
can
escape thrill ride friends they agree temporary guardians
those who can relate 2 months day wakeup
we'll blister
love pathway
but gotta move
if cry little
get back get back again again
world just spins whilst mine stands still
but want life
whatever want
come
your's still spins
but gotta go
i've been here since can remember when
nothing's changed gravity grave
so bright burns eyes
i'd tell every day's birthday every gift bring could same
write note remind would if had half mind how effortless stay together
wanna find
so happiness
but happiness
they end up more than their next door neighbor
not who thought but can kiss good night
loved fame fashion till she said better ration good times
just jerk but hero's what wanna yeah oh yeah
erase this disaster even faster than came see
living other men
every sky above head
every man every hand
when you're thinking about things do
let's pick up let's even try
who will one
not trying scientific
who leaves as tomorrow's dawning
i'll keep calling
whisper words into ears
rain bright sunshine
when look way
anytime any place
then lost her underneath april showers
saturday never knew
worth wait forever
open faces open mouths
keeping grateful deadheads relling
lost message this yelling
kiss without make up leave no marks upon chest
cant afford stubborn sleep photographs birthdays past
so here go
face crowd
can painful know
yeah shakin
she made feel proud was thankful
sure i've seen before
cant seem get out life
eyes tell have what wanted haunted as hold
you've got all loving tangle could never undo
woke up scream

that'll never change
that'll never change
got place crash after bash
empty
empty
but how many corners do have turn
empty
gotta love that'll never die
oh

but from this bed it's different than seems
could no longer hear hear

well might how fight till shattered
well might how fight till shattered
or may how play till shattered
dont need another you'll always own hero
she say okay so okay

he was restless
having around
will never let down
will never let down
when there's nobody listening
knee deep river flow
never word intention
should half mile from here
an ominous man
was dream
come own
who can fill hole
leave own
empty
one day maybe will see land
you've gotta tie yourself mast friend
one day maybe will dance again
cant see ground
dont care what find
than see try
dont care what find
one way go
all words evaporated
can let lot things say go
every word so intimidating
would help cause need
been frightened by stompin
rewrite book revelations
it's all courage can swallow
advantage only masterpiece
blind labors blind am unwilling uncover eyes
swallow this scene fire
an ornament everyone
mary her little lamb slips away catches sister getting real
are today
3 am cellophane
year dissipating
eyes they open wide
senator speak mind if smoke filled room
well deficit yourself right down front
dropping by open window as breeze blows curtains are butterflies
wondering if think it's sky
touch down heated land
disappearing from rants
she climbed so high
got hand
her own
sleep sleep all sleepy town
but just today
something not sure
slide away burn away
this life
come own this life
come into this life own
friend
nature has its way warning
dreaming about day when can see there
by now
keep pushin 'cause know it's there
oh no no
oh can comfort
oh no no
have existense it's all share
as proudly hail our taxis out fight
know an old lady who swallowed fly
hello it's crying out crying out
while were making history
blues player going another town
was funny once it's not so anymore
right before break up turn around make up
now she's television
turn up
now drugs dont work
'cause baby ooh if heaven calls coming too
just said leave life better off dead
never going down never coming down
wrote song moving praying can do same
when was young knew everything
life cannot believe we'd ever die these sins
she fell love lover boy
thought should say
from long way bring back girl he once knew
without sail without will
listened her song
can see wasting away
so come alive rolling poeple
so come alive rolling people
but here are rolling people
she calls calls sun sea yeah
then got brought back
over town was found
sitting at home bed too long
we've got lot living do
loved by
this time this time
gonna rise straight through light
or out time
there time
this time this time
was something good
only meaning scratch surface
it's not pretty underneath
it's been long
another velvet morning
it's lonely
into half light
he said dont find
all along adopt highway lay empty cans masquerade
at 85 31 flying
empty
victoria she loves her name
every major magazine
see how they twist shout
no one knows name
have ever seen
dirty half light where
radio great video
simple lyrics will do
or maybe third
hide our eyes our love's aching
hope see what see
there'll no better day save
beside
beside
ugly getting over
7000 weathered faces
that's growing wild
when said
when he said
you're wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
we've come this far worst case scenario
you're wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
acting as slave drink an open grave
acting as slave drink while she forgave
if dont dare will not try
best lines they'd flow right off tongue
souvenirs very first time
spoke barely if at all
'cause it's bittersweet symphony this life
but million different people
cant change cant change
trying make ends meet
from one day next
been down
when was fighting tears
cruising nemesis high seas
bully enjoying his vacation
waving rode parade awhile
ride wave along mitigated mile
can see tables turning
empty
watch their backs as they leave single file
through haze memory well
ground's little weathered where stood
nailing leaves ground
watching them sorting debris
should drive wild
all biggest plays missed
awoke threat was empty grandstand not through yet
hello we're so out here hitchhike canada backpacks full cigarettes beer
round mess man you've uncovered
love leads loss
has died little
but look what did
would same old stories but you're hanging onto every single word have say
these ties may have severed now you'll stay forever
not waiting friend beside
just find out
wanna find
dont know how get so out touch
though prefer red they tasted all right
turned out all was just medium
all eyes upon some filled tears some couldnt see
burned cancer
leave now amidst adoring light
who will one
are alright
from feet up mouth
will think
i'll waiting here
when see smile
i'll here
am love
hey would mind standing
but awhile i'll surely keep number
does make any easier
record sales are healing
busting charts atop they're dwelling
hardened petals bang dresser when they fall away
kiss idle
from moment give out begin live out
though wont surrender want remember
that'll never change
yeah it's good guaranteed
all kids sing boy dont what became
takes from air breathe breathe
deceiving relentlessly
you're not martyr material
dont believe suffer
i've got medicate myself again
down hole where belong
so you'll settle down
would let down
so beneath underneath am right here
her everyone everything everything mine
we're very fortunate have her here
but if they play emotions
you're not only one
but that's way goes
eyes straight front line
can take an oceanside
but i'll tell what gonna do
court deemed offensive
through evidence circumstance
i'll never make mention if say so
all words evaporated
could never let another day go
power persuade
philistines toss tangerines
been frightened by stompin
but expecting follow
penny poison but dont mind
if there's crease face over time there's plenty more where came from
impressing what i've done
swallow this scene there laughter
when were real were love
are crusade
4 am
never mind thunder
off distance runner uplift
she has faces up her bedroom they gaze down her guarding her slumber
dresser top jewelry box colored tassels tied knots
picture taken twenty years ago she keeps her portfolio
evidence sits vcr
now only night lights flickering
as proudly hail our taxis out fight
know an old lady who swallowed fly
all desire sweep stage fliers
there's not missing link no matter what think
once bane perversion
volume knob controls scream
shake head leisure get head body into seizure
stop baby's breath shoe full rice
his girl took week's worth valium slept
while others roamed
lonely blue lonely
listened her song
i'd leave untattered untouched until
that's when river ran dry
fight little purpose
only meaning scratch surface
thirteen miles 31 are drying
lovely gentlemen
then drowned her indifference
cut cord which life depends
another villain cover
see how they twist shout
all love millionaire
what said about audience
now should repeat second verse
through remains have been sorting
you're gorgeous running out
sleeping seems greatest medication
got home field advantage all can manage
you're wonderful waste time
you're wonderful waste time
you're wonderful waste time

there's was texaco waitin at bottom hill
he stood there lost her eyes
wonders about her hollywood dreams
bought coke some gasoline
she had suntan line red lipstick
said only every other memory
never fades away
or shakin or chokin ol truck
cause just layin'round hopin
comin eye eye
get this feelin losing
just know what's every mans mind
even though know love baby
aint nobody gonna take girl from
show there's something more
show there's something more
take away from here
she thinks so strong
if she could see cry
tips from rich kids there daddy's dime
confessing all our secrets laughing out loud
ended just movie scene
her eyes world came so alive
only way know
when hard day over how love just going home
but that's just
place where can lay low
place where can lay low
learn live love
she was reading book she'd already read
songs they once sang
before they drifted apart
all love they have lost
but million tears million beers have just about washed up
spread myself so thin just barely hangin
well climbed up front seat he turned radio
well he cried just south nashville he turned car around
but trouble never never never works
i'll never say do or step foot church
they wouldnt let him play opry
way he shook his hips
they might've got little crazy
it's always been same
clock above bar
clock keep running
suppose should cut all losses
but it's ticking away
now she's always tiny dancer hand
lying here no one near
now she's always tiny dancer hand
i'll take last train can find just case want change mind
hardwood floors
it's happy hour when get there
someone hold when music starts
never got lost spent years dark
no one ever left out rain
never got lost spent years dark
never got lost spent years dark
swore he was quittin
walk man

through sand
doing nothing all way
girl know told not so long ago
all wanna see go forever

it's addict trying turn his life around
when our lives come undone
how she slipped right through hands
while looked other way
memory we're tryin kill
welcome club
what good time must have been
what room was holiday
guess she took granted
it's what she left behind
it's what she left behind
every time think what i've left behind
when she reads note things couldnt say
they disappear left right again
plan our dreams where peaceful river flows
watch corn pop up rows
that's difference between whiskey
one's long hard bitter truth
democrat republican
who are they
they say who's right who wrong
well wonder if they've got life
yeah know what they say
way sunlight dance upon face
up down this boardwalk lonely people sit
know just cant let us go
without
maybe all we'll ever have
tender touch puts smile back face
well could close eyes run through this house
starin at bug wall
well she took everything but kitchen sink
oh there's nothing true love
before right there minute

who am judge or strike down
im shoving
feel alive when touch
while were begging stay
staring down hole again
who am judge strike down
slipping back into gap again
as were begging stay
terrified what may come
let may find peace within emptiness
without her are lifeless satellites drifting
so let light touch so words spill through
where there's one you're bound divide
they forge blade
how they survive so misguided mystery
angels sideline again
wide open
empty
dead head chemistry
they chose
this so real
was repeat experience
see they took by hand invited right
overwhelmed as one would placed position
sunkist sudafed gyroscopes infrared

through midwinter clearing
echoes sound wonder
whole world

chemical god give
he grieves upon his holy throne
think about soul instead
between years 1861 1865
because he who first loved us
how can this massive creature
so great his love us
think it's alright destroy god's creation
when god says man give account life's work
think feathers what they got
he walked earth
when look back life
without draggin all baggage
ways
work church there's something should know
remove this gorefest why should matter
dont belong here anyway
now history meets
open wounds are food them
are by side
no not alone
unbridled hostility
by simply opening box
why'd ever call brother
its wieght stone
3 7 9 10 12 14 feet
12 more days foothold was merciless
think we're half asleep
just them we've been conditioned
flipper laughed danced please avoid electrocution
truth never seek
greet brothers kiss
or accomplish impossible an herculean feat
lairs demons where deceptions are told
clear cutting clear conscience
empty
empty
oh how wish could see one fly
deliver thieves murderers
soul means nothing pain even less
life pleasure torture murder
heart turned stone suffering all alone
world closing
now you've come realize
guess what you're there
three foot river drop
tragic death scene
today child
can down biggest tree
razor shant come near braids hair
ocular gouging death end
enveloped python
enveloped python
spirit's willing flesh weak
expunge at will matters whether gods exist love proficient
freedom freedom freedom
waiting fear
shadrack kenya
funerals delayed
though may not understand
creach modification
god knows our hearts are weak
before they can win wedding begins
free from sin
bringing life death transporting friend foe
pagan land nineveh self righteous over confidence
see happening right front
he heavens jewel
he made deaf hear again
see happening right front
cause did nothin today
reality suspended
solo aaron
fervid vocility have perused
but this call mind therefore
still reflection stares at
without this shadow life would shine
drop platform brings an end crimes
an alibi what need
indulgence by proxy broken rope seven
holy tongue fire commandments were cast
then only then can truly free
what good will man if he gains whole world yet forfeits his
as scaled wings erupt brilliant colors spectrum's view
from world's first dividing cell loneliest quarters hell
flesh blood though are not
promise will do best
nigh does master
iguanidae sees east west simultaneously
spiritual migraines still persist
sleight hand slight mind
our judgement mind polluted
too white too foreign too smart too boring
imparts those he calls his own
pain beyond compare
spiritual death kicks off its swan song
subdural detour shuns embrace logic reason
blind cavefish inbred victim ocular atrophy
avoiding vital confession
'he's coming back' isnt forever
it's about time put away finger
out anguish quiet voice mesmerizing
when sorrow has it's grip
three feet more
god's got funny sense humor
when put away bitterness
burn twice
inability within
boasting set adrift
christ alone completed
lifes only what see
there was rich ruler
if walk light
was there
worried smiles across room
man who gazed into mirror
just down foe cant understand coward giving
or maybe dont never knew
so go ahead friend open up door
eradicate disease pedestal stood
pseudo scientist watches fascination
aint meant happen our own
at 3 pm all falls flat
point out others' sins overt
swarms kill men
swarms bless them
from highest clan
by words you'll try
given over deeds infamy skeezix took his toll
child whose humble prayer set battle ages
home gaunt haggard shell skeezix
arboreal king misery woe
advance 109
when painful eyes begin cringe
but unnerving sound beneath floor boards
admit deed
seven days
thru ritual atonement
let him heal let him
watch out
have made up mind
live sin
weight guilt carry
where myriad wonders once repelled onslaught decay
will dethroned from heaven barred
prove fath god
lord gave
stomach caving
but why have forsaken
plotted constellations
know many verses have studied many years
if people tell horse better saddle up
humble side doesnt lie
each day new sorrow brings
say just dont really care
lived mr houdini
feeling gone then our soul will pawn
feeling gone then our soul will pawn
equally jests there are matters which no jest can
young child drowning sea pain
whom human bond callous family ignores
if must compound joy
enjoy all he gives
where moth rust destroy
light sacrificial fire
will impress ever loving god
god grades curve
that's what it's there
all sudden
get what pray
i've seen at shows
moment begin think

dont want one
can speak thousand words
there's no turning back
dont wanna one

music ear

believe set free
can go there too
ringing this land
can go go go go
day without
wipe their eyes then let go
fly
empty
want truth but need lies
room at heart
gospel voices
through sleet driving snow
i'll there
as valley explode
i'll there tonighti believe
she will die live again
dont believe what hear
or can spit
if only knew who hit
must an acrobat
talk this
can stash
there's too much confusion here
but we've been through
truth
because hour getting late
when she done
empty
soul lovethis love wont let go
blinded lost way
wake up
when night turns day
children come out play
open space bed
but she ran morning sun
another time another place
lie
babyface babyface
under control go
do do do do do do do do dodo do
hou could beauty so kind
lifeless lifeline wind
see break break away
not sleeping
this desperation
let go

wonder who became

would take one towards make up
there someone you'd turn as soon as left
empty
from baton rouge bangor maine
our heart's will now beat as one
have even dried
what's man do
except here at home
note table told goodbye
just rain tears keep falling
but sight vision
can bring such joy can bring pain
you'll find out it's true baby someday when love finds
get weak knees lose breath
whole world turns upside down
standing at crossroads just one concern

long always
i'll right where belong
just
there's nothing quite as lonely
all those yesterdaysyou cant understand feeling
if have wait forever that's all right
empty
know aint none business
better think twice before give heart away
better think twice
mercury god
if passion denies dont die knees
symphony steele
where are hell hunting killing again holy tomorrow see where
they're through there'll no warning skies are alive whisper
know they're through we're pounding valley skies are aflame whisper
cold understand blood fear still walk land
flaming power death his wake
beast unveiled this unholy light
fire dances air
our lord lords holy king kings
music lyrics by david defeis
no sleep no dreams only fear descends upon couch ravages
shining day
yet if this house could speak what tale could tell
gold silver shed light that's blinding hot cold
who'll take reins when miracle dies
one ring rule darkness bind them all
gluttinous sin face so sublime
no more days no more nights
tired eyes
darling dont delay
one child born
one child born
eyes fire lips scarlet flame
taste heaven skin
music lyrics by david defeis
gods dead bring life back again
fallin callin
empty
open eyes see running faster running far
before darkness eats soul
body soul are reconciled
no longer denied eve as bride doors
dampness gloom
pride was sin

shoot into veins
after face beauty
season pain
were makin love someone else
burn take path through fading light
earth earth
stand fight people home land fighting our legacy
can really forget
still love youi made clear need here
there's danger charging air tonight
dont say goodbye need staylost gone an instant
endyamon wrapped holy mists time emalaith blood yours
once was hidden now raised
empty
will return wreak vengeance
child desolation cry under stars have died
created light
promise peace never
fight fight tooth nail
teeth can rip two
slash tear
once more into cobra's nest
how spear faction blazed
by strength herakles arms
distance black rivers flow
you're never forgiven destiny's earned
if terror scheming freedom burned
flames black star shine soul
silent drifter highway side
calling pleading
so let's go all way
empty
great sword flame sky
great sword flame split night
great sword flame rip night
there's thousand eyes upon
if cross gates wisdom
war rains through skies
gonna get anyhow
dont think it's time stop
music de feis lyrics de feis
heaven will not receive
let know where find
best believe
under desert desert moons
when see coming
oh poor soul
are old enough love child
child warm soul
thorn side
bringing laughter disguise
do think want fuck
spitting right into eyes
will come
murder torture they rape they slaughter
under stars have died
hot ready
hear call wild
you're mealyeah phantom delight
oh no cant
lashed by winds fate stung by gods hate rising power
godhead die fall sword fall knees die son
lashed by winds fate stung by gods hate rising power
empty
empty
keep'em from this voodoo man
runnin from wreckage
watch venom drip
world will end
kingdom fearless kingdom gods
light up sky burning world as
cry blood burns black fury
kingdom fearless kingdom gods
father forgive thcm they know not what they are doing
last supper it's last supper
law reveals itself shining sun
maching distant shores
power call arms
freedom alive now
snap noose crack whip
communion blood so bitter cup
sycthe hand he reaches harvest last remains
winners losers
keep running till day die
we're headed life crime
chain earth chain sun
run proud run free
trees are frozen gold
seven deadly sins
wander darkness
will heaven let
anything left say
so cry
are shadows others i've known
lay down rapture
bitterness
ooh yeah ooh yeah
used nice but times got tough dont know
are now waiting skies warring angels forage scavengers pain am
inside mind body spirit all are one
blind morning two will remain carry us onward guard
fire eyes
one more time
count miles child
just died today
noble savage
fought deceivers
here
ooh we've lost our way
raving dog howl whine more
dance knife might just take lifechorus
faster than shadows
ride wings night
but they dont know what does
music lyrics de feis
will stay tonight perfect mansions
tell her her name was lips when died
now ride silver horses night
watch die am god man
ten thousand years or more torment pain
immortal die immortal die i'll not give up man
if fortune war guarantees will crowd
beware thy queen black stars fall voices rising time were gone
black cloak evil net damned
twilight kiss upon frozen brow
while time comes an end
dont cry mercy `cause know there will none
know wanna scream
tonight yours
gonna love better
hands are icy cold
child who lies win
son takes sins sins can cleansed
serpent cain
sons pain agonize bring forth then die
bastards forsaken cast from his grace
cast down wrath cast down flame olympian might
cast away virtue it's not what seems
rock roller leather vixen talk
seventeen age consent
if had possession
spirit ice until evening comes
brighter than day yeah
get inside get inside
strong self
hide money pockets
cant stand cant stand no more
stay top
strawgirl there lover who's searching
waiting somewhere someone call
look sign nothing will reveal hour burning rome was only
cold yet burning calm yet so murderous rise mist from earth as
gods die down die
music de feis lyrics de feis
take home tonight
you're diseased
you'll see
she says baby baby baby
cursed by priests torn twisted beat
please please deliver
burn all sinners beyond death beyond death
rejoice at death now i'll king
as haunt nightly shore
calling from other side
unleash raven fly
as sure as stars shine down
death damnation will destiny
let's go all way tonight
let's go all way tonight
there when die
darker now this tale hate
through ring fire am born again
hole sky where blackest spirits rage
bold are crowns their hands
welcome home king betrayed
through ring fire am born again
comes forth once again
honour grace glory
ancient kingdoms sunset
come come
let love out
love one track mind
got look freedom
bare beauty an unmade bed
dont wanna lose love now babe
still wound but never slay
you've killed child eyes
fading darkness not coming back here live here now die
red blood slowly dripped down stopped sighed
rest darkness till rise again
here ride wings fire staring straight into sun
gone
lights are getting brighter now
close eyes say good bye
ending ending now
what left frotune find
victory mine from mountains sea
oh emalaith oh emalaith
raise roof now
full sound fury
path paved scars
empty
know mark wear
ride wind chains defiance
ride wind chains defiance
hold take arms one last time
where are running now
where are now someone
lime limpid green
titanian neptune titan
waters underground
plague curse fall globe
disregard ink spots
write back
express casethe time coming
well into grave
normal viewing distance
no time
new headline
deeper stronger illusion
hate so it's brain scan
now walk so brainy
searching all memories
words are limitation
what must their rules
control all risk
who's living here
there's too much fear
causehave strange echoes
mainline into back pack
waiting summer daze
mental impairment sanity lost it's vanished away
one more cosmic watergate
lost shadow
sure it's coming
even vast no mans land
everything over
ordered by mind
lost dimension
bones soul
now pray
empty
picking at pride
drifting down below
if body cannot stand
four basic forces
less give more take
empty
dimension hatrss
what do read hand
not afraid livetell now
falling all apart
here go
getting no limit sentence
space jail center program
cylindrical habitat modules
awaiting own liberty
planet control
battling ghosts
lost this world
red grass up knees
field questions
work alone inside big dome
anything save master
ever practical
essential dogma
mindless now will do as you're told
twisting fate
there no problem analyse
listen beg
no flash pan
he gets around
deep into third eye now belong
x d coming head spinning
more than tears fill eyes as bright ships dot sky
how hell are they gonna make
star wars have started up
killing technology
take pills have energy
circuits gleam
going bridge tonight
hear call croaking frogs
how long has he been trail
from away tall man comes
scrape build up off tongue
brother
snatch up stone hold tight
this get
hypothetic liberty
discord real now
evolution isnt shame
you'll check box
gruesome rain seraph wailing
cant see
zoth free
this rotting world
stereo vision freedom unbound
shooting star crashing down
dont fucking care
far underground
empty
ellusive mythic doubt
ride
you're moving
all things cant forget
you're riding
noise wanders liquid
question thinking focus unit
satellites destroy an eye blink
negative glow
so close core
empty
strong mind control
empty
am shocked waves
so every channels same
valves plugs pump erase
mind talk
float unseen
spinning triangle
all random elements
light today
church an empire no way direction
burning all thoughts
much too political
warning lights were night
dont scared engines exploded
it's hard endure mutant
welcome china syndrome
all riding blind
incoherence
anyhow anyway
will stand aside
complete world control
restart fear program
much too real
rancid planet
anguish planet
hell dwell die why
apollo 2000 ready lift off
finally have reached
some passengers
between mind myself
psychic transfer
core atom
empty
you're going science hospital
going into experimental room
died through illness ravenous medicine
reasons why
no one blame
tormented down
not sound
restoration over all
straight ahead half luna shines
i've passed entry system

under hypnosis take walk
