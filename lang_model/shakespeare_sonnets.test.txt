which fortified her visage from the sun
and often reading what contents it bears
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
upon whose weeping margent she was set
enswathed and seald to curious secrecy
of court of city and had let go by
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
a youthful suit it was to gain my grace
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
came for additions yet their purposed trim
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd
'yet did i not as some my equals did
to put the by past perils in her way
though reason weep and cry 'it is thy last'
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and so much less of shame in me remains
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
with the annexions of fair gems enrich'd
''lo all these trophies of affections hot
hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
to spend her living in eternal love
upon the moment did her force subdue
must for your victory us all congest
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
to leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine
that flame through water which their hue encloses
there my white stole of chastity i daff'd
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
the naked and concealed fiend he cover'd
o all that borrow'd motion seeming owed
whiles both his youth and virtue did intend
even in the hearts and memories of men
to one superlative above the rest
not that he was above the spleenful sense
of what they do to be a special work
which harvest like did yield again the crop
not fruitlessly in prodigal expense
and shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice
for if his fate and heaven had decreed
affecting fashions nor addicted wholly
seemed rather answers which the wise embrace
so that his mind and body made an inn
clean tempered moderation steady trust
and as much glory is it to be good
justice by wrong and sifted to embane
by fair demeanor he had won repute
how such a man was sadly overthrown
th' unsteady change of his fantastic forms
here shall be reckoned up the constant faith
when all shall turn to dust from whence we came
that pities not thy sad and sudden wrong
and i confess my love was too remiss
t' enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first
but here i trust i have discharged now
whereby if thou live to posterity
measure thy course of life with false pretenses
presuming still it sees even in the night
true 'tis this man whiles yet he was a man
the ready way to commendation
he was not so but in a serious awe
his observation and discreet discerning
wherein not any one thing comprehends
most true presage and he discharged the same
hence sprung the deadly fuel that revived
robbed virtue of a follower so true
whiles it not doubting whereinto it enters
according to the tenor of the saw
might in like manner be reproved of guilt
the second brother who was next begot
washed white in blood from earth hence have not gone
rebound gross arguments upon their heart
which being crossed gives matter of bewailing
the grave that in his ever empty womb
shall not abridge the commendable thank
which underneath the roof of safe content
does think most safety doth remain above
birth blood and ancestors are none of ours
remembrance of their worth we may preserve
look hither then you that enjoy the youth
his flourishing and fair long lived deserts
leading by his example in the path
hath the most share in loss for i in hers
such was the separation here constrained
includes all excellence can be displayed
undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now
and now if i have leveled mine account
who if it were in plenty still would want
but whether doth the stream of my mischance
your lordship's in all duty
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
unlock'd the treasure of his happy state
an expired date cancelld ere well begun
perchance his boast of lucrece' sovereignty
neglected all with swift intent he goes
virtue would stain that o'er with silver white
of either's colour was the other queen
to those two armies that would let him go
little suspecteth the false worshipper
which having all all could not satisfy
he stories to her ears her husband's fame
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
now serves the season that they may surprise
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
what following sorrow may on this arise
that spots and stains love's modest snow white weed
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
thus graceless holds he disputation
where her beloved collatinus lies
self love had never drownd him in the flood
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
and being lighted by the light he spies
he takes for accidental things of trial
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
whether it is that she reflects so bright
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
but that life lived in death and death in life
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
his eye commends the leading to his hand
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'd up eyes
wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
under what colour he commits this ill
where thou with patience must my will abide
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
which like a falcon towering in the skies
to kill thine honour with thy life's decay
'but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the blemish that will never be forgot
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
'in tarquins likeness i did entertain thee
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
where subjects' eyes do learn do read do look
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
o how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
turns not but swells the higher by this let
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
'so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state'
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
her tears should drop on them perpetually
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
to living death and pain perpetual
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she prays she never may behold the day
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel'
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
the silver shining queen he would distain
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
'make me not object to the tell tale day
will couple my reproach to tarquins shame
as i ere this was pure to collatine
my honour lost and i a drone like bee
and talk'd of virtue o unlook'd for evil
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
to hold their cursed blessed fortune long
'o opportunity thy guilt is great
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
being so bad such numbers seek for thee
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
my collatine would else have come to me
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
time's office is to fine the hate of foes
'to fill with worm holes stately monuments
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
and time to see one that by alms doth live
teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
'out idle words servants to shallow fools
in vain i spurn at my confirm'd despite
kill both thyself and her for yielding so'
i fear'd by tarquins falchion to be slain
poor helpless help the treasure stoln away
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
revealing day through every cranny spies
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
will we find out and there we will unfold
'to kill myself' quoth she 'alack what were it
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
through which i may convey this troubled soul
'tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
for fleet wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
no cause but company of her drops spilling
wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil
not that devour'd but that which doth devour
that dying fear through all her body spread
'but tell me girl when went' and there she stay'd
the repetition cannot make it less
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ'
health to thy person next vouchsafe t' afford
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
for then eye interprets to the ear
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
when silly groom god wot it was defect
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
pausing for means to mourn some newer way
many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear
such sweet observance in this work was had
the face of either cipher'd either's heart
wagg'd up and down and from his lips did fly
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
that through their light joy seemed to appear
to find a face where all distress is stelld
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
'poor instrument' quoth she'without a sound
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
to plague a private sin in general
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
he entertaind a show so seeming just
of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry
'it cannot be' quoth she'that so much guile'
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
brings home his lord and other company
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
where no excuse can give the fault amending
from that alas thy lucrece is not free
i'll murder straight and then i'll slaughter thee
and never be forgot in mighty rome
or at the least this refuge let me find
the grief away that stops his answer so
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies' harms'
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
'no no' quoth she 'no dame hereafter living
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
about the mourning and congealed face
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
that i no more can see what once i was
and then in key cold lucrece' bleeding stream
weak words so thick come in his poor heart's aid
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
'my daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours filld
but now he throws that shallow habit by
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
and kiss'd the fatal knife to end his vow
which being done with speedy diligence
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
but that thou none lov'st is most evident
that beauty still may live in thine or thee
if time have any wrinkle graven there
'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
i love not less though less the show appear
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
have from the forests shook three summers' pride
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
fair kind and true varying to other words
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
save thou my rose in it thou art my all
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
askance and strangely but by all above
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
nor double penance to correct correction
and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight
and all those friends which i thought buried
and thou all they hast all the all of me
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
without thy help by me be borne alone
as thou being mine mine is thy good report
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
when thou art all the better part of me
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her
for all the day they view things unrespected
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
as soon as think the place where he would be
these present absent with swift motion slide
i send them back again and straight grow sad
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
shall reasons find of settled gravity
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
when swift extremity can seem but slow
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
and you in grecian tires are painted new
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
upon the hours and times of your desire
save where you are how happy you make those
without accusing you of injury
the second burthen of a former child
to subjects worse have given admiring praise
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
doth half that glory to the sober west
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
perforce am thine and all that is in me
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
and in our faults by lies we flattered be
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
to any sensual feast with thee alone
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
by self example mayst thou be denied
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
tempteth my better angel from my side
breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate'
from heaven to hell is flown away
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
th' uncertain sickly appetite to please
who art as black as hell as dark as night
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
that time will come and take my love away
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
save that to die i leave my love alone
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
attending on his golden pilgrimage
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
to do more for me than mine own desert
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
consumed with that which it was nourished by
my spirit is thine the better part of me
as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
or gluttoning on all or all away
and you and love are still my argument
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
and found such fair assistance in my verse
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
revenge upon my self with present moan
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
die single and thine image dies with thee
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
though i once gone to all the world must die
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
which should example where your equal grew
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
and to the most of praise add something more
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
comes home again on better judgement making
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
against thy reasons making no defence
for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
some in their wealth some in their body's force
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
though to it self it only live and die
making lascivious comments on thy sport
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
like widowed wombs after their lords' decease
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
as with your shadow i with these did play
a third nor red nor white had stoln of both
right honorable henry wriothesly
sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
upon this promise did he raise his chin
'o pity' 'gan she cry 'flint hearted boy
and for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance
'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
these blue veind violets whereon we lean
o'erworn despised rheumatic and cold
'bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
by this the love sick queen began to sweat
souring his cheeks cries 'fie no more of love
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
'what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
thou art no man though of a mans complexion
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
within this limit is relief enough
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
the time is spent her object will away
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
round hoof'd short jointed fetlocks shag and long
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
but when the heart's attorney once is mute
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
o what a war of looks was then between them
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
thus she replies 'thy palfrey as he should
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
to take advantage on presented joy
'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
empty
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
till his breath breatheth life in her again
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
or in the ocean drench'd or in the fire
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
do summon us to part and bid good night
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what though the rose have prickles yet 'tis pluck'd
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
he on her belly falls she on her back
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
whose full perfection all the world amazes
saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
as air and water do abate the fire
an image like thyself all staind with gore
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
the many musets through the which he goes
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
'then shalt thou see the dew bedabbled wretch
applying this to that and so to so
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
'so in thyself thyself art made away
for by this black faced night desire's foul nurse
and then my little heart were quite undone
'call it not love for love to heaven is fled
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
whereat amazed as one that unaware
'ay me' she cries and twenty times 'woe woe'
if pleased themselves others they think delight
lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
for now she knows it is no gentle chase
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
a second fear through all her sinews spread
here kennelld in a brake she finds a hound
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
'grim grinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
it was not she that calld him all to naught
''tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
who like a king perplexed in his throne
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes' red fire
having no fair to lose you need not fear
'to see his face the lion walk'd along
would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries
who did not whet his teeth at him again
she looks upon his lips and they are pale
'wonder of time' quoth she 'this is my spite
the bottom poison and the top o'erstraw'd
'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
'here was thy father's bed here in my breast
holding their course to paphos where their queen
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
love is too young to know what conscience is
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
now stand you on the top of happy hours
who will believe my verse in time to come
and your true rights be termed a poet's rage
and every fair from fair sometime declines
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
so is it not with me as with that muse
as any mother's child though not so bright
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
for it no form delivers to the heart
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
which alters when it alteration finds
if this be error and upon me proved
book both my wilfulness and errors down
even so being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
and ruined love when it is built anew
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
needs must i under my transgression bow
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
no i am that i am and they that level
or at the least so long as brain and heart
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
for thy records and what we see doth lie
under the blow of thralled discontent
or laid great bases for eternity
hence thou suborned informer a true soul
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
mad in pursuit and in possession so
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
i grant i never saw a goddess go
