race drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously mr remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes
in point of fact the race drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live
however my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race drivers pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists

but this statement is completely unconvincing
this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the ever present need for a demythologized gospel
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward

he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with mans history
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam
therefore there is no need for him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the fall
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall
he was in the words of irenaeus `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality ''
with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality
nevertheless even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god and he still rules
it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal
furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes
the difference between mr parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity '' despite these supposed conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker
yet even after all these stratagems the conscience of christian liberality is still not laid to rest any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance for its rejection of ralph waldo emersons the divinity school address of naming its hall of philosophy after him
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him
the gentle channing revered by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment
by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should i am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest
and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them `` even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria and are worse than those who deceived them '' which implied that they were very bad indeed
we have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying that while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers '' worked miracles `` i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine ''
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible

yet some must have survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period from 202 bc to ad 220
if one takes the middle number 5 and multiplies it by 3 the base number of the magic square of three the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of all the rows columns and two main diagonals
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty
obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the lo shu
the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yin yang and five elements school which was traditionally founded by tsou yen
thus the middle number 5 represented sung shan in honan central china
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps

yet the most difficult problem in the church's program of evangelism is right at this point helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship
this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship

of course in prudential calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows
certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative ''
by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ''
`` if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war i think he is right
toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment

it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country
this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them
though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 being an agent of such `` detrimental '' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid
it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas 1 the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others however point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion
2 realtors realize of course that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations either negative or positive plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced
thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions

the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle
for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came to 58 million against 57 million in 1959
i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about 18 million slightly below 1960 but above 1959
it has been estimated that spending by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than 500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than 2 billion by 1967 and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50 than the current 20

on c from the point p at af to the point q at af we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square is inside c
the set of intersections of af the rotated curve with the original curve c consists of just the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex at af plus the vertex itself
each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between c and af
with the vertex at af in the c plane we assume that af is the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and af
thus if e is sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of c and af near q for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and af near q would not be a monotone function
proof
again the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist
proof
but this is a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of ft is odd for every t

the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty four

the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning

a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area
how well can the site be developed
a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use
the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them
notice should be taken of unusual rock formations deposits or shapes of the earth's crust in your region
areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments

we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth century composers
in this changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create for large national purpose
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism
in orchestration he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color
certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the western world not his experimentations
in all his miscalculations stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations representing many peoples time periods and styles into his own music by warping the harmony melody or form to verify his own experiments
stravinsky nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic bird flitting from one abandoned nest to another searching for a home

this unit affectionately dubbed `` the monster '' can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing
sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy
this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made
as shown in fig 4 an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 kc bursts
because the body contains so much liquid transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels
the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan just like a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners

the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic a threat and danger '' to all the young or good or religious or moral persons

and houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 1960 `` diane harris graham 30 doa circumstances unusual ''
it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best
she has been acting as a prostitute
as she told it `` he's a rich boy friend an old guy about 60 ''
she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance

it's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old
yet from the dentist's point of view bad fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy
`` if teeth are moved too rapidly serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' explains dr brodie
usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be 650 to 1000
research helps families
in other cases in view of present day knowledge of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment

as the hour progresses the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements
what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation
dr karlis osis director of research at the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article `` new research on survival after death '' spring 1958
as always a tape recording or detailed notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter
one sitter may think `` a leather couch '' identifies a reading as surely directed to him
methods have been developed of assigning `` weights '' to statements
that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her `` hits ''
perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all

he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice
returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation
some part time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development

it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there are jews
shout at eichmann though he might the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti semitism
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january 1942 to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state including the reich minister of the interior the state secretary in charge of the four year plan the reich minister of justice the under secretary of foreign affairs
the final solution proved that the jew baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him
it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable
these incidents typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth control issue
instead of catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many non catholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed
with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives allowing the couple free choice

the so called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self control ''
this development is reflected in the action taken in february 1961 by the general board of the national council of churches the largest protestant organization in the aj
this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief
what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months
the name henry hudson
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship
he named this opening between baffin island and labrador the `` furious overfall ''
worse his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before
the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage
with hudson looking on his protege greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon edward wilson
the trouble was at least partly juet's doing
the statement was effective
the ship halted
hudsons reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty

the grant which stretched southward to lake traverse the headwaters of the red was made in may 1811 and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay
here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk's barony in scotland
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states
they reached fort douglas in june 1820
observing their distressing condition colonel snelling allowed these half starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation
at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling
the resultant town platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier's mission st paul was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river
the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel
a third remarked of slowness of southerners `` they moved about from corner to corner as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god ''

one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years

he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under
because of this he was known as gimpy but as with capone and his nickname of scarface never in his presence
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of 30000 in bribes it was estimated
to forestall any change of allegiance the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o'banion as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay
then o'banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds
they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado as when his bodyguard yankee schwartz complained that he had been snubbed by dave miller a prize fight referee chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation who were hirschey a gambler politician in loose beer running league with torrio and o'banion frank a policeman and max the youngest
o'banions reaction was `` three hundred dollars

a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake or a volcanic eruption
japan has had 15 destructive ones eight of them disastrous since 1596
the greater the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave
they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they pour into a v shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions
the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more because of their great length and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over
the highest waves 55 feet occurred at pololu valley
ordinary water tides are disregarded
since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific but only one was of any consequence
but it is plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough
today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them
knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists in korea

when the korean war began on june 25 1950 the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition
they came in waves
he took one step two broke into a trot and then into a run
he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire
for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that their lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment was dead
so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and like such generals as george s patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare

this much having been said the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do defeat communism and if so how those resources ought to be used
i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts and i think mr jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth
the argument was typically advanced in terms of us `` prestige ''
to the extent then that declining us prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there is reason for concern
thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country
today sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed communists and for all of its `` neutralist '' pretensions it is a firm ally of soviet policy
one latin american country cuba has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala

this is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter
when stacking wine on its side in a bin care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork
light especially daylight is always bad for wine
in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air
a tug of war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea

and on the summit of mount washington where thirty five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas `` because it is there ''
a lawyer hired by the college was arguing specifically for dartmouth daniel webster class of 1801 made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea

it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door
the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door
he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone

what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial book essay
this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse and she replied she didnt think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them
the press reported the same facts in using harringtons interview but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the killer
the actions of bridget should be examined since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her innocence
her father james upton was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port

second vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years
these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic ''
today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school

progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the national council or the world council or even in offices of the denominational boards than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors
this way of describing the matter is unfortunate
the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love

as a result they go on thinking of the church with introverted and self centered satisfaction only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families
it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible

the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle during adolescence the individuals positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy childhood and early adolescence
however as erickson has noted the individuals failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his or her adolescence
to be different is to invite shame and doubt
she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives eg whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker
they accepted a job primarily because it was available convenient and paid reasonably
the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs diffusion of ideals
for example it is evinced by the adolescent or adult whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice
for example some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys '' and the `` bad guys '' to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue and to explain or even justify asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological familial and social experiences

one of the alam lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes `` at a minimum cost of 1 a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume ''
from the earliest days of the motor car industry before the alam was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem
since the alam holdings embraced only about twenty five per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry
by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information
the plan was supported by frederick p fish counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce

the resulting indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern hysteria
the country will not change until it re examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom
i had intended to be there myself

it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both
not that there had not been attempts mostly european to do exactly that
congregational membership however is another thing
central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle class people from most central cities
if it were primarily a believing fellowship it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks something which most congregations of the new protestantism with a few notable exceptions have not been able to do
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations
therefore the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co optation rather than proclamation like elements will have to be assimilated
this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation
the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together
the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization the parish or congregation with a residential area is self defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co optation
`` fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion
in accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians
fort toulouse on the alabama river had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws but money was available for only one other new post near the present nashville tennessee and this was soon abandoned
concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors
during the first administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue
their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland rivers and was easily accessible to traders among the near by cherokees
but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country
they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering

`` twenty five '' the sheik replied
then the boycott would not be secondary but a primary one
an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means
however it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward
the question then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re moralizing and re establishing him
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non violent means and apply to both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action
both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail
the race problem has tended to obscure other less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive

their fears now are of miscegenation and negro political control in many counties
the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western world
the north should thank its stars that such has been the case
as it is they consider that the north is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism that in spite of its high standard of living the `` american way '' has been proved inferior to the english and scandinavian ways although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter
the enormous changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era
a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment
the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ie societal responsibility for the economic well being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in american constitutional history
the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961
for better or for worse we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well being
the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure

austins nineteenth century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking
the short answer to those questions is `` yes ''
i asked the same questions inside the launch control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command centers where other pistol packing men could give orders to push such buttons
accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks
their conversations were almost invariably accompanied by the same gestures arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions

another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre
the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure
an approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of charles olsons statement of the process of projective verse `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception ''
the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience

in homely terms whose timeliness is startling today he thus declared his own right to secede
the confederate constitution copied much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in substance
'' the other important difference between the two constitutions was that the president of the confederacy held office for six instead of four years and was limited to one term
if the union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union
the fact that the americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery the antithesis of individual liberty made the conflict grimmer and the greater
but the fact that 70524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served liberty and union in other essential ways

i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly
this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the ptolemaic system and its built in concept of periodicity and then more firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions

the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes
a broader concept of imitation is needed one which acknowledges that true invention is important that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal factors out of which it arises
aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level
i have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which as in the christian mind are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved as in the greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection
a word taken in its dictionary meaning a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings

only infrequently did the situation color his thinking
but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history
the portrait that had developed fragmentarily but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits when it does not forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence

it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family

william gilmore simms sturdy realist that he was pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans to vivify the pale writings being produced around him

you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity
the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit our tendency to rate the `` goodness '' or `` badness '' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves
we would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries
the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present sometimes by the very agencies our educational system our mass media our statesmen on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves ''

let us re examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy
his problem concerns longitudes latitudes and angular velocities
he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three body problem
as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized
the latter required juggling several elements simultaneously
the lower level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum
but considered within technical astronomy a different pattern can be traced
that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy's theory was not discovered de novo by copernicus

i can see us now
while my memory holds with relentless tenacity as i cannot too often stress to my wrongs when it comes to my shames it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them
although it is constantly made to look foolish too simple to come in out of the rain people say who have found in the innocent an impediment it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks

oxford realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ took the opposite view for which the queen never forgave him

in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody's ally
the genuinely interesting question then becomes what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of jews
predispositions in turn fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis
undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality
what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized
if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship
so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish gentile relationships
when we consider the disorganized state of the world community and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill
as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected
for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary
there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else
one would need to test this proposition carefully
certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence
the notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling
fsc northrop in his discussion of the `` functions and future of poetry '' suggests this `` one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us at the end of the day fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing practical utilitarian concern of common sense objects

in this essay we are along with most historians interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas that are so to speak `` writ large '' in history of literature where they recur continually
again he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways
here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historians research
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought turning our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades
a contrast of the scripture reading of let us say st augustine john bunyan and thomas jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression

thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky

characteristically trevelyan enjoyed writing the work
more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre french revolution days portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus
these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england
trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples
trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay's history of england had broken off
the account of the battle is next to his descriptions of garibaldi's campaigns trevelyans outstanding military narrative
`` well i might not get that far '' i told them `` as actually i have no papers to enter germany and as a matter of fact no permit to return to france once i leave ''

if as reid says `` nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium '' there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to katie king and making plans for another book of verse

similarly the sufferings of hamlet othello or phedre engage the fortunes of the state
in la nouvelle heloise and werther tragedy is made intimate
there had not yet supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of mathematics and scientific formulas
concepts such as grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of being which are everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy lose their vitality

at milcote on november 3 1597 the aldermen asked him to support their petition for a new charter
allso that if monei might be had for 30 or 40 a lease might be procured ''
this seems to refer not to the loan richard had asked for but to a proposed bargain with shakespeare
he asked quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and if not to send to the lodging of sir edward and entreat him to pay what he owed
all which cost me at the least 20 pounds ''
after returning stratford he drew up a defense of the towns right to toll corn and the office of collecting it and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and shakespeare's father

the failure of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical conformation
in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views
in all fairness it must be admitted that adams made no pretense at being an impartial historian
no page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization
a m wergeland called the adams method literally antihistorical while clive day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight factual evidence
brooks adams considered religion as an extremely significant manifestation of mans fear of the unknown
adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality a reflection of mans inability to cope with his environment
adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between god and man
to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire culture of the race was one of imagination and it is largely the admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar religiosity a sentiment he would have probably denied
in fact he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in the forest of ecuador
finally we got them out of the house after the boy had run away four times looking for other nazis threatening to murder village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next fuhrer
he said `` some have criticized your book as being neither literary criticism nor history
but i liked to think of him at ninety swimming and working at key west long after hemingway had moved to cuba
then i spoke at the ninetieth birthday party of w e burghardt du bois who embarked on a fictional trilogy at eighty nine and who with the crisis had created a negro intelligentsia that had never existed in america before him
however at eighty five he had still been busy writing articles reviewing and speaking and i had never before known an englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the united states
but put them before a situation which they are forced to depict '' he was speaking of the spanish civil war `` and they have no hesitation

on the evening that they were to sail lewis himself gave a party but he was too indisposed to appear at it
but his rancor did not cease and presently on march 13 when he preached a sermon on the text `` and ben hadad was drunk '' he told his congregation how disappointed he was in mr lewis how he regretted having had him in his house and how he should have been warned by the fact that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the book
one had it that a friend protesting her snobbery said `` but gracie you are an american arent you ''
finally at dawn he fell asleep and when he awoke and came into the living room he found lewis in his pajamas before the fire smoking a cigarette
it was late and blackman was ready to go to sleep but lewis was not
the second name was edward kempe matriculated from queens' college at easter 1625
christ's college was well represented that year in the ordo and the name highest on the list from that college was miltons fourth in the entire university
looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years of miltons undergraduate days certain phases of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us
then we have surviving at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in naturam non pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica
the town itself and the `` reedy cam '' he often visited as did all in the university
a quibusdam audivi nuper domina
milton was to act as the archfool the supreme wit the lightly bantering pater pater liber who could at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering and with words alone
but that scarcely means that he was the aloof forbidding type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows the banter of the surviving prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this

james blish's a case of conscience 1958 describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters
since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication of nineteen eighty four an assumption which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as room 101 along with education by conditioning from brave new world a book to which science fiction writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful orwell dystopia
for example even the most successful executive lives in a two room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night
pohl and kornbluth's ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with `` every basic trauma and neurosis in american life '' which work on the libido of consumers which are linked to the `` great prime motivations of the human spirit ''

to those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally or politically or sociologically antiquated and i have reason to know that there are some such i would like to say what i have already hinted namely that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore incapable of being youthful of mind

without really changing the general subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by doubts not only about pacifism but also when asked to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous
for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species man or as malraux himself puts it `` to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves ''
and it should be far better known than it is
these lines never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltations of combat and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal necessities of war
the narrator is an alsatian serving with the french army and he has the same name berger that malraux himself was later to use in the resistance
a good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind
the men around him observes the narrator `` have been living from day to day for thousands of years ''
vincent berger's mission is a failure because the ottoman nationalism on which enver pasha counted does not exist
`` for six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing '' writes the narrator `` not to understand that man begins with ' the other ' ''
citing the advances of communist power in recent years sir anthony observed `` this very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources to meet it ''
many factors contributed to the growth of the european movement
in 1952 the european coal and steel community was launched placing the coal and steel production of france west germany italy and benelux under a supranational high authority
the time is now ripe indeed overdue for the vigorous development of its non military potentialities for its development as an instrument of atlantic community
the existence of a community is a state of mind a conviction that goals and values are widely shared that effective communication is possible that mutual trust is reasonably assured
the burden of these reflections is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs
such proposals look to an apocalyptic act a kind of lockian `` social contract '' on a world wide scale
our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the realization of a potential community
lawrence ferlenghetti and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician

beginning in cloth of the tempest 1943 he experimented in merging poetry and visual art using drawings to carry long narrative segments of a story as in sleepers awake and constructing elaborate `` poems in drawing and type '' in which it is impossible to distinguish between the `` art '' and the poetry
in 1945 probably almost every american not only knew who sam spade was but had some kind of emotional feeling about him
the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry
seen by the public the musician is the underdog par excellence
this involves a shift in patchens attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry

around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city in that park are the rows of marble busts of garibaldi's fallen men the ones who one day rushed out of the porta san pancrazio and under fire all the way up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground of the villa doria pamphili

a survey of practices and policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode island's practices
fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non itemized basis
flat payments over 50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state owned vehicles
the registry of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917
but it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees
gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities
one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951 1956 while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35 the total maintenance cost increased only 11
it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work
good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more

this however did not bar finding that du pont had become pre eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to general motors
the judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute
the government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du pont's shares of general motors
in addition the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be vested in du pont's stockholders other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware
du pont's counterproposal was filed on may 14 1958
general motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the mandate of this court

petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the department of justice and before the appeal board

on april 1 1953 after some six months of full time `` pioneering '' petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board
his claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' the department concluded that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith ''
nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board
but there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult
it is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection

the two governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after june 30 1961 shall be dependent upon the determination by the united states government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under title 1 of the act at that time
the terms and conditions of the loan and other provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two governments
the two governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the agreement will not displace usual marketings of the united states of america in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries

whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other
this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere
it was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose
as mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations
some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant class 1 a or class 1 b clear channel stations designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service both groundwave and at night skywave over large areas and at great distances being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective
in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible

this enterprise led to a father and son combination beginning in 1833 under the name d brown son a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call brown sharpe
the company became `` j r brown sharpe '' and entered into a new and important period of its development
curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches
the original machine bearing its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the brown sharpe precision center in providence

this result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence
that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by pettit and nicholson 1930 and pettit 1935
the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc
the apparent black body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation
observations have also been made at 15 mm using optical techniques sinton 1955 1956
the observations of mayer mccullough and sloanaker at 315 cm and of sloanaker at 103 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described
the 103 cm observation of sloanaker was made on may 20 1958 using the 84 foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the u s naval research laboratory
qualitative observations were made and high speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities
this energy transfer depends on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions in the anode sheath
an attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss
a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper
this tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing
it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet
the argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator
the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind

the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby af
by the use of various weights data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtained
a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time
however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper
af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h
there is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar
the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids
this formula is given by rumscheidt and mason
the internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume
the lines are asymmetric and over the range of field af gauss and temperature af the asymmetry increases with increasing af and decreasing t
it is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure

under this assumption the space group must be af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell
the structure appears to be unique among ooh compounds but is the same as that assumed by af
a randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position 3 since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell for which no evidence exists

it appears possible to set a lower limit of about af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form af radical
contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents
previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place

the data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux
the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain
however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as af
the flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors
the older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light
the solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation pressure and the associated poynting robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns

anti a and anti b activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o donors by the following tube agglutination methods
however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous af and homozygous af cells will be presented here
blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuged and the serum was removed
in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer 050 m in both af and tris ph 41
when paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run under the conditions described above
successive 1 ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe starting at the top of the tube and tested for agglutinin activity
not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas
chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide

another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity
other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern united states the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may be born every other year rather than annually
the first is the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh

however the formation of organically bound iodine mainly mono iodotyrosine can be accomplished in cell free systems
on chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to af and then to af as the active iodinating species
its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell free systems nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven
the finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from tsh treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo
e
any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism

similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis

in attempting to improve specificity of staining the fluorescein labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways 1 they were passed through dowex 2 chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders coons 1958 prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by agrobacterium tumefaciens e f smith townsend on sweet clover stems
the latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory
after blotting out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of pbs
results
however the nonspecific staining by the af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen
with this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 10 dilution of af for 30 minutes washing with pbs for 15 minutes staining with af for 30 minutes and washing with pbs for 15 minutes
the specificity of staining with af was established as follows af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover
the virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue
in the direct method af not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and wtv tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable af

maclean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain including the hypothalamus on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions
apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex
similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals
they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side
a state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response
on the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy
a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding
although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test
we are trying to study a linear operator t on the finite dimensional space v by decomposing t into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary
thus t is not diagonalizable
let t be a linear operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f
we shall find a polynomial af such that af is the identity on af and is zero on the other af and so that af etc
it is clear that each vector in the range of af is in af for if ya is in the range of af then af and so af because af is divisible by the minimal polynomial p
thus af is divisible by the minimal polynomial p of t ie af divides af
now af af so af
the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent operator n are uniquely determined by a and b and each of them is a polynomial in t
since n and n are both nilpotent and they commute the operator af is nilpotent
thus we see that af and af
example 11
if af is the null space of af then theorem 12 says that af

more generally suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non success '' `` failure '' and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial
if three dice are tossed a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials
exactly 2 times
for an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment it must have four properties 1 there must be a fixed number of trials 2 each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' a binomial trial 3 all trials must have identical probabilities of success 4 the trials must be independent of each other

the following is a less extreme example of dependence
but table 7 1 shows that af or 070 agree too many for independent voting
on the other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes
the set of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution '' or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear
their sum is x the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value af
the line af is the image of l
there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines whose images are not unique
the congruence of its secants is therefore of order af and class af
hence c' is a af curve on q
since c is rational this correspondence has k coincidences each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image
the first possibility requires that there be a line through p which meets zg in af points
but if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of zg can intersect then the regulus must be quadratic or in other words zg must be either a af or a af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface
as the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and subjects town and country will widen
we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene
most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective
only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance
as an isolated policy land reform is likely to be politically disruptive
but these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital
thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange
particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest
american and free world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition
with the diversity of religious viewpoints there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion
the instrumentalities follow
man has a second chance
religion at its best is out in front ever beckoning and leading on and as lippman put it `` mobilizing all mans scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance ''
in providing for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well being services for which there is no other institution
even the non church members the freewheelers marginal religionists and so on have the values of christian civilization internalized in them
it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action
it enables members of the society to operate as a system
durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them ''
it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones
religion provides the most attractive rewards either in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms but who engage in good works
clearly this was a family in crisis
simultaneously a variety of environmental supports a calm but not too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nursing care accompaniment to the well baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms
in this relationship building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem
in addition in many cases a variety of concrete social resources homemaker day care medical and financial aid must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts
that we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature
my aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the time honored clinical casework skills we already possess and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional pride
sentiment
maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today
status roles
`` the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system ''
within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems
each family line can be considered a substructure
to maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct grouping or system in society
in turn higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity
systemic linkage
intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community as in the case of this population
social control
the process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic interaction is maintained
a royal decree issued in 1910 two years after the belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms

the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour lassistance medicale aux indigenes du congo belge foreami has special interest with respect to demography

the radical nature of the innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements
sample units villages in rural areas houses in cities were drawn systematically within these strata
in the reports summary results are given for both the de facto a and c and de jure a and b populations
the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries
with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes
i can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past
this action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores
for no particular reason other than that the writer felt it might just might encourage both mates to be in attendance
but few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre marital situation
or `` how do we enrich our already fine marriage ''
they began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class

since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis
perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent

they continued to give an arm elevation
while other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior
they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors
in contrast to this voluntary control explanation for nonreactivity given by the kohnstamm positive subjects the kohnstamm negative subjects offered an involuntary control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity
thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality factor
it might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong
equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper lower and lower middle class neighborhoods

the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity
all of these sub tests involve reading except arithmetic computation
a child with an iq of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 35
the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported in this case at the level
figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group
but the symbols he is asked to learn are simple
analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements
the president of a small firm selling restaurant products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business
each was told to purchase material if he felt like it
from the point of view of the applicants less time was wasted in being evaluated and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances
some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure
he did not really listen to others had little interest in their ideas and wanted to have his own way which was the only right way
in any case he refused to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made over
the necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms
the first eight of these eighteen statements which received at least one half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared
to use these new ways in daily life is the last step
the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold
i thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother in their distant home city
she clearly agreed that this had been the case
eventually it became clear to me partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his condescending `` you're welcome '' was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor over these months on each of these occasions when i had bid him good bye with the consoling note each time that the healing christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow
but it is true that the therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another
in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which from time to time quite different things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them in words
one hebephrenic women confided to me `` i live in a world of words '' as if to her words were fully concrete objects
we suggest the application of certain data processing techniques as a solution to the problem
the dictionary is a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries
the form itself is stored in the next available cells of the w region beginning in cell af
a third situation is possible
hence when the address af is computed from af the cell af and all y cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain
the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time
only the assignment of the information cells is important
the address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage
the latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents
the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it
but the parallel is significant
dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist
they are likely to lose dominant stress
but when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress at all
often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion
thus in mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of mary's concerned with an account of her trip about which she may later have made speeches for example and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which mary wrote accounts
when go represents itself and a complement being equivalent say to go to martinique in which boat did jack go on
it is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written
in the steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second
it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels
the second need is better field techniques
the third need is for better theory
this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable
other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way
while the phonemes can be very easily stated no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units ie until the morphophonemics is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success
often therefore there are a number of rules having the same effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite effect
this seems naive
in the process he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult
as a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo
this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a short description of item categories in iraqw
the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used
what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes 1 body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly even representation 51 terms out of 253 25 out of 100 come out with nearly even ratios
if word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually

but second `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' as between m k and i e
but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance
and irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones
the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison

the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau
he would tell the poles he said that they had been `` given a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way ''
the issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin government formed behind the red army
twice in the last thirty years our enemies the germans have passed through this corridor
in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into russia as a part of hitler's armies
in doing so marshall and byrnes were `` asking for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life ''
then the editorial added prophetically `` how far they may reach in asia is yet undetermined but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences ''

they were stressed in the speeches of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council
in january 1958 the minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the king the rumors of election dates appeared once again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer
a titre personnel and a special office was created in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections
the choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections
the newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years
the sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure

the police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals and those punished for protectorate activities
annual authorizations of 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians
during world war 2 about 75 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities 1 vocational education for national defense and 2 war production training
employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training
but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses also may be conducted
the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled
furthermore there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys
proposals
local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training
a maximum of 600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home
the very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway run up or run down movement

the rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline
it suggests that during the next several months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds
however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market operations in longer term government bonds they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces
our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending
the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in the three year period from april 1947 to march 1950
in a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed up during the thirties and world war 2 is finally in the process of running dry

in both respects international law was europeanized
more emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations ''
that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states
it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the germans especially by hegel although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of hobbes
related to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another
indeed with developed positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally became quite specific
it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government
government itself was based upon contract
private international law which americans call the `` conflict of laws '' was thus segregated from international law proper or as it is often called public international law
serious difficulty arose with the advent of substantive due process
meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction
`` the resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication ''

federal review of state decisions
litigants who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure
but the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation ''
or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation section 381c6 but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization
refund claims
a tax free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law '' mold
revenue ruling 54 17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor corporation
in fact a cash purchase of a corporations stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the kimbell diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step
if the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes
similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting section 381c4 or depreciation section 381c6
it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax
as a result it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government
the research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire

the method of compiling the aia and tr lists will be described later
the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work
the third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register
if the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted
the second test mailing to 100 companies was made in july 1960
each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial number by the source list from which the company name was selected and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark on the return envelope
the second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study
inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless of how we ruled
as a result of these changed conditions the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor management relations has been much greater than in the past

only when a decision is rendered by the district court of appeal or of course the supreme court is a binding precedent established
a decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers

he wants to be with people but he hasnt yet learned to cooperate
indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary school teacher rather than merely an additional chore
it is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent
an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school
chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress
the summary report which was prepared for this conference indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing

nearly half the children still receive no education
in general it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle class values which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society
the members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position being strongest in the universities
one upward mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while another upward mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment
compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working class fathers
for instance there have been two presidential commissions on higher education since world war 2
these people are practically always upper or upper middle class persons who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society
educational policy in the united states has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity
the recent federal government's student loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower status youth
the double step type
has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet
instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables
here an apportionment say of 5000000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers
that is to say an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment
the simplest division and the one most frequently used with subdivisions in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs
included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer

philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories
but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato
it has surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's system 1929
beyond this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry but within its potential domain of relevance
philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed
in this philosophy and science share a common goal
when dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has to become necessarily selective
as simmel 1908 and dilthey 1922 indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions

we come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use
nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured
it removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be
if we did not mean to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred
when we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably make it with some feeling
we should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making

the supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as the direction and scope of a movement passively executed with one of his members proved to have been on the contrary very considerably affected ''
and so the authors conclude `` the conduct of the patient in his every day life and in his work even more than the foregoing facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected
according to his own testimony he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more or less indefinite size
in short both his own declarations and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all

those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from earliest times granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside are correct
the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early social political and religious patterns into later ages
to interpret indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information

what is new about it
but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's day and did not spring full clad from his imagination in 1515 it is not communism as such that we are concerned with
utopian communism applies to all utopians
the actual function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a millenium before more wrote utopia
in all the respects just indicated utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role
although utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice
what that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the church fathers of late antiquity

that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface
by its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done
the trompe loeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it
all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it

after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career
the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all in bad condition
to be sure of matching color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry out to their final key
in our own practice to have the last `` intonaco '' plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first set awhile before applying the second

almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation
nor do i think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual
moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible
one might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to fromm's theory of alienation
the failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader
while the `` empirical psychoanalytic '' label which fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product

about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive years `` 1908 1910 '' or two separate dates when hardy worked on the poem `` 1905 and 1926 '' or an approximate date `` during the war ''

and on christmas day 1890 hardy wrote `` while thinking of resuming ' the viewless wings of poesy before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying pettinesses to disappear '' early life p 302
the range of the later poetry is considerably narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater
it asserts emotion without evoking it that is to say it is sentimental
in `` revulsion '' on the other hand the pessimism is a case not proven
the elegiac tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising that the 1912 13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his
both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art
the last time i saw dylan his self destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality
both of them did communicate one central theme against the ruin of the world there is only one defense the creative act
they did not actively negate them
similarly the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado
the metaphysical conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation still dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries
partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication
a poem by dylan thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson pollock these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves
the main line of development today goes back to lester young and by passes them
nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion
a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions in vast depths
alcinous' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of ares and aphrodite odyssey 8 266 366 and takes up a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on odyssey 8 499 520
assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle commenced at hastings
either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns
this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric poetry but to students of anglo saxon poetry as well
it is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony
a ship at dry dock could be called a foamy necked floater in anglo saxon or a swift ship in greek
at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed
anglo saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition
dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian writers
dickens not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit crime greed education materialism enslavement by both people and institutions friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption
since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly half the characters in great expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at
it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's `` the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting '' that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of satis house
when the snobbery that alienates pip from joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which pip exclaims `` no dont wipe it off for god's sake give me your blackened hand ''
we take leave of pumblechook as he gloats over pip's loss of fortune extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' one of which he identifies with `` the finger of providence '' and shakes at pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as pip's `` earliest benefactor ''

their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr hp
for the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1
the lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage
the sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24 hr charts
grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions
ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts
the vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface
the bod in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 aj
very little protozoa activity existed below 40 degrees f
an extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water
during this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted
microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather
mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets
these have sought more and more of what they have
the result can only be confusion in the public mind
some are also in albania and others are on loan to egypt
antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result of a single battle
therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent
therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements
but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically
full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment
these variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically
a most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package
mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target
the 7 carbons of paba are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 as shown with both ring labeled and carboxy labeled af
research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued
electron microscopical and physical chemical methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat denatured collagen and ribonucleic acid
special equipment required for registering respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the instruments section victor jackman w c barnes j f reiss
on the basis of a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove that for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation has been infinitesimal for all times in the past
trace elements in tektites meteorites and related materials
nickel iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion craters may nevertheless melt only small quantities of material
by applying this general principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years
structure and properties of macromolecules
these studies are being extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain bonds
experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent
contrary to observations with ethers no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in benzene as solvent
a third volume remains to be published
most of the data used are from groth's chemische krystallographie
the publication form is that of clothbound books
volume 1 containing parts 1 and 2 was published in 1951
preparation of a second edition is in progress under the sponsorship of the crystal data committee of the american crystallographic association
for some substances auxiliary properties such as the melting point are given
the second edition should have greater uniformity
references for part 1 are given at the end and for part 2 in the tables
substances
use of nomenclature symbols units physical constants
numbers sometimes followed by letters are used so that insertions can be made
organization
a supplementary grant from the geological society of america helped finance its publication
the physical property values include hardness melting point and specific gravity

critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this project
with the development of nuclear technology isotopic materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout the world
insect infestation is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain
deactivation of enzymes is also possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad or more
for destruction of insects about 25000 aj
for example gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated
no comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen
of primary interest are meats
a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item
ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities
radiosterilization at 3 mrad is more expensive than canning particularly for the cesium 137 source
acceptance of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two reasons 1 the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices and 2 treatment by antibiotics a measure already approved by the federal food and drug administration serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 05 cents per pound
the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out
the pictures of figs 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between coating and substrate
the cutting or shearing removal process has been previously described
af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the knife
yc is defined by the geometry of the knife
the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be applied to this condition also
this is not a constant value like af but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants r and af of fig 6

and there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated
and in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed
since the mid 1950s when urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth has been little short of fantastic
the most important factor in determining what properties the end product will have is quite naturally the type of hydroxyl rich compound that is used in its production
in the prepolymer system the isocyanate and resin are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs
by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression strength density ratio
the higher density urethane semi rigid foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance ie the 12 lb cu ft foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3 lb cu ft density
the foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it can be molded it can be poured in place it can be applied by spray guns etc
the low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports and gas pedal covers
while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique is fast developing
at the conclusion of the washing 8 liters of water at 90 degrees f 320c are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub
a reflectance measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal
for example test 3 e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure `` 3 '' at 160 degrees f for a total of 60 minutes in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure `` e '' and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension presser by procedure `` 1 ''
one fin is located every 120 degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel
the flat bed press is maintained at a temperature not less than 275 degrees f 1350c
detergent synthetic alkylarysulfonate type
the springs have an extension of 1 inch at af tension
this also holds true if restorative forces are applied
the distances are at least two inches from any edge of the specimen
garments
add sufficient soap and softener if required to counteract hard water to furnish a good running suds or if desired use a synthetic detergent
refill the machine to a level of af inches with water at 100 109 degrees f 38 430c
cascading single stages by coupling lens systems b
tsem tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution
it should be noted however that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems

as the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the sbcs type lies around 2 the fresnel losses at the fiber photocathode interface are about 05 percent and the af factor for the interstage coupler is 095
for the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 af resolution af
the same consideration should govern the choice of the second stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor eg photographic emulsion
in general a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution
a resolution of 70 80 line pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible

he recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r stage process the remaining stages must use an optimal af stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process
if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously af operations would be required to do the same job and as r increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program
`` an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision ''
we write this af
let af where the maximization is over all admissible policies af
we also see how the results may be presented although if n the number of state variables is large any tabulation will become cumbersome
hence p is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that is the net profit
we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given af
it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process
in the system shown in fig 7 1 the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output axis torquer
finally the gyro stabilized platform characteristic is represented by af
the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is af
below this level the amplifier gain af is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering
this leveling system will hold the platform on level automatically as long as the system is actuated
also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach
the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading
with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned
obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand
it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform
the platform is leveled and properly headed so that the x gyro input axis is parallel to the east west direction and the y gyro input axis is parallel to the north south direction
scotty did not go back to school
his father tried to make the food a topic
since his seizure scotty had had little appetite
he looked lazy spoiled a little querulous
it was a negro section of peeling row houses store front churches and ragged children
she would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously watch the progress of scotty's fork or spoon
his energy was gone
it was merely another part of his weakness
they were far off and looked tiny
`` i imagine you're always battling in school ''
he could now but the weakness is very definite
scotty watched with disinterest
miss estherson called twice
she turned to him again
`` well there's time in any case
and rachels or virginia's reply `` better
`` i'm eating more '' he would say
and another time without accusation `` you never wore that scarf i bought you ''
was it all vain labor
there was just too much time
he had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a coward

it was dark
thus stealthily they advanced upstream
off in the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky
warren handed him the metal box and prevot quietly disappeared down the line
in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched
they were poems in a strange language of which he could barely touch a meaning enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there
cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside
they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there
smiling at warrens protestations the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor
the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were
he was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly supported the church
it was often re enacted in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer meeting
it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative
the streets in the colored section were dirty
it was called kent house
the best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better
wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a better church a more business like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization
the church certainly would not be removed
the colored people are getting employment at kent house and other places and they are near their places of employment
it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand
`` talk to mrs catt '' she said
and for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not in all churches
the bottle was filled up with flour
if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point in wasting time
he was no longer worried
he stopped and whispered his errand
it had misfired
he ran for the sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away
payne hacked at their arms
he clattered down the stairs and out of the door
he had no idea where he was
it was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more

the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear in or out of character but he was not particularly funny

the episcopal church was one block down sussex street
the veterans idling on their benches in the square beneath the soldiers' monument got to their feet when papa approached `` morning reverend ''
on these excursions papa instructed him on mans chief end which was his duty to god and his own salvation
`` no he wont ''
to speak of papa dying was a sin
the mouth was thin lipped and wide the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide

soon came back to his senses
maybe it's a good thing it happened
a tune began to whirl inside his head
he used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball
he laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving utmost respect and attention
before him mutilated bleeding to death they lay
somebody'll hafta start thinkin
the music arrived taking him its rhythm
that's what he said
why didnt the damn reactionaries bump him off

rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books too
`` to have become so corrupt '' he says `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences ''
but at the same time how understandable
but then one day while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which he attached no great importance
and they wouldnt leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised
and the fault of course was rameau's
but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first rate performance it merited

monsieur de cury was incensed of course
how titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals

since ordinary breakfast table conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first
harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in
at that moment the bathroom door flew open and eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went
it was the most important looking cradle he had ever seen
with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there
da da da dum music could not be eugene's passion
her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture a big round oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame

i hate it
what about him ''
she began to laugh
there was somebody else in the apartment
she gave the nastiest laugh i ever heard
i couldnt face thelma after that night
trust eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation
still i didnt think she was twotiming me with precious right then
the phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger
getting drunk every night was the only way i could handle the situation
he was a big thick beefy violent man
all evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion
pat had contacts all over the labor movement
sposato couldnt wait to get me hired
he wanted desperately to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant too
he left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively as rector gave him his final instructions
rector had never been able to find out much about hino's past
when the telephone rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in rector's office rarely rang unless it was important
`` at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time ''
rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission
he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished cleaning the press
he told her of the visitors and then of his plans
do you think you can manage it ''
`` have you ever operated a transit ''
johnson nodded
the air was cooler here and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect which he found pleasant
at last he consented to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal
there was one of the new forte pianos in the room and as claire rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left
the jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish
she was the pursuer as clearly as was venus in shakespeare's poem
byron inquired
so dont see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance ''
frankly i dont care ''
`` byron ''
pausing in the doorway he said `` the form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit is the most challenging loveliness in all nature ''
`` i was told it on good authority '' claire answered darkly
shelley sent a copy to southey a former friend and another to godwin
there are some even now
the careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent
he had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonels belt
i want to take a look
from the outside it seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth
the man had come floundering aboard the flat bottomed barge at the last instant brandishing the flag of truce
he had peered through the darkness at the rampart
watson turned away and did not see the mans knees buckle and his body sag
a feeling of futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known seeped through him
for what
to his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank
they crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats
he appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom
he felt a spectator interest
the guards came to life with astonishing menace
watson stared into a cadaverous face
another body length or all the rest of his nighted life
i can walk real good
hush
he had not meant to shout
all his emotions had been inward self conscious
already his cool body lay in the ground
john would curse
it was built by the pasterns and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property
she usually wore weeds and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that mr pastern was dead but mr pastern was far from dead
leaving her house one late afternoon mrs pastern stopped to admire the october light
mrs trempler was tuberculosis mrs surcliffe was mothers' march of dimes mrs craven was cancer and mrs gilkson did the kidney
she stopped at the surcliffes' after dusk and had a scotch and soda
their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door
`` your wife just called '' she said separating one word from another exactly like a child
everything's on the table ''
all in all they had six drinks
`` i've seen you though before '' she said with enormous coyness patting his knee
he didnt doubt her truthfulness although he had heard the words a hundred times
`` she told me he was in germany ''
it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known
it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil
to abel `` i am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here
she smiled and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face
i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me
procreation expansion proliferation these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion
or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years
they rarely spoke
they had closed over absolutely with the sealing of old izaak's grave
mark easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably categorized
he smiled
there was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished
he was in his mid fifties at this time long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing
his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos
he left his home the day after new year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat
he would settle himself into his seat to laugh
she called trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure
there is a death in all partings she knew and promptly put it out of her mind
she stood up smoothing her hair down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia to come with her guests
so when the big house filled up and ran over the sisters in law found beds for everyone in their own homes
now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained and she did not know where he went
so the pattern was established
the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room and her door was kept shut
`` cousin lura ''
almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she entered the room
`` he's ten years younger than ernest
`` how old is he ''
there never was a season before but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth ''
there was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in a cadillac
`` i'd give anything if i could have found a girl like you ''
`` oh you could
bobby joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum hunting and uncle bill farnworth from mama albright's side of the family said he would just get up from there and take them right then
he had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell
to alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs
alex's instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the rue ecole de medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all
all search was ended
alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind alex's arm and back
there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business
`` who was that young feller ''
now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe ''
a bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside
without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside
there were times it wasnt right to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we dont keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich
she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper
then he spread out the last list on the counter
she turned and put her arms around his neck
what you think i care about that
`` how many times have i told you '' he began and was almost glad when she cut him off `` too many times ''
she made him sad some days and he was never sure why
`` i dont know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' he said
winston enjoyed seeing him start out
he noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger
winston had been surprised at her for that
where would she go for her gardening now
he brought it in and put it down beside her
winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail objects christmas birthday and anniversary and wrapping them in tissue paper
`` well that's over now
he had only agreed with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested the photograph to mr jack
finally she had come down
`` you look like that picture i have at the office '' mr jack had started
`` i'll give you a medical certificate framed if you like '' miss ada had said
in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across the river from new york i would nearly cry
like eliot in my fantasies i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses burning with love
she was wearing her dark hair in two thick braids to attain an `` american girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to halloween
she was terribly pleased
when in one letter jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief
my camp made leather wallet bulky with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money i had been saving
there was a great sense of camaraderie
suppose i hadnt brought along enough money
my heart almost stopped beating
she wasnt quite sure that i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return to it once i was out and on my own again
you're not the kind to go violent
was she pretty ''
i wanted to go to college too ''
there was no money for tuition for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted
`` my aunt raised me
when she had finished i said
it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane brennan should know the truth about me that i was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be
there hadnt been anything really personal in her interest in me
i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined it all
ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled on it in his sun times column
i knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open
`` good
`` all right you bastards '' i said `` the great actor is about to buy a drink ''
the elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car
`` that's right '' i told him
for the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays then in people passing by
`` it's a sublease
`` it's one of the rules on transients
i hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left
i turned left too soon and got a signal showing that i was still behind him but he was to the right
moreover i'd have lost him if it hadnt been for the electronic shadowing device
i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco address
`` your wife isnt going to join you later ''
we like to run a nice quiet place ''
i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed
`` it's early in the evening to be in a hurry
i said `` darn it that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on
she'll eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i'm to have one with her so she wont feel out of place ''
the thin man said `` that a way ''
`` canada doesnt have much of this here juvenile delinquency problem but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists ''
it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top
it was getting light
a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side
vince swore
vince cursed steadily
he spoke soothingly
`` you get that kid over to rose's house ''
in the tool crib she cant get away ''
i wish you luck when you try scaring that kid ''
`` in a chicago slum just like you
she jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of coke
she called softly `` barney ''
now he looked at her
what awful thing had she to face in the next few hours
this is the end of the line ''
dave made some sound meant to convey agreement
you go
as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey
`` did anyone see my cab ''
there was no word spoken no apparent signal given
perhaps it was dora may
there was nothing he could do but walk
then he realized the utter futility of the idea
the steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man about faced and turned his back as the officer approached
acey squire's station wagon
he could not leave the road because of the water filled drainage ditch
there had been two more cars parked at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck
the admassy place could not be far now
he lurched on down the road despairingly because there was no place else to go
and now he saw them
he held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible
he was nearing the admassy house
`` get in '' charley estes said brusquely
i was lucky they let me go i guess ''
he turned his head and said `` alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour
shayne said briskly `` grab another drink if you want it
timothy rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him asking `` who are we going to call on in the northeast section ''
`` it does '' shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his in the green jungle parking lot
not more than a block or so ''
`` i told you mike '' said rourke in an aggrieved voice
two men in the front seat
`` what are they doing here ''
if they are beach cops on a stake out they'll admit it to a reporter
he crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant
be excited and dont identify yourself
the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill
he went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives in the front seat
they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didnt think either of them had recognized him or could describe him
got no business over here on a stake out anyway ''
i wouldnt have to tell them i had roberts
he felt his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand
he held the razor well out to one side
there was a fixed grin on roberts' face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood
roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly
roberts careened backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs
it seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do
one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet
he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby
then he went back for roberts
he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier
he could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out
he got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit
it landed on roberts' sprawled right thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground
he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room
the courthouse was a white stucco building minus the customary dome
i think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later
she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment
`` last year
`` was her name lisa carmody ''
`` have they inherited some money or something ''
`` sure '' said hirey
he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leather bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls
in a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room
he tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him
this time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of one and two line social notes in each issue
the air conditioner was no longer running
unless he was stone blind the person who'd just left couldnt have missed seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room
until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing

she had it all planned out how she'd do
prettier she'd do her hair another way
mendoza didnt wake until nearly nine thirty
what then ''
oh well you cant really blame lolotte
drink your coffee ''
ben and lucien have gone after them
she was deeply horribly sure that lucien had filled it with opium
it would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor
that was not reasonable either
but well she'd be very careful
she thrust the envelope back in the bag
glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice
`` we'll go to the storehouse ''
and the fields were green and growing
besides there was something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her
lolotte held a patch of leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for george's poised hammer
rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning
glendora ''
always provided that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it
i didnt think there was any reason to ''
`` then again he might not ''
`` i dont think anything
i'm telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off ''
he simply walked not noticing where he was not caring
emotionally they penetrated him not at all
for fifty five years he had lived progressing towards a no goal eating working breathing without plan without reason
he looked at gilborn with undisguised curiosity
he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed him
quickly he went into the bedroom
who
the figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter
that was one of the things she liked about stanley
but he hadnt understood
it was nothing that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal
indeed there was a woman who unasked had already given him love
blanche knew all this because the door to stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could hear everything that was said
while they were away blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically out of habit
`` also if you're going to believe those prints you'll have to look for a killer who's a top grade piano player ''
by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats
you've been away from home for the new year festivities but now the party is over and you come home
instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs
we were not however prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came up the stairs
i dont remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures
he was dressed in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor mans country weekend
`` that much latin we remember '' gibby said dryly
`` the past i leave to historians '' felix intoned demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy
the happy one could never have looked happier
`` past yes but important
nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world ''
this was a broth of a boy our felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit
when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night
they were all completely shrouded
outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day
`` reporters ''
you want me to call her ''
they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations
they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub
under the heading of it's an ill wind et cetera ''
any kind of job was better than brooding
andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying
didnt they tell you what i wanted the p a system for ''
`` someday '' bonner said `` you're going to ask us for help
he stalled for a half hour longer hoping to hear something from vecchio about the ransom money
`` no
he may try to phone us ''
the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge
rocco vecchio a perspiring haggard vecchio was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards
this particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency
someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped
`` did you hear them
vecchio shouldered in
the place had the air of a morgue
the old man gave the room a stare in leaving
his father looked him over closely
`` they took it away overalls or something ''
`` mae we're so busy
he couldnt see the grin that split her mouth
i stalled him off
he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face
what did she think he could do
though his inner thoughts cringed at it he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child
it was just that little accidents played into her hands
even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake to head up the road for home doing her bidding
he was straight something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report something
it would be such a relief
he looked up and down the street
and then you wiped up some grease ''
`` i dont remember any overalls at all ''
she shook her head
or are the eyebrows more like this ''
but gardner willings was not included
the hotel king arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems
there were other roofs less convenient but not impossible
who measures
detective pearson eighteenth precinct thought for a time he might be on to something
at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches
sort things out damn it
he had left after the scuffle
ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a tiger
also he thought i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun
but it happened almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young
opportunity was obvious
`` right ''
would certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder
on the other hand they or it seemed to have no legs whatever
it was not whatever tale was told by tails
and possessed himself how
two martinis for lunch that was the trouble
`` they wont talk about who gave the information
`` if there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later
with his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying `` uh huh '' and `` i see '' at intervals
no other cause of death apparent
`` so there it is '' he said
the police chief shook his head over it
he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high priced lawyers
garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it
she wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most
mrs meeker hadnt struck him as ready to seek anyone's advice least of all garth's
twenty five thousand to each of the great nieces in oregon not much to blood relatives out of millions ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another
there were no other names madden recognized
madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund
he would offer no theory to account for her murder
nevertheless he made a mental note to look into garth's financial background
a newspaper open at stock market reports lay on one of them
the safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred and fifty unused left hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemens ball tickets from last year and thirty seven cents in coins and stamps
leave me alone gun thought
it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer
he was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom
`` do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time ''
`` but you didnt know a thing about it did you ''
`` i might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped ''
`` i didnt think accacia knew so many big words lieutenant ''
`` let's not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant '' killpath nasaled
i thought you hadnt come in yet ''
because he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid watch pencil pusher just to please his ulcerated pro tem captain
on the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez prop and under that se habla espanol
`` why dont you just hire somebody else ''
all this went through casey's mind in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all
the girls eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched casey's hand
she made a face at him and then she laughed
because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burtons car was still there
he put the basket down distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof
he put the shells on the table as though he could no longer bear to hold them
`` yeah ''
casey believed that much
`` look '' he said
`` just be sure to send your two best boys tony ''
he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible
when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent
a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break
`` now ''
poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks
no one had prayed
it hung over them like a cloud its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun
`` and the deadliest '' poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness
clasping his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky
the small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised up to watch it heading south
sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure
poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead
the fin on his foot caught on the moulding throwing him off balance
the sudden silence was too silent
`` hurts like hell for a second then it disappears ''
the moment the sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic
suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not sinking
relentlessly nick held on sucking on the hose inhaling the air that belonged to poet

although bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office
julia buck the deceased '' moore said slipping me his smug idiot grin again
`` i'll collar tim before night ''
there's no doubt this tim sneaked back and killed mrs buck
powerful hands had killed her
`` naw we'll use mine '' moore said opening the door of a sleek white jaguar roadster
she calmly repeated what moore had told me
`` no sir
they had a son killed in the war ''
mrs tim williams was about 21 with skin the color of bitter chocolate and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers she was startlingly pretty
he strong as a bull but gentle as a baby
i knew she was lying
that jaguar could really barrel along
he said `` you bet
she mumbled `` i just know that chief moore is out to kill my tim ''

alec was growing more and more skeptical
try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself between eleven pm and one am the night you arrive ''
on the train alec refreshed his memory of the beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies spot news stories about the crime sent out by the pearson city star a member of the syndicate press
stacy said he left her suite at nine forty five pm
forbes had motive and stacy had opportunity
the clerk's smile congealed
he was looking dangerous now
`` no ''
it was blackmail and the clerk knew it
it was a neat setup for murder
table covers and towels were clean ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches
`` were you on duty here two weeks ago ''
as he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover
in less than five minutes alec was asleep
he let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily feigning sleep
someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window
alec waited a moment on guard
he was familiar with this type
demanded alec
only that curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight
`` sister '' said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven ''
red and handley god help them knew the old dogtown lore
there is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture look at that mahogany highboy behind you which has a provocative emanation if i may say so
just think of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger her real name was dorcas and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass
i myself have identified about sixty sites from the old maps and registers
i'd often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching
they married cousins anta and freya norberg
no i dont hold with those who live entirely among dead things
a sensual man but very courteous some would say slick
`` by god it's that damn handley the sneak ''
the beech pasture had suddenly become valuable
a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day i saw handley escorting anta red's wife up on dogtown common
you would call these the motives of crime
anta his wife never seemed to mind
but his new found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the mans eyes were still clear
his shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment
when the light went their way they went on across the street
thanks anyhow ''
phil rubbed his forehead wearily
`` fine
`` it's my line of work '' he said
by wednesday the landlord was still alive
he muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator
the stranger's eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings
his real grievance was lolly
he'd have to start going to some of the other places again
`` but why pay her bills
now i see
he felt very cunning very proud of himself as he played on the other mans soft spot
`` of course it looked like an accident
he said `` jist stay still
he drank and handed it back
his `` sure sure '' was enthusiastic this time
i introduced my friend larry to pops and we made ourselves comfortable
the second bottle passed a few times
out cold if not dead

i nodded to charlie
it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes
and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so we take that
we've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent
being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger and we werent picked up by a cop
we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow
we met at maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the evening to talk things out
shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first
if you draw the short straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take off to visit my sister in frisco
`` i was hoping you'd say that willy
he studied them compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in
he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet
`` oh ''
`` a fine idea '' mike agreed
but he was looking forward to snow seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had read walking barefoot rolling in it
it is mars isnt it
he hesitated
he had not known it until asked
for mars ''
`` you are all right my brother ''
turn just a little
this went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful
the purpose was less immediate
you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me
oh you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself
otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig in
mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches
we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago

she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her frigid way though in public she would be dry eyed

sigmen himself must have foreseen it
they would sleep while the gabriels drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured
and from the first he faced a difficult task
it was true that they could be approximated but would the ozagenians understand these approximations
this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already established premise
at last gabriel spoke
`` i did not perceive this essential distinction either first born '' hesperus said at once `` i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal ''
recovering the property was much less important ''
yes those could be commodities under this concept
what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws
out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations
secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters
what's going on here
nothing
it seemed unlikely that her crew if either of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light year
it was clear that langer had at last found a way to attract the angels attention
and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous
will you obstruct this or will you help
hesperus was in there
his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face
this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system
ekstrohm asked
`` i think they're dead '' ekstrohm interjected quietly
`` i'm not worried about you mis reading the dials nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all
it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow
the surveyor looked sidewise at the captain
`` no it isnt '' ekstrohm said
`` i dont know about that
`` suppose it was not us that killed these aliens
there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground
what had changed for him
but he never slept
ekstrohm had to hide his secret
the angry burnt red face of ryan greeted him
`` gone ''
`` why pick me for your patsy
`` what could i do with your lousy dead bodies
i give you my word i'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition

for helva was destined to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship partnered with a man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half
shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the well oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe
she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel
`` yes we have quite a few years of voice training madam '' remarked helva calmly
`` work ''
the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate
`` we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect ''
she approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and instrumental
it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased
she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine
tanner wisecracked
`` no directives from central is scarcely a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you you beautiful thing ''
`` isnt it wonderful
with most of his mind he was happy
that would make b'dikkat happy ''
but isnt this nice ''
after a long time the half man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms
he remembered them well from his happy period
that's out of a play
we all know when it is going to happen
i mean we know the order in which things happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of us know how long anything takes
once again b'dikkat moved among them like a father
he forgot the order
finally mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin
the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat
there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less
they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all
the front part of my head was called a face and i could talk with it
the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work
he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm
they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty
leaning his winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl
she was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms that he wasnt even sure she was conscious
he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two
`` are we in wyoming ''
`` this is a mighty empty country '' morgan said
the girls thin face haunted him
`` i've been mucking in a mine in the san juan but i used to work on a ranch
she rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair
then she murmured `` you're very kind mr morgan
`` and hungry '' he said
she said `` i guess the lord looks out for fools drunkards and innocents ''
`` no she'll be all right '' jones said quickly
the bed isnt made but you'll find plenty of blankets there ''
i just cant take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together ''
he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide
just a half breed 'pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with me
he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder
i saw you driftin away but i tried
the eyes followed him fearfully
the mare had backed away
we may take her with us to california
`` yes like a father and son ''
`` they'll trample it down
the two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness
the silence oppressed him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search
lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire
first he thought of the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley
he turned to lester
`` he killed tom do you understand that ''
the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavins stallion
and he was fleeing running fleeing his death and his life at the same time
a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard
he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek
he had none here
`` we'll stampede the rest
dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms
`` running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock ''
there's bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close ''
he located his man
this time it connected solidly on the mans temple felling him
the sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy in case of need
`` you're lighter than me
you might need it
these poured through the gate and joined the flight
all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half clad or hardly clad at all
mike crawled to the door and peered in
he set his bundle down
one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack
the iron hinges held but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars
the wagons were burning fiercely
hurry ''
hustle ''
`` no
using his hands as a trumpet he shouted `` fort up
oso gave me an unruffled look
hell they were fightin each other so hard they had no time for anyone else
i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight
more of an agricultural nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains
''
wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors
they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine chilling scalp cry
gradually they emerged as men
my god how long is he going to wait i thought
he jerked once in the grass and lay still
far up the valley i could see the rees circling and reorganizing
`` for christ's sake dont waste your powder on one of 'em ''
he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started to slump
but a few reached our wall
the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again
the aricaras made one last desperate charge
it wouldnt matter to a fool like you
that fire's too big
why should i
`` from a man in st louis '' wilson said
`` carwood didnt tell you that '' she said
i meant what i said about that fire
he meant to say more but he never got the chance
he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps
`` i am
`` i can take care of this
they could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out
`` not now '' wilson said
`` i've had enough of that
he had forgotten that she was so pretty
`` go to sleep '' he said
that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken down ranch house his hopes had been high
the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard
he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him
there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow under and places so steep that cattle wouldnt stop to graze
the town was about what wilson expected one main street with its rows of false fronted buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel
i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded
his authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further
hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it i could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck
what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me
having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself
this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below
i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to
the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it
as i had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application
i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green tinted soft collar
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there
if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it
when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped
atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin
it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all
she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail
knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man
pamela was glad jim was nowhere near
silence came into the forest a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees
she seemed to have come such a long distance too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees
where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene
but she did not know which way to go
every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy
`` to me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams an the sweetest flower that grows ''
he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important as well as pleasin to the ear and he didnt want to miss a word of it
`` well
after a time he straightened again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping it from his six dollar levis and his tailored twenty five dollar shirt
he was handsome with his coal black hair and eyes his fine chiseled features
he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot wearer
now are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk ''
for god's sake ''
`` i '' she broke off frowning
the car lurched along at a snails crawl the left front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself
it was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields
he said
`` i know you've got a grudge against me and maybe i cant blame you
not immediately as the deputy demanded
now he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck
and he could no longer think of face saving of honor but only of escape
he couldnt see
donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him
there was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive
conchita kept an eye on the twins and little elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing
you too sean
at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything
`` wait a little while
`` a year luis
`` but to take him and leave his mother behind is not good ''
like luis i cant see something like this happening to me
finally luis hernandez said `` what must be must be
the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles
it was dark early because of the storm
with red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe
he hardly noticed the blue green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder
it was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late
the other five slash b men followed them inside crowding the small room
he lifted the skirt of macklins coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk
come on the key
`` get it out '' brannon ordered
they returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on houston street
they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle
a split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded
he was a man those neighbors testified later who didnt have a friend in the world
`` that's all i ask ''
prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment
publicly he denied everything
`` fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man andy ross mentioned later
and he collapsed and died instantly
`` exterminatin cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' he'd blandly announce
`` but well it just dont seem sportin somehow ''
the lesson had been learned
jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated
the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week
by 1898 rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in wyoming
tell her to come here to the hotel ''
he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadnt before noticed
the fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that diane's information had been wrong but curt didnt interpret it this way
again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor
the startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall
a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop
you wont be needing this ''
there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen
one with blood all over it arbuckle's blood ''
`` having all the guns makes you a big man dont it adams
curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high
somewhere in the distance a woman screamed
pain shot up curt's arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit
so the pitchfork whistled over curt's head
curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor
`` you mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' curt said
`` who's in there ''
curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it
`` sally '' admonished her mother `` you've got all evening to visit with dan
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening
`` nate ''
slipping her hand in his they silently watched the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight
`` what about burnsides ''
the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals
`` come spring you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal ''
but she couldnt not yet
no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep
leaning forward in her chair gran nearsightedly scrutinized dans face
`` but the sunll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling ''
besides 'taint no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's i can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch ''
men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about
separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars
against all expectation carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him
`` he's there '' he got out tersely curbing his rising excitement
looking the setup over stevens started coolly for the rear of the place
small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side
russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach
straightening up his eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson
we can soon tell ''
pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out
`` i'll shove along home ''
`` but i still think penny's an awful nice girl russ ''
he asked himself
so far as he knew only his father could be there
if he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later
he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind
sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment
cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan
the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle
`` yeah
the control tower gave him immediate take off permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar and hope that it didnt close in before they returned
if the other pilots were worried they did not show it
his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights
greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home
the same old question
but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was the enemy and he hadnt been spotted already
let's make sure first ''
greg pushed the radio button again
`` they're japs
a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done
perfect he thought
it did not seem possible that they hadnt been spotted
the jap's propeller flew off in pieces
he held the controls where they had been
i waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass
still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its pre war chrome nearly blinding me
how far i knew will shortly become apparent
`` no i dont '' johnson said
`` in back buddy '' the driver said to me
but it was only johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cab's glassless rear window
johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it
i regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window
the beer foamed furiously
i tossed the bottle
but johnson couldnt quickly unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer
looking back i saw a gray haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number
i quickly turned around and began to drink
`` no i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all i could think of was '' this time she stopped the rush of words herself
would you like a drink or coffee ''
`` i forgive ''
i cried
in a waterfall and all that ''
`` i couldnt agree with you more ''
their product had been endorsed by good housekeeping the ama and the veterinary journal among other repositories of higher wisdom and before much longer if you didnt have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you didnt bathe
`` yes he didnt
but i'm pleased to hear ''
there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive
or at least not to joyce
`` itch ''
i shook my head
you'd better hurry ''
i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door
two uniformed officers a couple of plain clothesmen i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left
present at the scene in addition to the dead man who was indeed louis thor had been thor's partner bill blake and antony rose an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account
actually only two men know what the formula is blake and '' he stopped and looked at thor's body
too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living
the arrangement turned out to be excellent
she looked more like twenty five or six
that she impressed me instantly was obvious
i felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and i a nude model
some women with father fixations do
i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bear like crush
`` you're the man
she raised a protesting hand with a startled air
in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell
when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it ''
i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date
i exclaimed
a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith and that might be good for something
his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months
not by the 1100 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep
to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied `` ok i can use this blanket
his advice his voice saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair this was all new
`` his address '' walter added `` is that great foundling home the american express
he began sweating
twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the grafins pension her tears dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath
meredith was irritated when the grafin knocked at his door and told him `` she is a great beauty
in the small gallery used as the guests' dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress
as she was rather tired this evening her simple `` thank you for the use of your bath '' when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control
like as if it were built of books ''
meredith's voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it
the third time rather urgently
the third time rather urgently
he commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips
the water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste
she asked smolderingly
she scoffed
somewhere we'll hit a trail ''
actually she had hated him before she ever saw him
`` they wouldnt have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around ''
the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp limbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead
the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel
the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising
now and then the glistening side of a half swamped object showed as it swept past
she did not call out
he let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water
a terrible numbing sense of futility swept over him
their jams and jellies had not suffered
he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs
heave on those ropes
already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water
`` god help us if we're near the island of eromonga
of course males play a role there but believe me when i say you wouldnt enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga
we had drifted closer
it was embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen
in ngandlu
thirty minutes later the outrigger grated on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder
i looked with revulsion at the legs
we are very proud of it ''
they despise males who brag of their strength
my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
but in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled
`` karipo's women then named this place ' eromonga ' manhood for just the strongest men could stay here
for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened
`` nope just you all the time sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent partner ''
`` if you want to see something he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car ''
every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear
he had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run
she began to watch a blonde haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly
the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top
it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine
the man had spoken only once
ramey's fist and the air expelled from the mans collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together
even yet there was no realization in his eyes
the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back
a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again
`` all right step back ''
it was only then that he turned to look at penny
and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty
`` the snake was beautiful wasnt it ''
you love this village and these stinking brown people because they're god's creatures too
she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because keith was between her and the invader
wing commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves
he enjoyed killing
he was aware of her as a frightfully good looking american wac a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the command offices but that was all
no dates or hand holding
there was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered
she came from ohio from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmer type farmers
when they got to shillong in assam he was happy
they came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools
he was frowning
`` the equipment was fine '' rob stated standing up
`` no it wasnt that '' rob said
not right away ''
`` anyway '' waddell went on
mr forsythe exclaimed
he was thinking big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started
`` i do not drink so much thank you ''
`` i agree yes ''
waddell asked frowning
`` but surely you have misunderstood mr roy
herr schaffner said
`` on the basis of the facts ''
this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop
`` by god '' waddell said `` we dont want to upset the boy at this time of all times
fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions
and make my life different and better from this time on
anyway i wasnt down long enough to matter
he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting
his comrades were all dead
the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though debating whether to brave the sunlight
the marines let him advance
faint creaking of belts and slings
the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound
it ended when he tumbled
they could come on him now without difficulty
with a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back
then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief
the marine blinked soon dropping his hand
`` be a good turtle ''
the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was dripping
the marine yelled and flung the hand away
the marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach
then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat
the marine nodded vigorously
popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted
his head slumped
only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were
he didnt stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver
his head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling
another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor
blue throat wont stand for this
any posse riding down the street to demand blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire
blue throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed
he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun slinging character in the book
billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named ed dunn who lived at rock fort
seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher ed dunn
the men behind them were bill doolin and five of his gang every man a killer
one false move on his part and he would be a dead man
even as he spoke those words billy tilghmans life hung on a thread
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately
miss langford her first name was evelyn was an attractive girl
he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating
`` what's the matter honey ''
`` dont you play hard today then
charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school
`` how'd you do it ''
if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself ''
the children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse
`` maybe '' jack said idly watching for miss langford
`` it was my fault ''
`` i dont believe i'll play any more neither ''
`` all right if you cant do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' miss langford said firmly not smiling
he had been conning the freights for a long long time now
he held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune belly
his thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however
we run a respectable house here ''
we dont know this guy ''
these two were going to be easy pickins
`` that aint your name mister '' the boy accused
he had it all doped of course
after a while kitty murmured something to cappy and he held her close answering `` we'll just have to wait till we pull into philly honey ''
`` whynt ya say so fellow travelers
charcoal ''
when they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back and cappy offered ernie a cigarette
she looked down at her hands too
cappy raged at himself
he thought pull out of it old son
ernie stared at the man
the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring
he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car
he held the knife aloft an instant an instant enough to press the stud
yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june
but youth asked nothing of its parents not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing
`` no no
mauve colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of mans tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again
the old mans very soul could have left him and flown down that street but he wouldnt have had anyone know it
sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city
above it from a second story showroom wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood
he was holding out for something
he would not carry a brief case
laura did not answer him
pompeii called again `` laura ''
`` you're boiling milk aint you ''
he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldnt raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back
little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery
maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more
she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck
maggie started laughing and she laughed so hard she couldnt stop and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining
and grandma isnt strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i ''
maggie laughed
there werent facilities to take care of them
something had to be done
they lived mainly in the kitchen
`` the only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it '' eugenia said
she's married that tenant
kizzie turned to go inside
why should i want pictures of an empty room now
she was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable
`` under the window in stormy weather
`` why lacerate the congregation ''
but this last time he drank not to brace but `` to tolley ''
he really hadnt meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr robards
nerves mr robards said just a nip anyway
the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure
now she must be thinking of a boy name something special
he had a good idea why not
it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss sis had given him to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next if you please and that much as she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs robards and the children
miss jen was funny that way funny that she didnt seem to take to his ideas and perk up
miss kiz wont care your comin will she ''
their childhood would have been quite circumspect without hetty's flair for drama especially through the long summers
she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice
before anything else she would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten garden
rosa unbelievably was not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human
the cemetery slumbered just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea
he scowled at her flowers
his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text
he had never spoken once to the awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishing boat captain and powerful like the sea
man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit
`` you've not had your breakfast yet grandad ''
`` come on do
`` god rest her soul she was a sweet one
both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` dorothy tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible
a pitiful few of them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors
ships from the west coast rotated on six month tours of duty with the seventh fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleet's principal port for maintenance upkeep and shore liberty
there was a fifty fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different
tommy said out of her cold rage
`` take off fly boy ''
there are beauties from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and back in the blessed united states they were regarded simply as pretty women
seeing these did nothing for tommy's mood
one had to have friends and a congenial life in after duty hours
and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach
the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief
doc had been under restriction to the ship since the bustard left subic
we live down by the base commissary
there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog
imagine a stag dinner with toodle williams ''
probably saw me in the lobby
`` why is that ''
`` you know that's very interesting
`` oh i just come once a week
`` that's hardly a christian approach '' she remonstrated
why go on
but what do you want to do about the lay sisters
he heard her knocking on another door
he felt suddenly elated adventurous
the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers
`` what you need is a steady martingale '' the cowboy announced after watching owen play

`` something about the pollen ''
we'll get it in a hurry and get it out ''
spencer shook his head
the two met in the captains cabin
heiser breathless and wild eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places
adrien deslonde hastened to alexander's side
one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson
`` that would be worse than useless '' alexander broke in
we are going to be rushed and murdered ''
`` we ourselves must stand sentinel ''
he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer
now the hope was gone
`` yes sir
he said `` cromwell is telling you the truth
this tragic lad had forged his own shackles
`` nothing to lose either spencer ''
this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized
i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms
the dirty discolored buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above our heads
he left us
they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces
he did not return my interest
we walked down the cool hall silently
she passed by him
when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass
rachel faced me
she loved the children
she chose it
i'd like to know that very much ''
he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted
all his family was dead except for his son
then she continued with energy `` i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father
he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him
she let him lead her around
for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun dreaming too
wednesday nights after youth fellowship
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wont tell a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that is being an old maid too
even when he is on the way to memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside of you

so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not listening exactly but rather feeling
there was no lock because herman didnt allow a lock
i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver
he said `` that may be but it isnt authentic the way readers think
he had style a real inner vision of his very own
we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another
the night we first met at one of mrs monmouth's giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt
we went into mrs monmouth's library which had low bookshelves all along the walls and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb
`` painting isnt this big you know
i was fascinated
i said
`` yes it sounds great '' i said `` but suppose you dont think of yourself as an impressionist painter ''
he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did
after a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldnt feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the brush off reading out to work
`` ida where is the car license ''
`` i'm sure she'd turn it over to you if you'd rather
`` what a fool i've been '' she said quietly
`` dont bother ida '' she said
but the next day sunday
and she
and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again `` on the boat people liked me for myself ''
it's so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic
and they have never changed
no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal and she has never come to see me since
then via called to say they had decided to cremate her as they had ellen the thought leaped to my mind and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning
`` uhhu '' she said hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid
`` me ''
he asked trying to touch a part of her life alberto hadnt discussed
this is my town
he wondered
`` what's the matter with them ''
`` what's the matter with it ''
they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens
he had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps
why did he want her to go to church
could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now
just the same he thought pondering over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church
let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' he said as if he were joking
and they sat down and began their little coffee party
had sam ever lived in a boxcar
agnese had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware
did signor raymond understand
he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach
elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small curious clusters
telling you ''
they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl
drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband ''
but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote
they all know your foolish name ''
turning the girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his arms hanging long and resigned
it was they who held the future in their hands
then again they would stand in circles making other preparations
they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance
she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white birch and maples
the reedy music of the frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was vibrant
and then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lower cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning
he recognized his jacket and trousers
alex poldowski in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman
he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door
he was actually walking down the stairs
`` uncle george ''
`` i'm about to leave myself
that's my wish
he raised them
`` i'm fine julie
`` i'll take that julie for you ''
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed
`` oh just sort of everything in general ''
he could see the stone building where he lived
`` take care of yourself then ''
`` i bumped into a door handle '' george said
tell sam not to worry about the car
`` yes i thought you'd probably be up
he'll understand you might give him sort of a tactful nudge
okay
yet if he said make an excuse yourself come out here today she would have been on the next train and similarly if she had been in need he would have gone to her
lucy listened
as he looked at her it registered anxiety
remember what happened the last time ''
`` it depends on the widow ''
myra loved big cities
was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon washed river
but they werent just friends lucy thought
his voice had sharp edges as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment
nice ''
she had let jim go with a chilly good by a chillier kiss
she had a day of things to do
since myra had always put most of greg's money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed
susan was an active character
there was a momentary pause and then her mother said `` how long is she supposed to stay ''
again there was that curious pause and then her mother said `` i guess i do
for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her and when she found her voice anger thickened it
she's not going to get away with it
unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand
here he was enclosed and safe
every night when he wanted a drink of water didnt he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light
son
when you get back i'll probly be swimming better than victoria
he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg
`` watch it big shot '' a hoarse voice yelled back
`` is ''
that's short for quintus
`` sometimes eleven fourteen a day ''
`` a cane's mighty handy
`` holy mackerel that's the most unique dog i ever saw '' she said firmly
even though this is my rock you can use it sometimes
`` no
camels in tripoli had harelips
`` books are for schnooks ''
that dog has to go ''
his encylopedia agreed with sabella
once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered `` dont feel like it '' he was tempted to tell her about being scared
`` yeah keen ''
it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung
hadnt linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years
linda accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around pittsburgh
it got worse instead of better
`` well you shouldnt underestimate edythe '' mousie said
she didnt have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart
though that may be unfair since ben cooper johns first son came along early in 1938 the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes nary a trace of edythe
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company
linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed bobbie's death could move her to feeling
linda would have to wait she knew
she asked bobbie
`` i think we're agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive
the job at funk wasnt particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of linda's family
i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour
but if you're worried you can go home and check ''
please janice
her face was flushed from sleep
`` that's mrs roberts again '' i said
she didnt even give me a chance to refuse
her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead
her eyes were wild
wally's lost his job
she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you dont go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning
whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine
seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side
now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough
it was easy enough to say it because of course we couldnt spare a cent
but it would only be for a couple of weeks until they get straightened out ''
it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do
`` you're too lazy to go out and look for another job
`` you can get something '' nadine would snap
part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital
maybe i didnt see as much of gladdy as i'd like but how much worse it would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice went send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding home
it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too
i'm chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds
we didnt get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights
her coarse hair was two colored bleached blonde and its real dirty gray
i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak
i asked
that done i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind
but that was ridiculous of course
but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in low tones
`` no ''
`` will you tell me why ''
her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was
she could have found out my first name of course that wouldnt be difficult
`` what's the matter joe you scared of me
the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego ''
if i let her go she'd disappear once more
the metal tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water
i was twenty one back then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of rhine main
i never got there
is your evening free ''
i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils so help me then switched to tuborg
i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up
she saw me and sat down beside me three feet away
after a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh `` you have snow in your hair and ears ''
`` well women and unhappiness go together '' i observed profoundly adding `` you can wager your derriere on that ''
she asked
there wasnt much light in the blue dark but i could see her well
i sensed no stranger in her
maybe closer to thirty i thought
i gave it to the woman
the coffee wasnt very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good
`` i didnt really use yours '' she went on
`` what is this from ''
he must have thought i was a tourist
she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight
the spanish steps
the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches
she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her
this letter would have got to me if she hadnt even put rome italy on it
theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george
can you think of anything to do ''
cousin emma is alone in that big old house and wont hear to parting from it
i really shouldnt have smoked a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick
he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them
they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in august to get cousin emma's house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september
`` mi diapiace signora ma insomma
i never heard my folks talk about her though
honest kitten that's all it is i dont even like lucille much ''
the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too
and he wouldnt leave her either he'd told me that
`` i always imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that
`` and never show my face or my truck around here again ''
he'd just admitted it to me
my very first time
always ''
it's never wrong if love is real ''
wouldnt johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness
he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half
love you ''
i hadnt been doing as much work as i used to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever
outside the hall i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my elbow
my folks wouldnt dream of having alcohol in the house so my first taste of it had been of course with johnnie
i drew back
under normal circumstances he had a certain bright eyed all american boy charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs
and where was the thing
the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked
in these damp circumstances he was an odds on bet to develop pneumonia
she studied him briefly
his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in
he scrawled `` sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added `` dont you eat ''
now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink
`` oh yes
that pale kind's the worst ''
he looked more closely
it gave him a good feeling
he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper
`` you wont if you're looking for a redhead
finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note
it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own
`` that mrs kirby
but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister
third base ''
this brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar
`` you're in for trouble ''
when deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips
the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field
he was followed by four of his men
`` stop it will you
the first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for mike's head
mike was slow getting into the box this time
deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound
`` it's a helluva thing '' mike said looking at phil `` when a guy's own team mate wont come out and help him in a fight ''
you didnt think it was necessary ''
and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around
phil had to clear his throat
i am saying you're not a professional ballplayer ''
`` now dont tell me what a good ball player you are
or even the way you run bases
he's wrong
you'll get your pay in the morning ''
phil sighed
the leagues are full of guys like that ''
`` will you do it phil ''
`` dont worry '' frankie said
for his birthday because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend avesta and a little image of the indian god acala
although he still didnt speak to anyone he grew fond of saying `` the future lies in asia '' when the opportunity arose and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies
as for the book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york
he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo
three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier
`` for a minute anyhow
this is the interesting part richard '' she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking
fudo the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala
on the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon
he walked all the miles back to his room
i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time
my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly
i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly plowed earth from between my pale hands
the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience
i felt the anger mount within me
he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me
he tried to take my hand to show me
this snake could not harm anything ''
there was a contorted ugliness now
the boy came around behind me dragging the stake
`` dont '' i said
cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort
it wouldnt help anyway
he put down his pipe and started to type
his chief motivation for enrolling at hanford is the desire to ''
he told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics
half of it was natural half was smith college
`` i was just thinking how things have changed
he's president of the rocket club here you know
so sorry
he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose
cady deep in thought neither heard nor answered
`` dont worry about it dave
he looks a little bit frayed ''
hanford college hasnt decided on dave's application yet
cady stuck his jaw out
david's interests
`` but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts ''
`` all right
cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel
but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold
you cant run a war with ninety nine generals and one private ''
but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug
they married
`` now i'm not going to pick up those shorts ''
they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face
dolores stood motionless in the doorway
all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks
he shivered
it wasnt even true that he'd said he was sorry that time
these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment
they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing
but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything
he had thought her exactly what he wanted
when the solution finally came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before
she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male looseness while she remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body
he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him
as a prominent industrialist you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group
shortly after freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas
feeling his power freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer
in the end he said `` i'm not enchanted by the proposition sir
cant you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles ''
if we dont take care the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels ''
he forgot about a z till unhappily he and hamrick were proved correct
will you see if you can help me ''
`` your alternative is breathtaking '' he said `` and i'm frank in saying a bit mad
`` i should explain there's more here for me than advocating my little dream there's you

`` i'm an advertising hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere
we've got rid of the steam yachts and georgian houses and the bloated too expensive automobile is next
if we cant raise the capital we're through
`` all the in laws have got to have their day '' adam said and glared at william and freddy in turn
had listed himself for mormon beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said `` with your beard dear you ought to be in movies ''
the detective commenting on barco's behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged that he was a more or less harmless `` nut ''
now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at
but to welch's chagrin the police captain pooh poohed welch's credulity in barco's confession
he queried
orders were given to dig
said the digger
i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand
viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing the host or the character of the party she had gone
