empty
the sonnets
by william shakespeare
empty
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the world's due by the grave and thee
empty
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
empty
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self love to stop posterity
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee
empty
upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
which used lives th' executor to be
empty
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never resting time leads summer on
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'er snowed and bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
empty
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beauty's treasure ere it be self killed
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
that's for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self willed for thou art much too fair
to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
empty
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his new appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
so thou thy self out going in thy noon
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
empty
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none'
empty
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consum'st thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murd'rous shame commits
empty
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lov'st is most evident
for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
or to thy self at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee
empty
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
empty
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silvered o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
empty
o that you were your self but love you are
no longer yours than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
your self again after your self's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so
empty
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
empty
when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new
empty
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify your self in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
can make you live your self in eyes of men
to give away your self keeps your self still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
empty
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age
be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
empty
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
empty
devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young
empty
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
empty
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven it self for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with aprils first born flowers and all things rare
that heavens air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heavens air
let them say more that like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell
empty
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for my self but for thee will
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gav'st me thine not to give back again
empty
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
empty
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein 'tis held
and perspective it is best painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart
empty
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed
empty
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
empty
weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for my self no quiet find
empty
that am debarred the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressed
and each though enemies to either's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please him thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
empty
when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon my self and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings
empty
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end
empty
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me
empty
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bett'ring of the time
and though they be outstripped by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'
empty
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
empty
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
empty
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
my self corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
empty
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
unless thou take that honour from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report
empty
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me
empty
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
empty
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is't but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain
empty
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste of what thy self refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
to bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
empty
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me
empty
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but here's the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
empty
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
empty
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
i must attend time's leisure with my moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of either's woe
empty
the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these present absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad
empty
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impanelled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
and my heart's right thy inward love of heart
empty
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
empty
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
empty
against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against my self uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause
empty
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that case and that repose to say
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind
empty
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go
empty
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in that long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lacked to hope
empty
what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
on helens cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart
empty
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwooed and unrespected fade
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
empty
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that your self arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes
empty
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to day by feeding is allayed
to morrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
to morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
return of love more blest may be the view
or call it winter which being full of care
makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
empty
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill
empty
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand th' account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
th' imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you your self may privilage your time
your self to pardon of self doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
empty
if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amis
the second burthen of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise
empty
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
empty
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near
empty
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for my self mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
self so self loving were iniquity
'tis thee my self that for my self i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days
empty
against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to age's steepy night
are vanishing or vanished out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green
empty
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down rased
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state it self confounded to decay
that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose
empty
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright
empty
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and gilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue tied by authority
and folly doctor like controlling skill
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone
empty
ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace it self with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad
empty
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament it self and true
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore
empty
those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the soil is this that thou dost common grow
empty
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wooed of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
empty
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone
empty
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth
empty
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long
empty
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
too base of thee to be remembered
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains
empty
so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
now counting best to be with you alone
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away
empty
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told
empty
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
empty
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance
empty
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayed
and my sick muse doth give an other place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behaviour beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
empty
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay
empty
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'er read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
empty
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
empty
i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
that barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise
empty
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
empty
my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polished form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so 'tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
empty
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filled up his line
then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine
empty
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgement making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter
empty
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against my self i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
doing thee vantage double vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right my self will bear all wrong
empty
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
as i'll my self disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wronk
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against my self i'll vow debate
for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
empty
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ah do not when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
at first the very worst of fortune's might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so
empty
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their body's force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
of more delight than hawks and horses be
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretchcd make
empty
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
happy to have thy love happy to die
but what's so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
empty
so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though altered new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
in many's looks the false heart's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
empty
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to it self it only live and die
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
empty
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turns to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
empty
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemed
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemed
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report
empty
how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness everywhere
and yet this time removed was summer's time
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowed wombs after their lords' decease
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
empty
when proud pied april dressed in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemed it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play
empty
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stoln of both
and to his robbery had annexed thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee
where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised everywhere
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
empty
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixed'
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now
my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song
empty
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers' pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
empty
let not my love be called idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressed
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
and for they looked but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
empty
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent
what's in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what now to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead
empty
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemed my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that my self bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reigned
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stained
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all
alas 'tis true i have gone here and there
and made my self a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast
empty
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renewed
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me
your love and pity doth th' impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'er green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead
empty
since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisoned 'tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
empty
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
might i not then say 'now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved
empty
accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakened hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love
like as to make our appetite more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love t' anticipate
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
empty
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw my self to win
whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours y'have passed a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remembered
and soon to you as you to me then tendered
the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
empty
'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
not by our feeling but by others' seeing
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign
thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full charactered with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missed
that poor retention could not so much hold
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me
empty
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wond'ring at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime
empty
were't aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou suborned informer a true soul
when most impeached stands least in thy control
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
her audit though delayed answered must be
and her quietus is to render thee
empty
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
but now is black beauty's successive heir
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power
fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so
empty
how oft when thou my music music play'st
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
empty
th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
empty
my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damasked red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare
empty
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
although i swear it to my self alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds
empty
thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack
empty
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed
a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me
empty
so now i have confessed that he is thine
my self i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learned but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fist doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free
empty
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
and 'will to boot and 'will in over plus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one 'will'
empty
if thy soul check thee that i come so near
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with case we prove
among a number one is reckoned none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy store's account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lov'st me for my name is will
empty
thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchored in the bay where all men ride
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferred
empty
when my love swears that she is made of truth
that she might think me some untutored youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flattered be
empty
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
empty
be wise as thou art cruel do not press
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
empty
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be
only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain
empty
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied
empty
lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
one of her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runst thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still
empty
two loves i have of comfort and despair
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman coloured ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
empty
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate'
to me that languished for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate' she altered with an end
that followed it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
'i hate' from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying 'not you'
empty
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead there's no more dying then
empty
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
th' uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are
at random from the truth vainly expressed
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night
empty
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all mens no
how can it o how can love's eye be true
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
empty
canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against my self with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon
revenge upon my self with present moan
what merit do i in my self respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lov'st and i am blind
empty
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantise of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee
empty
love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
empty
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a be

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dians this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
which borrowed from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress' eye love's brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distempered guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress' eyes
empty
the little love god lying once asleep
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
came there for cure and this by that i prove
love's fire heats water water cools not love

rousillon the count's palace
enter bertram the countess of rousillon helena and lafeu all in black
countess in delivering my son from me i bury a second husband
but i must attend his majesty's command to whom i am now in
ward evermore in subjection
lafeu you shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a
father he that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it
up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such
empty
countess what hope is there of his majesty's amendment
lafeu he hath abandond his physicians madam under whose
advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time
countess this young gentlewoman had a father o that 'had' how
sad a passage 'tis whose skill was almost as great as his
honesty had it stretch'd so far would have made nature
immortal and death should have play for lack of work would for
the king's sake he were living i think it would be the death of
the king's disease
lafeu how calld you the man you speak of madam
countess he was famous sir in his profession and it was his
lafeu he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke
of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have
liv'd still if knowledge could be set up against mortality
bertram what is it my good lord the king languishes of
lafeu a fistula my lord
bertram i heard not of it before
lafeu i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the
daughter of gerard de narbon
countess his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts
fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities
there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors
too in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives
her honesty and achieves her goodness
lafeu your commendations madam get from her tears
countess 'tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in
the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek no
you affect a sorrow than to have
helena i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too
lafeu moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive
grief the enemy to the living
countess if the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it
soon mortal
bertram madam i desire your holy wishes
lafeu how understand we that
countess be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father
contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
share with thy birthright love all trust a few
do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
rather in power than use and keep thy friend
under thy own life's key be check'd for silence
but never tax'd for speech what heaven more will
that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
fall on thy head farewell my lord
'tis an unseasond courtier good my lord
lafeu he cannot want the best

countess heaven bless him farewell bertram exit
bertram the best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be

mistress and make much of her
lafeu farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your
father exeunt bertram and lafeu
helena o were that all i think not on my father
than those i shed for him what was he like
i have forgot him my imagination
carries no favour int but bertram's
i am undone there is no living none
if bertram be away 'twere all one
that i should love a bright particular star
and think to wed it he is so above me
in his bright radiance and collateral light
must i be comforted not in his sphere
the hind that would be mated by the lion
must die for love 'twas pretty though a plague
to see him every hour to sit and draw
his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
in our heart's table heart too capable
of every line and trick of his sweet favour
but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
must sanctify his relics who comes here
enter parolles
and yet i know him a notorious liar
think him a great way fool solely a coward
yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
that they take place when virtue's steely bones
looks bleak i' th' cold wind withal full oft we see
cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
parolles save you fair queen
helena and you monarch
parolles no
parolles are you meditating on virginity
helena ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a
question man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it
against him
parolles keep him out
helena but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the
defence yet is weak unfold to us some warlike resistance
parolles there is none man setting down before you will
undermine you and blow you up
is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
parolles virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown
up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves
made you lose your city it is not politic in the commonwealth
of nature to preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
lost that you were made of is metal to make virgins virginity
by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it
is ever lost 'tis too cold a companion away with't
empty
parolles there's little can be said in 't 'tis against the rule
of nature to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
mothers which is most infallible disobedience he that hangs
himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be
buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a
cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with
feeding his own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud
canon keep it not you cannot choose but lose by't out with't
within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly
increase and the principal itself not much the worse away
empty
helena how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
parolles let me see marry ill to like him that ne'er it likes
'tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept
the less worth off with't while 'tis vendible answer the time
of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of
the toothpick which wear not now your date is better in your
pie and your porridge than in your cheek and your virginity
your old virginity is like one of our french wither'd pears it
looks ill it eats drily marry 'tis a wither'd pear it was
formerly better marry yet 'tis a wither'd pear will you
anything with it
helena not my virginity yet
there shall your master have a thousand loves
a mother and a mistress and a friend
a guide a goddess and a sovereign
a counsellor a traitress and a dear
his humble ambition proud humility
his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
his faith his sweet disaster with a world
of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
that blinking cupid gossips now shall he
i know not what he shall god send him well
the court's a learning place and he is one
helena that i wish well 'tis pity
parolles what's pity
helena that wishing well had not a body int
which might be felt that we the poorer born
whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
might with effects of them follow our friends
and show what we alone must think which never
returns us thanks
enter page
parolles little helen farewell if i can remember thee i will
think of thee at court
helena monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star
parolles under mars i
helena i especially think under mars
parolles why under man
helena the wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
under mars
parolles when he was predominant
parolles why think you so
helena you go so much backward when you fight
parolles that's for advantage
helena so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the
composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
a good wing and i like the wear well
parolles i am so full of business i cannot answer thee acutely i
will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall
serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes
thee away farewell when thou hast leisure say thy prayers
when thou hast none remember thy friends get thee a good
husband and use him as he uses thee so farewell
empty
helena our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
gives us free scope only doth backward pull
our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings
to join like likes and kiss like native things
impossible be strange attempts to those
that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
what hath been cannot be who ever strove
to show her merit that did miss her love
the king's disease my project may deceive me
but my intents are fix'd and will not leave me exit
paris the king's palace
flourish of cornets enter the king of france with letters
and divers attendants
king the florentines and senoys are by th' ears
have fought with equal fortune and continue
a braving war
first lord so 'tis reported sir
king nay 'tis most credible we here receive it
a certainty vouch'd from our cousin austria
for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
prejudicates the business and would seem
to have us make denial
first lord his love and wisdom
approv'd so to your majesty may plead
for amplest credence
king he hath arm'd our answer
and florence is denied before he comes
yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
to stand on either part
second lord it well may serve
a nursery to our gentry who are sick
for breathing and exploit
king what's he comes here
enter bertram lafeu and parolles
first lord it is the count rousillon my good lord
young bertram
king youth thou bear'st thy father's face
hath well compos'd thee thy father's moral parts
mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris
bertram my thanks and duty are your majesty's
king i would i had that corporal soundness now
as when thy father and myself in friendship
first tried our soldiership he did look far
into the service of the time and was
discipled of the bravest he lasted long
but on us both did haggish age steal on
to talk of your good father in his youth
he had the wit which i can well observe
to day in our young lords but they may jest
till their own scorn return to them unnoted
ere they can hide their levity in honour
so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
were in his pride or sharpness if they were
his equal had awak'd them and his honour
clock to itself knew the true minute when
his tongue obey'd his hand who were below him
he us'd as creatures of another place
and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
making them proud of his humility
in their poor praise he humbled such a man
might be a copy to these younger times
which followed well would demonstrate them now
but goers backward
bertram his good remembrance sir
so in approof lives not his epitaph
as in your royal speech
king would i were with him he would always say
methinks i hear him now his plausive words
he scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
to grow there and to bear 'let me not live'
this his good melancholy oft began
on the catastrophe and heel of pastime
when it was out 'let me not live' quoth he
of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
all but new things disdain whose judgments are
mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
expire before their fashions' this he wish'd
i after him do after him wish too
since i nor wax nor honey can bring home
i quickly were dissolved from my hive
to give some labourers room
second lord you're loved sir
king i fill a place i know't how long is't count
since the physician at your father's died

anon exit steward
enter helena
even so it was with me when i was young
doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
our blood to us this to our blood is born
it is the show and seal of nature's truth
where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
by our remembrances of days foregone
such were our faults or then we thought them none
her eye is sick ont i observe her now
helena what is your pleasure madam
countess you know helen
helena mine honourable mistress
countess nay a mother
why not a mother when i said 'a mother'
methought you saw a serpent what's in 'mother'
that you start at it i say i am your mother
and put you in the catalogue of those
that were enwombed mine 'tis often seen
adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
a native slip to us from foreign seeds
yet i express to you a mother's care
god's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
to say i am thy mother what's the matter
that this distempered messenger of wet
the many colour'd iris rounds thine eye
why that you are my daughter
helena that i am not
countess i say i am your mother
helena pardon madam
i am from humble he from honoured name
no note upon my parents his all noble
my master my dear lord he is and i
his servant live and will his vassal die
he must not be my brother
countess nor i your mother
helena you are my mother madam would you were
so that my lord your son were not my brother
indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
so i were not his sister cant no other
but i your daughter he must be my brother
countess yes helen you might be my daughter in law
god shield you mean it not 'daughter' and 'mother'
so strive upon your pulse what pale again
my fear hath catch'd your fondness now i see
the myst'ry of your loneliness and find
your salt tears' head now to all sense 'tis gross
you love my son invention is asham'd
to say thou dost not therefore tell me true
but tell me then 'tis so for look thy cheeks
confess it th' one to th' other and thine eyes
see it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
that in their kind they speak it only sin
and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
that truth should be suspected speak is't so
if it be so you have wound a goodly clew
if it be not forswear't howe'er i charge thee
to tell me truly
helena good madam pardon me
countess do you love my son
helena your pardon noble mistress
countess love you my son

that before you and next unto high heaven
i love your son
my friends were poor but honest so's my love
be not offended for it hurts not him
that he is lov'd of me i follow him not
by any token of presumptuous suit
nor would i have him till i do deserve him
i know i love in vain strive against hope
yet in this captious and intenible sieve
i still pour in the waters of my love
and lack not to lose still thus indian like
religious in mine error i adore
the sun that looks upon his worshipper
but knows of him no more my dearest madam
let not your hate encounter with my love
for loving where you do but if yourself
did ever in so true a flame of liking
wish chastely and love dearly that your dian
was both herself and love o then give pity
to her whose state is such that cannot choose
but lend and give where she is sure to lose
that seeks not to find that her search implies
but riddle like lives sweetly where she dies
countess had you not lately an intent speak truly
to go to paris
countess wherefore tell true
helena i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
you know my father left me some prescriptions
of rare and prov'd effects such as his reading
and manifest experience had collected
for general sovereignty and that he willd me
in heedfullst reservation to bestow them
as notes whose faculties inclusive were
more than they were in note amongst the rest
to cure the desperate languishings whereof
the king is render'd lost
countess this was your motive
for paris was it speak
helena my lord your son made me to think of this
else paris and the medicine and the king
had from the conversation of my thoughts
haply been absent then
countess but think you helen
he would receive it he and his physicians
are of a mind he that they cannot help him
they that they cannot help how shall they credit
a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
embowelld of their doctrine have let off
the danger to itself
helena there's something int
more than my father's skill which was the great'st
of his profession that his good receipt
by th' luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
but give me leave to try success i'd venture
the well lost life of mine on his grace's cure
by such a day and hour
countess dost thou believe't
helena ay madam knowingly
countess why helen thou shalt have my leave and love
means and attendants and my loving greetings
to those of mine in court i'll stay at home
be gone to morrow and be sure of this
what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss exeunt

king i would i had so i had broke thy pate

lafeu good faith across
but my good lord 'tis thus will you be cur'd
king no
lafeu o will you eat
no grapes my royal fox yes but you will
my noble grapes an if my royal fox
could reach them i have seen a medicine
that's able to breathe life into a stone
quicken a rock and make you dance canary
with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
is powerful to araise king pepin nay
and write to her a love line
king what her is this
lafeu why doctor she my lord there's one arriv'd
if you will see her now by my faith and honour
if seriously i may convey my thoughts
in this my light deliverance i have spoke

wisdom and constancy hath amaz'd me more

his majesty seldom fears i am cressid's uncle
that dare leave two together fare you well exit
king now fair one does your business follow us
helena ay my good lord
gerard de narbon was my father
king i knew him
helena the rather will i spare my praises towards him
knowing him is enough ons bed of death
many receipts he gave me chiefly one
which as the dearest issue of his practice
and of his old experience th' only darling
he bade me store up as a triple eye
safer than mine own two more dear i have so
and hearing your high majesty is touch'd
of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
i come to tender it and my appliance
with all bound humbleness
king we thank you maiden
but may not be so credulous of cure
when our most learned doctors leave us and
the congregated college have concluded
that labouring art can never ransom nature
from her inaidable estate i say we must not
to prostitute our past cure malady
to empirics or to dissever so
our great self and our credit to esteem
a senseless help when help past sense we deem
helena my duty then shall pay me for my pains
i will no more enforce mine office on you
humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
a modest one to bear me back again
king i cannot give thee less to be calld grateful
as one near death to those that wish him live
but what at full i know thou know'st no part
i knowing all my peril thou no art
helena what i can do can do no hurt to try
since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy
he that of greatest works is finisher
oft does them by the weakest minister
so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
when judges have been babes great floods have flown
when miracles have by the greatest been denied
oft expectation fails and most oft there
where most it promises and oft it hits
where hope is coldest and despair most fits
king i must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
thy pains not us'd must by thyself be paid
proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
helena inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
it is not so with him that all things knows
but most it is presumption in us when
the help of heaven we count the act of men
dear sir to my endeavours give consent
of heaven not me make an experiment
i am not an impostor that proclaim
myself against the level of mine aim
but know i think and think i know most sure
my art is not past power nor you past cure
king art thou so confident within what space
helena the greatest grace lending grace
ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
ere twice in murk and occidental damp
moist hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
health shall live free and sickness freely die
what dar'st thou venture
helena tax of impudence
a strumpet's boldness a divulged shame
traduc'd by odious ballads my maidens name
sear'd otherwise ne worse of worst extended
with vilest torture let my life be ended
king methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
his powerful sound within an organ weak
and what impossibility would slay
thy life is dear for all that life can rate
worth name of life in thee hath estimate
youth beauty wisdom courage all
that happiness and prime can happy call
thou this to hazard needs must intimate
skill infinite or monstrous desperate
sweet practiser thy physic i will try
that ministers thine own death if i die
helena if i break time or flinch in property
and well deserv'd not helping death's my fee
but if i help what do you promise me
king make thy demand
helena but will you make it even
king ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
helena then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
what husband in thy power i will command
exempted be from me the arrogance
to choose from forth the royal blood of france
with any branch or image of thy state
but such a one thy vassal whom i know
is free for me to ask thee to bestow
king here is my hand the premises observ'd
thy will by my performance shall be serv'd
so make the choice of thy own time for i
thy resolv'd patient on thee still rely
more should i question thee and more i must
though more to know could not be more to trust
unquestiond welcome and undoubted blest
give me some help here ho if thou proceed
as high as word my deed shall match thy deed

the court but for me i have an answer will serve all men

countess will your answer serve fit to all questions
clown as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your
french crown for your taffety punk as tib's rush for tom's
forefinger as a pancake for shrove tuesday a morris for mayday
as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding
quean to a wrangling knave as the nuns lip to the friar's
mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
countess have you i say an answer of such fitness for all
clown from below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit

paris the king's palace
enter bertram lafeu and parolles
lafeu they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical
persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear
parolles why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
out in our latter times
bertram and so 'tis
lafeu to be relinquish'd of the artists
parolles so i say both of galen and paracelsus
lafeu of all the learned and authentic fellows
parolles right so i say
parolles why there 'tis so say i too
lafeu not to be help'd
parolles right as 'twere a man assur'd of a
lafeu uncertain life and sure death
parolles just you say well so would i have said
lafeu i may truly say it is a novelty to the world
parolles it is indeed if you will have it in showing you shall
read it in what do ye callt here
lafeu reading the ballad title 'a showing of a heavenly
parolles that's it i would have said the very same
lafeu why your dolphin is not lustier 'fore me i speak in
empty
parolles nay 'tis strange 'tis very strange that is the brief
and the tedious of it and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
will not acknowledge it to be the
lafeu very hand of heaven
parolles ay so i say
lafeu in a most weak
which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone
the recov'ry of the king as to be
lafeu generally thankful
enter king helena and attendants
parolles i would have said it you say well here comes the king
lafeu lustig as the dutchman says i'll like a maid the better
whilst i have a tooth in my head why he's able to lead her a
empty
parolles mort du vinaigre is not this helen
king go call before me all the lords in court
exit an attendant
sit my preserver by thy patient's side
and with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense
thou has repeald a second time receive
the confirmation of my promis'd gift
which but attends thy naming
enter three or four lords
fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
o'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
i have to use thy frank election make
thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
helena to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
fall when love please marry to each but one
lafeu i'd give bay curtal and his furniture
my mouth no more were broken than these boys'
and writ as little beard
king peruse them well
helena gentlemen
heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health
all we understand it and thank heaven for you
helena i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
that i protest i simply am a maid
please it your majesty i have done already
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
'we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
king make choice and see
who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
helena now dian from thy altar do i fly
and to imperial love that god most high
do my sighs stream sir will you hear my suit
first lord and grant it
helena thanks sir all the rest is mute
lafeu i had rather be in this choice than throw ames ace for my
empty
before i speak too threat'ningly replies
love make your fortunes twenty times above
her that so wishes and her humble love
second lord no better if you please
helena my wish receive
which great love grant and so i take my leave
lafeu do all they deny her an they were sons of mine i'd have
them whipt or i would send them to th' turk to make eunuchs of
helena be not afraid that i your hand should take
blessing upon your vows and in your bed
find fairer fortune if you ever wed
lafeu these boys are boys of ice they'll none have her
sure they are bastards to the english the french ne'er got 'em
helena you are too young too happy and too good
to make yourself a son out of my blood
fourth lord fair one i think not so
lafeu there's one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk wine but
if thou be'st not an ass i am a youth of fourteen i have known
helena to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give
me and my service ever whilst i live
into your guiding power this is the man
king why then young bertram take her she's thy wife
bertram my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness
in such a business give me leave to use
the help of mine own eyes
king know'st thou not bertram
what she has done for me
but never hope to know why i should marry her
king thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed
bertram but follows it my lord to bring me down
must answer for your raising i know her well
she had her breeding at my father's charge
a poor physicians daughter my wife disdain
rather corrupt me ever
king 'tis only title thou disdainst in her the which
i can build up strange is it that our bloods
would quite confound distinction yet stand off
in differences so mighty if she be
all that is virtuous save what thou dislik'st
a poor physicians daughter thou dislik'st
of virtue for the name but do not so
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
the place is dignified by the doer's deed
where great additions swells and virtue none
it is a dropsied honour good alone
the property by what it is should go
not by the title she is young wise fair
in these to nature she's immediate heir
and these breed honour that is honour's scorn
which challenges itself as honour's born
and is not like the sire honours thrive
when rather from our acts we them derive
than our fore goers the mere word's a slave
debauch'd on every tomb on every grave
where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb
of honour'd bones indeed what should be said
if thou canst like this creature as a maid
i can create the rest virtue and she
is her own dower honour and wealth from me
bertram i cannot love her nor will strive to do 't
king thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
helena that you are well restor'd my lord i'm glad
let the rest go
i must produce my power here take her hand
proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
that dost in vile misprision shackle up
my love and her desert that canst not dream
we poising us in her defective scale
shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
it is in us to plant thine honour where
we please to have it grow check thy contempt
obey our will which travails in thy good
do thine own fortunes that obedient right
which both thy duty owes and our power claims
or i will throw thee from my care for ever
into the staggers and the careless lapse
of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
loosing upon thee in the name of justice
without all terms of pity speak thine answer
bertram pardon my gracious lord for i submit
my fancy to your eyes when i consider
flies where you bid it i find that she which late
was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
the praised of the king who so ennobled
is as 'twere born so
king take her by the hand
and tell her she is thine to whom i promise
a counterpoise if not to thy estate
a balance more replete
bertram i take her hand
smile upon this contract whose ceremony
shall seem expedient on the now born brief
and be perform'd to night the solemn feast
shall more attend upon the coming space
expecting absent friends as thou lov'st her
thy love's to me religious else does err
exeunt all but lafeu and parolles who stay behind
commenting of this wedding
lafeu do you hear monsieur a word with you
lafeu your lord and master did well to make his recantation
parolles recantation my lord my master
lafeu ay is it not a language i speak
parolles a most harsh one and not to be understood without bloody
succeeding my master
lafeu are you companion to the count rousillon
parolles to any count to all counts to what is man
lafeu to what is count's man count's master is of another style
parolles you are too old sir let it satisfy you you are too
lafeu i must tell thee sirrah i write man to which title age
cannot bring thee
parolles what i dare too well do i dare not do
lafeu i did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty wise
fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel it might
pass yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden i
have now found thee when i lose thee again i care not yet art
thou good for nothing but taking up and that thou'rt scarce
parolles hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee
lafeu do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou hasten thy
trial which if lord have mercy on thee for a hen so my good
window of lattice fare thee well thy casement i need not open
for i look through thee give me thy hand
parolles my lord you give me most egregious indignity
lafeu ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it
parolles i have not my lord deserv'd it
lafeu yes good faith ev'ry dram of it and i will not bate thee
parolles well i shall be wiser
lafeu ev'n as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at a smack
o' th' contrary if ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
beaten thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage i
have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or rather my
knowledge that i may say in the default 'he is a man i know'
parolles my lord you do me most insupportable vexation
lafeu i would it were hell pains for thy sake and my poor doing
eternal for doing i am past as i will by thee in what motion
parolles well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me

first lord if your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more
in your respect
bertram do you think i am so far deceived in him
second lord believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he's a
most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly
promise breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your
lordship's entertainment
first lord it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his
virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty
business in a main danger fail you
first lord none better than to let him fetch off his drum which
you hear him so confidently undertake to do
second lord i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise
him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy
we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at
his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in
the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and
with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my
judgment in anything
first lord o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he
says he has a stratagem for't when your lordship sees the bottom
of his success int and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
ore will be melted if you give him not john drum's
entertainment your inclining cannot be removed here he comes
enter parolles
second lord o for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of
bertram how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
empty
first lord a pox on 't let it go 'tis but a drum
parolles but a drum is't but a drum a drum so lost there was
excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own
wings and to rend our own soldiers
first lord that was not to be blam'd in the command of the
service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not
have prevented if he had been there to command
some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to
be recovered
parolles it might have been recovered
bertram it might but it is not now
parolles it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is
seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have
that drum or another or 'hic jacet'
bertram why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you think
your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to
you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost
syllable of our worthiness
parolles by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
bertram but you must not now slumber in it
parolles i'll about it this evening and i will presently pen
down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself
into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further
bertram may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it

attempt i vow
bertram i know th' art valiant and to the of thy soldiership
will subscribe for thee farewell

second lord no more than a fish loves water is not this a strange
fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this
business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do
first lord you do not know him my lord as we do certain it is
that he will steal himself into a mans favour and for a week
escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out
you have him ever after
bertram why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
so seriously he does address himself unto
second lord none in the world but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost
emboss'd him you shall see his fall to night for indeed he is
first lord we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him
he was first smok'd by the old lord lafeu when his disguise and
he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you
shall see this very night

since the first father wore it this ring he holds
in most rich choice yet in his idle fire
howe'er repented after
widow now i see
the bottom of your purpose
helena you see it lawful then it is no more

desires this ring appoints him an encounter
in fine delivers me to fill the time
herself most chastely absent after this

widow i have yielded
instruct my daughter how she shall persever
that time and place with this deceit so lawful
may prove coherent every night he comes
with musics of all sorts and songs compos'd

diana no my good lord diana
bertram titled goddess
and worth it with addition but fair soul
in your fine frame hath love no quality
if the quick fire of youth light not your mind
you are no maiden but a monument
as you are now for you are cold and stern
and now you should be as your mother was
when your sweet self was got
diana she then was honest
bertram so should you be
diana no
my mother did but duty such my lord
as you owe to your wife
bertram no more o'that
i was compelld to her but i love the
by love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
do thee all rights of service
diana ay so you serve us
till we serve you but when you have our roses
you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
and mock us with our bareness
bertram how have i sworn
diana 'tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
what is not holy that we swear not by
but take the high'st to witness then pray you tell me
if i should swear by jove's great attributes
i lov'd you dearly would you believe my oaths
when i did love you ill this has no holding
to swear by him whom i protest to love
that i will work against him therefore your oaths
are words and poor conditions but unseald
at least in my opinion
be not so holy cruel love is holy
and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
that you do charge men with stand no more off
but give thyself unto my sick desires
who then recovers say thou art mine and ever
my love as it begins shall so persever
diana i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
that we'll forsake ourselves give me that ring
bertram i'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
diana will you not my lord
bertram it is an honour 'longing to our house
bequeathed down from many ancestors
which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
in me to lose
diana mine honour's such a ring
my chastity's the jewel of our house
bequeathed down from many ancestors
which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
brings in the champion honour on my part
against your vain assault
bertram here take my ring

and i'll be bid by thee
diana when midnight comes knock at my chamber window
i'll order take my mother shall not hear
now will i charge you in the band of truth
when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
my reasons are most strong and you shall know them
when back again this ring shall be deliver'd
and on your finger in the night i'll put
another ring that what in time proceeds
may token to the future our past deeds
adieu till then then fail not you have won
a wife of me though there my hope be done
bertram a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
empty
you may so in the end
my mother told me just how he would woo
as if she sat ins heart she says all men
have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
when his wife's dead therefore i'll lie with him
when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid
marry that will i live and die a maid

to cozen him that would unjustly win exit
the florentine camp
enter the two french lords and two or three soldiers
second lord you have not given him his mother's letter
first lord i have deliv'red it an hour since there is something
int that stings his nature for on the reading it he chang'd
almost into another man
second lord he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
so good a wife and so sweet a lady
first lord especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
him i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly
with you
second lord when you have spoken it 'tis dead and i am the grave
of it
first lord he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence
of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in
the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring
and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
second lord now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
first lord merely our own traitors and as in the common course of
all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
to their abhorr'd ends so he that in this action contrives
against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows
empty
second lord is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
unlawful intents we shall not then have his company to night
first lord not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
second lord that approaches apace i would gladly have him see his
judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit
first lord we will not meddle with him till he come for his
presence must be the whip of the other
second lord in the meantime what hear you of these wars
first lord i hear there is an overture of peace
second lord nay i assure you a peace concluded
first lord what will count rousillon do then will he travel
higher or return again into france
second lord i perceive by this demand you are not altogether
first lord let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal
of his act
second lord sir his wife some two months since fled from his
house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand
which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
accomplish'd and there residing the tenderness of her nature
became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last
breath and now she sings in heaven
first lord how is this justified
makes her story true even to the point of her death her death
itself which could not be her office to say is come was
faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place
first lord hath the count all this intelligence
second lord ay and the particular confirmations point from
point to the full arming of the verity
first lord i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this
second lord how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
empty
tears the great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample
second lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill
together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
our virtues

spurs so long how does he carry himself
second lord i have told your lordship already the stocks carry

a wench that had shed her milk he hath confess'd himself to
morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his
remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'

the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole
theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the
first lord i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
apparel neatly
first soldier well that's set down
parolles 'five or six thousand horse' i said i will say true 'or
thereabouts' set down for i'll speak truth
second lord he's very near the truth in this
bertram but i con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it
parolles 'poor rogues' i pray you say

condition and what credit i have with the duke
first soldier well that's set down 'you shall demand of him
whether one captain dumain be i' th' camp a frenchman what his
reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty expertness
well weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt' what say
you to this what do you know of it
parolles i beseech you let me answer to the particular of the
inter'gatories demand them singly
first soldier do you know this captain dumain
parolles i know him 'a was a botcher's prentice in paris from
whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child a
dumb innocent that could not say him nay
bertram nay by your leave hold your hands though i know his
first soldier well is this captain in the duke of florence's
empty
parolles upon my knowledge he is and lousy
second lord nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
lordship anon
first soldier what is his reputation with the duke
parolles the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band
i think i have his letter in my pocket
parolles in good sadness i do not know either it is there or it
is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent
first soldier here 'tis here's a paper shall i read it to you
parolles i do not know if it be it or no
bertram our interpreter does it well
second lord excellently
first soldier reads 'dian the count's a fool and full of
empty
parolles that is not the duke's letter sir that is an
heed of the allurement of one count rousillon a foolish idle
boy but for all that very ruttish i pray you sir put it up
empty
first soldier nay i'll read it first by your favour
parolles my meaning int i protest was very honest in the behalf
of the maid for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and
lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all
the fry it finds
bertram damnable both sides rogue
'when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
after he scores he never pays the score
half won is match well made match and well make it
he ne'er pays after debts take it before
and say a soldier dian told thee this
men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
for count of this the count's a fool i know it
who pays before but not when he does owe it
thine as he vow'd to thee in thine ear
bertram he shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme ins
empty
first lord this is your devoted friend sir the manifold
linguist and the amnipotent soldier
bertram i could endure anything before but a cat and now he's a
cat to me
first soldier i perceive sir by our generals looks we shall be
fain to hang you
parolles my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to die
remainder of nature let me live sir in a dungeon i' th'
stocks or anywhere so i may live
first soldier we'll see what may be done so you confess freely
therefore once more to this captain dumain you have answer'd to
his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his
empty
parolles he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes
and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of
oaths in breaking 'em he is stronger than hercules he will lie
drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and
in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about
him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw i have
but little more to say sir of his honesty he has everything
that an honest man should not have what an honest man should
have he has nothing
second lord i begin to love him for this
bertram for this description of thine honesty a pox upon him for
me he's more and more a cat
parolles faith sir has led the drum before the english
tragedians to belie him i will not and more of his soldier ship
i know not except in that country he had the honour to be the
officer at a place there called mile end to instruct for the
doubling of files i would do the man what honour i can but of
this i am not certain
second lord he hath out villaind villainy so far that the rarity
redeems him
bertram a pox on him he's a cat still
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
parolles sir for a cardecue he will sell the fee simple of his
salvation the inheritance of it and cut th' entail from all
remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually
first soldier what's his brother the other captain dumain
first lord why does he ask him of me
first soldier what's he
parolles e'en a crow o' th' same nest not altogether so great as
the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil he
of the best that is in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry
in coming on he has the cramp
first soldier if your life be saved will you undertake to betray
the florentine
parolles ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon
first soldier i'll whisper with the general and know his
empty
parolles aside i'll no more drumming a plague of all drums
only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of
yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken
first soldier there is no remedy sir but you must die
the general says you that have so traitorously discover'd the
secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men
very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore
you must die come headsman of with his head
parolles o lord sir let me live or let me see my death
first soldier that shall you and take your leave of all your
friends unmuffling him so look about you know you any here
first lord god bless you captain parolles
second lord god save you noble captain
first lord captain what greeting will you to my lord lafeu i am
for france

you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon an i were not
a very coward i'd compel it of you but fare you well
exeunt bertram and lords

first soldier if you could find out a country where but women were
that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent
nation fare ye well sir i am for france too we shall speak of
you there exit with soldiers
parolles yet am i thankful if my heart were great
'twould burst at this captain i'll be no more
but i will eat and drink and sleep as soft
as captain shall simply the thing i am
let him fear this for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass

flourish enter king countess lafeu the two french lords with attendants
king we lost a jewel of her and our esteem
was made much poorer by it but your son
as mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
her estimation home
countess 'tis past my liege
and i beseech your majesty to make it
natural rebellion done i' th' blaze of youth
o'erbears it and burns on
king my honour'd lady
i have forgiven and forgotten all
though my revenges were high bent upon him
and watch'd the time to shoot
lafeu this i must say
but first i beg my pardon the young lord
did to his majesty his mother and his lady
offence of mighty note but to himself
whose beauty did astonish the survey
of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
whose dear perfection hearts that scornd to serve
humbly calld mistress
king praising what is lost
makes the remembrance dear well call him hither
we are reconcild and the first view shall kill
all repetition let him not ask our pardon
the nature of his great offence is dead
th' incensing relics of it let him approach
a stranger no offender and inform him
so 'tis our will he should
gentleman i shall my liege exit gentleman
king what says he to your daughter have you spoke
lafeu all that he is hath reference to your highness

king i am not a day of season
for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
in me at once but to the brightest beams
distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
the time is fair again
bertram my high repented blames
dear sovereign pardon to me
king all is whole
not one word more of the consumed time
for we are old and on our quick'st decrees
th' inaudible and noiseless foot of time
steals ere we can effect them you remember
the daughter of this lord
bertram admiringly my liege at first
i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
durst make too bold herald of my tongue
where the impression of mine eye infixing
contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
scornd a fair colour or express'd it stoln
extended or contracted all proportions
to a most hideous object thence it came
that she whom all men prais'd and whom myself
since i have lost have lov'd was in mine eye
the dust that did offend it
king well excus'd
that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
from the great compt but love that comes too late
to the great sender turns a sour offence
crying 'that's good that's gone' our rash faults
make trivial price of serious things we have
not knowing them until we know their grave
oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
destroy our friends and after weep their dust
our own love waking cries to see what's done
while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
be this sweet helens knell and now forget her
the main consents are had and here we'll stay
to see our widower's second marriage day
countess which better than the first o dear heaven bless
or ere they meet in me o nature cesse
lafeu come on my son in whom my house's name
must be digested give a favour from you
to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
that she may quickly come
bertram gives a ring
and ev'ry hair that's on 't helen that's dead
was a sweet creature such a ring as this
the last that e'er i took her leave at court
i saw upon her finger
bertram hers it was not
king now pray you let me see it for mine eye
while i was speaking oft was fastend to't
this ring was mine and when i gave it helen
i bade her if her fortunes ever stood
i would relieve her had you that craft to reave her
of what should stead her most
bertram my gracious sovereign
howe'er it pleases you to take it so
the ring was never hers
countess son on my life
i have seen her wear it and she reckond it
at her life's rate
lafeu i am sure i saw her wear it
in florence was it from a casement thrown me
wrapp'd in a paper which containd the name
of her that threw it noble she was and thought
i stood engag'd but when i had subscrib'd
to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
i could not answer in that course of honour
as she had made the overture she ceas'd
in heavy satisfaction and would never
receive the ring again
that knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine
hath not in nature's mystery more science
than i have in this ring 'twas mine 'twas helens
whoever gave it you then if you know
that you are well acquainted with yourself
confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement
you got it from her she calld the saints to surety
that she would never put it from her finger
unless she gave it to yourself in bed
upon her great disaster
bertram she never saw it
king thou speak'st it falsely as i love mine honour
and mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
which i would fain shut out if it should prove
that thou art so inhuman 'twill not prove so
and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
and she is dead which nothing but to close
her eyes myself could win me to believe
guards seize bertram
my fore past proofs howe'er the matter fall
shall tax my fears of little vanity
having vainly fear'd too little away with him
we'll sift this matter further
bertram if you shall prove
this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
prove that i husbanded her bed in florence
where she yet never was exit guarded
enter a gentleman
gentleman gracious sovereign
whether i have been to blame or no i know not
here's a petition from a florentine
who hath for four or five removes come short
to tender it herself i undertook it
vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
of the poor suppliant who by this i know
is here attending her business looks in her
in a sweet verbal brief it did concern
your highness with herself
king reads the letter 'upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won me now is the
count rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my
honour's paid to him he stole from florence taking no leave
and i follow him to his country for justice grant it me o king
in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor
maid is undone
lafeu i will buy me a son in law in a fair and toll for this
i'll none of him
king the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu
to bring forth this discov'ry seek these suitors
go speedily and bring again the count
exeunt attendants
i am afeard the life of helen lady
was foully snatch'd
countess now justice on the doers
king i wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
and that you fly them as you swear them lordship
yet you desire to marry
enter widow and diana
what womans that
diana i am my lord a wretched florentine
derived from the ancient capilet
my suit as i do understand you know
and therefore know how far i may be pitied
both suffer under this complaint we bring
and both shall cease without your remedy
king come hither count do you know these women
bertram my lord i neither can nor will deny
but that i know them do they charge me further
diana why do you look so strange upon your wife
bertram she's none of mine my lord
diana if you shall marry
you give away this hand and that is mine
you give away myself which is known mine
for i by vow am so embodied yours
that she which marries you must marry me
either both or none
lafeu to bertram your reputation comes too short for
my daughter you are no husband for her
bertram my lord this is a fond and desp'rate creature
whom sometime i have laugh'd with let your highness
lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
king sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
than in my thought it lies
diana good my lord
ask him upon his oath if he does think
he had not my virginity
king what say'st thou to her
bertram she's impudent my lord
and was a common gamester to the camp
he might have bought me at a common price
do not believe him o behold this ring
whose high respect and rich validity
did lack a parallel yet for all that
he gave it to a commoner o' th' camp
if i be one
countess he blushes and 'tis it
of six preceding ancestors that gem
conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue
that ring's a thousand proofs
king methought you said
you saw one here in court could witness it
diana i did my lord but loath am to produce
so bad an instrument his name's parolles
lafeu i saw the man to day if man he be
king find him and bring him hither exit an attendant
bertram what of him
he's quoted for a most perfidious slave
whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
am i or that or this for what he'll utter
that will speak anything
king she hath that ring of yours
bertram i think she has certain it is i lik'd her
and boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth
she knew her distance and did angle for me
madding my eagerness with her restraint
as all impediments in fancy's course
her infinite cunning with her modern grace
subdu'd me to her rate she got the ring
and i had that which any inferior might
at market price have bought
diana i must be patient
you that have turnd off a first so noble wife
may justly diet me i pray you yet
since you lack virtue i will lose a husband
send for your ring i will return it home
bertram i have it not
king what ring was yours i pray you
diana sir much like
the same upon your finger
king know you this ring this ring was his of late
diana and this was it i gave him being abed
king the story then goes false you threw it him
out of a casement
diana i have spoke the truth
bertram my lord i do confess the ring was hers
king you boggle shrewdly every feather starts you
is this the man you speak of
diana ay my lord
king tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you
not fearing the displeasure of your master
which on your just proceeding i'll keep off
by him and by this woman here what know you
parolles so please your majesty my master hath been an honourable
king come come to th' purpose did he love this woman
parolles faith sir he did love her but how
king how i pray you
parolles he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
king how is that
parolles he lov'd her sir and lov'd her not
king as thou art a knave and no knave
what an equivocal companion is this
parolles i am a poor man and at your majesty's command
diana do you know he promis'd me marriage
parolles faith i know more than i'll speak
king but wilt thou not speak all thou know'st
parolles yes so please your majesty i did go between them as i
said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for
her and talk'd of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know
not what yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i
knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising
her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak
king thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are
married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand
empty
this ring you say was yours
diana ay my good lord
king where did you buy it or who gave it you
diana it was not given me nor i did not buy it
king who lent it you
diana it was not lent me neither
diana i found it not
king if it were yours by none of all these ways
how could you give it him
diana i never gave it him
lafeu this womans an easy glove my lord she goes of and on at
empty
king this ring was mine i gave it his first wife
diana it might be yours or hers for aught i know
king take her away i do not like her now
unless thou tellst me where thou hadst this ring
thou diest within this hour
diana i'll never tell you
king take her away
diana i'll put in bail my liege
king i think thee now some common customer
diana by jove if ever i knew man 'twas you
king wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while
diana because he's guilty and he is not guilty
i'll swear i am a maid and he knows not
great king i am no strumpet by my life
i am either maid or else this old mans wife
pointing to lafeu
king she does abuse our ears to prison with her
diana good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir
exit widow
the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
and he shall surety me but for this lord
though yet he never harm'd me here i quit him
he knows himself my bed he hath defild
and at that time he got his wife with child
dead though she be she feels her young one kick
so there's my riddle one that's dead is quick
and now behold the meaning
re enter widow with helena
king is there no exorcist
beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
helena no my good lord
'tis but the shadow of a wife you see
the name and not the thing
bertram both both o pardon
helena o my good lord when i was like this maid
i found you wondrous kind there is your ring
and look you here's your letter this it says
'when from my finger you can get this ring
and are by me with child' etc this is done
bertram if she my liege can make me know this clearly
i'll love her dearly ever ever dearly
helena if it appear not plain and prove untrue
deadly divorce step between me and you
o my dear mother do i see you living
lafeu mine eyes smell onions i shall weep anon to parolles
good tom drum lend me a handkercher so i
thank thee wait on me home i'll make sport with thee
let thy curtsies alone they are scurvy ones
to make the even truth in pleasure flow
to diana if thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower
choose thou thy husband and i'll pay thy dower
for i can guess that by thy honest aid
thou kept'st a wife herself thyself a maid
of that and all the progress more and less
resolvedly more leisure shall express
all yet seems well and if it end so meet
the bitter past more welcome is the sweet flourish
empty
king the king's a beggar now the play is done
all is well ended if this suit be won
that you express content which we will pay
with strife to please you day exceeding day
ours be your patience then and yours our parts
your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts

philo nay but this dotage of our generals
o'erflows the measure those his goodly eyes
that o'er the files and musters of the war
have glow'd like plated mars now bend now turn
the office and devotion of their view
upon a tawny front his captains heart

into a strumpet's fool behold and see
antony there's beggary in the love that can be reckond
cleopatra i'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd
antony then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
enter a messenger
messenger news my good lord from rome
antony grates me the sum
cleopatra nay hear them antony
fulvia perchance is angry or who knows
if the scarce bearded caesar have not sent
take in that kingdom and enfranchise that
perform't or else we damn thee'
antony how my love
cleopatra perchance nay and most like
you must not stay here longer your dismission
is come from caesar therefore hear it antony
where's fulvia's process caesar's i would say both
call in the messengers as i am egypt's queen

why did he marry fulvia and not love her
i'll seem the fool i am not antony

last night you did desire it speak not to us
exeunt antony and cleopatra with the train
demetrius is caesar with antonius priz'd so slight

thus speaks of him at rome but i will hope
of better deeds to morrow rest you happy exeunt

enter antony with a messenger and attendants
cleopatra we will not look upon him go with us
exeunt cleopatra enobarbus and the rest
messenger fulvia thy wife first came into the field
antony against my brother lucius
messenger ay
but soon that war had end and the time's state
made friends of them jointing their force 'gainst caesar
whose better issue in the war from italy
antony well what worst
messenger the nature of bad news infects the teller
antony when it concerns the fool or coward on
things that are past are done with me 'tis thus
who tells me true though in his tale lie death
i hear him as he flatter'd
messenger labienus
this is stiff news hath with his parthian force
extended asia from euphrates
to lydia and to ionia
empty
antony antony thou wouldst say
messenger o my lord
antony speak to me home mince not the general tongue
name cleopatra as she is calld in rome
rail thou in fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults
with such full licence as both truth and malice
have power to utter o then we bring forth weeds
is as our earing fare thee well awhile
messenger at your noble pleasure exit
antony from sicyon ho the news speak there
first attendant the man from sicyon is there such an one
second attendant he stays upon your will
antony let him appear
these strong egyptian fetters i must break
or lose myself in dotage
enter another messenger with a letter
second messenger fulvia thy wife is dead
antony where died she
second messenger in sicyon
her length of sickness with what else more serious
importeth thee to know this bears gives the letter
antony forbear me exit messenger
there's a great spirit gone thus did i desire it
what our contempts doth often hurl from us
we wish it ours again the present pleasure
the opposite of itself she's good being gone
the hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on
i must from this enchanting queen break off
ten thousand harms more than the ills i know
my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus
re enter enobarbus
enobarbus what's your pleasure sir
antony i must with haste from hence
enobarbus why then we kill all our women we see how mortal an
empty
antony i must be gone
enobarbus under a compelling occasion let women die it were pity
to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great
cause they should be esteemed nothing cleopatra catching but
the least noise of this dies instantly i have seen her die
twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle
in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a
celerity in dying
enobarbus alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the
finest part of pure love we cannot call her winds and waters
sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than
almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she
makes a show'r of rain as well as jove
antony would i had never seen her
enobarbus o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
your travel
enobarbus sir
antony fulvia is dead
enobarbus fulvia
antony dead
enobarbus why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when it
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it
shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that
when old robes are worn out there are members to make new if
there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut
consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and
indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
antony the business she hath broached in the state
cannot endure my absence
enobarbus and the business you have broach'd here cannot be
without you especially that of cleopatra's which wholly depends
on your abode
antony no more light answers let our officers
have notice what we purpose i shall break
and get her leave to part for not alone
the death of fulvia with more urgent touches
do strongly speak to us but the letters to
of many our contriving friends in rome
petition us at home sextus pompeius
hath given the dare to caesar and commands
the empire of the sea our slippery people
whose love is never link'd to the deserver
till his deserts are past begin to throw
upon his son who high in name and power
higher than both in blood and life stands up
for the main soldier whose quality going on
the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding
which like the courser's hair hath yet but life
and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure
to such whose place is under us requires
our quick remove from hence
enobarbus i shall do't exeunt
alexandria cleopatra's palace
enter cleopatra charmian iras and alexas
cleopatra where is he
charmian i did not see him since
cleopatra see where he is who's with him what he does
i did not send you if you find him sad
say i am dancing if in mirth report
that i am sudden sick quick and return exit alexas
charmian madam methinks if you did love him dearly
the like from him
cleopatra what should i do i do not
charmian in each thing give him way cross him in nothing
cleopatra thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
charmian tempt him not so too far i wish forbear
in time we hate that which we often fear
enter antony
but here comes antony
cleopatra i am sick and sullen
cleopatra help me away dear charmian i shall fall
it cannot be thus long the sides of nature
will not sustain it
antony now my dearest queen
cleopatra pray you stand farther from me
antony what's the matter
cleopatra i know by that same eye there's some good news
what says the married woman you may go
would she had never given you leave to come
i have no power upon you hers you are
antony the gods best know
cleopatra o never was there queen
so mightily betray'd yet at the first
i saw the treasons planted
antony cleopatra
cleopatra why should i think you can be mine and true
though you in swearing shake the throned gods
who have been false to fulvia riotous madness
which break themselves in swearing
antony most sweet queen
cleopatra nay pray you seek no colour for your going
but bid farewell and go when you sued staying
then was the time for words no going then
eternity was in our lips and eyes
bliss in our brows' bent none our parts so poor
but was a race of heaven they are so still
or thou the greatest soldier of the world
antony how now lady
cleopatra i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know
there were a heart in egypt
antony hear me queen
the strong necessity of time commands
our services awhile but my full heart
remains in use with you our italy
shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius
makes his approaches to the port of rome
breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
are newly grown to love the condemnd pompey
rich in his father's honour creeps apace
into the hearts of such as have not thrived
upon the present state whose numbers threaten
and quietness grown sick of rest would purge
by any desperate change my more particular
and that which most with you should safe my going
is fulvia's death
it does from childishness can fulvia die
antony she's dead my queen
look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
the garboils she awak'd at the last best
see when and where she died
cleopatra o most false love
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
with sorrowful water now i see i see
in fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be
the purposes i bear which are or cease
as you shall give th' advice by the fire
that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence
thy soldier servant making peace or war
as thou affects
cleopatra cut my lace charmian come
but let it be i am quickly ill and well
so antony loves
antony my precious queen forbear
an honourable trial
cleopatra so fulvia told me
i prithee turn aside and weep for her
then bid adieu to me and say the tears
belong to egypt good now play one scene
of excellent dissembling and let it look
like perfect honour
antony you'll heat my blood no more
cleopatra you can do better yet but this is meetly
cleopatra and target still he mends
but this is not the best look prithee charmian
how this herculean roman does become
the carriage of his chafe
antony i'll leave you lady
cleopatra courteous lord one word
sir you and i must part but that's not it
sir you and i have lov'd but there's not it
that you know well something it is i would
and i am all forgotten
antony but that your royalty
holds idleness your subject i should take you
for idleness itself
cleopatra 'tis sweating labour
to bear such idleness so near the heart
as cleopatra this but sir forgive me
since my becomings kill me when they do not
eye well to you your honour calls you hence
and all the gods go with you upon your sword
sit laurel victory and smooth success
be strew'd before your feet
antony let us go come
our separation so abides and flies
that thou residing here goes yet with me
and i hence fleeting here remain with thee
away exeunt
scene iv
enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus and their train
caesar you may see lepidus and henceforth know
it is not caesar's natural vice to hate
our great competitor from alexandria
this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy
more womanly than he hardly gave audience or
vouchsaf'd to think he had partners you shall find there
that all men follow
lepidus i must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
more fiery by night's blackness hereditary
rather than purchas'd what he cannot change
than what he chooses
caesar you are too indulgent let's grant it is not
amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy
and keep the turn of tippling with a slave
to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him
as his composure must be rare indeed
whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony
no way excuse his foils when we do bear
so great weight in his lightness if he filld
his vacancy with his voluptuousness
full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
as his own state and ours 'tis to be chid
as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
pawn their experience to their present pleasure
and so rebel to judgment
enter a messenger
lepidus here's more news
messenger thy biddings have been done and every hour
most noble caesar shalt thou have report
and it appears he is belov'd of those
that only have fear'd caesar to the ports
the discontents repair and mens reports
give him much wrong'd
caesar i should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state
that he which is was wish'd until he were
and the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love
comes dear'd by being lack'd this common body
goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
to rot itself with motion
messenger caesar i bring thee word
menecrates and menas famous pirates
make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
with keels of every kind many hot inroads
they make in italy the borders maritime
lack blood to think ont and flush youth revolt
no vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
than could his war resisted
caesar antony
leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once
was beaten from modena where thou slew'st
hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel
did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
though daintily brought up with patience more
than savages could suffer thou didst drink
the stale of horses and the gilded puddle
the roughest berry on the rudest hedge
yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
the barks of trees thou brows'd on the alps
it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
which some did die to look on and all this
it wounds thine honour that i speak it now
was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
so much as lank'd not
lepidus 'tis pity of him
drive him to rome 'tis time we twain
did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end
assemble we immediate council pompey
thrives in our idleness
lepidus to morrow caesar
i shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
both what by sea and land i can be able
to front this present time
caesar till which encounter
lepidus farewell my lord what you shall know meantime
of stirs abroad i shall beseech you sir
to let me be partaker
caesar doubt not sir
i knew it for my bond exeunt

enter cleopatra charmian iras and mardian
cleopatra charmian
cleopatra ha ha
give me to drink mandragora
charmian why madam
cleopatra that i might sleep out this great gap of time
my antony is away
charmian you think of him too much
cleopatra o 'tis treason
charmian madam i trust not so
cleopatra thou eunuch mardian
cleopatra not now to hear thee sing i take no pleasure
in aught an eunuch has 'tis well for thee
that being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts
may not fly forth of egypt hast thou affections
mardian yes gracious madam
cleopatra indeed
mardian not in deed madam for i can do nothing
but what indeed is honest to be done
yet have i fierce affections and think
cleopatra o charmian
where think'st thou he is now stands he or sits he
or does he walk or is he on his horse
o happy horse to bear the weight of antony
do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st
the demi atlas of this earth the arm
and burgonet of men he's speaking now
or murmuring 'where's my serpent of old nile'
for so he calls me now i feed myself
that am with phoebus' amorous pinches black
and wrinkled deep in time broad fronted caesar
when thou wast here above the ground i was
a morsel for a monarch and great pompey
would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
there would he anchor his aspect and die
with looking on his life

alexas sovereign of egypt hail
yet coming from him that great med'cine hath
with his tinct gilded thee
how goes it with my brave mark antony
alexas last thing he did dear queen
he kiss'd the last of many doubled kisses
this orient pearl his speech sticks in my heart
cleopatra mine ear must pluck it thence
alexas 'good friend' quoth he
'say the firm roman to great egypt sends
to mend the petty present i will piece
her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
say thou shall call her mistress' so he nodded
and soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed
who neigh'd so high that what i would have spoke
was beastly dumb'd by him
cleopatra what was he sad or merry
alexas like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
note him good charmian 'tis the man but note him
he was not sad for he would shine on those
that make their looks by his he was not merry
which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
in egypt with his joy but between both
o heavenly mingle be'st thou sad or merry
the violence of either thee becomes
so does it no man else met'st thou my posts
alexas ay madam twenty several messengers
cleopatra who's born that day
when i forget to send to antony
shall die a beggar ink and paper charmian
welcome my good alexas did i charmian
ever love caesar so
charmian o that brave caesar
cleopatra be chok'd with such another emphasis
say 'the brave antony'
charmian the valiant caesar
if thou with caesar paragon again
my man of men
charmian by your most gracious pardon
i sing but after you
cleopatra my salad days
when i was green in judgment cold in blood
to say as i said then but come away
get me ink and paper
he shall have every day a several greeting
act ii scene i
messina pompey's house
enter pompey menecrates and menas in warlike manner
pompey if the great gods be just they shall assist
the deeds of justest men
menecrates know worthy pompey
that what they do delay they not deny
pompey whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
the thing we sue for
beg often our own harms which the wise pow'rs
deny us for our good so find we profit
by losing of our prayers
pompey i shall do well
the people love me and the sea is mine
my powers are crescent and my auguring hope
says it will come to th' full mark antony
in egypt sits at dinner and will make
no wars without doors caesar gets money where
of both is flatter'd but he neither loves
nor either cares for him
menas caesar and lepidus
are in the field a mighty strength they carry
pompey where have you this 'tis false
menas from silvius sir
pompey he dreams i know they are in rome together
looking for antony but all the charms of love
salt cleopatra soften thy wand lip
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
keep his brain fuming epicurean cooks
sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
even till a lethe'd dullness
enter varrius
how now varrius
varrius this is most certain that i shall deliver
mark antony is every hour in rome
a space for farther travel
pompey i could have given less matter
a better ear menas i did not think
this amorous surfeiter would have donnd his helm
for such a petty war his soldiership
is twice the other twain but let us rear
the higher our opinion that our stirring
can from the lap of egypt's widow pluck
the ne'er lust wearied antony
caesar and antony shall well greet together
his wife that's dead did trespasses to caesar
his brother warr'd upon him although i think
not mov'd by antony
pompey i know not menas
how lesser enmities may give way to greater
were't not that we stand up against them all
'twere pregnant they should square between themselves
for they have entertained cause enough
may cement their divisions and bind up
the petty difference we yet not know
be't as our gods will have't it only stands
our lives upon to use our strongest hands
come menas exeunt
scene ii
rome the house of lepidus
enter enobarbus and lepidus
lepidus good enobarbus 'tis a worthy deed
to soft and gentle speech
enobarbus i shall entreat him
to answer like himself if caesar move him
let antony look over caesar's head
and speak as loud as mars by jupiter
were i the wearer of antonius' beard
i would not shave't to day
lepidus 'tis not a time
for private stomaching
serves for the matter that is then born int
lepidus but small to greater matters must give way
enobarbus not if the small come first
lepidus your speech is passion
but pray you stir no embers up here comes
the noble antony
enter antony and ventidius
enobarbus and yonder caesar
enter caesar maecenas and agrippa
hark ventidius
caesar i do not know maecenas ask agrippa
lepidus noble friends
that which combind us was most great and let not
a leaner action rend us what's amiss
may it be gently heard when we debate
our trivial difference loud we do commit
murder in healing wounds then noble partners
the rather for i earnestly beseech
nor curstness grow to th' matter
antony 'tis spoken well
were we before our arinies and to fight
i should do thus flourish
caesar welcome to rome
antony thank you
caesar sit
antony sit sir
caesar nay then they sit
or being concern you not
caesar i must be laugh'd at
if or for nothing or a little
should say myself offended and with you
chiefly i' the world more laugh'd at that i should
once name you derogately when to sound your name
it not concernd me
antony my being in egypt caesar
what was't to you
might be to you in egypt yet if you there
did practise on my state your being in egypt
might be my question
antony how intend you practis'd
caesar you may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
by what did here befall me your wife and brother
made wars upon me and their contestation
was theme for you you were the word of war
antony you do mistake your business my brother never
and have my learning from some true reports
that drew their swords with you did he not rather
discredit my authority with yours
and make the wars alike against my stomach
having alike your cause of this my letters
before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel
as matter whole you have not to make it with
it must not be with this
caesar you praise yourself
you patch'd up your excuses
antony not so not so
i know you could not lack i am certain ont
very necessity of this thought that i
your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought
could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
which fronted mine own peace as for my wife
i would you had her spirit in such another
the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle
enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go to
wars with the women
antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar
made out of her impatience which not wanted
shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant
did you too much disquiet for that you must
but say i could not help it
caesar i wrote to you
when rioting in alexandria you
did gibe my missive out of audience
antony sir
he fell upon me ere admitted then
three kings i had newly feasted and did want
of what i was i' th' morning but next day
i told him of myself which was as much
as to have ask'd him pardon let this fellow
be nothing of our strife if we contend
out of our question wipe him
the article of your oath which you shall never
have tongue to charge me with
lepidus soft caesar
antony no
lepidus let him speak
the honour is sacred which he talks on now
supposing that i lack'd it but on caesar
the article of my oath
caesar to lend me arms and aid when i requir'd them
antony neglected rather
and then when poisoned hours had bound me up
from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may
i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
work without it truth is that fulvia
to have me out of egypt made wars here
for which myself the ignorant motive do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
lepidus 'tis noble spoken
maecenas if it might please you to enforce no further
the griefs between ye to forget them quite
were to remember that the present need
speaks to atone you
lepidus worthily spoken maecenas
enobarbus or if you borrow one another's love for the instant
you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
antony thou art a soldier only speak no more
enobarbus that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
antony you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
enobarbus go to then your considerate stone
caesar i do not much dislike the matter but
the manner of his speech for't cannot be
we shall remain in friendship our conditions
so diff'ring in their acts yet if i knew
what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
agrippa give me leave caesar
caesar speak agrippa
agrippa thou hast a sister by the mother's side
admir'd octavia great mark antony
is now a widower
caesar say not so agrippa
if cleopatra heard you your reproof
were well deserv'd of rashness
antony i am not married caesar let me hear
agrippa to hold you in perpetual amity
to make you brothers and to knit your hearts
with an unslipping knot take antony
octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
no worse a husband than the best of men
whose virtue and whose general graces speak
that which none else can utter by this marriage
all little jealousies which now seem great
and all great fears which now import their dangers
where now half tales be truths her love to both
would each to other and all loves to both
draw after her pardon what i have spoke
for 'tis a studied not a present thought
by duty ruminated
antony will caesar speak
caesar not till he hears how antony is touch'd
with what is spoke already
antony what power is in agrippa
to make this good
caesar the power of caesar and
his power unto octavia
antony may i never
to this good purpose that so fairly shows
dream of impediment let me have thy hand
further this act of grace and from this hour
the heart of brothers govern in our loves
and sway our great designs
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother
did ever love so dearly let her live
to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
fly off our loves again
lepidus happily amen
antony i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey
for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
of late upon me i must thank him only
lest my remembrance suffer ill report
lepidus time calls upons
of us must pompey presently be sought
or else he seeks out us
antony where lies he
caesar about the mount misenum
antony what is his strength by land
caesar great and increasing but by sea
he is an absolute master
antony so is the fame
yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
the business we have talk'd of
caesar with most gladness
and do invite you to my sister's view
whither straight i'll lead you
antony let us lepidus
not lack your company
lepidus noble antony
not sickness should detain me flourish
maecenas welcome from egypt sir
enobarbus half the heart of caesar worthy maecenas my honourable
friend agrippa
agrippa good enobarbus
maecenas we have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested you stay'd well by't in egypt
enobarbus ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made
the night light with drinking
maecenas eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but
enobarbus this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
maecenas she's a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
enobarbus when she first met mark antony she purs'd up his heart
upon the river of cydnus
agrippa there she appear'd indeed or my reporter devis'd well for
empty
enobarbus i will tell you
the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne
purple the sails and so perfumed that
the winds were love sick with them the oars were silver
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
the water which they beat to follow faster
as amorous of their strokes for her own person
it beggar'd all description she did lie
in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue
o'erpicturing that venus where we see
the fancy out work nature on each side her
with divers colour'd fans whose wind did seem
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
and what they undid did
agrippa o rare for antony
enobarbus her gentlewomen like the nereides
so many mermaids tended her i' th' eyes
and made their bends adornings at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower soft hands
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs the city cast
her people out upon her and antony
enthrond i' th' market place did sit alone
whistling to th' air which but for vacancy
had gone to gaze on cleopatra too
and made a gap in nature
agrippa rare egyptian
enobarbus upon her landing antony sent to her
it should be better he became her guest
which she entreated our courteous antony
whom ne'er the word of 'no' woman heard speak
being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
and for his ordinary pays his heart
for what his eyes eat only
agrippa royal wench
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
he ploughed her and she cropp'd
hop forty paces through the public street
and having lost her breath she spoke and panted
that she did make defect perfection
and breathless pow'r breathe forth
maecenas now antony must leave her utterly
enobarbus never he will not
age cannot wither her nor custom stale
her infinite variety other women cloy
the appetites they feed but she makes hungry
become themselves in her that the holy priests
bless her when she is riggish
maecenas if beauty wisdom modesty can settle
the heart of antony octavia is
a blessed lottery to him
agrippa let us go
good enobarbus make yourself my guest
whilst you abide here
enobarbus humbly sir i thank you exeunt
rome caesar's house
enter antony caesar octavia between them
antony the world and my great office will sometimes
divide me from your bosom
octavia all which time
before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
to them for you

shall all be done by th' rule good night dear lady
octavia good night sir
caesar good night exeunt caesar and octavia

soothsayer i see it in my motion have it not in my tongue but
yet hie you to egypt again
whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar's or mine
soothsayer caesar's
therefore o antony stay not by his side
thy daemon that thy spirit which keeps thee is
noble courageous high unmatchable
where caesar's is not but near him thy angel
becomes a fear as being o'erpow'r'd therefore
make space enough between you
antony speak this no more
if thou dost play with him at any game
thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
he beats thee 'gainst the odds thy lustre thickens
when he shines by i say again thy spirit
is all afraid to govern thee near him
but he away 'tis noble
antony get thee gone
say to ventidius i would speak with him
exit soothsayer
he hath spoken true the very dice obey him
and in our sports my better cunning faints
under his chance if we draw lots he speeds
his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought and his quails ever
beat mine inhoop'd at odds i will to egypt
and though i make this marriage for my peace
i' th' east my pleasure lies

tawny finnd fishes my bended hook shall pierce

you wager'd on your angling when your diver
did hang a salt fish on his hook which he
with fervency drew up
cleopatra that time o times
i laughed him out of patience and that night
i laugh'd him into patience and next morn
ere the ninth hour i drunk him to his bed
then put my tires and mantles on him whilst
i wore his sword philippan
o from italy
ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears
that long time have been barren
messenger madam madam
cleopatra antony's dead if thou say so villain

if thou so yield him there is gold and here
my bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings
have lipp'd and trembled kissing
cleopatra why there's more gold
but sirrah mark we use
to say the dead are well bring it to that
the gold i give thee will i melt and pour
down thy ill uttering throat
messenger good madam hear me
cleopatra well go to i will
but there's no goodness in thy face if antony
be free and healthful why so tart a favour
thou shouldst come like a fury crownd with snakes
not like a formal man
messenger willt please you hear me
cleopatra i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st
yet if thou say antony lives is well
or friends with caesar or not captive to him
i'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail
rich pearls upon thee
messenger madam he's well
messenger and friends with caesar
cleopatra th'art an honest man
messenger caesar and he are greater friends than ever
cleopatra make thee a fortune from me
messenger but yet madam
cleopatra i do not like 'but yet' it does allay
the good precedence fie upon 'but yet'
'but yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
some monstrous malefactor prithee friend
the good and bad together he's friends with caesar
in state of health thou say'st and thou say'st free
messenger free madam no i made no such report

smarting in ling'ring pickle
messenger gracious madam
i that do bring the news made not the match
and make thy fortunes proud the blow thou hadst

thy modesty can beg
messenger he's married madam
cleopatra rogue thou hast liv'd too long draws a knife
messenger nay then i'll run

cleopatra some innocents scape not the thunderbolt
melt egypt into nile and kindly creatures

charmian he is afear'd to come
cleopatra i will not hurt him
these hands do lack nobility that they strike
a meaner than myself since i myself
have given myself the cause
come hither sir
though it be honest it is never good
to bring bad news give to a gracious message
an host of tongues but let ill tidings tell
themselves when they be felt
messenger i have done my duty
cleopatra is he married
i cannot hate thee worser than i do
if thou again say 'yes'
cleopatra the gods confound thee dost thou hold there still
messenger should i lie madam
cleopatra o i would thou didst

a cistern for scald snakes go get thee hence

near misenum
flourish enter pompey and menas at one door with drum and trumpet
at another caesar antony lepidus enobarbus maecenas agrippa
with soldiers marching
pompey your hostages i have so have you mine
caesar most meet
that first we come to words and therefore have we
our written purposes before us sent
which if thou hast considered let us know
if 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
and carry back to sicily much tall youth
that else must perish here
pompey to you all three
the senators alone of this great world
wherefore my father should revengers want
having a son and friends since julius caesar
who at philippi the good brutus ghosted
there saw you labouring for him what was't
that mov'd pale cassius to conspire and what
made the all honour'd honest roman brutus
with the arm'd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom
to drench the capitol but that they would
have one man but a man and that is it
the anger'd ocean foams with which i meant
to scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful rome
cast on my noble father
caesar take your time
antony thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails
we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st
how much we do o'er count thee
pompey at land indeed
thou dost o'er count me of my father's house
remain int as thou mayst
lepidus be pleas'd to tell us
for this is from the present how you take
the offers we have sent you
caesar there's the point
antony which do not be entreated to but weigh
what it is worth embrac'd
caesar and what may follow
to try a larger fortune
of sicily sardinia and i must
rid all the sea of pirates then to send
measures of wheat to rome this 'greed upon
to part with unhack'd edges and bear back
our targes undinted
all that's our offer
pompey know then
i came before you here a man prepar'd
to take this offer but mark antony
the praise of it by telling you must know
when caesar and your brother were at blows
your mother came to sicily and did find
her welcome friendly
antony i have heard it pompey
and am well studied for a liberal thanks
which i do owe you
pompey let me have your hand
i did not think sir to have met you here
that calld me timelier than my purpose hither
for i have gained by't
caesar since i saw you last
there is a change upon you
pompey well i know not
what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
but in my bosom shall she never come
to make my heart her vassal
lepidus well met here
i crave our composition may be written
and seald between us
caesar that's the next to do
pompey we'll feast each other ere we part and let's
draw lots who shall begin
antony that will i pompey
pompey no antony take the lot
but first or last your fine egyptian cookery
shall have the fame i have heard that julius caesar
antony you have heard much
pompey i have fair meanings sir
antony and fair words to them
pompey then so much have i heard
and i have heard apollodorus carried
enobarbus no more of that he did so
pompey what i pray you
enobarbus a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
pompey i know thee now how far'st thou soldier
and well am like to do for i perceive
four feasts are toward
pompey let me shake thy hand
i never hated thee i have seen thee fight
when i have envied thy behaviour
enobarbus sir
i never lov'd you much but i ha' prais'd ye
when you have well deserv'd ten times as much
as i have said you did
it nothing ill becomes thee
aboard my galley i invite you all
will you lead lords
all show's the way sir
pompey come exeunt all but enobarbus and menas
menas aside thy father pompey would ne'er have made this
treaty you and i have known sir
enobarbus at sea i think
menas we have sir
menas and you by land
enobarbus i will praise any man that will praise me though it
cannot be denied what i have done by land
menas nor what i have done by water
enobarbus yes something you can deny for your own safety you
have been a great thief by sea
menas and you by land
enobarbus there i deny my land service but give me your hand
menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two
menas all mens faces are true whatsome'er their hands are
enobarbus but there is never a fair woman has a true face
menas no slander they steal hearts
enobarbus we came hither to fight with you
menas for my part i am sorry it is turnd to a drinking
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
enobarbus if he do sure he cannot weep't back again
menas y'have said sir we look'd not for mark antony here pray
you is he married to cleopatra
menas true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus
enobarbus but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
menas pray ye sir
enobarbus 'tis true
menas then is caesar and he for ever knit together
enobarbus if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not
prophesy so
menas i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
than the love of the parties
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
menas who would not have his wife so
enobarbus not he that himself is not so which is mark antony he
will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia
blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
their variance antony will use his affection where it is he
married but his occasion here
health for you
enobarbus i shall take it sir we have us'd our throats in egypt
menas come let's away exeunt

may make too great an act for learn this silius
better to leave undone than by our deed
acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away
caesar and antony have ever won
more in their officer than person sossius
one of my place in syria his lieutenant
for quick accumulation of renown
who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
becomes his captains captain and ambition
the soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss
than gain which darkens him
i could do more to do antonius good
but 'twould offend him and in his offence
should my performance perish
silius thou hast ventidius that
without the which a soldier and his sword
ventidius i'll humbly signify what in his name
that magical word of war we have effected
how with his banners and his well paid ranks
the ne'er yet beaten horse of parthia

i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky
thy dearest quit thee exit
thyreus shall i say to caesar
what you require of him for he partly begs
to be desir'd to give it much would please him

and put yourself under his shroud
the universal landlord
thyreus my name is thyreus

i kiss his conquring hand tell him i am prompt
to lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel

have i my pillow left unpress'd in rome
forborne the getting of a lawful race

in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
adore our errors laugh at's while we strut

cleopatra o is't come to this
antony i found you as a morsel cold upon
dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment
of cneius pompey's besides what hotter hours
luxuriously pick'd out for i am sure
though you can guess what temperance should be
you know not what it is
cleopatra wherefore is this
antony to let a fellow that will take rewards
and say 'god quit you' be familiar with
my playfellow your hand this kingly seal
and plighter of high hearts o that i were
upon the hill of basan to outroar

a halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
for being yare about him

thou hast been whipt for following him henceforth
the white hand of a lady fever thee
shake thou to look ont get thee back to caesar
tell him thy entertainment look thou say
he makes me angry with him for he seems
proud and disdainful harping on what i am
not what he knew i was he makes me angry
and at this time most easy 'tis to do't
have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
into th' abysm of hell if he mislike
my speech and what is done tell him he has
hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
as he shall like to quit me urge it thou
hence with thy stripes be gone exit thyreus

antony cold hearted toward me
cleopatra ah dear if i be so
from my cold heart let heaven engender hail
and poison it in the source and the first stone
dissolve my life the next caesarion smite

by the discandying of this pelleted storm
lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile
have buried them for prey

caesar sits down in alexandria where
i will oppose his fate our force by land

not cowardly put off my helmet to
my countryman a roman by a roman
valiantly vanquish'd now my spirit is going
i can no more
cleopatra noblest of men woo't die
hast thou no care of me shall i abide
in this dull world which in thy absence is
the crown o' th' earth doth melt my lord
o wither'd is the garland of the war
the soldier's pole is falln young boys and girls
are level now with men the odds is gone
and there is nothing left remarkable
beneath the visiting moon swoons

by such poor passion as the maid that milks
and does the meanest chares it were for me
to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
to tell them that this world did equal theirs
till they had stoln our jewel alls but nought
become a dog that's mad then is it sin
to rush into the secret house of death
ere death dare come to us how do you women

i'll be to caesar if thou pleasest not
i yield thee up my life
caesar what is't thou say'st
dercetas i say o caesar antony is dead
caesar the breaking of so great a thing should make
a greater crack the round world
should have shook lions into civil streets
and citizens to their dens the death of antony
a moiety of the world
dercetas he is dead caesar
not by a public minister of justice
nor by a hired knife but that self hand
which writ his honour in the acts it did
hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
splitted the heart this is his sword
i robb'd his wound of it behold it staind
with his most noble blood
the gods rebuke me but it is tidings
to wash the eyes of kings
agrippa and strange it is
that nature must compel us to lament
our most persisted deeds
maecenas his taints and honours
wag'd equal with him
agrippa a rarer spirit never
did steer humanity but you gods will give us
maecenas when such a spacious mirror's set before him
he needs must see himself
caesar o antony
i have follow'd thee to this but we do lance
diseases in our bodies i must perforce
have shown to thee such a declining day
or look on thine we could not stall together
in the whole world but yet let me lament
with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
in top of all design my mate in empire
friend and companion in the front of war
the arm of mine own body and the heart
where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars
unreconciliable should divide
our equalness to this hear me good friends

cleopatra my desolation does begin to make
a better life 'tis paltry to be caesar

enter to the gates of the monument proculeius gallus

proculeius caesar sends greetings to the queen of egypt
and bids thee study on what fair demands
thou meanst to have him grant thee

did tell me of you bade me trust you but
i do not greatly care to be deceiv'd
that have no use for trusting if your master
would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
that majesty to keep decorum must
no less beg than a kingdom if he please
to give me conquer'd egypt for my son
he gives me so much of mine own as i
will kneel to him with thanks
y'are falln into a princely hand fear nothing
make your full reference freely to my lord
who is so full of grace that it flows over
on all that need let me report to him
your sweet dependency and you shall find
a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
where he for grace is kneeld to
cleopatra pray you tell him
i am his fortune's vassal and i send him
a doctrine of obedience and would gladly
look him i' th' face
proculeius this i'll report dear lady
have comfort for i know your plight is pitied

i'll not sleep neither this mortal house i'll ruin
do caesar what he can know sir that i
will not wait piniond at your master's court
nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
of dull octavia shall they hoist me up
and show me to the shouting varletry
of censuring rome rather a ditch in egypt
be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus' mud
lay me stark nak'd and let the water flies
my country's high pyramides my gibbet
and hang me up in chains
proculeius you do extend
these thoughts of horror further than you shall
find cause in caesar
enter dolabella
dolabella proculeius
what thou hast done thy master caesar knows
and he hath sent for thee for the queen
proculeius so dolabella

cleopatra say i would die
exeunt proculeius and soldiers
dolabella most noble empress you have heard of me
cleopatra i cannot tell
dolabella assuredly you know me
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
is't not your trick
dolabella i understand not madam
cleopatra i dreamt there was an emperor antony
o such another sleep that i might see
but such another man
dolabella if it might please ye
cleopatra his face was as the heav'ns and therein stuck
a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted
dolabella most sovereign creature
cleopatra his legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm
crested the world his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres and that to friends
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb
he was as rattling thunder for his bounty
there was no winter int an autumn 'twas
that grew the more by reaping his delights
were dolphin like they show'd his back above
walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
as plates dropp'd from his pocket
dolabella cleopatra
cleopatra think you there was or might be such a man
as this i dreamt of
dolabella gentle madam no
cleopatra you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be nor ever were one such
it's past the size of drearning nature wants stuff
an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy
condemning shadows quite
dolabella hear me good madam
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
as answering to the weight would i might never
o'ertake pursu'd success but i do feel
by the rebound of yours a grief that smites
my very heart at root
cleopatra i thank you sir
dolabella i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
cleopatra nay pray you sir
dolabella though he be honourable
cleopatra he'll lead me then in triumph
dolabella madam he will i know't flourish

enter caesar gallus proculeius maecenas seleucus
and others of his train
caesar which is the queen of egypt
caesar arise you shall not kneel
i pray you rise rise egypt
cleopatra sir the gods
will have it thus my master and my lord
i must obey
caesar take to you no hard thoughts
the record of what injuries you did us
though written in our flesh we shall remember
as things but done by chance
i cannot project mine own cause so well
to make it clear but do confess i have
been laden with like frailties which before
have often sham'd our sex
caesar cleopatra know
we will extenuate rather than enforce
if you apply yourself to our intents
which towards you are most gentle you shall find
a benefit in this change but if you seek
antony's course you shall bereave yourself
of my good purposes and put your children
to that destruction which i'll guard them from
if thereon you rely i'll take my leave
cleopatra and may through all the world 'tis yours and we
your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
hang in what place you please here my good lord
caesar you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
cleopatra this is the brief of money plate and jewels
not petty things admitted where's seleucus
seleucus here madam
cleopatra this is my treasurer let him speak my lord
upon his peril that i have reserv'd
to myself nothing speak the truth seleucus
seleucus madam
i had rather seal my lips than to my peril
speak that which is not
cleopatra what have i kept back
caesar nay blush not cleopatra i approve
your wisdom in the deed
cleopatra see caesar o behold
how pomp is followed mine will now be yours
and should we shift estates yours would be mine
the ingratitude of this seleucus does
even make me wild o slave of no more trust
than love that's hir'd what goest thou back thou shalt
go back i warrant thee but i'll catch thine eyes
o rarely base
caesar good queen let us entreat you
cleopatra o caesar what a wounding shame is this
that thou vouchsafing here to visit me
doing the honour of thy lordliness
to one so meek that mine own servant should
parcel the sum of my disgraces by
addition of his envy say good caesar
that i some lady trifles have reserv'd
as we greet modern friends withal and say
some nobler token i have kept apart
for livia and octavia to induce
their mediation must i be unfolded
with one that i have bred the gods it smites me
beneath the fall i have to seleucus prithee go hence
or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
through th' ashes of my chance wert thou a man
thou wouldst have mercy on me
cleopatra be it known that we the greatest are misthought
for things that others do and when we fall
we answer others' merits in our name
are therefore to be pitied
caesar cleopatra
not what you have reserv'd nor what acknowledg'd
put we i' th' roll of conquest still be't yours
bestow it at your pleasure and believe
caesar's no merchant to make prize with you
make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
for we intend so to dispose you as
yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep
our care and pity is so much upon you
that we remain your friend and so adieu
cleopatra my master and my lord

iras the gods forbid
cleopatra nay 'tis most certain iras saucy lictors

ballad us out o' tune the quick comedians
extemporally will stage us and present
our alexandrian revels antony
shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see
some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness
i' th' posture of a whore
cleopatra nay that's certain
iras i'll never see't for i am sure mine nails

cleopatra why that's the way
to fool their preparation and to conquer
their most absurd intents
enter charmian

guardsman here is a rural fellow
that will not be denied your highness' presence
cleopatra let him come in exit guardsman
what poor an instrument
may do a noble deed he brings me liberty
my resolutions plac'd and i have nothing
of woman in me now from head to foot
i am marble constant now the fleeting moon
no planet is of mine
re enter guardsman and clown with a basket
guardsman this is the man
hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there
that kills and pains not
clown truly i have him but i would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover
cleopatra remember'st thou any that have died ont
clown very many men and women too i heard of one of them no
longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given
to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how
a very good report o' th' worm but he that will believe all that
they say shall never be saved by half that they do but this is
most falliable the worm's an odd worm
cleopatra get thee hence farewell
clown i wish you all joy of the worm
sets down the basket
cleopatra farewell
clown you must think this look you that the worm will do his
empty
clown look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
cleopatra take thou no care it shall be heeded
clown very good give it nothing i pray you for it is not worth
the feeding
cleopatra will it eat me
clown you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil
himself will not eat a woman i know that a woman is a dish for
the gods if the devil dress her not but truly these same
every ten that they make the devils mar five
cleopatra well get thee gone farewell
clown yes forsooth i wish you joy o' th' worm exit
re enter iras with a robe crown c
cleopatra give me my robe put on my crown i have
immortal longings in me now no more
the juice of egypt's grape shall moist this lip
yare yare good iras quick methinks i hear
antony call i see him rouse himself
the luck of caesar which the gods give men
to excuse their after wrath husband i come
now to that name my courage prove my title
i am fire and air my other elements
i give to baser life so have you done
come then and take the last warmth of my lips
farewell kind charmian iras long farewell
kisses them iras falls and dies
have i the aspic in my lips dost fall
the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch
which hurts and is desir'd dost thou lie still
if thou vanishest thou tellst the world
it is not worth leave taking
charmian dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say
the gods themselves do weep
cleopatra this proves me base
if she first meet the curled antony
he'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
to an asp which she applies to her breast
with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
of life at once untie poor venomous fool
be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak
that i might hear thee call great caesar ass
empty
charmian o eastern star
cleopatra peace peace
dost thou not see my baby at my breast
charmian o break o break
cleopatra as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
o antony nay i will take thee too
applying another asp to her arm
what should i stay dies
charmian in this vile world so fare thee well
now boast thee death in thy possession lies
a lass unparalleld downy windows close
and golden phoebus never be beheld
i'll mend it and then play
enter the guard rushing in
first guard where's the queen
charmian speak softly wake her not
first guard caesar hath sent
charmian too slow a messenger applies an asp
o come apace dispatch i partly feel thee
first guard approach ho alls not well caesar's beguild
second guard there's dolabella sent from caesar call him
charmian it is well done and fitting for a princes
descended of so many royal kings
ah soldier charmian dies
re enter dolabella
dolabella how goes it here
second guard all dead
dolabella caesar thy thoughts
touch their effects in this thyself art coming
to see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
within 'a way there a way for caesar'
re enter caesar and all his train
dolabella o sir you are too sure an augurer
that you did fear is done
caesar bravest at the last
she levelld at our purposes and being royal
took her own way the manner of their deaths
i do not see them bleed
dolabella who was last with them
this was his basket
caesar poisond then
first guard o caesar
this charmian liv'd but now she stood and spake
i found her trimming up the diadem
on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
and on the sudden dropp'd
caesar o noble weakness
if they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
as she would catch another antony
in her strong toil of grace
dolabella here on her breast
there is a vent of blood and something blown
the like is on her arm
first guard this is an aspic's trail and these fig leaves
have slime upon them such as th' aspic leaves
upon the caves of nile
caesar most probable
she hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
of easy ways to die take up her bed
and bear her women from the monument
she shall be buried by her antony
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
a pair so famous high events as these
strike those that make them and their story is
no less in pity than his glory which
brought them to be lamented our army shall
and then to rome come dolabella see
high order in this great solemnity exeunt
the end

oliver good monsieur charles what's the new news at the new
empty
charles there's no news at the court sir but the old news that
and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
therefore he gives them good leave to wander
oliver can you tell if rosalind the duke's daughter be banished
with her father
charles o no for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves her
being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have
followed her exile or have died to stay behind her she is at
the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
oliver where will the old duke live
charles they say he is already in the forest of arden and a many
merry men with him and there they live like the old robin hood
of england they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day
and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world
oliver what you wrestle to morrow before the new duke
charles marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
matter i am given sir secretly to understand that your younger
brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
your brother is but young and tender and for your love i would
be loath to foil him as i must for my own honour if he come
in therefore out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint
you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment
or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is
thing of his own search and altogether against my will
oliver charles i thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt
find i will most kindly requite i had myself notice of my
dissuade him from it but he is resolute i'll tell thee
charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full of
ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret
and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his
neck as his finger and thou wert best look to't for if thou
dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace
himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap
thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he
assure thee and almost with tears i speak it there is not one
so young and so villainous this day living i speak but brotherly
of him but should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must blush
and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
charles i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
to morrow i'll give him his payment if ever he go alone again
i'll never wrestle for prize more and so god keep your worship
empty
oliver farewell good charles now will i stir this gamester i
hates nothing more than he yet he's gentle never schoold and
yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly
beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and
especially of my own people who best know him that i am
altogether misprised but it shall not be so long this wrestler
shall clear all nothing remains but that i kindle the boy
thither which now i'll go about exit
scene ii
a lawn before the duke's palace
celia i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
rosalind dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and
would you yet i were merrier unless you could teach me to forget
a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any
extraordinary pleasure
celia herein i see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that i
love thee if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy
uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me i
could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst
as mine is to thee
rosalind well i will forget the condition of my estate to
rejoice in yours
celia you know my father hath no child but i nor none is like to
have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what
he hath taken away from thy father perforce i will render thee
again in affection by mine honour i will and when i break that
oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet rose my dear
rose be merry
let me see what think you of falling in love
celia marry i prithee do to make sport withal but love no man
in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety
of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again
rosalind what shall be our sport then
celia let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her
wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
rosalind i would we could do so for her benefits are mightily
misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
celia 'tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
honest and those that she makes honest she makes very
empty
rosalind nay now thou goest from fortune's office to nature's
fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of
empty
enter touchstone
celia no when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by
fortune fall into the fire though nature hath given us wit to
the argument
rosalind indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
fortune makes nature's natural the cutter off of nature's wit
celia peradventure this is not fortune's work neither but
nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for
always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits how
now wit whither wander you
touchstone mistress you must come away to your father
touchstone no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
rosalind where learned you that oath fool
touchstone of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught
now i'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard
was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
celia how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
rosalind ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
touchstone stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear
celia by our beards if we had them thou art
touchstone by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this
knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he
had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
that mustard
celia prithee who is't that thou meanst
touchstone one that old frederick your father loves
celia my father's love is enough to honour him enough speak no
touchstone the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
men do foolishly
celia by my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that
fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have
makes a great show here comes monsieur le beau

ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and
here where you are they are coming to perform it
celia well the beginning that is dead and buried
le beau there comes an old man and his three sons
celia i could match this beginning with an old tale
le beau three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
these presents'
le beau the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the duke's
wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of
his ribs that there is little hope of life in him so he serv'd
the second and so the third yonder they lie the poor old man
their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the
beholders take his part with weeping
rosalind alas
touchstone but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have
le beau why this that i speak of
touchstone thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time
that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies
celia or i i promise thee
rosalind but is there any else longs to see this broken music in
his sides is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking shall we
see this wrestling cousin

appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it

duke frederick goes apart
le beau monsieur the challenger the princess calls for you

orlando no fair princess he is the general challenger i come
but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
celia young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
you have seen cruel proof of this mans strength if you saw
yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the
fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own
safety and give over this attempt
rosalind do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be
wrestling might not go forward
orlando i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts
wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
ladies any thing but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
with me to my trial wherein if i be foild there is but one
sham'd that was never gracious if killd but one dead that is
willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none
to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only
in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when
rosalind the little strength that i have i would it were with
empty
celia and mine to eke out hers
rosalind fare you well pray heaven i be deceiv'd in you
celia your heart's desires be with you
charles come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
lie with his mother earth
orlando ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
frederick you shall try but one fall
second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
orlando you mean to mock me after you should not have mock'd me
before but come your ways
rosalind now hercules be thy speed young man
celia i would i were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the
leg they wrestle
rosalind o excellent young man
celia if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who should
empty

frederick how dost thou charles
le beau he cannot speak my lord
frederick bear him away what is thy name young man
orlando orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de
empty
frederick i would thou hadst been son to some man else
the world esteem'd thy father honourable
thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed
hadst thou descended from another house
but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
i would thou hadst told me of another father
exeunt duke train and le beau
celia were i my father coz would i do this
orlando i am more proud to be sir rowland's son
his youngest son and would not change that calling
to be adopted heir to frederick
and all the world was of my father's mind
had i before known this young man his son
i should have given him tears unto entreaties
ere he should thus have ventur'd
celia gentle cousin
let us go thank him and encourage him
my father's rough and envious disposition
sticks me at heart sir you have well deserv'd
if you do keep your promises in love
your mistress shall be happy
rosalind gentleman giving him a chain from her neck
wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
that could give more but that her hand lacks means
shall we go coz
celia ay fare you well fair gentleman
orlando can i not say 'i thank you' my better parts
are all thrown down and that which here stands up
is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
i'll ask him what he would did you call sir
sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
more than your enemies
celia will you go coz
rosalind have with you fare you well
exeunt rosalind and celia
orlando what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
i cannot speak to her yet she urg'd conference
o poor orlando thou art overthrown
re enter le beau
le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you
to leave this place albeit you have deserv'd
high commendation true applause and love
yet such is now the duke's condition
that he misconstrues all that you have done
the duke is humorous what he is indeed
more suits you to conceive than i to speak of
orlando i thank you sir and pray you tell me this
that here was at the wrestling
le beau neither his daughter if we judge by manners
but yet indeed the smaller is his daughter
the other is daughter to the banish'd duke
and here detaind by her usurping uncle
to keep his daughter company whose loves
are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
but i can tell you that of late this duke
hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece
but that the people praise her for her virtues
and pity her for her good father's sake
and on my life his malice 'gainst the lady
will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
hereafter in a better world than this
i shall desire more love and knowledge of you
orlando i rest much bounden to you fare you well
exit le beau
thus must i from the smoke into the smother
but heavenly rosalind exit
scene iii
the duke's palace
enter celia and rosalind
celia why cousin why rosalind cupid have mercy
not a word
rosalind not one to throw at a dog
celia no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs
throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any
celia but is all this for your father
rosalind no some of it is for my child's father o how full of
briers is this working day world
celia they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday
foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats
will catch them
rosalind i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my
empty
rosalind i would try if i could cry 'hem' and have him
celia come come wrestle with thy affections
rosalind o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
celia o a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of
a fall but turning these jests out of service let us talk in
good earnest is it possible on such a sudden you should fall
into so strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son
rosalind the duke my father lov'd his father dearly
celia doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
father dearly yet i hate not orlando
rosalind no faith hate him not for my sake
celia why should i not doth he not deserve well
enter duke frederick with lords
rosalind let me love him for that and do you love him because i
do look here comes the duke
celia with his eyes full of anger
frederick mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
and get you from our court
frederick you cousin
within these ten days if that thou beest found
so near our public court as twenty miles
thou diest for it
rosalind i do beseech your grace
let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
if with myself i hold intelligence
or have acquaintance with mine own desires
if that i do not dream or be not frantic
never so much as in a thought unborn
did i offend your highness
frederick thus do all traitors
if their purgation did consist in words
they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
rosalind yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends
frederick thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
so was i when your highness banish'd him
treason is not inherited my lord
or if we did derive it from our friends
what's that to me my father was no traitor
then good my liege mistake me not so much
to think my poverty is treacherous
celia dear sovereign hear me speak
frederick ay celia we stay'd her for your sake
else had she with her father rang'd along
it was your pleasure and your own remorse
i was too young that time to value her
but now i know her if she be a traitor
why so am i we still have slept together
rose at an instant learnd play'd eat together
and wheresoe'er we went like juno's swans
still we went coupled and inseparable
frederick she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
her very silence and her patience
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
when she is gone then open not thy lips
firm and irrevocable is my doom
which i have pass'd upon her she is banish'd
celia pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
i cannot live out of her company
frederick you are a fool you niece provide yourself
if you outstay the time upon mine honour
exeunt duke and lords
celia o my poor rosalind whither wilt thou go
wilt thou change fathers i will give thee mine
i charge thee be not thou more griev'd than i am
rosalind i have more cause
celia thou hast not cousin
prithee be cheerful know'st thou not the duke
hath banish'd me his daughter
rosalind that he hath not
which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
shall we be sund'red shall we part sweet girl
no let my father seek another heir
therefore devise with me how we may fly
whither to go and what to bear with us
and do not seek to take your charge upon you
to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
say what thou canst i'll go along with thee
celia to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
rosalind alas what danger will it be to us
maids as we are to travel forth so far
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
celia i'll put myself in poor and mean attire
and with a kind of umber smirch my face
the like do you so shall we pass along
and never stir assailants
rosalind were it not better
that i did suit me all points like a man
a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh
a boar spear in my hand and in my heart
lie there what hidden womans fear there will
we'll have a swashing and a martial outside
as many other mannish cowards have
that do outface it with their semblances
celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man
rosalind i'll have no worse a name than jove's own page
but what will you be calld
celia something that hath a reference to my state
no longer celia but aliena
rosalind but cousin what if we assay'd to steal
the clownish fool out of your father's court
would he not be a comfort to our travel
celia he'll go along o'er the wide world with me
leave me alone to woo him let's away
and get our jewels and our wealth together
to hide us from pursuit that will be made
after my flight now go we in content
to liberty and not to banishment exeunt
act ii scene i
the forest of arden
enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords like foresters
duke senior now my co mates and brothers in exile
hath not old custom made this life more sweet
than that of painted pomp are not these woods
here feel we not the penalty of adam
the seasons' difference as the icy fang
and churlish chiding of the winter's wind
which when it bites and blows upon my body
even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
'this is no flattery these are counsellors
that feelingly persuade me what i am'
sweet are the uses of adversity
which like the toad ugly and venomous
and this our life exempt from public haunt
finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
sermons in stones and good in everything
i would not change it
amiens happy is your grace
that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
into so quiet and so sweet a style
duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
should in their own confines with forked heads
have their round haunches gor'd
first lord indeed my lord
the melancholy jaques grieves at that
and in that kind swears you do more usurp
than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
to day my lord of amiens and myself
did steal behind him as he lay along
under an oak whose antique root peeps out
to the which place a poor sequest'red stag
that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
did come to languish and indeed my lord
the wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
almost to bursting and the big round tears
cours'd one another down his innocent nose
in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
much marked of the melancholy jaques
augmenting it with tears
duke senior but what said jaques
did he not moralize this spectacle
first lord o yes into a thousand similes
first for his weeping into the needless stream
'poor deer' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
to that which had too much' then being there alone
left and abandoned of his velvet friends
the flux of company' anon a careless herd
full of the pasture jumps along by him
and never stays to greet him 'ay' quoth jaques
'sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
'tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
upon that poor and broken bankrupt there'
thus most invectively he pierceth through
the body of the country city court
yea and of this our life swearing that we
to fright the animals and to kill them up
in their assignd and native dwelling place
duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation
second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting
upon the sobbing deer
duke senior show me the place
i love to cope him in these sullen fits
for then he's full of matter
first lord i'll bring you to him straight exeunt
the duke's palace
enter duke frederick with lords
frederick can it be possible that no man saw them
it cannot be some villains of my court
are of consent and sufferance in this
first lord i cannot hear of any that did see her
the ladies her attendants of her chamber
saw her abed and in the morning early
they found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress
your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess' gentlewoman
confesses that she secretly o'erheard
your daughter and her cousin much commend
the parts and graces of the wrestler
that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
and she believes wherever they are gone
that youth is surely in their company
frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
i'll make him find him do this suddenly
and let not search and inquisition quail
to bring again these foolish runaways exeunt
scene iii
before oliver's house
enter orlando and adam meeting
orlando who's there
adam what my young master o my gentle master
o my sweet master o you memory
why are you virtuous why do people love you
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome
the bonny prizer of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men
their graces serve them but as enemies
no more do yours your virtues gentle master
are sanctified and holy traitors to you
envenoms him that bears it
orlando why what's the matter
adam o unhappy youth
come not within these doors within this roof
the enemy of all your graces lives
your brother no no brother yet the son
yet not the son i will not call him son
of him i was about to call his father
hath heard your praises and this night he means
and you within it if he fail of that
he will have other means to cut you off
i overheard him and his practices
this is no place this house is but a butchery
abhor it fear it do not enter it
orlando why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
adam no matter whither so you come not here
orlando what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
this i must do or know not what to do
yet this i will not do do how i can
i rather will subject me to the malice
of a diverted blood and bloody brother
adam but do not so i have five hundred crowns
the thrifty hire i sav'd under your father
which i did store to be my foster nurse
when service should in my old limbs lie lame
and unregarded age in corners thrown
yea providently caters for the sparrow
be comfort to my age here is the gold
all this i give you let me be your servant
though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
for in my youth i never did apply
hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
the means of weakness and debility
therefore my age is as a lusty winter
i'll do the service of a younger man
in all your business and necessities
orlando o good old man how well in thee appears
the constant service of the antique world
when service sweat for duty not for meed
thou art not for the fashion of these times
where none will sweat but for promotion
and having that do choke their service up
even with the having it is not so with thee
that cannot so much as a blossom yield
in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways we'll go along together
and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
we'll light upon some settled low content
adam master go on and i will follow the
to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost four score
here lived i but now live here no more
but at fourscore it is too late a week
yet fortune cannot recompense me better
than to die well and not my master's debtor exeunt
scene iv
the forest of arden
enter rosalind for ganymede celia for aliena and clown alias touchstone
rosalind o jupiter how weary are my spirits
touchstone i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
rosalind i could find in my heart to disgrace my mans apparel
doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat
therefore courage good aliena
celia i pray you bear with me i cannot go no further
touchstone for my part i had rather bear with you than bear you
yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you for i think you
have no money in your purse
rosalind well this is the forest of arden
touchstone ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was at
home i was in a better place but travellers must be content
rosalind ay be so good touchstone look you who comes here a
young man and an old in solemn talk
corin that is the way to make her scorn you still
silvius o corin that thou knew'st how i do love her
corin i partly guess for i have lov'd ere now
silvius no corin being old thou canst not guess
though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
but if thy love were ever like to mine
how many actions most ridiculous
hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
corin into a thousand that i have forgotten
silvius o thou didst then never love so heartily
if thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
that ever love did make thee run into
thou hast not lov'd
or if thou hast not sat as i do now
wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise
or if thou hast not broke from company
abruptly as my passion now makes me
thou hast not lov'd
o phebe phebe phebe exit silvius
rosalind alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
i have by hard adventure found mine own
touchstone and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke my
sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a night to
jane smile and i remember the kissing of her batler and the
the wooing of peascod instead of her from whom i took two cods
and giving her them again said with weeping tears 'wear these
for my sake' we that are true lovers run into strange capers
but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal
in folly
rosalind thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of
touchstone nay i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i break
my shins against it
rosalind jove jove this shepherd's passion
touchstone and mine but it grows something stale with me
celia i pray you one of you question yond man
if he for gold will give us any food
i faint almost to death
touchstone holla you clown
rosalind peace fool he's not thy ensman
corin who calls
touchstone your betters sir
corin else are they very wretched
corin and to you gentle sir and to you all
rosalind i prithee shepherd if that love or gold
can in this desert place buy entertainment
bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
and faints for succour
corin fair sir i pity her
and wish for her sake more than for mine own
my fortunes were more able to relieve her
and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
my master is of churlish disposition
and little recks to find the way to heaven
by doing deeds of hospitality
besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
by reason of his absence there is nothing
that you will feed on but what is come see
and in my voice most welcome shall you be
corin that young swain that you saw here but erewhile
that little cares for buying any thing
rosalind i pray thee if it stand with honesty
buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
and thou shalt have to pay for it of us
celia and we will mend thy wages i like this place
and willingly could waste my time in it
corin assuredly the thing is to be sold
go with me if you like upon report
i will your very faithful feeder be
and buy it with your gold right suddenly exeunt

adam dear master i can go no further o i die for food here lie

little comfort a little cheer thyself a little if this uncouth
forest yield anything savage i will either be food for it or
bring it for food to thee thy conceit is nearer death than thy
powers for my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the

anything in this desert cheerly good adam exeunt
scene vii
the forest
a table set out enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws
duke senior i think he be transform'd into a beast
for i can nowhere find him like a man
first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence
here was he merry hearing of a song
we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him i would speak with him
enter jaques
first lord he saves my labour by his own approach
duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this
that your poor friends must woo your company
what you look merrily
jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i' th' forest
a motley fool a miserable world
who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
and raild on lady fortune in good terms
in good set terms and yet a motley fool
'good morrow fool' quoth i 'no sir' quoth he
'call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune'
and then he drew a dial from his poke
and looking on it with lack lustre eye
says very wisely 'it is ten o'clock
thus we may see' quoth he 'how the world wags
and after one hour more 'twill be eleven
and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
and thereby hangs a tale' when i did hear
the motley fool thus moral on the time
my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
that fools should be so deep contemplative
and i did laugh sans intermission
an hour by his dial o noble fool
duke senior what fool is this
jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
and says if ladies be but young and fair
they have the gift to know it and in his brain
which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
with observation the which he vents
in mangled forms o that i were a fool
i am ambitious for a motley coat
jaques it is my only suit
provided that you weed your better judgments
of all opinion that grows rank in them
that i am wise i must have liberty
withal as large a charter as the wind
to blow on whom i please for so fools have
and they that are most galled with my folly
they most must laugh and why sir must they so
the why is plain as way to parish church
doth very foolishly although he smart
not to seem senseless of the bob if not
the wise mans folly is anatomiz'd
even by the squand'ring glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave
to speak my mind and i will through and through
cleanse the foul body of th' infected world
if they will patiently receive my medicine
duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do
duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
for thou thyself hast been a libertine
as sensual as the brutish sting itself
and all th' embossed sores and headed evils
that thou with license of free foot hast caught
wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
jaques why who cries out on pride
that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
what woman in the city do i name
when that i say the city woman bears
the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that i mean her
when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function
that says his bravery is not on my cost
thinking that i mean him but therein suits
his folly to the mettle of my speech
my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
why then my taxing like a wild goose flies
unclaim'd of any man but who comes here
enter orlando with his sword drawn
orlando forbear and eat no more
jaques why i have eat none yet
orlando nor shalt not till necessity be serv'd
jaques of what kind should this cock come of
or else a rude despiser of good manners
that in civility thou seem'st so empty
orlando you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
of smooth civility yet arn i inland bred
and know some nurture but forbear i say
he dies that touches any of this fruit
till i and my affairs are answered
jaques an you will not be answer'd with reason i must die
more than your force move us to gentleness
orlando i almost die for food and let me have it
duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table
orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you
i thought that all things had been savage here
and therefore put i on the countenance
of stern commandment but whate'er you are
that in this desert inaccessible
under the shade of melancholy boughs
if ever you have look'd on better days
if ever been where bells have knolld to church
if ever sat at any good mans feast
if ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear
and know what 'tis to pity and be pitied
let gentleness my strong enforcement be
in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
duke senior true is it that we have seen better days
and have with holy bell been knolld to church
of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red
and therefore sit you down in gentleness
and take upon command what help we have
that to your wanting may be minist'red
orlando then but forbear your food a little while
whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
and give it food there is an old poor man
who after me hath many a weary step
limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd
i will not touch a bit
duke senior go find him out
and we will nothing waste till you return
orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
empty
duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
this wide and universal theatre
presents more woeful pageants than the scene
wherein we play in
and all the men and women merely players
they have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts
his acts being seven ages at first the infant
mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
then the whining school boy with his satchel
and shining morning face creeping like snail
unwillingly to school and then the lover
sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannons mouth and then the justice
in fair round belly with good capon lind
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
full of wise saws and modern instances
and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
his youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide
for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
turning again toward childish treble pipes
and whistles in his sound last scene of all
that ends this strange eventful history
is second childishness and mere oblivion
sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing
re enter orlando with adam
duke senior welcome set down your venerable burden
orlando i thank you most for him
adam so had you need
i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
duke senior welcome fall to i will not trouble you

the forest
enter orlando with a paper
orlando hang there my verse in witness of my love
with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway
o rosalind these trees shall be my books
and in their barks my thoughts i'll character
that every eye which in this forest looks
shall see thy virtue witness'd every where
run run orlando carve on every tree
the fair the chaste and unexpressive she exit
enter corin and touchstone
touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is nought
in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in
respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in
respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect
it is not in the court it is tedious as it is a spare life
look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty
in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in
thee shepherd
ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is
without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet
and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath
learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding
or comes of a very dull kindred
touchstone such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in
court shepherd
corin no truly
corin nay i hope
touchstone truly thou art damnd like an ill roasted egg all on
one side
corin for not being at court your reason
touchstone why if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
manners if thou never saw'st good manners then thy manners must
be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art
in a parlous state shepherd
corin not a whit touchstone those that are good manners at the
country is most mockable at the court you told me you salute not
at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
touchstone instance briefly come instance
corin why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you
know are greasy
touchstone why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not the
grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man shallow
shallow a better instance i say come
touchstone your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again a
more sounder instance come
corin and they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
sheep and would you have us kiss tar the courtier's hands are
perfum'd with civet
touchstone most shallow man thou worm's meat in respect of a good
piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and perpend civet is
of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat mend
the instance shepherd
touchstone wilt thou rest damnd god help thee shallow man god
make incision in thee thou art raw
corin sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get that i
wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other
mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is
to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck
touchstone that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the
copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray
out of all reasonable match if thou beest not damnd for this
the devil himself will have no shepherds i cannot see else how
thou shouldst scape
corin here comes young master ganymede my new mistress's brother
enter rosalind reading a paper
rosalind 'from the east to western inde
no jewel is like rosalinde
her worth being mounted on the wind
through all the world bears rosalinde
are but black to rosalinde
let no face be kept in mind
but the fair of rosalinde'
touchstone i'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
suppers and sleeping hours excepted it is the right
butter womens rank to market
rosalind out fool
touchstone for a taste
if a hart do lack a hind
if the cat will after kind
so be sure will rosalinde
winter garments must be lind
so must slender rosalinde
they that reap must sheaf and bind
then to cart with rosalinde
sweetest nut hath sourest rind
such a nut is rosalinde
he that sweetest rose will find
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect
yourself with them
rosalind peace you dull fool i found them on a tree
touchstone truly the tree yields bad fruit
rosalind i'll graff it with you and then i shall graff it with a
medlar then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country for
you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that's the right
virtue of the medlar
touchstone you have said but whether wisely or no let the forest
enter celia with a writing
rosalind peace
here comes my sister reading stand aside
celia 'why should this a desert be
for it is unpeopled no
tongues i'll hang on every tree
that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage
buckles in his sum of age
some of violated vows
'twixt the souls of friend and friend
but upon the fairest boughs
or at every sentence end
will i rosalinda write
teaching all that read to know
the quintessence of every sprite
heaven would in little show
that one body should be filld
with all graces wide enlarg'd
nature presently distilld
helens cheek but not her heart
cleopatra's majesty
atalanta's better part
sad lucretia's modesty
thus rosalinde of many parts
by heavenly synod was devis'd
to have the touches dearest priz'd
heaven would that she these gifts should have
and i to live and die her slave'
rosalind o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love have
you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried 'have
patience good people'
celia how now back friends shepherd go off a little go with
him sirrah
touchstone come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
exeunt corin and touchstone
celia didst thou hear these verses
rosalind o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them
had in them more feet than the verses would bear
celia that's no matter the feet might bear the verses
rosalind ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves
without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
celia but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
hang'd and carved upon these trees
came for look here what i found on a palm tree i was never so
berhym'd since pythagoras' time that i was an irish rat which i
can hardly remember
celia trow you who hath done this
rosalind is it a man
celia and a chain that you once wore about his neck
change you colour
rosalind i prithee who
celia o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but
rosalind nay but who is it
celia is it possible
rosalind nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell
me who it is
celia o wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet
again wonderful and after that out of all whooping
rosalind good my complexion dost thou think though i am
caparisond like a man i have a doublet and hose in my
disposition one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery
thou could'st stammer that thou mightst pour this conceald man
out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrow mouth'd bottle
either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork
out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings
celia so you may put a man in your belly
rosalind is he of god's making what manner of man
is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
celia nay he hath but a little beard
rosalind why god will send more if the man will be thankful let
knowledge of his chin
celia it is young orlando that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
and your heart both in an instant
rosalind nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true
empty
celia i' faith coz 'tis he
rosalind orlando
celia orlando
rosalind alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose
wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where
remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him
again answer me in one word
celia you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first 'tis a word too
great for any mouth of this age's size to say ay and no to these
particulars is more than to answer in a catechism
rosalind but doth he know that i am in this forest and in mans
apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
celia it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a
dropp'd acorn
rosalind it may well be calld jove's tree when it drops forth
such fruit
celia give me audience good madam
rosalind proceed
celia there lay he stretch'd along like a wounded knight
rosalind though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes
the ground
unseasonably he was furnish'd like a hunter
rosalind o ominous he comes to kill my heart
celia i would sing my song without a burden thou bring'st me out
of tune
rosalind do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak
sweet say on
celia you bring me out soft comes he not here
enter orlando and jaques
rosalind 'tis he slink by and note him
lief have been myself alone
orlando and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you too
for your society
jaques god buy you let's meet as little as we can
orlando i do desire we may be better strangers
jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
their barks
orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
empty
orlando yes just
jaques i do not like her name
orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
empty
jaques what stature is she of
orlando just as high as my heart
jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and connd them out of rings
orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence
jaques you have a nimble wit i think 'twas made of atalanta's
heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against
our mistress the world and all our misery
orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself against
whom i know most faults
jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love
orlando 'tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am
weary of you
jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you
empty
jaques there i shall see mine own figure
orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
jaques i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love
orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
empty
exit jaques
rosalind aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy lackey
and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear
orlando very well what would you
rosalind i pray you what is't o'clock
orlando you should ask me what time o' day there's no clock in
the forest
rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing
every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
of time as well as a clock
orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as
empty
divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time
trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still
empty
orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd if the
interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems
the length of seven year
orlando who ambles time withal
not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study
and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one
lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other
knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles
empty
orlando who doth he gallop withal
rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly
as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
orlando who stays it still withal
and term and then they perceive not how time moves
orlando where dwell you pretty youth
rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of
the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
orlando are you native of this place
rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled
orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
so removed a dwelling
rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious
man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i
am not a woman to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal
orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
to the charge of women
rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another
as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his
fellow fault came to match it
rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are
sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
plants with carving 'rosalind' on their barks hangs odes upon
hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the
name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give
him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love
upon him
orlando i am he that is so love shak'd i pray you tell me your
empty
how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you
are not prisoner
orlando what were his marks
rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken
which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not
a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that
for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue
then your hose should be ungarter'd your bonnet unbanded your
sleeve unbuttond your shoe untied and every thing about you
are rather point device in your accoutrements as loving yourself
than seeming the lover of any other
orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you love
believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess
she does that is one of the points in the which women still give
the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that
hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired
orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i
rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as
well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why
they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing
it by counsel
orlando did you ever cure any so
rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his
time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate
changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish
shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and
women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like
him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now
weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his
mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to
forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart
that there shall not be one spot of love in 't
orlando i would not be cured youth
rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and
come every day to my cote and woo me
orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is
rosalind go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go
orlando with all my heart good youth
go exeunt
scene iii
the forest
enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind
touchstone come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats
audrey and how audrey am i the man yet doth my simple feature
content you
audrey your features lord warrant us what features
touchstone i am here with thee and thy goats as the most
jaques aside o knowledge ill inhabited worse than jove in a
thatch'd house
touchstone when a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans
good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it
strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room
truly i would the gods had made thee poetical
audrey i do not know what 'poetical is is it honest in deed and
word is it a true thing
touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning
be said as lovers they do feign
audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
touchstone i do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest
now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst
empty
audrey would you not have me honest
touchstone no truly unless thou wert hard favour'd for honesty
coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
jaques aside a material fool
empty
touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
to put good meat into an unclean dish
audrey i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
touchstone well praised be the gods for thy foulness
sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will
marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext
the vicar of the next village who hath promis'd to meet me in
this place of the forest and to couple us
audrey well the gods give us joy
touchstone amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger
in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no
assembly but horn beasts but what though courage as horns are
odious they are necessary it is said 'many a man knows no end
of his goods' right many a man has good horns and knows no end
of them well that is the dowry of his wife 'tis none of his
own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest
deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore
is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
skill by so much is horn more precious than to want here comes
sir oliver
enter sir oliver martext
sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here
under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
martext is there none here to give the woman
touchstone i will not take her on gift of any man
jaques discovering himself proceed proceed i'll give her
touchstone good even good master what ye callt how do you sir
you are very well met goddild you for your last company i am
very glad to see you even a toy in hand here sir nay pray be
empty
jaques will you be married motley
touchstone as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons
bill so wedlock would be nibbling
under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good
priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but
join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be
married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me
well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me
hereafter to leave my wife
jaques go thou with me and let me counsel thee
we must be married or we must live in bawdry
farewell good master oliver not
o sweet oliver
o brave oliver
leave me not behind thee
empty
wind away
begone i say
i will not to wedding with thee
martext 'tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
shall flout me out of my calling exit
scene iv
the forest
enter rosalind and celia
rosalind never talk to me i will weep
celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears
do not become a man
rosalind but have i not cause to weep
rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling colour
celia something browner than judas's
marry his kisses are judas's own children
rosalind i' faith his hair is of a good colour
celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
holy bread
celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of
winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of
rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and
comes not
celia nay certainly there is no truth in him
rosalind do you think so
celia yes i think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer but
for his verity in love i do think him as concave as covered
goblet or a worm eaten nut
rosalind not true in love
celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in
celia 'was' is not 'is' besides the oath of a lover is no
stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer
of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke
your father
rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him
he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as
he so he laugh'd and let me go but what talk we of fathers when
there is such a man as orlando
celia o that's a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave
traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that
spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides who
comes here
enter corin
corin mistress and master you have oft enquired
after the shepherd that complaind of love
who you saw sitting by me on the turf
praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
celia well and what of him
corin if you will see a pageant truly play'd
between the pale complexion of true love
and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
go hence a little and i shall conduct you
if you will mark it
rosalind o come let us remove
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
bring us to this sight and you shall say
scene v
another part of the forest
enter silvius and phebe
silvius sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
say that you love me not but say not so
in bitterness the common executioner
whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard
falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
but first begs pardon will you sterner be
enter rosalind celia and corin at a distance
phebe i would not be thy executioner
i fly thee for i would not injure thee
thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
'tis pretty sure and very probable
that eyes that are the frailst and softest things
who shut their coward gates on atomies
should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
now i do frown on thee with all my heart
now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
some scar of it lean upon a rush
the cicatrice and capable impressure
thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
that can do hurt
silvius o dear phebe
if ever as that ever may be near
you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
then shall you know the wounds invisible
that love's keen arrows make
phebe but till that time
come not thou near me and when that time comes
afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
rosalind advancing and why i pray you who might be your
empty
that you insult exult and all at once
over the wretched what though you have no beauty
as by my faith i see no more in you
than without candle may go dark to bed
must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why what means this why do you look on me
i see no more in you than in the ordinary
i think she means to tangle my eyes too
no faith proud mistress hope not after it
'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man
than she a woman 'tis such fools as you
'tis not her glass but you that flatters her
and out of you she sees herself more proper
than any of her lineaments can show her
but mistress know yourself down on your knees
and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
for i must tell you friendly in your ear
sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer
foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
phebe sweet youth i pray you chide a year together
i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
rosalind he's falln in love with your foulness and she'll fall
in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee
with frowning looks i'll sauce her with bitter words why look
you so upon me
phebe for no ill will i bear you
rosalind i pray you do not fall in love with me
for i am falser than vows made in wine
'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
will you go sister shepherd ply her hard
come sister shepherdess look on him better
and be not proud though all the world could see
none could be so abus'd in sight as he
come to our flock exeunt rosalind celia and corin
phebe dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might
'who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight'
silvius sweet phebe
silvius sweet phebe pity me
phebe why i arn sorry for thee gentle silvius
silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be
if you do sorrow at my grief in love
by giving love your sorrow and my grief
were both extermind
phebe thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius i would have you
phebe why that were covetousness
and yet it is not that i bear thee love
but since that thou canst talk of love so well
thy company which erst was irksome to me
i will endure and i'll employ thee too
but do not look for further recompense
than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd
silvius so holy and so perfect is my love
and i in such a poverty of grace
that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
a scatt'red smile and that i'll live upon
phebe know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
silvius not very well but i have met him oft
and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
that the old carlot once was master of
phebe think not i love him though i ask for him
'tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care i for words yet words do well
it is a pretty youth not very pretty
but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
he'll make a proper man the best thing in him
is his complexion and faster than his tongue
did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
his leg is but so so and yet 'tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip
a little riper and more lusty red
betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women silvius had they mark'd him
in parcels as i did would have gone near
to fall in love with him but for my part
i love him not nor hate him not and yet
i have more cause to hate him than to love him
for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
and now i am rememb'red scornd at me
but that's all one omittance is no quittance
i'll write to him a very taunting letter
and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
silvius phebe with all my heart
phebe i'll write it straight
the matter's in my head and in my heart
i will be bitter with him and passing short
go with me silvius exeunt
act iv scene i
enter rosalind celia and jaques
jaques i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with
empty
rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow
jaques i am so i do love it better than laughing
rosalind those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
empty
jaques why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing
jaques i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is
emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the
courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is
ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's
which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted
from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my
travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
empty
sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then
to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
poor hands
jaques yes i have gaind my experience
enter orlando
rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a
fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to
travel for it too
orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind
rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear
strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be
out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making
you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have
swam in a gondola exit jaques why how now orlando where
have you been all this while you a lover an you serve me such
another trick never come in my sight more
orlando my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
rosalind break an hour's promise in love he that will divide a
thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said
of him that cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder but i'll
warrant him heart whole
orlando pardon me dear rosalind
rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had
as lief be woo'd of a snail
orlando of a snail
rosalind ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries
his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make
orlando what's that
rosalind why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to
your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents
the slander of his wife
orlando virtue is no horn maker and my rosalind is virtuous
rosalind and i am your rosalind
celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a
better leer than you
rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour
were your very very rosalind
orlando i would kiss before i spoke
rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were
gravelld for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss
very good orators when they are out they will spit and for
lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to
empty
orlando how if the kiss be denied
rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new
orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress
rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or i
should think my honesty ranker than my wit
orlando what of my suit
rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
am not i your rosalind
orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking
of her
rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you
rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six
thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man
died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had
his brains dash'd out with a grecian club yet he did what he
could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love
leander he would have liv'd many a fair year though hero had
turnd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for
good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and
being taken with the cramp was drownd and the foolish
are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have
eaten them but not for love
orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i
protest her frown might kill me
rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i
will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me
what you will i will grant it
orlando then love me rosalind
rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
rosalind ay and twenty such
orlando what sayest thou
rosalind are you not good
orlando i hope so
rosalind why then can one desire too much of a good thing come
sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand
orlando what do you say sister
orlando pray thee marry us
celia i cannot say the words
celia go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
orlando i will
rosalind ay but when
orlando why now as fast as she can marry us
rosalind then you must say 'i take thee rosalind for wife'
orlando i take thee rosalind for wife
rosalind i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee
orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest
and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions
rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you have
possess'd her
orlando for ever and a day
rosalind say 'a day' without the 'ever' no no orlando men are
april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when
they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will
be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen
more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than
an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for
are dispos'd to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when
thou are inclind to sleep
orlando but will my rosalind do so
rosalind by my life she will do as i do
orlando o but she is wise
rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser
the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out
at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the key hole stop
that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney
whither wilt' rosalind nay you might keep that check for it till you met your
wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed
orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that
rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never
take her without her answer unless you take her without her
tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will
breed it like a fool
orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i will be
with thee again
rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would
prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that
flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and
so come death two o'clock is your hour
orlando ay sweet rosalind
rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and
by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot
think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow
lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may
be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore
beware my censure and keep your promise
orlando with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
rosalind so adieu
rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders and let time try adieu exit orlando
celia you have simply misus'd our sex in your love prate we must
world what the bird hath done to her own nest
rosalind o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst
know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded
my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal
celia or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection
in it runs out
rosalind no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of
thought conceiv'd of spleen and born of madness that blind
rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are
aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando i'll go find a
shadow and sigh till he come

enter rosalind and celia
rosalind how say you now is it not past two o'clock
celia i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath
ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep look who
comes here
enter silvius
silvius my errand is to you fair youth
my gentle phebe did bid me give you this
i know not the contents but as i guess
by the stern brow and waspish action
which she did use as she was writing of it
i am but as a guiltless messenger
rosalind patience herself would startle at this letter
and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
she says i am not fair that i lack manners
she calls me proud and that she could not love me
were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will
her love is not the hare that i do hunt
why writes she so to me well shepherd well
this is a letter of your own device
phebe did write it
rosalind come come you are a fool
and turnd into the extremity of love
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
a freestone colour'd hand i verily did think
that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands
she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter
i say she never did invent this letter
this is a mans invention and his hand
rosalind why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style
a style for challengers why she defies me
like turk to christian womens gentle brain
could not drop forth such giant rude invention
such ethiope words blacker in their effect
than in their countenance will you hear the letter
silvius so please you for i never heard it yet
yet heard too much of phebe's cruelty
rosalind she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
'art thou god to shepherd turnd
that a maidens heart hath burnd'
can a woman rail thus
silvius call you this railing
rosalind 'why thy godhead laid apart
warr'st thou with a womans heart'
did you ever hear such railing
'whiles the eye of man did woo me
that could do no vengeance to me'
'if the scorn of your bright eyne
have power to raise such love in mine
alack in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect
whiles you chid me i did love
how then might your prayers move
he that brings this love to the
little knows this love in me
and by him seal up thy mind
will the faithful offer take
of me and all that i can make
or else by him my love deny
and then i'll study how to die'
silvius call you this chiding
celia alas poor shepherd
rosalind do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love
such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false
strains upon thee not to be endur'd well go your way to her
that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not
i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a
true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
exit silvius
enter oliver
oliver good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
where in the purlieus of this forest stands
a sheep cote fenc'd about with olive trees
celia west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself
there's none within
oliver if that an eye may profit by a tongue
then should i know you by description
such garments and such years 'the boy is fair
of female favour and bestows himself
like a ripe sister the woman low
and browner than her brother' are not you
celia it is no boast being ask'd to say we are
oliver orlando doth commend him to you both
and to that youth he calls his rosalind
he sends this bloody napkin are you he
rosalind i am what must we understand by this
oliver some of my shame if you will know of me
what man i am and how and why and where
this handkercher was staind
celia i pray you tell it
he left a promise to return again
within an hour and pacing through the forest
chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
lo what befell he threw his eye aside
and mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age
and high top bald with dry antiquity
a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
lay sleeping on his back about his neck
who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
the opening of his mouth but suddenly
seeing orlando it unlink'd itself
and with indented glides did slip away
into a bush under which bush's shade
a lioness with udders all drawn dry
lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
when that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis
the royal disposition of that beast
this seen orlando did approach the man
and found it was his brother his elder brother
celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother
and he did render him the most unnatural
that liv'd amongst men
oliver and well he might so do
for well i know he was unnatural
rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there
food to the suck'd and hungry lioness
but kindness nobler ever than revenge
and nature stronger than his just occasion
made him give battle to the lioness
who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
from miserable slumber i awak'd
celia are you his brother
rosalind was't you he rescu'd
celia was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him
oliver 'twas i but 'tis not i i do not shame
so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
rosalind but for the bloody napkin
oliver by and by
when from the first to last betwixt us two
tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd
as how i came into that desert place
in brief he led me to the gentle duke
who gave me fresh array and entertainment
committing me unto my brother's love
there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
the lioness had torn some flesh away
which all this while had bled and now he fainted
and cried in fainting upon rosalind
brief i recover'd him bound up his wound
and after some small space being strong at heart
he sent me hither stranger as i am
to tell this story that you might excuse
his broken promise and to give this napkin
that he in sport doth call his rosalind
rosalind swoons
celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede
oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood
celia there is more in it cousin ganymede
oliver look he recovers
rosalind i would i were at home
celia we'll lead you thither
i pray you will you take him by the arm
you lack a mans heart
rosalind i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think
this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how
well i counterfeited heigh ho
oliver this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in
your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
rosalind counterfeit i assure you
oliver well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
rosalind so i do but i' faith i should have been a woman by
celia come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards
good sir go with us
oliver that will i for i must bear answer back
how you excuse my brother rosalind
rosalind i shall devise something but i pray you commend my
counterfeiting to him will you go exeunt

rosalind did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon

any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar's
and my sister no sooner met but they look'd no sooner look'd but
they lov'd no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd no sooner sigh'd but
they ask'd one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but
they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made pair
of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else
be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of
love and they will together clubs cannot part them
orlando they shall be married to morrow and i will bid the duke
to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it is to look into

a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should
bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you
little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and
not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do
strange things i have since i was three year old convers'd

if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i
know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not
impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set
her before your eyes to morrow human as she is and without any
orlando speak'st thou in sober meanings

circumstantial and the lie direct

duke frederick hearing how that every day

in his own conduct purposely to take

where meeting with an old religious man
after some question with him was converted
both from his enterprise and from the world
his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother
and all their lands restor'd to them again
that were with him exild this to be true

pleas'd me complexions that lik'd me and breaths that i defied

the comedy of errors
act i scene 1
a hall in the duke's palace
enter the duke of ephesus aegeon the merchant
aegeon proceed solinus to procure my fall
and by the doom of death end woes and all
duke merchant of syracuse plead no more
i am not partial to infringe our laws
the enmity and discord which of late
sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
to merchants our well dealing countrymen
who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods
for since the mortal and intestine jars
'twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
it hath in solemn synods been decreed
both by the syracusians and ourselves
to admit no traffic to our adverse towns
nay more if any born at ephesus
be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs
again if any syracusian born
come to the bay of ephesus he dies
unless a thousand marks be levied
to quit the penalty and to ransom him
thy substance valued at the highest rate
cannot amount unto a hundred marks
therefore by law thou art condemnd to die
aegeon yet this my comfort when your words are done
my woes end likewise with the evening sun
duke well syracusian say in brief the cause
why thou departed'st from thy native home
aegeon a heavier task could not have been impos'd
than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
yet that the world may witness that my end
was wrought by nature not by vile offence
i'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
in syracuse was i born and wed
unto a woman happy but for me
and by me had not our hap been bad
with her i liv'd in joy our wealth increas'd
to epidamnum till my factor's death
and the great care of goods at random left
drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
from whom my absence was not six months old
before herself almost at fainting under
the pleasing punishment that women bear
had made provision for her following me
and soon and safe arrived where i was
there had she not been long but she became
and which was strange the one so like the other
as could not be disdnguish'd but by names
that very hour and in the self same inn
a mean woman was delivered
of such a burden male twins both alike
those for their parents were exceeding poor
i bought and brought up to attend my sons
my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
made daily motions for our home return
we came aboard
a league from epidamnum had we saild
before the always wind obeying deep
gave any tragic instance of our harm
but longer did we not retain much hope
for what obscured light the heavens did grant
did but convey unto our fearful minds
a doubtful warrant of immediate death
which though myself would gladly have embrac'd
weeping before for what she saw must come
and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
that mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear
forc'd me to seek delays for them and me
and this it was for other means was none
the sailors sought for safety by our boat
and left the ship then sinking ripe to us
my wife more careful for the latter born
had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast
to him one of the other twins was bound
whilst i had been like heedful of the other
the children thus dispos'd my wife and i
fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast
and floating straight obedient to the stream
was carried towards corinth as we thought
at length the sun gazing upon the earth
dispers'd those vapours that offended us
the seas wax'd calm and we discovered
two ships from far making amain to us
of corinth that of epidaurus this
but ere they came o let me say no more
gather the sequel by that went before
duke nay forward old man do not break off so
for we may pity though not pardon thee
aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now
worthily term'd them merciless to us
we were encount'red by a mighty rock
which being violently borne upon
our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
so that in this unjust divorce of us
fortune had left to both of us alike
what to delight in what to sorrow for
her part poor soul seeming as burdened
with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
was carried with more speed before the wind
by fishermen of corinth as we thought
at length another ship had seiz'd on us
and knowing whom it was their hap to save
gave healthful welcome to their ship wreck'd guests
and would have reft the fishers of their prey
had not their bark been very slow of sail
and therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
duke and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
do me the favour to dilate at full
what have befalln of them and thee till now
aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
at eighteen years became inquisitive
after his brother and importund me
that his attendant so his case was like
reft of his brother but retaind his name
might bear him company in the quest of him
i hazarded the loss of whom i lov'd
five summers have i spent in farthest greece
roaming clean through the bounds of asia
and coasting homeward came to ephesus
hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
or that or any place that harbours men
but here must end the story of my life
and happy were i in my timely death
could all my travels warrant me they live
to bear the extremity of dire mishap
now trust me were it not against our laws
against my crown my oath my dignity
which princes would they may not disannul
my soul should sue as advocate for thee
but though thou art adjudged to the death
and passed sentence may not be recalld
but to our honour's great disparagement
yet will i favour thee in what i can
to seek thy help by beneficial hap
try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
and live if no then thou art doom'd to die
gaoler take him to thy custody
gaoler i will my lord
aegeon hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend
but to procrastinate his lifeless end

adriana neither my husband nor the slave returnd
that in such haste i sent to seek his master
sure luciana it is two o'clock
and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
good sister let us dine and never fret
a man is master of his liberty
time is their master and when they see time
they'll go or come if so be patient sister
adriana why should their liberty than ours be more
luciana because their business still lies out o' door
adriana look when i serve him so he takes it ill
luciana o know he is the bridle of your will
luciana why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
there's nothing situate under heavens eye
but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
are their males' subjects and at their controls
man more divine the master of all these
lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas
indu'd with intellectual sense and souls
of more pre eminence than fish and fowls
then let your will attend on their accords
adriana this servitude makes you to keep unwed
luciana not this but troubles of the marriage bed
adriana but were you wedded you would bear some sway
luciana ere i learn love i'll practise to obey
adriana how if your husband start some other where
luciana till he come home again i would forbear
adriana patience unmov'd no marvel though she pause
they can be meek that have no other cause
we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
but were we burd'ned with like weight of pain
as much or more we should ourselves complain
so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
with urging helpless patience would relieve me
but if thou live to see like right bereft
this fool begg'd patience in thee will be left
luciana well i will marry one day but to try
here comes your man now is your husband nigh
adriana say is your tardy master now at hand
dromio of ephesus nay he's at two hands with me and that my two
ears can witness
adriana say didst thou speak with him know'st thou his mind
dromio of ephesus ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it
luciana spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning
dromio of ephesus nay he struck so plainly i could to
well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that i could
adriana but say i prithee is he coming home
it seems he hath great care to please his wife
dromio of ephesus why mistress sure my master is horn mad
adriana horn mad thou villain
dromio of ephesus i mean not cuckold mad
but sure he is stark mad
when i desir'd him to come home to dinner
he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
tis dinner time' quoth i 'my gold' quoth he
'will you come home' quoth i 'my gold' quoth he
'where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain'
'the pig' quoth i 'is burnd' 'my gold' quoth he
'my mistress sir' quoth i 'hang up thy mistress
i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'
luciana quoth who
dromio of ephesus quoth my master
'i know' quoth he 'no house no wife no mistress'
so that my errand due unto my tongue
for in conclusion he did beat me there
adriana go back again thou slave and fetch him home
dromio of ephesus go back again and be new beaten home
for god's sake send some other messenger
adriana back slave or i will break thy pate across
dromio of ephesus and he will bless that cross with other beating
between you i shall have a holy head
adriana hence prating peasant fetch thy master home
dromio of ephesus am i so round with you as you with me
you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
if i last in this service you must case me in leather
empty
luciana fie how impatience loureth in your face
adriana his company must do his minions grace
whilst i at home starve for a merry look
hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
are my discourses dull barren my wit
unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that's not my fault he's master of my state
what ruins are in me that can be found
by him not ruind then is he the ground
of my defeatures my decayed fair
a sunny look of his would soon repair
but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
and feeds from home poor i am but his stale
adriana unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
or else what lets it but he would be here
sister you know he promis'd me a chain
would that alone a love he would detain
so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
i see the jewel best enamelled
will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
that others touch and often touching will
by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
since that my beauty cannot please his eye
i'll weep what's left away and weeping die
luciana how many fond fools serve mad jealousy

enter antipholus of syracuse
antipholus of syracuse the gold i gave to dromio is laid up
is wand'red forth in care to seek me out
by computation and mine host's report
i could not speak with dromio since at first
i sent him from the mart see here he comes
enter dromio of syracuse
how now sir is your merry humour alter'd
as you love strokes so jest with me again
you know no centaur you receiv'd no gold
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
that thus so madly thou didst answer me
dromio of syracuse what answer sir when spake i such a word
antipholus of syracuse even now even here not half an hour since
dromio of syracuse i did not see you since you sent me hence
home to the centaur with the gold you gave me
antipholus of syracuse villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeas'd
dromio of syracuse i am glad to see you in this merry vein
antipholus of syracuse yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that
beating him
dromio of syracuse hold sir for god's sake now your jest is earnest
upon what bargain do you give it me
antipholus of syracuse because that i familiarly sometimes
do use you for my fool and chat with you
your sauciness will jest upon my love
and make a common of my serious hours
but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
if you will jest with me know my aspect
and fashion your demeanour to my looks
or i will beat this method in your sconce
dromio of syracuse sconce call you it so you would
leave battering i had rather have it a head an you use
these blows long i must get a sconce for my head and
insconce it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders
but i pray sir why am i beaten
dromio of syracuse nothing sir but that i am beaten
antipholus of syracuse shall i tell you why
dromio of syracuse ay sir and wherefore for they say
every why hath a wherefore
antipholus of syracuse why first for flouting me and then wherefore
for urging it the second time to me
dromio of syracuse was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason
well sir i thank you
dromio of syracuse marry sir for this something that you gave
me for nothing
antipholus of syracuse i'll make you amends next to
give you nothing for something but say sir is it dinnertime
dromio of syracuse no sir i think the meat wants that i have
antipholus of syracuse in good time sir what's that
dromio of syracuse basting
antipholus of syracuse well sir then 'twill be dry
dromio of syracuse if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
dromio of syracuse lest it make you choleric and purchase me
another dry basting
antipholus of syracuse well sir learn to jest in good time
there's a time for all things
dromio of syracuse i durst have denied that before you
were so choleric
antipholus of syracuse by what rule sir
dromio of syracuse marry sir by a rule as plain as the
plain bald pate of father time himself
dromio of syracuse there's no time for a man to recover
his hair that grows bald by nature
antipholus of syracuse may he not do it by fine and recovery
dromio of syracuse yes to pay a fine for a periwig and
recover the lost hair of another man
antipholus of syracuse why is time such a niggard of
hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement
dromio of syracuse because it is a blessing that he bestows
on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
antipholus of syracuse why but there's many a man
hath more hair than wit
dromio of syracuse not a man of those but he hath the
wit to lose his hair
antipholus of syracuse why thou didst conclude hairy
men plain dealers without wit
dromio of syracuse the plainer dealer the sooner lost
yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity
antipholus of syracuse for what reason
antipholus of syracuse nay not sound i pray you
dromio of syracuse sure ones then
antipholus of syracuse nay not sure in a thing falsing
dromio of syracuse certain ones then
antipholus of syracuse name them
dromio of syracuse the one to save the money that he spends in
tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his
empty
antipholus of syracuse you would all this time have prov'd there
dromio of syracuse marry and did sir namely no time to recover
hair lost by nature
antipholus of syracuse but your reason was not substantial why
there is no time to recover
dromio of syracuse thus i mend it time himself is bald
and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers
antipholus of syracuse i knew 't'would be a bald conclusion but
soft who wafts us yonder
enter adriana and luciana
some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
i am not adriana nor thy wife
the time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
that never words were music to thine ear
that never object pleasing in thine eye
that never touch well welcome to thy hand
that never meat sweet savour'd in thy taste
unless i spake or look'd or touch'd or carv'd to thee
how comes it now my husband o how comes it
thyself i call it being strange to me
that undividable incorporate
am better than thy dear self's better part
ah do not tear away thyself from me
for know my love as easy mayst thou fall
a drop of water in the breaking gulf
and take unmingled thence that drop again
without addition or diminishing
as take from me thyself and not me too
should'st thou but hear i were licentious
and that this body consecrate to thee
by ruffian lust should be contaminate
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
and hurl the name of husband in my face
and tear the staind skin off my harlot brow
and from my false hand cut the wedding ring
and break it with a deep divorcing vow
i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
for if we two be one and thou play false
i do digest the poison of thy flesh
being strumpeted by thy contagion
keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed
i live dis staind thou undishonoured
antipholus of syracuse plead you to me fair dame i know you not
in ephesus i am but two hours old
as strange unto your town as to your talk
wants wit in all one word to understand
luciana fie brother how the world is chang'd with you
when were you wont to use my sister thus
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner
antipholus of syracuse by dromio
dromio of syracuse by me
adriana by thee and this thou didst return from him
that he did buffet thee and in his blows
denied my house for his me for his wife
what is the course and drift of your compact
dromio of syracuse i sir i never saw her till this time
antipholus of syracuse villain thou liest for even her very words
didst thou deliver to me on the mart
dromio of syracuse i never spake with her in all my life
antipholus of syracuse how can she thus then call us by our names
unless it be by inspiration
adriana how ill agrees it with your gravity
to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
be it my wrong you are from me exempt
but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
thou art an elm my husband i a vine
whose weakness married to thy stronger state
makes me with thy strength to communicate
if aught possess thee from me it is dross
usurping ivy brier or idle moss
who all for want of pruning with intrusion
antipholus of syracuse to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
what was i married to her in my dream
or sleep i now and think i hear all this
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
until i know this sure uncertainty
i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy
luciana dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
dromio of syracuse o for my beads i cross me for sinner
this is the fairy land o spite of spites
if we obey them not this will ensue
they'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
luciana why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not
dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
dromio of syracuse i am transformed master am not i
antipholus of syracuse i think thou art in mind and so am i
dromio of syracuse nay master both in mind and in my shape
antipholus of syracuse thou hast thine own form
dromio of syracuse no i am an ape
dromio of syracuse 'tis true she rides me and i long for grass
'tis so i am an ass else it could never be
but i should know her as well as she knows me
adriana come come no longer will i be a fool
to put the finger in the eye and weep
whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate
husband i'll dine above with you to day
and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
say he dines forth and let no creature enter
come sister dromio play the porter well
antipholus of syracuse am i in earth in heaven or in hell
sleeping or waking mad or well advis'd
known unto these and to myself disguis'd
i'll say as they say and persever so
and in this mist at all adventures go
dromio of syracuse master shall i be porter at the gate
adriana ay and let none enter lest i break your pate

scene 2
before the house of antipholus of ephesus
enter luciana with antipholus of syracuse
luciana and may it be that you have quite forgot
a husband's office shall antipholus
even in the spring of love thy love springs rot
shall love in building grow so ruinous
then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
muffle your false love with some show of blindness
let not my sister read it in your eye
be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
look sweet speak fair become disloyalty
apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
what simple thief brags of his own attaint
'tis double wrong to truant with your bed
and let her read it in thy looks at board
shame hath a bastard fame well managed
ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
alas poor women make us but believe
being compact of credit that you love us
though others have the arm show us the sleeve
we in your motion turn and you may move us
comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
'tis holy sport to be a little vain
when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
antipholus of syracuse sweet mistress what your name is else i know not
nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
than our earth's wonder more than earth divine
teach me dear creature how to think and speak
lay open to my earthy gross conceit
the folded meaning of your words' deceit
against my souls pure truth why labour you
to make it wander in an unknown field
are you a god would you create me new
transform me then and to your pow'r i'll yield
but if that i am i then well i know
your weeping sister is no wife of mine
nor to her bed no homage do i owe
far more far more to you do i decline
to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
sing siren for thyself and i will dote
spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
and as a bed i'll take them and there he
and in that glorious supposition think
he gains by death that hath such means to die
let love being light be drowned if she sink
luciana what are you mad that you do reason so
antipholus of syracuse not mad but mated how i do not know
antipholus of syracuse for gazing on your beams fair sun being by
luciana gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
antipholus of syracuse as good to wink sweet love as look on night
luciana why call you me love call my sister so
antipholus of syracuse thy sister's sister
luciana that's my sister
antipholus of syracuse no

my sole earth's heaven and my heavens claim
luciana all this my sister is or else should be
antipholus of syracuse call thyself sister sweet for i am thee

wondrous fat marriage
antipholus of syracuse how dost thou mean a fat marriage

antipholus of syracuse go hie thee presently post to the road
an if the wind blow any way from shore

antipholus of syracuse there's none but witches do inhabit here
and therefore 'tis high time that i were hence

doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister
of such enchanting presence and discourse
hath almost made me traitor to myself
but lest myself be guilty to self wrong
i'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song

exploits with his mace than a morris pike

else would he never so demean himself
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
and for the same he promis'd me a chain
both one and other he denies me now
the reason that i gather he is mad
besides this present instance of his rage
is a mad tale he told to day at dinner
of his own doors being shut against his entrance
belike his wife acquainted with his fits
my way is now to hie home to his house
and tell his wife that being lunatic
he rush'd into my house and took perforce
my ring away this course i fittest choose
for forty ducats is too much to lose
empty

antipholus of ephesus thou art sensible in nothing but
blows and so is an ass
by my long 'ears i have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for
my service but blows when i am cold he heats me with
beating when i am warm he cools me with beating i am
wak'd with it when i sleep rais'd with it when i sit driven
out of doors with it when i go from home welcom'd home

antipholus of ephesus and did not i in rage depart from thence
that since have felt the vigour of his rage
adriana is't good to soothe him in these contraries

antipholus of ephesus say wherefore didst thou lock me forth to day
and why dost thou deny the bag of gold
dromio of ephesus and gentle master i receiv'd no gold
but i confess sir that we were lock'd out
adriana dissembling villain thou speak'st false in both
antipholus of ephesus dissembling harlot thou art false in all
and art confederate with a damned pack
to make a loathsome abject scorn of me
but with these nails i'll pluck out these false eyes
that would behold in me this shameful sport
adriana o bind him bind him let him not come near me

act v scene 1
a street before a priory
enter second merchant and angelo
angelo i am sorry sir that i have hind'red you
but i protest he had the chain of me
though most dishonestly he doth deny it
second merchant how is the man esteem'd here in the city
of credit infinite highly belov'd
second to none that lives here in the city
his word might bear my wealth at any time
second merchant speak softly yonder as i think he walks
enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
angelo 'tis so and that self chain about his neck
which he forswore most monstrously to have
good sir draw near to me i'll speak to him
signior andpholus i wonder much
and not without some scandal to yourself
with circumstance and oaths so to deny
this chain which now you wear so openly
beside the charge the shame imprisonment
you have done wrong to this my honest friend
who but for staying on our controversy
had hoisted sail and put to sea to day
this chain you had of me can you deny it
antipholus of syracuse i think i had i never did deny it
antipholus of syracuse who heard me to deny it or forswear it
second merchant these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee
fie on thee wretch 'tis pity that thou liv'st
to walk where any honest men resort
antipholus of syracuse thou art a villain to impeach me thus
i'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
against thee presently if thou dar'st stand
second merchant i dare and do defy thee for a villain
they draw
adriana hold hurt him not for god's sake he is mad
some get within him take his sword away
bind dromio too and bear them to my house
dromio of syracuse run master run for god's sake take a house
this is some priory in or we are spoild
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory
enter the lady abbess
abbess be quiet people wherefore throng you hither
adriana to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
and bear him home for his recovery
angelo i knew he was not in his perfect wits
second merchant i am sorry now that i did draw on him
abbess how long hath this possession held the man
adriana this week he hath been heavy sour sad
and much different from the man he was
but till this afternoon his passion
ne'er brake into extremity of rage
abbess hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
stray'd his affection in unlawful love
a sin prevailing much in youthful men
who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
which of these sorrows is he subject to
adriana to none of these except it be the last
namely some love that drew him oft from home
abbess you should for that have reprehended him
adriana why so i did
abbess ay but not rough enough
abbess haply in private
adriana and in assemblies too
abbess ay but not enough
adriana it was the copy of our conference
in bed he slept not for my urging it
at board he fed not for my urging it
alone it was the subject of my theme
in company i often glanced it
still did i tell him it was vile and bad
the venom clamours of a jealous woman
poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
it seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing
and thereof comes it that his head is light
thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings
unquiet meals make ill digestions
thereof the raging fire of fever bred
and what's a fever but a fit of madness
thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls
but moody and dull melancholy
kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
and at her heels a huge infectious troop
of pale distemperatures and foes to life
in food in sport and life preserving rest
to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
the consequence is then thy jealous fits
hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits
luciana she never reprehended him but mildly
why bear you these rebukes and answer not
adriana she did betray me to my own reproof
good people enter and lay hold on him
abbess no not a creature enters in my house
adriana then let your servants bring my husband forth
abbess neither he took this place for sanctuary
and it shall privilege him from your hands
till i have brought him to his wits again
or lose my labour in assaying it
diet his sickness for it is my office
and will have no attorney but myself
and therefore let me have him home with me
abbess be patient for i will not let him stir
till i have us'd the approved means i have
with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
to make of him a formal man again
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
a charitable duty of my order
adriana i will not hence and leave my husband here
and ill it doth beseem your holiness
to separate the husband and the wife
abbess be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
empty
luciana complain unto the duke of this indignity
adriana come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
and never rise until my tears and prayers
have won his grace to come in person hither
second merchant by this i think the dial points at five
anon i'm sure the duke himself in person
comes this way to the melancholy vale
the place of death and sorry execution
behind the ditches of the abbey here
angelo upon what cause
second merchant to see a reverend syracusian merchant
who put unluckily into this bay
against the laws and statutes of this town
angelo see where they come we will behold his death
luciana kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
enter the duke attended aegeon bareheaded
with the headsman and other officers
duke yet once again proclaim it publicly
if any friend will pay the sum for him
he shall not die so much we tender him
adriana justice most sacred duke against the abbess
duke she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
adriana may it please your grace antipholus my husband
who i made lord of me and all i had
at your important letters this ill day
a most outrageous fit of madness took him
that desp'rately he hurried through the street
with him his bondman all as mad as he
doing displeasure to the citizens
by rushing in their houses bearing thence
rings jewels anything his rage did like
whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
that here and there his fury had committed
anon i wot not by what strong escape
he broke from those that had the guard of him
and with his mad attendant and himself
each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
met us again and madly bent on us
chas'd us away till raising of more aid
we came again to bind them then they fled
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
and will not suffer us to fetch him out
nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
therefore most gracious duke with thy command
let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
duke long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars
and i to thee engag'd a prince's word
when thou didst make him master of thy bed
to do him all the grace and good i could
and bid the lady abbess come to me
i will determine this before i stir
enter a messenger
messenger o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
my master and his man are both broke loose
beaten the maids a row and bound the doctor
whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire
and ever as it blaz'd they threw on him
great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
and sure unless you send some present help
between them they will kill the conjurer
adriana peace fool thy master and his man are here
and that is false thou dost report to us
messenger mistress upon my life i tell you true
i have not breath'd almost since i did see it
he cries for you and vows if he can take you
to scorch your face and to disfigure you
hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone
duke come stand by me fear nothing guard with halberds
adriana ay me it is my husband witness you
that he is borne about invisible
even now we hous'd him in the abbey here
and now he's there past thought of human reason
enter antipholus ofephesus and dromio ofephesus
antipholus ofephesus justice most gracious duke o grant me justice
even for the service that long since i did thee
deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
that then i lost for thee now grant me justice
aegeon unless the fear of death doth make me dote
i see my son antipholus and dromio
antipholus ofephesus justice sweet prince against that woman there
she whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife
that hath abused and dishonoured me
even in the strength and height of injury
beyond imagination is the wrong
duke discover how and thou shalt find me just
antipholus ofephesus this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
while she with harlots feasted in my house
duke a grievous fault say woman didst thou so
adriana no my good lord myself he and my sister
to day did dine together so befall my soul
as this is false he burdens me withal
luciana ne'er may i look on day nor sleep on night
but she tells to your highness simple truth
in this the madman justly chargeth them
antipholus of ephesus my liege i am advised what i say
neither disturbed with the effect of wine
nor heady rash provok'd with raging ire
albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
could witness it for he was with me then
who parted with me to go fetch a chain
where balthazar and i did dine together
our dinner done and he not coming thither
i went to seek him in the street i met him
and in his company that gentleman
there did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
that i this day of him receiv'd the chain
which god he knows i saw not for the which
he did arrest me with an officer
i did obey and sent my peasant home
then fairly i bespoke the officer
to go in person with me to my house
by th' way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more
of vile confederates along with them
they brought one pinch a hungry lean fac'd villain
a mere anatomy a mountebank
a threadbare juggler and a fortune teller
a needy hollow ey'd sharp looking wretch
a living dead man this pernicious slave
and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
and with no face as 'twere outfacing me
cries out i was possess'd then all together
they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
and in a dark and dankish vault at home
there left me and my man both bound together
till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
i gaind my freedom and immediately
ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
for these deep shames and great indignities
angelo my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
that he dind not at home but was lock'd out
duke but had he such a chain of thee or no
angelo he had my lord and when he ran in here
these people saw the chain about his neck
second merchant besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
heard you confess you had the chain of him
after you first forswore it on the mart
and then you fled into this abbey here
from whence i think you are come by miracle
antipholus of ephesus i never came within these abbey walls
nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
i never saw the chain so help me heaven
and this is false you burden me withal
duke why what an intricate impeach is this
i think you all have drunk of circe's cup
if here you hous'd him here he would have been
you say he dind at home the goldsmith here
denies that saying sirrah what say you
dromio of ephesus sir he dind with her there at the porpentine
courtezan he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring
antipholus of ephesus 'tis true my liege this ring i had of her
duke saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here
courtezan as sure my liege as i do see your grace
duke why this is strange go call the abbess hither
i think you are all mated or stark mad
aegeon most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
haply i see a friend will save my life
and pay the sum that may deliver me
duke speak freely syracusian what thou wilt
aegeon is not your name sir calld antipholus
and is not that your bondman dromio
dromio of ephesus within this hour i was his bondman sir
but he i thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
now am i dromio and his man unbound
dromio of ephesus ourselves we do remember sir by you
for lately we were bound as you are now
you are not pinch's patient are you sir
aegeon why look you strange on me you know me well
antipholus of ephesus i never saw you in my life till now
aegeon o grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last
and careful hours with time's deformed hand
have written strange defeatures in my face
but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
aegeon dromio nor thou
dromio of ephesus no trust me sir nor i
aegeon i am sure thou dost
dromio of ephesus ay sir but i am sure i do not and
whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him
aegeon not know my voice o time's extremity
hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
in seven short years that here my only son
knows not my feeble key of untund cares
in sap consuming winter's drizzled snow
and all the conduits of my blood froze up
yet hath my night of life some memory
my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
all these old witnesses i cannot err
tell me thou art my son antipholus
antipholus of ephesus i never saw my father in my life
aegeon but seven years since in syracuse boy
thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery
antipholus of ephesus the duke and all that know me in
the city can witness with me that it is not so

and me they left with those of epidamnum
what then became of them i cannot tell
i to this fortune that you see me in
duke why here begins his morning story right

first citizen first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the
empty
all we know't we know't
first citizen let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own
price is't a verdict
all no more talking ont let it be done away away
second citizen one word good citizens
first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess
they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the
leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a
gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in
thirst for revenge
second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius
first citizen against him first he's a very dog to the
second citizen consider you what services he has done for his
empty
first citizen very well and could be content to give him good
report for't but that he pays himself with being proud
second citizen nay but speak not maliciously
first citizen i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it
to that end though soft conscienc'd men can be content to say it
was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be
partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue
vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous

with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you
first citizen our business is not unknown to th' senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll
show 'em in deeds they say poor suitors have strong breaths
they shall know we have strong arms too
menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
will you undo yourselves
menenius i tell you friends most charitable care
have the patricians of you for your wants
your suffering in this dearth you may as well
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the roman state whose course will on
the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment for the dearth
the gods not the patricians make it and
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you and you slander
the helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers
when you curse them as enemies
first citizen care for us true indeed they ne'er car'd for us
yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm'd with
grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily
any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the
empty
menenius either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious
or be accus'd of folly i shall tell you
a pretty tale it may be you have heard it
but since it serves my purpose i will venture
to stale't a little more
first citizen well i'll hear it sir yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale but ant please you deliver
rebelld against the belly thus accus'd it
that only like a gulf it did remain
i' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive
still cupboarding the viand never bearing
like labour with the rest where th' other instruments
did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
and mutually participate did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body the belly answer'd
menenius sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus
for look you i may make the belly smile
as well as speak it tauntingly replied
to th' discontented members the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you
first citizen your belly's answer what
the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
with other muniments and petty helps
is this our fabric if that they
menenius what then
fore me this fellow speaks what then what then
first citizen should by the cormorant belly be restraind
who is the sink o' th' body
menenius well what then
what could the belly answer
menenius i will tell you
if you'll bestow a small of what you have little
patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer
first citizen y'are long about it
menenius note me this good friend
your most grave belly was deliberate
not rash like his accusers and thus answered
'true is it my incorporate friends' quoth he
which you do live upon and fit it is
because i am the storehouse and the shop
of the whole body but if you do remember
i send it through the rivers of your blood
even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain
and through the cranks and offices of man
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
whereby they live and though that all at once
first citizen ay sir well well
menenius 'though all at once cannot
see what i do deliver out to each
yet i can make my audit up that all
from me do back receive the flour of all
and leave me but the bran' what say you to' t
first citizen it was an answer how apply you this
menenius the senators of rome are this good belly
and you the mutinous members for examine
touching the weal o' th' common you shall find
no public benefit which you receive
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves what do you think
you the great toe of this assembly
first citizen i the great toe why the great toe
menenius for that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest
of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
rome and her rats are at the point of battle
the one side must have bale
enter caius marcius
hail noble marcius
marcius thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourselves scabs
first citizen we have ever your good word
beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
where he should find you lions finds you hares
where foxes geese you are no surer no
than is the coal of fire upon the ice
or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness
a sick mans appetite who desires most that
which would increase his evil he that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
with every minute you do change a mind
and call him noble that was now your hate
him vile that was your garland what's the matter
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate who
would feed on one another what's their seeking
menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say
the city is well stor'd
marcius hang 'em they say
they'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
what's done i' th' capitol who's like to rise
who thrives and who declines side factions and give out
conjectural marriages making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
would the nobility lay aside their ruth
and let me use my sword i'd make a quarry
with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high
as i could pick my lance
menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
for though abundantly they lack discretion
yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
what says the other troop
marcius they are dissolv'd hang 'em
that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
corn for the rich men only with these shreds
they vented their complainings which being answer'd
and a petition granted them a strange one
to break the heart of generosity
and make bold power look pale they threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon
shouting their emulation
marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
of their own choice one's junius brutus
sicinius velutus and i know not 'sdeath
the rabble should have first unroof'd the city
ere so prevaild with me it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrections arguing
menenius this is strange
marcius go get you home you fragments
messenger where's caius marcius
marcius here what's the matter
messenger the news is sir the volsces are in arms
marcius i am glad ont then we shall ha' means to vent
our musty superfluity see our best elders
enter cominius titus lartius with other senators
junius brutus and sicinius velutus
first senator marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us
the volsces are in arms

and were i anything but what i am
i would wish me only he
cominius you have fought together
marcius were half to half the world by th' ears and he
upon my party i'd revolt to make
only my wars with him he is a lion
that i am proud to hunt
attend upon cominius to these wars
cominius it is your former promise
marcius sir it is
and i am constant titus lartius thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face
what art thou stiff stand'st out
lartius no caius marcius
i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
ere stay behind this business
first senator your company to th' capitol where i know
our greatest friends attend us
lartius to cominius lead you on
to marcius follow cominius we must follow you
right worthy you priority
cominius noble marcius
first senator to the citizens hence to your homes be gone
marcius nay let them follow
the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
your valour puts well forth pray follow
ciitzens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus
sicinius was ever man so proud as is this marcius
brutus he has no equal
sicinius when we were chosen tribunes for the people
brutus mark'd you his lip and eyes
sicinius nay but his taunts
brutus being mov'd he will not spare to gird the gods
sicinius bemock the modest moon
too proud to be so valiant
sicinius such a nature
tickled with good success disdains the shadow
which he treads on at noon but i do wonder
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under cominius
brutus fame at the which he aims
in whom already he is well grac'd cannot
better be held nor more attaind than by
shall be the generals fault though he perform
to th' utmost of a man and giddy censure
will then cry out of marcius 'o if he
had borne the business'
sicinius besides if things go well
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
of his demerits rob cominius
brutus come
half all cominius' honours are to marcius
to marcius shall be honours though indeed
in aught he merit not
sicinius let's hence and hear
how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
more than his singularity he goes
upon this present action
brutus let's along exeunt
scene ii
corioli the senate house
first senator so your opinion is aufidius
that they of rome are ent'red in our counsels
and know how we proceed
aufidius is it not yours
what ever have been thought on in this state
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
had circumvention 'tis not four days gone
since i heard thence these are the words i think
i have the letter hereyes here it is
whether for east or west the dearth is great
the people mutinous and it is rumour'd
cominius marcius your old enemy
who is of rome worse hated than of you
and titus lartius a most valiant roman
these three lead on this preparation
whither 'tis bent most likely 'tis for you
consider of it'
first senator our army's in the field
to answer us
aufidius nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veild till when
they needs must show themselves which in the hatching
it seem'd appear'd to rome by the discovery
we shall be short'ned in our aim which was
to take in many towns ere almost rome
should know we were afoot
second senator noble aufidius
let us alone to guard corioli
if they set down before's for the remove
bring up your army but i think you'll find
th' have not prepar'd for us
aufidius o doubt not that
i speak from certainties nay more
some parcels of their power are forth already
and only hitherward i leave your honours
if we and caius marcius chance to meet
till one can do no more
all the gods assist you
aufidius and keep your honours safe
first senator farewell
second senator farewell
all farewell exeunt
scene iii
rome marcius' house
enter volumnia and virgilia mother and wife to marcius
volumnia i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more
comfortable sort if my son were my husband i should freelier
rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet
he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb when youth
with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way when for a day of
kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her
beholding i considering how honour would become such a person
that it was no better than picture like to hang by th' wall if
he was to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he
returnd his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i
sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than
now in first seeing he had proved himself a man
virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then
volumnia then his good report should have been my son i therein
would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen
sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my
good marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
enter a gentlewoman
gentlewoman madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
virgilia beseech you give me leave to retire myself
volumnia indeed you shall not
methinks i hear hither your husband's drum
see him pluck aufidius down by th' hair
as children from a bear the volsces shunning him
methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus
'come on you cowards you were got in fear
with his maild hand then wiping forth he goes
like to a harvest man that's task'd to mow
or all or lose his hire
virgilia his bloody brow o jupiter no blood
volumnia away you fool it more becomes a man
than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba
when she did suckle hector look'd not lovelier
than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
at grecian sword contemning tell valeria
virgilia heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
volumnia he'll beat aufidius' head below his knee
and tread upon his neck
re enter gentlewoman with valeria and an usher
valeria my ladies both good day to you
volumnia sweet madam
virgilia i am glad to see your ladyship
valeria how do you both you are manifest housekeepers what are
you sewing here a fine spot in good faith how does your little
virgilia i thank your ladyship well good madam
volumnia he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
upon his schoolmaster
valeria o' my word the father's son i'll swear 'tis a very
pretty boy o' my troth i look'd upon him a wednesday half an
hour together has such a confirm'd countenance i saw him run
after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
again and after it again and over and over he comes and up
again catch'd it again or whether his fall enrag'd him or how
mammock'd it
volumnia one ons father's moods
valeria indeed la 'tis a noble child
virgilia a crack madam
valeria come lay aside your stitchery i must have you play the
idle huswife with me this afternoon
virgilia no good madam i will not out of doors
valeria not out of doors
volumnia she shall she shall
till my lord return from the wars
valeria fie you confine yourself most unreasonably come you
must go visit the good lady that lies in
virgilia i will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my
prayers but i cannot go thither
volumnia why i pray you
virgilia 'tis not to save labour nor that i want love
valeria you would be another penelope yet they say all the yarn
she spun in ulysses' absence did but fill ithaca full of moths
might leave pricking it for pity come you shall go with us
virgilia no good madam pardon me indeed i will not forth
valeria in truth la go with me and i'll tell you excellent news
of your husband
virgilia o good madam there can be none yet
valeria verily i do not jest with you there came news from him
last night

general is gone with one part of our roman power your lord and
titus lartius are set down before their city corioli they

on mine honour and so i pray go with us

scene iv
before corioli
enter marcius titus lartius with drum and colours
with captains and soldiers to them a messenger
marcius yonder comes news a wager they have met
marcius 'tis done
lartius agreed
marcius say has our general met the enemy
messenger they lie in view but have not spoke as yet
lartius so the good horse is mine
marcius i'll buy him of you
lartius no i'll nor sell nor give him lend you him i will
for half a hundred years summon the town
marcius how far off lie these armies
marcius then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours
now mars i prithee make us quick in work
that we with smoking swords may march from hence
to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast
they sound a parley enter two senators with others
on the walls of corioli
tullus aufidius is he within your walls
first senator no nor a man that fears you less than he
that's lesser than a little drum afar off hark our drums
rather than they shall pound us up our gates
which yet seem shut we have but pinnd with rushes
they'll open of themselves alarum far off hark you far off
there is aufidius list what work he makes
amongst your cloven army
marcius o they are at it
lartius their noise be our instruction ladders ho
enter the army of the volsces
marcius they fear us not but issue forth their city
with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows
he that retires i'll take him for a volsce
and he shall feel mine edge
alarum the romans are beat back to their trenches
re enter marcius cursing
marcius all the contagion of the south light on you
you shames of rome you herd of boils and plagues
farther than seen and one infect another
against the wind a mile you souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell
all hurt behind backs red and faces pale
with flight and agued fear mend and charge home
or by the fires of heaven i'll leave the foe
and make my wars on you look to't come on
if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives
another alarum the volsces fly and marcius follows
them to the gates
so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds
'tis for the followers fortune widens them
not for the fliers mark me and do the like
marcius enters the gates
first soldier fool hardiness not i
second soldier not i marcius is shut in
first soldier see they have shut him in
re enter titus lartius
lartius what is become of marcius
all slain sir doubtless
first soldier following the fliers at the very heels
with them he enters who upon the sudden
clapp'd to their gates he is himself alone
to answer all the city
lartius o noble fellow
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
even to cato's wish not fierce and terrible
only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
the thunder like percussion of thy sounds
thou mad'st thine enemies shake as if the world
were feverous and did tremble
re enter marcius bleeding assaulted by the enemy
first soldier look sir
let's fetch him off or make remain alike
they fight and all enter the city
scene v
within corioli a street
enter certain romans with spoils
first roman this will i carry to rome
second roman and i this
third roman a murrain on 't i took this for silver
alarum continues still afar off
marcius see here these movers that do prize their hours
at a crack'd drachma cushions leaden spoons
irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them these base slaves
ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them
exeunt pillagers
and hark what noise the general makes to him
there is the man of my souls hate aufidius
piercing our romans then valiant titus take
whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
to help cominius
lartius worthy sir thou bleed'st
thy exercise hath been too violent
for a second course of fight
marcius sir praise me not
my work hath yet not warm'd me fare you well
the blood i drop is rather physical
than dangerous to me to aufidius thus
lartius now the fair goddess fortune
fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
misguide thy opposers' swords bold gentleman
prosperity be thy page
marcius thy friend no less
than those she placeth highest so farewell
lartius thou worthiest marcius exit marcius
go sound thy trumpet in the market place
call thither all the officers o' th' town
scene vi
near the camp of cominius
enter cominius as it were in retire with soldiers
cominius breathe you my friends well fought we are come off
like romans neither foolish in our stands
nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs
we shall be charg'd again whiles we have struck
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends the roman gods
that both our powers with smiling fronts encount'ring
may give you thankful sacrifice
enter a messenger
thy news
messenger the citizens of corioli have issued
and given to lartius and to marcius battle
i saw our party to their trenches driven
and then i came away
cominius though thou speak'st truth
messenger above an hour my lord
cominius 'tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
and bring thy news so late
messenger spies of the volsces
held me in chase that i was forc'd to wheel
three or four miles about else had i sir
half an hour since brought my report
enter marcius
that does appear as he were flay'd o gods
he has the stamp of marcius and i have
before time seen him thus
marcius come i too late
cominius the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
more than i know the sound of marcius' tongue
from every meaner man
marcius come i too late
cominius ay if you come not in the blood of others
marcius o let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when i woo'd in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done
and tapers burnd to bedward
cominius flower of warriors
how is't with titus lartius
marcius as with a man busied about decrees
condemning some to death and some to exile
ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
to let him slip at will
cominius where is that slave
which told me they had beat you to your trenches
where is he call him hither
marcius let him alone
he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
the common file a plague tribunes for them
the mouse ne'er shunnd the cat as they did budge
cominius but how prevaild you
marcius will the time serve to tell i do not think
where is the enemy are you lords o' th' field
if not why cease you till you are so
cominius marcius
we have at disadvantage fought and did
retire to win our purpose
marcius how lies their battle know you on which side
they have plac'd their men of trust
their bands i' th' vaward are the antiates
of their best trust o'er them aufidius
their very heart of hope
marcius i do beseech you
by all the battles wherein we have fought
by th' blood we have shed together by th' vows
we have made to endure friends that you directly
set me against aufidius and his antiates
and that you not delay the present but
we prove this very hour
cominius though i could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to you yet dare i never
deny your asking take your choice of those
that best can aid your action
marcius those are they
that most are willing if any such be here
as it were sin to doubt that love this painting
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his country's dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus to express his disposition
and follow marcius they all shout and wave their
swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps
o me alone make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you
able to bear against the great aufidius
a shield as hard as his a certain number
though thanks to all must i select from all the rest
shall bear the business in some other fight
as cause will be obey'd please you to march
and four shall quickly draw out my command
which men are best inclind
cominius march on my fellows
make good this ostentation and you shall
scene vii
the gates of corioli
titus lartius having set a guard upon corioli going with drum and trumpet
toward cominius and caius marcius enters with a lieutenant other soldiers
and a scout
lartius so let the ports be guarded keep your duties
as i have set them down if i do send dispatch
those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
for a short holding if we lose the field
lieutenant fear not our care sir
lartius hence and shut your gates upons
our guider come to th' roman camp conduct us exeunt
scene viii
a field of battle between the roman and the volscian camps
alarum as in battle enter marcius and aufidius at several doors
marcius i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
worse than a promise breaker
aufidius we hate alike
more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot
marcius let the first budger die the other's slave
and the gods doom him after
aufidius if i fly marcius
halloa me like a hare
marcius within these three hours tullus
alone i fought in your corioli walls
and made what work i pleas'd 'tis not my blood
wherein thou seest me mask'd for thy revenge
aufidius wert thou the hector
that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny
thou shouldst not scape me here
here they fight and certain volsces come in the aid
of aufidius marcius fights till they be driven in
empty
officious and not valiant you have sham'd me
in your condemned seconds exeunt
scene ix
flourish alarum a retreat is sounded enter at one door
cominius with the romans at another door marcius with his arm in a scarf
cominius if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work
thou't not believe thy deeds but i'll report it
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
where great patricians shall attend and shrug
i' th' end admire where ladies shall be frighted
and gladly quak'd hear more where the dull tribunes
that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
our rome hath such a soldier'
yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast
having fully dind before
enter titus lartius with his power from the pursuit
lartius o general
here is the steed we the caparison
hadst thou beheld
marcius pray now no more my mother
who has a charter to extol her blood
as you have done that's what i can induc'd
as you have been that's for my country
he that has but effected his good will
hath overta'en mine act
cominius you shall not be
the grave of your deserving rome must know
the value of her own 'twere a concealment
worse than a theft no less than a traducement
to hide your doings and to silence that
would seem but modest therefore i beseech you
in sign of what you are not to reward
what you have done before our army hear me
marcius i have some wounds upon me and they smart
to hear themselves rememb'red
cominius should they not
well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
and tent themselves with death of all the horses
whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all
we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth
before the common distribution at
your only choice
marcius i thank you general
but cannot make my heart consent to take
a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing
a long flourish they all cry 'marcius marcius'
may these same instruments which you profane
never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
i' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
made all of false fac'd soothing when steel grows
soft as the parasite's silk let him be made
an overture for th' wars no more i say
for that i have not wash'd my nose that bled
or foild some debile wretch which without note
here's many else have done you shout me forth
as if i lov'd my little should be dieted
in praises sauc'd with lies
cominius too modest are you
more cruel to your good report than grateful
to us that give you truly by your patience
if 'gainst yourself you be incens'd we'll put you
like one that means his proper harm in manacles
then reason safely with you therefore be it known
as to us to all the world that caius marcius
my noble steed known to the camp i give him
with all his trim belonging and from this time
for what he did before corioli can him
with all th' applause and clamour of the host
caius marcius coriolanus
bear th' addition nobly ever
flourish trumpets sound and drums
all caius marcius coriolanus
coriolanus i will go wash
whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you
i mean to stride your steed and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to th' fairness of my power
cominius so to our tent
where ere we do repose us we will write
to rome of our success you titus lartius
must to corioli back send us to rome
the best with whom we may articulate
lartius i shall my lord
coriolanus the gods begin to mock me i that now
refus'd most princely gifts am bound to beg
of my lord general
cominius take't 'tis yours what is't
coriolanus i sometime lay here in corioli
at a poor mans house he us'd me kindly
he cried to me i saw him prisoner
but then aufidius was within my view
to give my poor host freedom
cominius o well begg'd
were he the butcher of my son he should
be free as is the wind deliver him titus
lartius marcius his name
coriolanus by jupiter forgot
i am weary yea my memory is tir'd
have we no wine here
cominius go we to our tent
it should be look'd to come exeunt
scene x
the camp of the volsces
a flourish cornets enter tullus aufidius bloody with two or three soldiers
aufidius the town is ta'en
first soldier 'twill be deliver'd back on good condition
aufidius condition
i would i were a roman for i cannot
being a volsce be that i am condition
i' th' part that is at mercy five times marcius
i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
as often as we eat by th' elements
if e'er again i meet him beard to beard
he's mine or i am his mine emulation
hath not that honour int it had for where
i thought to crush him in an equal force
true sword to sword i'll potch at him some way
first soldier he's the devil
aufidius bolder though not so subtle my valour's poisond
with only suff'ring stain by him for him
shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary
being naked sick nor fane nor capitol
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
embarquements all of fury shall lift up
their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
my hate to marcius where i find him were it
against the hospitable canon would i
wash my fierce hand ins heart go you to th' city
learn how 'tis held and what they are that must
be hostages for rome
first soldier will not you go
aufidius i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you
'tis south the city mills bring me word thither
how the world goes that to the pace of it
i may spur on my journey
act ii scene i
rome a public place
enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people sicinius and brutus
menenius the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
brutus good or bad
menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they love
not marcius
sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends
menenius pray you who does the wolf love
menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble marcius
brutus he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
menenius he's a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb you two are
old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you
both tribunes well sir
menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not
in abundance
brutus he's poor in no one fault but stor'd with all
brutus and topping all others in boasting
menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are censured
here in the city i mean of us o' th' right hand file do you
both tribunes why how are we censur'd
menenius because you talk of pride now will you not be angry
both tribunes well well sir well
menenius why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your
dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the
marcius for being proud
brutus we do it not alone sir
menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps are
many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your
abilities are too infant like for doing much alone you talk of
pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o
that you could
both tribunes what then sir
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome
sicinius menenius you are known well enough too
menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves
a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to
be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty
and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath
meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you
make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have
deliver'd the matter well when i find the ass in compound with
the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to
bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie
deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the
map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too
what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
character if i be known well enough too
brutus come sir come we know you well enough
ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good
wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and
a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter
between party and party if you chance to be pinch'd with the
colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag
against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss
the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all
the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
brutus come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol
menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak
best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your
beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a
cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion
hangmen god den to your worships more of your conversation
would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you
brutus and sicinius go aside
enter volumnia virgilia and valeria
how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she
earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast

menenius i will make my very house reel to night a letter for me
virgilia yes certain there's a letter for you i saw't

most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to
this preservative of no better report than a horse drench is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
virgilia o no no no
volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods for't
menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in
his pocket the wounds become him
volumnia ons brows menenius he comes the third time home with
menenius has he disciplind aufidius soundly
volumnia titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius
got off
menenius and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that an he
had stay'd by him i would not have been so fidius'd for all the
chests in corioli and the gold that's in them is the senate
possess'd of this
volumnia good ladies let's go yes yes yes the senate has
letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name
empty
valeria in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him
menenius wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true
empty
virgilia the gods grant them true
volumnia true pow waw
menenius true i'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded
to the tribunes god save your good worships marcius is coming
home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded
cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place
he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i' th' body
menenius one i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh there's nine that i
empty
volumnia he had before this last expedition twenty five wounds
upon him
menenius now it's twenty seven every gash was an enemy's grave
a shout and flourish hark the trumpets
volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries
death that dark spirit ins nervy arm doth lie
which being advanc'd declines and then men die
a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius the
general and titus lartius between them

captains and soldiers and a herald

menenius a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep
and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome
a curse begin at very root ons heart
that is not glad to see thee you are three
that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly
cominius ever right
coriolanus menenius ever ever
herald give way there and go on
coriolanus to his wife and mother your hand and yours
ere in our own house i do shade my head
the good patricians must be visited
but with them change of honours
volumnia i have lived
to see inherited my very wishes
and the buildings of my fancy only
there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but
our rome will cast upon thee
coriolanus know good mother
i had rather be their servant in my way
than sway with them in theirs
flourish cornets exeunt in state as before
brutus and sicinius come forward
brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
into a rapture lets her baby cry
while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck
clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
are smother'd up leads filld and ridges hors'd
in earnestness to see him seld shown flamens
do press among the popular throngs and puff
to win a vulgar station our veild dames
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
of phoebus' burning kisses such a pother
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture
i warrant him consul
brutus then our office may
during his power go sleep
sicinius he cannot temp'rately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end but will
lose those he hath won
brutus in that there's comfort
sicinius doubt not
the commoners for whom we stand but they
with the least cause these his new honours which
that he will give them make i as little question
as he is proud to do't
brutus i heard him swear
were he to stand for consul never would he
appear i' th' market place nor on him put
the napless vesture of humility
nor showing as the manner is his wounds
to th' people beg their stinking breaths
brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
and the desire of the nobles
sicinius i wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution
brutus 'tis most like he will
sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills
a sure destruction
to him or our authorities for an end
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them that to's power he would
have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms holding them
in human action and capacity
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in their war who have their provand
only for bearing burdens and sore blows
sicinius this as you say suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall touch the people which time shall not want
if he be put upont and that's as easy
as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
shall darken him for ever
enter a messenger
brutus what's the matter
that marcius shall be consul
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended
as to jove's statue and the commons made
a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
i never saw the like
brutus let's to the capitol
but hearts for the event
sicinius have with you exeunt
scene ii
rome the capitol
enter two officers to lay cushions as it were in the capitol
first officer come come they are almost here how many stand for
empty
second officer three they say but 'tis thought of every one
coriolanus will carry it
loves not the common people
second officer faith there have been many great men that have
flatter'd the people who ne'er loved them and there be many
that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they
love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground
therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
empty
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to
flatter them for their love
second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been
supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further
he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise
were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof
and rebuke from every car that heard it
first officer no more of him he's a worthy man make way they
are coming
a sennet enter the patricians and the tribunes
of the people lictors before them coriolanus
brutus take their places by themselves
coriolanus stands
menenius having determind of the volsces and
to send for titus lartius it remains
as the main point of this our after meeting
to gratify his noble service that
hath thus stood for his country therefore please you
most reverend and grave elders to desire
the present consul and last general
a little of that worthy work perform'd
by caius marcius coriolanus whom
we met here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself coriolanus sits
first senator speak good cominius
leave nothing out for length and make us think
rather our state's defective for requital
than we to stretch it out masters o' th' people
we do request your kindest ears and after
to yield what passes here
sicinius we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance
the theme of our assembly
brutus which the rather
we shall be bless'd to do if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto priz'd them at
i would you rather had been silent please you
to hear cominius speak
brutus most willingly
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it
menenius he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
coriolanus rises and offers to go away
first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear
what you have nobly done
coriolanus your honours' pardon
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them
brutus sir i hope
my words disbench'd you not
coriolanus no sir yet oft
when blows have made me stay i fled from words
i love them as they weigh
menenius pray now sit down
coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit
to hear my nothings monster'd exit
menenius masters of the people
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
that's thousand to one good one when you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus
should not be utter'd feebly it is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue and
most dignifies the haver if it be
the man i speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpois'd at sixteen years
when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
beyond the mark of others our then dictator
whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
the bristled lips before him he bestrid
an o'erpress'd roman and i' th' consuls view
slew three opposers tarquins self he met
and struck him on his knee in that day's feats
when he might act the woman in the scene
he prov'd best man i' th' field and for his meed
was brow bound with the oak his pupil age
man ent'red thus he waxed like a sea
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
before and in corioli let me say
i cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers
and by his rare example made the coward
turn terror into sport as weeds before
a vessel under sail so men obey'd
and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp
where it did mark it took from face to foot
he was a thing of blood whose every motion
was tim'd with dying cries alone he ent'red
with shunless destiny aidless came off
and with a sudden re enforcement struck
corioli like a planet now alls his
when by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
re quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate
and to the battle came he where he did
run reeking o'er the lives of men as if
'twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld
to ease his breast with panting
menenius worthy man
first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him
cominius our spoils he kick'd at
and look'd upon things precious as they were
the common muck of the world he covets less
than misery itself would give rewards
his deeds with doing them and is content
menenius he's right noble
let him be calld for
first senator call coriolanus
officer he doth appear
re enter coriolanus
menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleas'd
to make thee consul
coriolanus i do owe them still
my life and services
that you do speak to the people
coriolanus i do beseech you
let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot
put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you
that i may pass this doing
sicinius sir the people
must have their voices neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony
pray you go fit you to the custom and
take to you as your predecessors have
your honour with your form
coriolanus it is a part
that i shall blush in acting and might well
be taken from the people
brutus mark you that
coriolanus to brag unto them 'thus i did and thus'
show them th' unaching scars which i should hide
of their breath only
menenius do not stand upont
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
our purpose to them and to our noble consul
wish we all joy and honour
senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour
flourish cornets then exeunt all
but sicinius and brutus
brutus you see how he intends to use the people
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give
brutus come we'll inform them
of our proceedings here on th' market place
i know they do attend us exeunt
scene iii
rome the forum
enter seven or eight citizens
first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to
second citizen we may sir if we will
third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds
and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those
wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we
must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
monster of the multitude of the which we being members should
bring ourselves to be monstrous members
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck
not to call us the many headed multitude
third citizen we have been calld so of many not that our heads
are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our
wits are so diversely colour'd and truly i think if all our wits
were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north
south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
all the points o' th' compass
second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would
third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans
will 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block head but if it were at
liberty 'twould sure southward
second citizen why that way
third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for
conscience' sake to help to get thee a wife
second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you
empty
no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would
incline to the people there was never a worthier man
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility
with menenius
here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behaviour
we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he
stands by ones by twos and by threes he's to make his
requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues
all content content exeunt citizens
menenius o sir you are not right have you not known
the worthiest men have done't
coriolanus what must i say
'i pray sir' plague upont i cannot bring
my tongue to such a pace 'look sir my wounds
i got them in my country's service when
some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
from th' noise of our own drums'
you must not speak of that you must desire them
to think upon you
coriolanus think upon me hang 'em
i would they would forget me like the virtues
which our divines lose by 'em
menenius you'll mar all
i'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you
in wholesome manner exit
re enter three of the citizens
and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace
you know the cause sir of my standing here
third citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't
coriolanus mine own desert
second citizen your own desert
coriolanus ay not mine own desire
third citizen how not your own desire
coriolanus no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
with begging
gain by you
coriolanus well then i pray your price o' th' consulship
first citizen the price is to ask it kindly
coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me ha't i have wounds to show
you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what
say you
second citizen you shall ha' it worthy sir
coriolanus a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begg'd
i have your alms adieu
second citizen an 'twere to give again but 'tis no matter
exeunt the three citizens
re enter two other citizens
coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown
fourth citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly
coriolanus your enigma
fourth citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
empty
coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have
not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn
brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a
condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their
choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that
is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i
fifth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily
fourth citizen you have received many wounds for your country
coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther
both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily
exeunt citizens
coriolanus most sweet voices
better it is to die better to starve
why in this wolvish toge should i stand here
to beg of hob and dick that do appear
their needless vouches custom calls me to't
what custom wills in all things should we do't
the dust on antique time would lie unswept
and mountainous error be too highly heap'd
for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus i am half through
re enter three citizens more
here come moe voices
your voices for your voices i have fought
watch'd for your voices for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
i have seen and heard of for your voices have
done many things some less some more your voices
indeed i would be consul
sixth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
seventh citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him
joy and make him good friend to the people
all amen amen god save thee noble consul
exeunt citizens
coriolanus worthy voices
re enter menenius with brutus and sicinius
menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
endue you with the people's voice remains
that in th' official marks invested you
coriolanus is this done
sicinius the custom of request you have discharg'd
the people do admit you and are summond
to meet anon upon your approbation
coriolanus where at the senate house
sicinius there coriolanus
coriolanus may i change these garments
sicinius you may sir
coriolanus that i'll straight do and knowing myself again
menenius i'll keep you company will you along
brutus we stay here for the people
sicinius fare you well
exeunt coriolanus and menenius
he has it now and by his looks methinks
'tis warm at's heart
brutus with a proud heart he wore
his humble weeds will you dismiss the people
re enter citizens
first citizen he has our voices sir
brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice
he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices
third citizen certainly
he flouted us downright
first citizen no 'tis his kind of speech he did not mock us
second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says
he us'd us scornfully he should have show'd us
sicinius why so he did i am sure
all no no no man saw 'em
third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show in
empty
and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
'i would be consul' says he 'aged custom
but by your voices will not so permit me
your voices therefore' when we granted that
here was 'i thank you for your voices thank you
i have no further with you' was not this mockery
sicinius why either were you ignorant to see't
or seeing it of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices
brutus could you not have told him
as you were lessond when he had no power
but was a petty servant to the state
he was your enemy ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
a place of potency and sway o' th' state
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might
be curses to yourselves you should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love
standing your friendly lord
as you were fore advis'd had touch'd his spirit
and tried his inclination from him pluck'd
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had calld you up have held him to
or else it would have galld his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught so putting him to rage
you should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
and pass'd him unelected
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment
sicinius have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
third citizen he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet
second citizens and will deny him
i'll have five hundred voices of that sound
first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece
empty
brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends
they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
sicinius let them assemble
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election enforce his pride
and his old hate unto you besides forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed
how in his suit he scornd you but your loves
thinking upon his services took from you
th' apprehension of his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
brutus lay
a fault on us your tribunes that we labour'd
no impediment between but that you must
cast your election on him
sicinius say you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections and that your minds
pre occupied with what you rather must do
than what you should made you against the grain
brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
how youngly he began to serve his country
how long continued and what stock he springs of
the noble house o' th' marcians from whence came
that ancus marcius numa's daughter's son
who after great hostilius here was king
of the same house publius and quintus were
that our best water brought by conduits hither
and censorinus nobly named so
was his great ancestor
sicinius one thus descended
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place we did commend
to your remembrances but you have found
scaling his present bearing with his past
that he's your fixed enemy and revoke
your sudden approbation
brutus say you ne'er had done't
and presently when you have drawn your number
repair to th' capitol
citizens will will so almost all
repent in their election exeunt plebeians
brutus let them go on
this mutiny were better put in hazard
than stay past doubt for greater
if as his nature is he fall in rage
with their refusal both observe and answer
sicinius to th' capitol come
we will be there before the stream o' th' people
and this shall seem as partly 'tis their own
which we have goaded onward exeunt
act iii scene i
rome a street
cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius
titus lartius and other senators
coriolanus tullus aufidius then had made new head
our swifter composition
coriolanus so then the volsces stand but as at first
ready when time shall prompt them to make road
upons again
cominius they are worn lord consul so
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners wave again
coriolanus saw you aufidius
lartius on safeguard he came to me and did curse
yielded the town he is retir'd to antium
coriolanus spoke he of me
lartius he did my lord
coriolanus how what
lartius how often he had met you sword to sword
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution so he might
be calld your vanquisher
lartius at antium
coriolanus i wish i had a cause to seek him there
to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
enter sicinius and brutus
behold these are the tribunes of the people
the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them
for they do prank them in authority
against all noble sufferance
sicinius pass no further
brutus it will be dangerous to go on no further
coriolanus what makes this change
menenius the matter
cominius hath he not pass'd the noble and the common
brutus cominius no
coriolanus have i had childrens voices
first senator tribunes give way he shall to th' market place
brutus the people are incens'd against him
sicinius stop
coriolanus are these your herd
must these have voices that can yield them now
and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on
menenius be calm be calm
coriolanus it is a purpos'd thing and grows by plot
to curb the will of the nobility
suffer't and live with such as cannot rule
brutus callt not a plot
the people cry you mock'd them and of late
when corn was given them gratis you repind
scandald the suppliants for the people calld them
time pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
coriolanus why this was known before
brutus not to them all
coriolanus have you inform'd them sithence
brutus how i inform them
brutus not unlike
each way to better yours
coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds
let me deserve so ill as you and make me
your fellow tribune
sicinius you show too much of that
for which the people stir if you will pass
to where you are bound you must enquire your way
which you are out of with a gentler spirit
nor yoke with him for tribune
menenius let's be calm
cominius the people are abus'd set on this palt'ring
becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely
i' th' plain way of his merit
coriolanus tell me of corn
this was my speech and i will speak't again
menenius not now not now
coriolanus now as i live i will
my nobler friends i crave their pardons
for the mutable rank scented meiny let them
regard me as i do not flatter and
therein behold themselves i say again
in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate
the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd
by mingling them with us the honour'd number
which they have given to beggars
menenius well no more
first senator no more words we beseech you
coriolanus how no more
as for my country i have shed my blood
not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles
which we disdain should tetter us yet sought
the very way to catch them
as if you were a god to punish not
a man of their infirmity
sicinius 'twere well
we let the people know't
menenius what what his choler
coriolanus choler
were i as patient as the midnight sleep
by jove 'twould be my mind
sicinius it is a mind
not poison any further
coriolanus shall remain
hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
his absolute 'shall
cominius 'twas from the canon
coriolanus 'shall
o good but most unwise patricians why
you grave but reckless senators have you thus
given hydra here to choose an officer
the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit
to say he'll turn your current in a ditch
and make your channel his if he have power
then vail your ignorance if none awake
your dangerous lenity if you are learnd
be not as common fools if you are not
let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
if they be senators and they are no less
when both your voices blended the great'st taste
and such a one as he who puts his 'shall'
his popular 'shall' against a graver bench
than ever frownd in greece by jove himself
it makes the consuls base and my soul aches
to know when two authorities are up
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
the one by th' other
cominius well on to th' market place
the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas us'd
sometime in greece
menenius well well no more of that
coriolanus though there the people had more absolute pow'r
i say they nourish'd disobedience fed
the ruin of the state
brutus why shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice
coriolanus i'll give my reasons
was not our recompense resting well assur'd
they ne'er did service for't being press'd to th' war
even when the navel of the state was touch'd
they would not thread the gates this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war
their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd
most valour spoke not for them th' accusation
which they have often made against the senate
all cause unborn could never be the native
how shall this bosom multiplied digest
the senate's courtesy let deeds express
what's like to be their words 'we did request it
we are the greater poll and in true fear
they gave us our demands' thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears which will in time
break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles
brutus enough with over measure
coriolanus no take more
what may be sworn by both divine and human
seal what i end withal this double worship
where one part does disdain with cause the other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignorance it must omit
real necessities and give way the while
nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you
you that will be less fearful than discreet
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change ont that prefer
a noble life before a long and wish
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
that's sure of death without it at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
the sweet which is their poison your dishonour
of that integrity which should become't
not having the power to do the good it would
for th' ill which doth controlt
brutus has said enough
sicinius has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
as traitors do
coriolanus thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes
on whom depending their obedience fails
when what's not meet but what must be was law
then were they chosen in a better hour
let what is meet be said it must be meet
and throw their power i' th' dust
brutus manifest treason
sicinius this a consul no
brutus the aediles ho
enter an aedile
let him be apprehended
attach thee as a traitorous innovator
a foe to th' public weal obey i charge thee
and follow to thine answer
coriolanus hence old goat
patricians we'll surety him
cominius ag'd sir hands off
coriolanus hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments
sicinius help ye citizens
menenius on both sides more respect
sicinius here's he that would take from you all your power
brutus seize him aediles
plebeians down with him down with him
second senator weapons weapons weapons
they all bustle about coriolanus
all tribunes patricians citizens what ho sicinius
brutus coriolanus citizens
patricians peace peace peace stay hold peace
confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes
to th' people coriolanus patience
speak good sicinius
sicinius hear me people peace
plebeians let's hear our tribune peace speak speak speak
sicinius you are at point to lose your liberties
marcius would have all from you marcius
whom late you have nam'd for consul
menenius fie fie fie
first senator to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
sicinius what is the city but the people
plebeians true
the people are the city
brutus by the consent of all we were establish'd
the people's magistrates
plebeians you so remain
menenius and so are like to do
cominius that is the way to lay the city flat
and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
in heaps and piles of ruin
sicinius this deserves death
brutus or let us stand to our authority
or let us lose it we do here pronounce
upon the part o' th' people in whose power
we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
of present death
sicinius therefore lay hold of him
into destruction cast him
brutus aediles seize him
plebeians yield marcius yield
menenius hear me one word beseech you tribunes
hear me but a word
aediles peace peace
menenius be that you seem truly your country's friend
and temp'rately proceed to what you would
thus violently redress
that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
and bear him to the rock
coriolanus draws his sword
coriolanus no i'll die here
there's some among you have beheld me fighting
come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
menenius down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile
brutus lay hands upon him
you that be noble help him young and old
plebeians down with him down with him
in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles
and the people are beat in
menenius go get you to your house be gone away
all will be nought else
second senator get you gone
coriolanus stand fast
we have as many friends as enemies
first senator the gods forbid
i prithee noble friend home to thy house
leave us to cure this cause
menenius for 'tis a sore upon us
you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
cominius come sir along with us
coriolanus i would they were barbarians as they are
though in rome litter'd not romans as they are not
though calved i' th' porch o' th' capitol
put not your worthy rage into your tongue
one time will owe another
coriolanus on fair ground
i could beat forty of them
menenius i could myself
take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes
cominius but now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic
and manhood is calld foolery when it stands
against a falling fabric will you hence
like interrupted waters and o'erbear
what they are us'd to bear
menenius pray you be gone
i'll try whether my old wit be in request
with those that have but little this must be patch'd
with cloth of any colour
cominius nay come away
exeunt coriolanus and cominius with others
patricians this man has marr'd his fortune
he would not flatter neptune for his trident
or jove for's power to thunder his heart's his mouth
what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
and being angry does forget that ever
he heard the name of death a noise within
here's goodly work
patricians i would they were a bed
menenius i would they were in tiber
what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair
sicinius where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself
menenius you worthy tribunes
sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
with rigorous hands he hath resisted law
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought
the noble tribunes are the people's mouths
and we their hands
plebeians he shall sure ont
menenius sir sir
sicinius peace
menenius do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
with modest warrant
sicinius sir how comes't that you
have holp to make this rescue
as i do know the consuls worthiness
so can i name his faults
sicinius consul what consul
menenius the consul coriolanus
brutus he consul
plebeians no no no no no
menenius if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people
i may be heard i would crave a word or two
the which shall turn you to no further harm
sicinius speak briefly then
for we are peremptory to dispatch
this viperous traitor to eject him hence
were but one danger and to keep him here
our certain death therefore it is decreed
he dies to night
menenius now the good gods forbid
that our renowned rome whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enrolld
should now eat up her own
sicinius he's a disease that must be cut away
menenius o he's a limb that has but a disease
mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome that's worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
by many an ounce he dropt it for his country
and what is left to lose it by his country
a brand to th' end o' th' world
sicinius this is clean kam
brutus merely awry when he did love his country
it honour'd him
sicinius the service of the foot
being once gangrend is not then respected
for what before it was
brutus we'll hear no more
pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
spread further
menenius one word more one word
this tiger footed rage when it shall find
the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late
tie leaden pounds to's heels proceed by process
lest parties as he is belov'd break out
and sack great rome with romans
brutus if it were so
sicinius what do ye talk
our aediles smote ourselves resisted come
menenius consider this he has been bred i' th' wars
since 'a could draw a sword and is ill schoold
in bolted language meal and bran together
he throws without distinction give me leave
i'll go to him and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer by a lawful form
in peace to his utmost peril
first senator noble tribunes
will prove too bloody and the end of it
unknown to the beginning
sicinius noble menenius
be you then as the people's officer
masters lay down your weapons
brutus go not home
sicinius meet on the market place we'll attend you there
where if you bring not marcius we'll proceed
in our first way
to the senators let me desire your company he must come
or what is worst will follow
first senator pray you let's to him exeunt
scene ii
rome the house of coriolanus
enter coriolanus with nobles
coriolanus let them pull all about mine ears present me
death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels
or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
below the beam of sight yet will i still
be thus to them
first patrician you do the nobler
coriolanus i muse my mother
does not approve me further who was wont
to call them woollen vassals things created
to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
when one but of my ordinance stood up
enter volumnia
i talk of you
why did you wish me milder would you have me
false to my nature rather say i play
the man i am
volumnia o sir sir sir
i would have had you put your power well on
before you had worn it out
coriolanus let go
with striving less to be so lesser had been
the thwartings of your dispositions if
you had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd
ere they lack'd power to cross you
coriolanus let them hang
volumnia ay and burn too
enter menenius with the senators
menenius come come you have been too rough something too rough
you must return and mend it
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave in the midst and perish
volumnia pray be counselld
i have a heart as little apt as yours
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
to better vantage
menenius well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that
the violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic
which i can scarcely bear
coriolanus what must i do
menenius return to th' tribunes
coriolanus well what then what then
menenius repent what you have spoke
coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods
must i then do't to them
volumnia you are too absolute
though therein you can never be too noble
honour and policy like unsever'd friends
i' th' war do grow together grant that and tell me
in peace what each of them by th' other lose
that they combine not there
coriolanus tush tush
menenius a good demand
volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem
the same you are not which for your best ends
you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
with honour as in war since that to both
it stands in like request
coriolanus why force you this
volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak
to th' people not by your own instruction
nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you
but with such words that are but roted in
your tongue though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom's truth
than to take in a town with gentle words
which else would put you to your fortune and
the hazard of much blood
i would dissemble with my nature where
my fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
i should do so in honour i am in this
your wife your son these senators the nobles
and you will rather show our general louts
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em
of what that want might ruin
menenius noble lady
come go with us speak fair you may salve so
not what is dangerous present but the los
of what is past
volumnia i prithee now my son
go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
and thus far having stretch'd it here be with them
thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines
more learned than the ears waving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as the ripest mulberry
that will not hold the handling or say to them
thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
were fit for thee to use as they to claim
in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
menenius this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
for they have pardons being ask'd as free
as words to little purpose
volumnia prithee now
go and be ruld although i know thou hadst rather
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
than flatter him in a bower
enter cominius
cominius i have been i' th' market place and sir 'tis fit
you make strong party or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence alls in anger
menenius only fair speech
cominius i think 'twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit
volumnia he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it
coriolanus must i go show them my unbarb'd sconce must i
a lie that it must bear well i will do't
yet were there but this single plot to lose
this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
and throw't against the wind to th' market place
you have put me now to such a part which never
i shall discharge to th' life
cominius come come we'll prompt you
volumnia i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
my praises made thee first a soldier so
thou hast not done before
coriolanus well i must do't
away my disposition and possess me
some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turnd
which quier'd with my drum into a pipe
small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up
the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue
who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his
that hath receiv'd an alms i will not do't
lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
and by my body's action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness
volumnia at thy choice then
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
than thou of them come all to ruin let
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
with as big heart as thou do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me
but owe thy pride thyself
coriolanus pray be content
mother i am going to the market place
chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home belov'd
of all the trades in rome look i am going
commend me to my wife i'll return consul
i' th' way of flattery further
volumnia do your will exit
cominius away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
to answer mildly for they are prepar'd
with accusations as i hear more strong
than are upon you yet
coriolanus the word is 'mildly' pray you let us go
let them accuse me by invention i
will answer in mine honour
coriolanus well mildly be it then mildly exeunt
scene iii
rome the forum
enter sicinius and brutus
brutus in this point charge him home that he affects
tyrannical power if he evade us there
enforce him with his envy to the people
and that the spoil got on the antiates
was ne'er distributed
what will he come
aedile he's coming
brutus how accompanied
aedile with old menenius and those senators
that always favour'd him
sicinius have you a catalogue
of all the voices that we have procur'd
set down by th' poll
aedile i have 'tis ready
aedile i have
sicinius assemble presently the people hither
and when they hear me say 'it shall be so
i' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either
for death for fine or banishment then let them
if i say fine cry 'fine' if death cry 'death'
insisting on the old prerogative
and power i' th' truth o' th' cause
aedile i shall inform them
let them not cease but with a din confus'd
enforce the present execution
of what we chance to sentence
aedile very well
sicinius make them be strong and ready for this hint
when we shall hap to give't them
brutus go about it exit aedile
put him to choler straight he hath been us'd
ever to conquer and to have his worth
be reind again to temperance then he speaks
what's in his heart and that is there which looks
with us to break his neck
enter coriolanus menenius and cominius with others
sicinius well here he comes
menenius calmly i do beseech you
coriolanus ay as an ostler that for th' poorest piece
will bear the knave by th' volume th' honour'd gods
keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
throng our large temples with the shows of peace
and not our streets with war
first senator amen amen
menenius a noble wish
re enter theaedilewith the plebeians
sicinius draw near ye people
aedile list to your tribunes audience peace i say
coriolanus first hear me speak
both tribunes well say peace ho
must all determine here
sicinius i do demand
if you submit you to the people's voices
allow their officers and are content
to suffer lawful censure for such faults
as shall be prov'd upon you
coriolanus i am content
menenius lo citizens he says he is content
the warlike service he has done consider think
like graves i' th' holy churchyard
coriolanus scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only
menenius consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
you find him like a soldier do not take
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as i say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you
coriolanus what is the matter
that being pass'd for consul with full voice
i am so dishonour'd that the very hour
you take it off again
sicinius answer to us
coriolanus say then 'tis true i ought so
sicinius we charge you that you have contriv'd to take
from rome all seasond office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical
coriolanus how traitor
menenius nay temperately your promise
coriolanus the fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hands clutch'd as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
'thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
as i do pray the gods
plebeians to th' rock to th' rock with him
sicinius peace
we need not put new matter to his charge
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves th' extremest death
serv'd well for rome
coriolanus what do you prate of service
brutus i talk of that that know it
coriolanus you
menenius is this the promise that you made your mother
cominius know i pray you
coriolanus i'll know no further
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
vagabond exile flaying pent to linger
their mercy at the price of one fair word
nor check my courage for what they can give
to have't with saying 'good morrow'
sicinius for that he has
as much as in him lies from time to time
envied against the people seeking means
to pluck away their power as now at last
given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
of dreaded justice but on the ministers
and in the power of us the tribunes we
ev'n from this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock tarpeian never more
to enter our rome gates i' th' people's name
i say it shall be so
plebeians it shall be so it shall be so let him away
he's banish'd and it shall be so
cominius hear me my masters and my common friends
cominius let me speak
i have been consul and can show for rome
her enemies' marks upon me i do love
my country's good with a respect more tender
more holy and profound than mine own life
my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase
and treasure of my loins then if i would
speak that
sicinius we know your drift speak what
as enemy to the people and his country
it shall be so
plebeians it shall be so it shall be so
coriolanus you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize
as the dead carcasses of unburied men
that do corrupt my air i banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
fan you into despair have the power still
to banish your defenders till at length
your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making but reservation of yourselves
still your own foes deliver you
as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows despising
for you the city thus i turn my back
there is a world elsewhere
cominius menenius with the other patricians
aedile the people's enemy is gone is gone
they all shout and throw up their caps
plebeians our enemy is banish'd he is gone hoo oo
sicinius go see him out at gates and follow him
as he hath follow'd you with all despite
give him deserv'd vexation let a guard
attend us through the city
plebeians come come let's see him out at gates come

coriolanus come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast
with many heads butts me away nay mother
where is your ancient courage you were us'd
to say extremities was the trier of spirits
that common chances common men could bear
show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows
when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
a noble cunning you were us'd to load me
with precepts that would make invincible
the heart that connd them
virgilia o heavens o heavens

if you had been the wife of hercules
six of his labours you'd have done and sav'd
your husband so much sweat cominius
droop not adieu farewell my wife my mother
i'll do well yet thou old and true menenius
thy tears are salter than a younger mans
and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general
heart hard'ning spectacles tell these sad women
'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
as 'tis to laugh at 'em my mother you wot well
my hazards still have been your solace and
believe't not lightly though i go alone
like to a lonely dragon that his fen
makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen your son
will or exceed the common or be caught
with cautelous baits and practice
whither wilt thou go take good cominius
with thee awhile determine on some course
more than a wild exposture to each chance
that starts i' th' way before thee
virgilia o the gods
cominius i'll follow thee a month devise with the
where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
and we of thee so if the time thrust forth
a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
and lose advantage which doth ever cool
i' th' absence of the needer

of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
that's yet unbruis'd bring me but out at gate

for the violent breaking out
roman banish'd sir

aufidius what is thy name
coriolanus a name unmusical to the volscians' ears

bears a command int though thy tackle's torn
thou show'st a noble vessel what's thy name
coriolanus prepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yet
coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done
to thee particularly and to all the volsces
great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
my surname coriolanus the painful service
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
but with that surname a good memory
and witness of the malice and displeasure
which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
permitted by our dastard nobles who
have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest
an suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
whoop'd out of rome now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
mistake me not to save my life for if
i had fear'd death of all the men i' th' world
i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite
to be full quit of those my banishers
a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight
and make my misery serve thy turn so use it
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee for i will fight
against my cank'red country with the spleen
of all the under fiends but if so be
thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes
longer to live most weary and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
which not to cut would show thee but a fool
since i have ever followed thee with hate
drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast
and cannot live but to thy shame unless
it be to do thee service
aufidius o marcius marcius
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
should from yond cloud speak divine things
and say ''tis true' i'd not believe them more
than thee all noble marcius let me twine
mine arms about that body where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
and scarr'd the moon with splinters here i clip
the anvil of my sword and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength i did
i lov'd the maid i married never man
sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here
thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
than when i first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell the
we have a power on foot and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
or lose mine arm for't thou hast beat me out
twelve several times and i have nightly since
we have been down together in my sleep
unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat
and wak'd half dead with nothing worthy marcius
had we no other quarrel else to rome but that
thou art thence banish'd we would muster all
from twelve to seventy and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome
like a bold flood o'erbeat o come go in
and take our friendly senators by th' hands
who am prepar'd against your territories
though not for rome itself
coriolanus you bless me gods
aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges take
th' one half of my commission and set down
as best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st
thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways
whether to knock against the gates of rome
to fright them ere destroy but come in
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
and more a friend than e'er an enemy
yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius
the two servingmen come forward
first servant here's a strange alteration
second servant by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
of him
first servant what an arm he has he turnd me about with his
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
second servant nay i knew by his face that there was something in
him he had sir a kind of face methought i cannot tell how to
term it
first servant he had so looking as it were would i were hang'd
but i thought there was more in him than i could think
second servant so did i i'll be sworn he is simply the rarest
first servant i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot
empty
second servant who my master
first servant nay it's no matter for that
second servant worth six on him
first servant nay not so neither but i take him to be the
greater soldier
second servant faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
for the defence of a town our general is excellent
re enter the third servingman
third servant o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
both what what what let's partake
third servant i would not be a roman of all nations
i had as lief be a condemnd man
both wherefore wherefore
third servant why here's he that was wont to thwack our general
caius marcius
first servant why do you say 'thwack our general
good enough for him
second servant come we are fellows and friends he was ever too
hard for him i have heard him say so himself
first servant he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
ont before corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
empty
second servant an he had been cannibally given he might have
broild and eaten him too
first servant but more of thy news
and heir to mars set at upper end o' th' table no question
asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him
our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself
with's hand and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse
but the bottom of the news is our general is cut i' th' middle
and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half
by the entreaty and grant of the whole table he'll go he says
and sowl the porter of rome gates by th' ears he will mow all
down before him and leave his passage polld
third servant do't he will do't for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst
not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends
whilst he's in directitude
first servant directitude what's that
third servant but when they shall see sir his crest up again and
the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies
after rain and revel an with him
first servant but when goes this forward
drum struck up this afternoon 'tis as it were parcel of their
feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips
second servant why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and
breed ballad makers
first servant let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent
peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulld deaf sleepy
insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a
second servant 'tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be
a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
empty
first servant ay and it makes men hate one another
third servant reason because they then less need one another the
wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians
they are rising they are rising
both in in in in exeunt
scene vi
enter the two tribunes sicinius and brutus
sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him
his remedies are tame the present peace
and quietness of the people which before
were in wild hurry here do make his friends
blush that the world goes well who rather had
though they themselves did suffer by't behold
dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
enter menenius
brutus we stood to't in good time is this menenius
sicinius 'tis he 'tis he o he is grown most kind
of late hail sir
menenius hail to you both
sicinius your coriolanus is not much miss'd
but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand
and so would do were he more angry at it
menenius alls well and might have been much better
sicinius where is he hear you
menenius nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife
hear nothing from him
enter three or four citizens
citizens the gods preserve you both
sicinius god den our neighbours
brutus god den to you all god den to you an
first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees
are bound to pray for you both
brutus farewell kind neighbours we wish'd coriolanus
had lov'd you as we did
citizens now the gods keep you
both tribunes farewell farewell exeunt citizens
sicinius this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets
crying confusion
brutus caius marcius was
a worthy officer i' the war but insolent
empty
sicinius and affecting one sole throne
without assistance
menenius i think not so
sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation
if he had gone forth consul found it so
brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome
sits safe and still without him
enter an aedile
there is a slave whom we have put in prison
reports the volsces with several powers
are ent'red in the roman territories
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before 'em
menenius 'tis aufidius
who hearing of our marcius' banishment
thrusts forth his horns again into the world
which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome
sicinius come what talk you of marcius
brutus go see this rumourer whipp'd it cannot be
the volsces dare break with us
menenius cannot be
we have record that very well it can
and three examples of the like hath been
within my age but reason with the fellow
before you punish him where he heard this
lest you shall chance to whip your information
of what is to be dreaded
sicinius tell not me
i know this cannot be
brutus not possible
enter a messenger
messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going
all to the senate house some news is come
that turns their countenances
sicinius 'tis this slave
nothing but his report
messenger yes worthy sir
the slave's report is seconded and more
more fearful is deliver'd
sicinius what more fearful
messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths
how probable i do not know that marcius
joind with aufidius leads a power 'gainst rome
and vows revenge as spacious as between
sicinius this is most likely
brutus rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
good marcius home again
sicinius the very trick on 't
menenius this is unlikely
he and aufidius can no more atone
than violent'st contrariety
enter a second messenger
second messenger you are sent for to the senate
associated with aufidius rages
upon our territories and have already
o'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took
what lay before them
enter cominius
cominius o you have made good work
menenius what news what news
cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates
menenius what's the news what's the news
cominius your temples burned in their cement and
your franchises whereon you stood confind
into an auger's bore
menenius pray now your news
you have made fair work i fear me pray your news
if marcius should be joind wi' th' volscians
cominius if
he is their god he leads them like a thing
that shapes man better and they follow him
against us brats with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies
menenius you have made good work
you and your apron men you that stood so much
upon the voice of occupation and
the breath of garlic eaters
cominius he'll shake
menenius as hercules
did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work
brutus but is this true sir
cominius ay and you'll look pale
before you find it other all the regions
do smilingly revolt and who resists
are mock'd for valiant ignorance
and perish constant fools who is't can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him
the noble man have mercy
cominius who shall ask it
the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
should say 'be good to rome' they charg'd him even
as those should do that had deserv'd his hate
and therein show'd fike enemies
menenius 'tis true
that should consume it i have not the face
to say 'beseech you cease' you have made fair hands
you and your crafts you have crafted fair
cominius you have brought
a trembling upon rome such as was never
s' incapable of help
both tribunes say not we brought it
menenius how was't we we lov'd him but like beasts
and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
cominius but i fear
they'll roar him in again tullus aufidius
the second name of men obeys his points
as if he were his officer desperation
is all the policy strength and defence
that rome can make against them
enter a troop of citizens
menenius here comes the clusters
and is aufidius with him you are they
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus' exile now he's coming
and not a hair upon a soldier's head
which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
as you threw caps up will he tumble down
and pay you for your voices 'tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
we have deserv'd it
plebeians faith we hear fearful news
when i said banish him i said 'twas pity
second citizen and so did i
third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very
many of us that we did we did for the best and though we
willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our
empty
cominius y'are goodly things you voices
menenius you have made
good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol
exeunt cominius and menenius
sicinius go masters get you be not dismay'd
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear go home
and show no sign of fear
first citizen the gods be good to us come masters let's home i
ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him
second citizen so did we all but come let's home
exeunt citizens
sicinius nor i
brutus let's to the capitol would half my wealth
would buy this for a lie
sicinius pray let's go exeunt
scene vii
a camp at a short distance from rome
enter aufidius with his lieutenant
aufidius do they still fly to th' roman
lieutenant i do not know what witchcraft's in him but
their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are dark'ned in this action sir
even by your own
aufidius i cannot help it now
unless by using means i lame the foot
of our design he bears himself more proudlier
even to my person than i thought he would
when first i did embrace him yet his nature
in that's no changeling and i must excuse
lieutenant yet i wish sir
i mean for your particular you had not
joind in commission with him but either
had borne the action of yourself or else
to him had left it solely
aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
what i can urge against him although it seems
and so he thinks and is no less apparent
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
fights dragon like and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
whene'er we come to our account
lieutenant sir i beseech you think you he'll carry rome
aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down
and the nobility of rome are his
the senators and patricians love him too
will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature first he was
a noble servant to them but he could not
carry his honours even whether 'twas pride
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man whether defect of judgment
to fail in the disposing of those chances
not to be other than one thing not moving
from th' casque to th' cushion but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controlld the war but one of these
as he hath spices of them all not all
for i dare so far free him made him fear'd
so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit
to choke it in the utt'rance so our virtues
lie in th' interpretation of the time
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
t' extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come let's away when caius rome is thine
thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine
empty
act v scene i
rome a public place
menenius no i'll not go you hear what he hath said
which was sometime his general who lov'd him
in a most dear particular he calld me father
but what o' that go you that banish'd him
a mile before his tent fall down and knee
the way into his mercy nay if he coy'd
to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home
cominius he would not seem to know me
menenius do you hear
i urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops
that we have bled together 'coriolanus'
he would not answer to forbid all names
he was a kind of nothing titleless
till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
of burning rome
menenius why so you have made good work
a pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for rome
to make coals cheap a noble memory
when it was less expected he replied
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punish'd
menenius very well
could he say less
cominius i offer'd to awaken his regard
for's private friends his answer to me was
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
of noisome musty chaff he said 'twas folly
and still to nose th' offence
menenius for one poor grain or two
i am one of those his mother wife his child
and this brave fellow too we are the grains
you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
above the moon we must be burnt for you
sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
in this so never needed help yet do not
upbraid's with our distress but sure if you
more than the instant army we can make
might stop our countryman
menenius no i'll not meddle
sicinius pray you go to him
menenius what should i do
brutus only make trial what your love can do
for rome towards marcius
menenius well and say that marcius
return me as cominius is returnd
but as a discontented friend grief shot
with his unkindness say't be so
sicinius yet your good will
must have that thanks from rome after the measure
as you intended well
menenius i'll undertake't
i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip
and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
he was not taken well he had not dind
we pout upon the morning are unapt
to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd
these pipes and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
than in our priest like fasts therefore i'll watch him
till he be dieted to my request
and then i'll set upon him
brutus you know the very road into his kindness
and cannot lose your way
speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
of my success exit
cominius he'll never hear him
sicinius not
cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
red as 'twould burn rome and his injury
the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him
'twas very faintly he said 'rise' dismiss'd me
thus with his speechless hand what he would do
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
so that all hope is vain
unless his noble mother and his wife
who as i hear mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country therefore let's hence
and with our fair entreaties haste them on exeunt
scene ii
the volscian camp before rome
enter menenius to the watch on guard
second watch stand and go back
menenius you guard like men 'tis well but by your leave
i am an officer of state and come
to speak with coriolanus
first watch from whence
menenius from rome
first watch you may not pass you must return our general
will no more hear from thence
second watch you'll see your rome embrac'd with fire before
menenius good my friends
if you have heard your general talk of rome
and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius
first watch be it so go back the virtue of your name
is not here passable
menenius i tell thee fellow
thy general is my lover i have been
the book of his good acts whence men have read
for i have ever verified my friends
of whom he's chief with all the size that verity
would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow
i must have leave to pass
first watch faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf
as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here
therefore go back
menenius prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always
factionary on the party of your general
second watch howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot
pass therefore go back
menenius has he dind canst thou tell for i would not speak with
him till after dinner
first watch you are a roman are you
first watch then you should hate rome as he does can you when
you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them and in
a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think
to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the
virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied
intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be can you
think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
in with such weak breath as this no you are deceiv'd therefore
back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemnd
menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me
with estimation
first watch come my captain knows you not
menenius i mean thy general
first watch my general cares not for you back i say go lest i
let forth your half pint of blood back that's the utmost of
your having back
menenius nay but fellow fellow
enter coriolanus with aufidius
menenius now you companion i'll say an errand for you you shall
know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack
guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my
entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of
hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come
upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father
menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us
to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i
have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to
pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage
thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this
who like a block hath denied my access to thee
coriolanus away
menenius how away
coriolanus wife mother child i know not my affairs
are servanted to others though i owe
in volscian breasts that we have been familiar
ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
than pity note how much therefore be gone
mine ears against your suits are stronger than
your gates against my force yet for i lov'd thee
take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter
and would have sent it another word menenius
i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius
was my belov'd in rome yet thou behold'st
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius
first watch now sir is your name menenius
second watch 'tis a spell you see of much power you know the
way home again
first watch do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back
second watch what cause do you think i have to swoon
menenius i neither care for th' world nor your general for such
things as you i can scarce think there's any y'are so slight
let your general do his worst for you be that you are long
and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was
said to away exit
first watch a noble fellow i warrant him
second watch the worthy fellow is our general he's the rock the
oak not to be wind shaken exeunt
scene iii
the tent of coriolanus
enter coriolanus aufidius and others
set down our host my partner in this action
you must report to th' volscian lords how plainly
i have borne this business
aufidius only their ends
you have respected stopp'd your ears against
the general suit of rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such friends
that thought them sure of you
coriolanus this last old man
lov'd me above the measure of a father
nay godded me indeed their latest refuge
was to send him for whose old love i have
though i show'd sourly to him once more offer'd
the first conditions which they did refuse
and cannot now accept to grace him only
that thought he could do more a very little
i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time 'tis made i will not
enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia valeria
young marcius with attendants
my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould
wherein this trunk was fram'd and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood but out affection
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not
of stronger earth than others my mother bows
as if olympus to a molehill should
in supplication nod and my young boy
hath an aspect of intercession which
great nature cries 'deny not' let the volsces
plough rome and harrow italy i'll never
be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
as if a man were author of himself
virgilia my lord and husband
coriolanus these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
virgilia the sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
makes you think so
coriolanus like a dull actor now
i have forgot my part and i am out
even to a full disgrace best of my flesh
forgive my tyranny but do not say
for that 'forgive our romans' o a kiss
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
i carried from thee dear and my true lip
hath virgind it e'er since you gods i prate
and the most noble mother of the world
leave unsaluted sink my knee i' th' earth kneels
of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons
volumnia o stand up blest
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
show duty as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent kneels
coriolanus what's this
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun
murd'ring impossibility to make
what cannot be slight work
i holp to frame thee do you know this lady
coriolanus the noble sister of publicola
the moon of rome chaste as the icicle
that's curdied by the frost from purest snow
and hangs on dians temple dear valeria
volumnia this is a poor epitome of yours
which by th' interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself
coriolanus the god of soldiers
thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars
like a great sea mark standing every flaw
and saving those that eye thee
volumnia your knee sirrah
coriolanus that's my brave boy
volumnia even he your wife this lady and myself
are suitors to you
coriolanus i beseech you peace
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials do not bid me
dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
again with rome's mechanics tell me not
wherein i seem unnatural desire not
t'allay my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons
volumnia o no more no more
you have said you will not grant us any thing
which you deny already yet we will ask
that if you fail in our request the blame
may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
coriolanus aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll
hear nought from rome in private your request
volumnia should we be silent and not speak our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
making the mother wife and child to see
the son the husband and the father tearing
his country's bowels out and to poor we
thine enmity's most capital thou bar'st us
our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy for how can we
alas how can we for our country pray
whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
the country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort in the country we must find
an evident calamity though we had
our wish which side should win for either thou
must as a foreign recreant be led
with manacles through our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
i purpose not to wait on fortune till
these wars determine if i can not persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread
trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb
that brought thee to this world
virgilia ay and mine
that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
boy 'a shall not tread on me
i'll run away till i am bigger but then i'll fight
coriolanus not of a womans tenderness to be
requires nor child nor womans face to see
i have sat too long rising
volumnia nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
is that you reconcile them while the volsces
may say 'this mercy we have show'd' the romans
'this we receiv'd' and each in either side
give the all hail to thee and cry 'be blest
for making up this peace' thou know'st great son
the end of war's uncertain but this certain
that if thou conquer rome the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses
but with his last attempt he wip'd it out
destroy'd his country and his name remains
to th' ensuing age abhorr'd' speak to me son
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
to imitate the graces of the gods
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak why dost not speak
think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons there's no man in the world
more bound to's mother yet here he lets me prate
like one i' th' stocks thou hast never in thy life
show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond of no second brood
has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home
loaden with honour say my request's unjust
thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrainst from me the duty which
to a mother's part belongs he turns away
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride
than pity to our prayers down an end
this is the last so we will home to rome
and die among our neighbours nay behold's
this boy that cannot tell what he would have
does reason our petition with more strength
than thou hast to deny't come let us go
this fellow had a volscian to his mother
his wife is in corioli and his child
like him by chance yet give us our dispatch
i am hush'd until our city be afire
and then i'll speak a little
he holds her by the hand silent
coriolanus o mother mother
the gods look down and this unnatural scene
they laugh at o my mother mother o
you have won a happy victory to rome
but for your son believe it o believe it
most dangerously you have with him prevaild
if not most mortal to him but let it come
aufidius though i cannot make true wars
i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius
were you in my stead would you have heard
aufidius i was mov'd withal
coriolanus i dare be sworn you were
and sir it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir
what peace you'fl make advise me for my part
i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you
stand to me in this cause o mother wife
aufidius aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy
empty
myself a former fortune
coriolanus to the ladies ay by and by
but we will drink together and you shall bear
a better witness back than words which we

menenius see you yond coign o' th' capitol yond cornerstone
sicinius why what of that
menenius if it be possible for you to displace it with your little
finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his
mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope int
our throats are sentenc'd and stay upon execution
sicinius is't possible that so short a time can alter the
menenius there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet
your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to
dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing
sicinius he lov'd his mother dearly
menenius so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now
than an eight year old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe
grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground
shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in
finish'd with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but
eternity and a heaven to throne in
sicinius yes mercy if you report him truly
menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother
shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is
milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this
is 'long of you
sicinius the gods be good unto us
menenius no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us
break our necks they respect not us

you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you
of your great danger
aufidius sir i cannot tell
we must proceed as we do find the people
third conspirator the people will remain uncertain whilst
'twixt you there's difference but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all
aufidius i know it
and my pretext to strike at him admits
mine honour for his truth who being so heightend
he watered his new plants with dews of flattery
seducing so my friends and to this end
he bow'd his nature never known before
but to be rough unswayable and free
third conspirator sir his stoutness
when he did stand for consul which he lost
by lack of stooping
aufidius that i would have spoken of
presented to my knife his throat i took him
made him joint servant with me gave him way
in all his own desires nay let him choose
out of my files his projects to accomplish
my best and freshest men serv'd his designments
in mine own person holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his and took some pride
to do myself this wrong till at the last
i seem'd his follower not partner and
i had been mercenary
first conspirator so he did my lord
the army marvelld at it and in the last
when he had carried rome and that we look'd
for no less spoil than glory
aufidius there was it
for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
at a few drops of womens rheum which are
as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
and i'll renew me in his fall but hark
drums and
trumpets sound with great shouts of the people
first conspirator your native town you enter'd like a post
and had no welcomes home but he returns
splitting the air with noise
second conspirator and patient fools
whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
with giving him glory
ere he express himself or move the people
with what he would say let him feel your sword
which we will second when he lies along
after your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
his reasons with his body
aufidius say no more
here come the lords

lords you are most welcome home
but worthy lords have you with heed perused

than shame to th' romans and we here deliver
subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians
together with the seal o' th' senate what
we have compounded on

son my daughter he killd my cousin marcus he killd my

britain the garden of cymbeline's palace
first gentleman you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
still seem as does the king's
second gentleman but what's the matter
first gentleman his daughter and the heir of's kingdom whom
he purpos'd to his wife's sole son a widow
that late he married hath referr'd herself
unto a poor but worthy gentleman she's wedded
her husband banish'd she imprisond all
is outward sorrow though i think the king
be touch'd at very heart
first gentleman he that hath lost her too so is the queen
that most desir'd the match but not a courtier
although they wear their faces to the bent
of the king's looks hath a heart that is not
glad at the thing they scowl at
second gentleman and why so
first gentleman he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
too bad for bad report and he that hath her
i mean that married her alack good man
as to seek through the regions of the earth
for one his like there would be something failing
in him that should compare i do not think
so fair an outward and such stuff within
endows a man but he
second gentleman you speak him far
first gentleman i do extend him sir within himself
crush him together rather than unfold
his measure duly
first gentleman i cannot delve him to the root his father
was calld sicilius who did join his honour
against the romans with cassibelan
but had his titles by tenantius whom
he serv'd with glory and admir'd success
so gaind the sur addition leonatus
and had besides this gentleman in question
two other sons who in the wars o' th' time
died with their swords in hand for which their father
that he quit being and his gentle lady
big of this gentleman our theme deceas'd
as he was born the king he takes the babe
to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus
breeds him and makes him of his bed chamber
puts to him all the learnings that his time
could make him the receiver of which he took
as we do air fast as 'twas minist'red
and ins spring became a harvest liv'd in court
a sample to the youngest to th' more mature
a glass that feated them and to the graver
a child that guided dotards to his mistress
for whom he now is banish'd her own price
proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
by her election may be truly read
what kind of man he is
second gentleman i honour him
even out of your report but pray you tell me
first gentleman his only child
he had two sons if this be worth your hearing
mark it the eldest of them at three years old
i' th' swathing clothes the other from their nursery
were stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledge
which way they went
second gentleman how long is this ago
first gentleman some twenty years
second gentleman that a king's children should be so convey'd
that could not trace them
first gentleman howsoe'er 'tis strange
or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
yet is it true sir
second gentleman i do well believe you
first gentleman we must forbear here comes the gentleman
the queen and princess exeunt
enter the queen posthumus and imogen
queen no be assur'd you shall not find me daughter
evil ey'd unto you you're my prisoner but
your gaoler shall deliver you the keys

the fire of rage is in him and 'twere good
you leand unto his sentence with what patience

the pangs of barr'd affections though the king
hath charg'd you should not speak together exit
imogen o dissembling courtesy how fine this tyrant
can tickle where she wounds my dearest husband
i something fear my father's wrath but nothing
always reserv'd my holy duty what
his rage can do on me you must be gone
of angry eyes not comforted to live
but that there is this jewel in the world
that i may see again
posthumus my queen my mistress
o lady weep no more lest i give cause
to be suspected of more tenderness
than doth become a man i will remain
the loyalst husband that did e'er plight troth
my residence in rome at one philario's
known but by letter thither write my queen
and with mine eyes i'll drink the words you send
though ink be made of gall
re enter queen
queen be brief i pray you
if the king come i shall incur i know not
how much of his displeasure aside yet i'll move him
to walk this way i never do him wrong
but he does buy my injuries to be friends
posthumus should we be taking leave
as long a term as yet we have to live
the loathness to depart would grow adieu
imogen nay stay a little
were you but riding forth to air yourself
such parting were too petty look here love
this diamond was my mother's take it heart
but keep it till you woo another wife
when imogen is dead
you gentle gods give me but this i have
and sear up my embracements from a next
with bonds of death remain remain thou here
puts on the ring
while sense can keep it on and sweetest fairest
as i my poor self did exchange for you
to your so infinite loss so in our trifles
i still win of you for my sake wear this
it is a manacle of love i'll place it
imogen o the gods

cymbeline o disloyal thing

a year's age on me
imogen i beseech you sir
harm not yourself with your vexation
i am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
cymbeline past grace obedience
imogen past hope and in despair that way past grace
cymbeline that mightst have had the sole son of my queen
imogen o blessed that i might not i chose an eagle
and did avoid a puttock
cymbeline thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne
a seat for baseness
imogen no i rather added
a lustre to it
imogen sir
it is your fault that i have lov'd posthumus
you bred him as my playfellow and he is
a man worth any woman overbuys me
almost the sum he pays
cymbeline what art thou mad
imogen almost sir heaven restore me would i were
a neat herd's daughter and my leonatus
our neighbour shepherd's son
cymbeline thou foolish thing
to the queen they were again together you have done
not after our command away with her

first lord sir i would advise you to shift a shirt the violence
of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice where air comes out
air comes in there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent
cloten if my shirt were bloody then to shift it have i hurt him
second lord aside no faith not so much as his patience
first lord hurt him his body's a passable carcass if he be not
hurt it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt
side the town
cloten the villain would not stand me
second lord aside no but he fled forward still toward your
empty
first lord stand you you have land enough of your own but he
added to your having gave you some ground
second lord aside as many inches as you have oceans
empty
cloten i would they had not come between us
fool you were upon the ground
cloten and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
second lord aside if it be a sin to make a true election she is
empty
first lord sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain go
not together she's a good sign but i have seen small reflection
of her wit
second lord aside she shines not upon fools lest the reflection
should hurt her
empty

an ass which is no great hurt
cloten you'll go with us
first lord i'll attend your lordship

scene iii
britain cymbeline's palace
imogen i would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven
and questioned'st every sail if he should write
and i not have it 'twere a paper lost
as offer'd mercy is what was the last
that he spake to thee
pisanio it was his queen his queen
imogen then wav'd his handkerchief
pisanio and kiss'd it madam
imogen senseless linen happier therein than i
pisanio no madam for so long
as he could make me with his eye or care
distinguish him from others he did keep
the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
still waving as the fits and stirs of's mind
could best express how slow his soul saild on
how swift his ship
imogen thou shouldst have made him
as little as a crow or less ere left
pisanio madam so i did
imogen i would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but
to look upon him till the diminution
of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
nay followed him till he had melted from
the smallness of a gnat to air and then
have turnd mine eye and wept but good pisanio
when shall we hear from him
pisanio be assur'd madam
imogen i did not take my leave of him but had
most pretty things to say ere i could tell him
how i would think on him at certain hours
such thoughts and such or i could make him swear
the shes of italy should not betray
mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him
at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
t' encounter me with orisons for then
i am in heaven for him or ere i could
betwixt two charming words comes in my father
and like the tyrannous breathing of the north
shakes all our buds from growing
enter a lady
lady the queen madam
desires your highness' company
imogen those things i bid you do get them dispatch'd
i will attend the queen
pisanio madam i shall exeunt
rome philario's house
enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard
iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then
of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
been allowed the name of but i could then have look'd on him
without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his
endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by
empty
philario you speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there could
behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
iachimo this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he
must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i
doubt not a great deal from the matter
frenchman and then his banishment
iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it
but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay
he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance
philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have
been often bound for no less than my life
enter posthumus
here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as
suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
quality i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman
whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is
i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his
frenchman sir we have known together in orleans
posthumus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies
which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still
frenchman sir you o'errate my poor kindness i was glad i did
atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have
been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore
upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature
posthumus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller
rather shunnd to go even with what i heard than in my every
judgment if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not
altogether slight
frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and
by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
other or have falln both
iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference
frenchman safely i think 'twas a contention in public which
may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like
an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in
vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more
fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less
attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france
iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion
by this worn out
posthumus she holds her virtue still and i my mind
iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy
posthumus being so far provok'd as i was in france i would abate
her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend
had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain
if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours
outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she
excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that
is nor you the lady
posthumus i prais'd her as i rated her so do i my stone
iachimo what do you esteem it at
posthumus more than the world enjoys
iachimo either your unparagond mistress is dead or she's
posthumus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there
were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the
other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods
iachimo which the gods have given you
posthumus which by their graces i will keep
iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl
light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stoln too so
your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and
the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplish'd
posthumus your italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of
that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of
thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring
philario let us leave here gentlemen
posthumus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank
him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get ground
of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had
posthumus no no
iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but i make
my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and
to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any
lady in the world
posthumus you are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion
and i doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt
iachimo what's that
more a punishment too
philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let
it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted
iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
approbation of what i have spoke
posthumus what lady would you choose to assail
iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will
lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the
court where your lady is with no more advantage than the
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd
posthumus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i
hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it
iachimo you are a friend and therein the wiser if you buy
ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from
tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear
posthumus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver
purpose i hope
iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's
posthumus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return
let there be covenants drawn betweens my mistress exceeds in
goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to
this match here's my ring
philario i will have it no lay
iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient
testimony that i have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your
mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond
too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have
provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment
posthumus i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt
us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon
her and give me directly to understand you have prevaild i am
no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain
unseduc'd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill
opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall
answer me with your sword
iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set down
bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and
have our two wagers recorded
posthumus agreed exeunt posthumus and iachimo
frenchman will this hold think you
philario signior iachimo will not from it pray let us follow 'em

scene v
britain cymbeline's palace
enter queen ladies and cornelius
make haste who has the note of them
lady i madam
queen dispatch exeunt ladies
now master doctor have you brought those drugs
cornelius pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
presenting a box
but i beseech your grace without offence
my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have
commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
but though slow deadly
queen i wonder doctor
thou ask'st me such a question have i not been
thy pupil long hast thou not learnd me how
to make perfumes distil preserve yea so
that our great king himself doth woo me oft
for my confections having thus far proceeded
unless thou think'st me devilish is't not meet
that i did amplify my judgment in
of these thy compounds on such creatures as
we count not worth the hanging but none human
to try the vigour of them and apply
allayments to their act and by them gather
their several virtues and effects
cornelius your highness
shall from this practice but make hard your heart
besides the seeing these effects will be
both noisome and infectious
enter pisanio
aside here comes a flattering rascal upon him
will i first work he's for his master
an enemy to my son how now pisanio
doctor your service for this time is ended
take your own way
cornelius aside i do suspect you madam
but you shall do no harm
queen to pisanio hark thee a word
strange ling'ring poisons i do know her spirit
and will not trust one of her malice with
a drug of such damnd nature those she has
will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs
then afterward up higher but there is
no danger in what show of death it makes
more than the locking up the spirits a time
to be more fresh reviving she is foold
so to be false with her
queen no further service doctor
until i send for thee
cornelius i humbly take my leave exit
queen weeps she still say'st thou dost thou think in time
she will not quench and let instructions enter
where folly now possesses do thou work
when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
i'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
is at last gasp return he cannot nor
continue where he is to shift his being
is to exchange one misery with another
and every day that comes comes comes to
a day's work in him what shalt thou expect
to be depender on a thing that leans
who cannot be new built nor has no friends
so much as but to prop him
thou tak'st up
thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
it is a thing i made which hath the king
five times redeem'd from death i do not know
what is more cordial nay i prithee take it
it is an earnest of a further good
that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how
the case stands with her do't as from thyself
think what a chance thou changest on but think
who shall take notice of thee i'll move the king
to any shape of thy preferment such
as thou'lt desire and then myself i chiefly
that set thee on to this desert am bound
to load thy merit richly call my women

a sly and constant knave
not to be shak'd the agent for his master

except she bend her humour shall be assur'd
to taste of too

a foolish suitor to a wedded lady
that hath her husband banish'd o that husband
my supreme crown of grief and those repeated

how mean soe'er that have their honest wills
which seasons comfort who may this be fie
enter pisanio and iachimo
pisanio madam a noble gentleman of rome
comes from my lord with letters
iachimo change you madam
the worthy leonatus is in safety
imogen thanks good sir
you're kindly welcome
iachimo aside all of her that is out of door most rich
if she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
she is alone th' arabian bird and i
have lost the wager boldness be my friend
arm me audacity from head to foot
or like the parthian i shall flying fight
rather directly fly
kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon him
accordingly as you value your trust leonatus'
so far i read aloud
but even the very middle of my heart
is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully
you are as welcome worthy sir as i
have words to bid you and shall find it so
in all that i can do
iachimo thanks fairest lady
to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt
the fiery orbs above and the twinnd stones
upon the number'd beach and can we not
partition make with spectacles so precious
'twixt fair and foul
imogen what makes your admiration
iachimo it cannot be i' th' eye for apes and monkeys
'twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
for idiots in this case of favour would
be wisely definite nor i' th' appetite
sluttery to such neat excellence oppos'd
should make desire vomit emptiness
not so allur'd to feed
imogen what is the matter trow
iachimo the cloyed will
that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
both filld and running ravening first the lamb
imogen what dear sir
thus raps you are you well
iachimo thanks madam well beseech you sir
desire my mans abode where i did leave him
he's strange and peevish
pisanio i was going sir
to give him welcome exit
imogen continues well my lord his health beseech you
iachimo well madam
iachimo exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome he is calld
the britain reveller
imogen when he was here
he did incline to sadness and oft times
not knowing why
iachimo i never saw him sad
there is a frenchman his companion one
an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton
your lord i mean laughs from's free lungs cries 'o
can my sides hold to think that man who knows
by history report or his own proof
what woman is yea what she cannot choose
but must be wills free hours languish for
assured bondage'
imogen will my lord say so
iachimo ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know
some men are much to blame
imogen not he i hope
iachimo not he but yet heavens bounty towards him might
be us'd more thankfully in himself 'tis much
in you which i account his beyond all talents
whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound
to pity too
imogen what do you pity sir
imogen am i one sir
you look on me what wreck discern you in me
deserves your pity
iachimo lamentable what
to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
i' th' dungeon by a snuff
imogen i pray you sir
deliver with more openness your answers
to my demands why do you pity me
i was about to say enjoy your but
it is an office of the gods to venge it
not mine to speak ont
imogen you do seem to know
something of me or what concerns me pray you
since doubting things go ill often hurts more
than to be sure they do for certainties
either are past remedies or timely knowing
the remedy then born discover to me
iachimo had i this cheek
to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
to th' oath of loyalty this object which
takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
fixing it only here should i damnd then
slaver with lips as common as the stairs
that mount the capitol join gripes with hands
made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as
base and illustrious as the smoky light
that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
that all the plagues of hell should at one time
encounter such revolt
imogen my lord i fear
has forgot britain
iachimo and himself not i
inclind to this intelligence pronounce
the beggary of his change but 'tis your graces
charms this report out
imogen let me hear no more
iachimo o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
with pity that doth make me sick a lady
so fair and fastend to an empery
would make the great'st king double to be partner'd
with tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
which your own coffers yield with diseas'd ventures
that play with all infirmities for gold
as well might poison poison be reveng'd
or she that bore you was no queen and you
recoil from your great stock
imogen reveng'd
how should i be reveng'd if this be true
as i have such a heart that both mine ears
must not in haste abuse if it be true
how should i be reveng'd
iachimo should he make me
whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
in your despite upon your purse revenge it
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
more noble than that runagate to your bed
and will continue fast to your affection
still close as sure
imogen what ho pisanio
iachimo let me my service tender on your lips
imogen away i do condemn mine ears that have
thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
for such an end thou seek'st as base as strange
thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
from thy report as thou from honour and
solicits here a lady that disdains
thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio
the king my father shall be made acquainted
of thy assault if he shall think it fit
a saucy stranger in his court to mart
his beastly mind to us he hath a court
he little cares for and a daughter who
he not respects at all what ho pisanio
iachimo o happy leonatus i may say
the credit that thy lady hath of thee
deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
her assur'd credit blessed live you long
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
country calld his and you his mistress only
i have spoke this to know if your affiance
were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
that which he is new o'er and he is one
the truest manner'd such a holy witch
that he enchants societies into him
half all mens hearts are his

iachimo he sits 'mongst men like a descended god
he hath a kind of honour sets him of
most mighty princess that i have adventur'd
to try your taking of a false report which hath
honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
in the election of a sir so rare
which you know cannot err the love i bear him
made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
unlike all others chaffless pray your pardon
imogen alls well sir take my pow'r i' th' court for yours

by being so verbal and learn now for all
that i which know my heart do here pronounce
by th' very truth of it i care not for you

to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather
you felt than make't my boast
obedience which you owe your father for
the contract you pretend with that base wretch
one bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes
with scraps o' th' court it is no contract none
and though it be allowed in meaner parties
yet who than he more mean to knit their souls

rome philario's house
enter posthumus and philario
posthumus fear it not sir i would i were so sure
to win the king as i am bold her honour
philario what means do you make to him
posthumus not any but abide the change of time
quake in the present winter's state and wish
that warmer days would come in these fear'd hopes
i barely gratify your love they failing
i must die much your debtor
philario your very goodness and your company
o'erpays all i can do by this your king
hath heard of great augustus caius lucius
he'll grant the tribute send th' arrearages
or look upon our romans whose remembrance
is yet fresh in their grief
posthumus i do believe
statist though i am none nor like to be
that this will prove a war and you shall hear
the legions now in gallia sooner landed
in our not fearing britain than have tidings
of any penny tribute paid our countrymen
smild at their lack of skill but found their courage
worthy his frowning at their discipline
now mingled with their courages will make known
to their approvers they are people such
that mend upon the world
enter iachimo
philario see iachimo
posthumus the swiftest harts have posted you by land
and winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
philario welcome sir
posthumus i hope the briefness of your answer made
the speediness of your return
iachimo your lady
is one of the fairest that i have look'd upon
posthumus and therewithal the best or let her beauty
look through a casement to allure false hearts
and be false with them
iachimo here are letters for you
iachimo 'tis very like
philario was caius lucius in the britain court
when you were there
iachimo he was expected then
but not approach'd
posthumus all is well yet
sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
too dull for your good wearing
iachimo if i have lost it
i'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy
a second night of such sweet shortness which
was mine in britain for the ring is won
posthumus the stone's too hard to come by
iachimo not a whit
your lady being so easy
posthumus make not sir
your loss your sport i hope you know that we
must not continue friends
if you keep covenant had i not brought
the knowledge of your mistress home i grant
we were to question farther but i now
profess myself the winner of her honour
together with your ring and not the wronger
of her or you having proceeded but
by both your wills
posthumus if you can make't apparent
that you have tasted her in bed my hand
you had of her pure honour gains or loses
your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
to who shall find them
iachimo sir my circumstances
being so near the truth as i will make them
must first induce you to believe whose strength
i will confirm with oath which i doubt not
you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
you need it not
iachimo first her bedchamber
where i confess i slept not but profess
had that was well worth watching it was hang'd
with tapestry of silk and silver the story
proud cleopatra when she met her roman
and cydnus swelld above the banks or for
the press of boats or pride a piece of work
so bravely done so rich that it did strive
in workmanship and value which i wonder'd
since the true life ont was
posthumus this is true
and this you might have heard of here by me
or by some other
iachimo more particulars
must justify my knowledge
posthumus so they must
or do your honour injury
iachimo the chimney
chaste dian bathing never saw i figures
so likely to report themselves the cutter
was as another nature dumb outwent her
motion and breath left out
posthumus this is a thing
which you might from relation likewise reap
being as it is much spoke of
iachimo the roof o' th' chamber
with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
of silver each on one foot standing nicely
depending on their brands
posthumus this is her honour
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
be given to your remembrance the description
of what is in her chamber nothing saves
the wager you have laid
iachimo then if you can shows the bracelet
be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see
to that your diamond i'll keep them
posthumus jove
once more let me behold it is it that
which i left with her
iachimo sir i thank her that
she stripp'd it from her arm i see her yet
her pretty action did outsell her gift
and yet enrich'd it too she gave it me and said
she priz'd it once
to send it me
iachimo she writes so to you doth she
posthumus o no no no 'tis true here take this too
gives the ring
it is a basilisk unto mine eye
kills me to look ont let there be no honour
where there is beauty truth where semblance love
where there's another man the vows of women
of no more bondage be to where they are made
o above measure false
philario have patience sir
and take your ring again 'tis not yet won
it may be probable she lost it or
who knows if one her women being corrupted
hath stoln it from her
posthumus very true
and so i hope he came by't back my ring
render to me some corporal sign about her
iachimo by jupiter i had it from her arm
posthumus hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
'tis true nay keep the ring 'tis true i am sure
she would not lose it her attendants are
all sworn and honourable they induc'd to steal it
and by a stranger no he hath enjoy'd her
the cognizance of her incontinency
is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
philario sir be patient
this is not strong enough to be believ'd
of one persuaded well of
posthumus never talk ont
she hath been colted by him
iachimo if you seek
for further satisfying under her breast
worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud
of that most delicate lodging by my life
to feed again though full you do remember
this stain upon her
posthumus ay and it doth confirm
another stain as big as hell can hold
were there no more but it
iachimo will you hear more
posthumus spare your arithmetic never count the turns
once and a million
iachimo i'll be sworn
if you will swear you have not done't you lie
and i will kill thee if thou dost deny
thou'st made me cuckold
iachimo i'll deny nothing
posthumus o that i had her here to tear her limb meal
i will go there and do't i' th' court before
her father i'll do something exit
philario quite besides
the government of patience you have won
he hath against himself
iachimo with all my heart exeunt
scene v
rome another room in philario's house
enter posthumus
posthumus is there no way for men to be but women
must be half workers we are all bastards
and that most venerable man which i
did call my father was i know not where
made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd
the dian of that time so doth my wife
the nonpareil of this o vengeance vengeance
me of my lawful pleasure she restraind
and pray'd me oft forbearance did it with
a pudency so rosy the sweet view ont
might well have warm'd old saturn that i thought her
as chaste as unsunnd snow o all the devils
this yellow iachimo in an hour was't not
like a full acornd boar a german one
cried 'o' and mounted found no opposition
but what he look'd for should oppose and she
should from encounter guard could i find out
the womans part in me for there's no motion
that tends to vice in man but i affirm
it is the womans part be it lying note it
the womans flattering hers deceiving hers
lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
nice longing slanders mutability
all faults that man may name nay that hell knows
why hers in part or all but rather all
for even to vice
they are not constant but are changing still
one vice but of a minute old for one
not half so old as that i'll write against them
detest them curse them yet 'tis greater skill
in a true hate to pray they have their will

enter in state cymbeline queen cloten and lords at one door
and at another caius lucius and attendants
cymbeline now say what would augustus caesar with us
lucius when julius caesar whose remembrance yet
lives in mens eyes and will to ears and tongues
be theme and hearing ever was in this britain
and conquer'd it cassibelan thine uncle
than in his feats deserving it for him
and his succession granted rome a tribute
yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
is left untender'd
queen and to kill the marvel
shall be so ever
cloten there be many caesars
ere such another julius britain is
a world by itself and we will nothing pay
queen that opportunity
which then they had to take from 's to resume
we have again remember sir my liege
the kings your ancestors together with
the natural bravery of your isle which stands
as neptune's park ribb'd and pald in
with rocks unscalable and roaring waters
with sands that will not bear your enemies' boats
but suck them up to th' top mast a kind of conquest
of 'came and saw and overcame' with shame
the first that ever touch'd him he was carried
from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas
like egg shells mov'd upon their surges crack'd
as easily 'gainst our rocks for joy whereof
the fam'd cassibelan who was once at point
o giglot fortune to master caesar's sword
made lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
cloten come there's no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is
stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no
moe such caesars other of them may have crook'd noses but to
owe such straight arms none
cymbeline son let your mother end
cloten we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan
i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should
we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket
or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light
cymbeline you must know
till the injurious romans did extort
this tribute from us we were free caesar's ambition
which swelld so much that it did almost stretch
the sides o' th' world against all colour here
did put the yoke upons which to shake of
becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
ourselves to be
cloten we do
our ancestor was that mulmutius which
ordaind our laws whose use the sword of caesar
hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
shall by the power we hold be our good deed
though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws
who was the first of britain which did put
his brows within a golden crown and calld
himself a king
lucius i am sorry cymbeline
caesar that hath moe kings his servants than
thyself domestic officers thine enemy
receive it from me then war and confusion
in caesar's name pronounce i 'gainst thee look
for fury not to be resisted thus defied
i thank thee for myself
cymbeline thou art welcome caius
thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent
much under him of him i gather'd honour
behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect
that the pannonians and dalmatians for
their liberties are now in arms a precedent
which not to read would show the britons cold
so caesar shall not find them
lucius let proof speak
cloten his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or
two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you
shall find us in our salt water girdle if you beat us out of it
the better for you and there's an end
lucius so sir
cymbeline i know your master's pleasure and he mine
all the remain is welcome exeunt

britain another room in cymbeline's palace
enter pisanio reading of a letter
pisanio how of adultery wherefore write you not
what monsters her accuse leonatus
is falln into thy ear what false italian
as poisonous tongu'd as handed hath prevaild
on thy too ready hearing disloyal no
she's punish'd for her truth and undergoes
more goddess like than wife like such assaults
as would take in some virtue o my master
thy mind to her is now as low as were
thy fortunes how that i should murder her
upon the love and truth and vows which i
if it be so to do good service never
let me be counted serviceable how look i
that i should seem to lack humanity
so much as this fact comes to reads 'do't the letter
that i have sent her by her own command
shall give thee opportunity' o damnd paper
black as the ink that's on thee senseless bauble
art thou a fedary for this act and look'st
so virgin like without lo here she comes
i am ignorant in what i am commanded
imogen how now pisanio
pisanio madam here is a letter from my lord
imogen who thy lord that is my lord leonatus
o learnd indeed were that astronomer
that knew the stars as i his characters
he'd lay the future open you good gods
let what is here containd relish of love
of my lord's health of his content yet not
some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them
for it doth physic love of his content
all but in that good wax thy leave blest be
you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers
and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike
though forfeiters you cast in prison yet
you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods
empty
'justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his
creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i
am in cambria at milford haven what your own love will out of
this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that
remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love
leonatus posthumus'
o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio
he is at milford haven read and tell me
how far 'tis thither if one of mean affairs
may plod it in a week why may not i
who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st
o let me 'bate but not like me yet long'st
but in a fainter kind o not like me
for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick
love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
to th' smothering of the sense how far it is
to this same blessed milford and by th' way
tell me how wales was made so happy as
t' inherit such a haven but first of all
that we shall make in time from our hence going
and our return to excuse but first how get hence
why should excuse be born or ere begot
we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak
how many score of miles may we well ride
'twixt hour and hour
pisanio one score 'twixt sun and sun
madam 's enough for you and too much too
imogen why one that rode to's execution man
where horses have been nimbler than the sands
that run i' th' clock's behalf but this is foolry
go bid my woman feign a sickness say
she'll home to her father and provide me presently
a riding suit no costlier than would fit
a franklins huswife
pisanio madam you're best consider
imogen i see before me man nor here nor here

accessible is none but milford way exeunt
scene iii
wales a mountainous country with a cave
enter from the cave belarius guiderius and arviragus
belarius a goodly day not to keep house with such
whose roof's as low as ours stoop boys this gate
instructs you how t' adore the heavens and bows you
to a morning's holy office the gates of monarchs
and keep their impious turbans on without
good morrow to the sun hail thou fair heaven
we house i' th' rock yet use thee not so hardly
as prouder livers do
guiderius hail heaven
arviragus hail heaven
belarius now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
your legs are young i'll tread these flats consider
when you above perceive me like a crow
and you may then revolve what tales i have told you
of courts of princes of the tricks in war
this service is not service so being done
but being so allow'd to apprehend thus
draws us a profit from all things we see
and often to our comfort shall we find
the sharded beetle in a safer hold
than is the full wing'd eagle o this life
is nobler than attending for a check
prouder than rustling in unpaid for silk
such gain the cap of him that makes him fine
yet keeps his book uncross'd no life to ours
guiderius out of your proof you speak we poor unfledg'd
have never wing'd from view o' th' nest nor know not
what air's from home haply this life is best
if quiet life be best sweeter to you
that have a sharper known well corresponding
with your stiff age but unto us it is
a prison for a debtor that not dares
to stride a limit
arviragus what should we speak of
when we are old as you when we shall hear
the rain and wind beat dark december how
in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
the freezing hours away we have seen nothing
we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
we make a choir as doth the prisond bird
and sing our bondage freely
belarius how you speak
did you but know the city's usuries
and felt them knowingly the art o' th' court
as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
is certain falling or so slipp'ry that
the fear's as bad as falling the toil o' th' war
a pain that only seems to seek out danger
and hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
as record of fair act nay many times
doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse
must curtsy at the censure o boys this story
the world may read in me my body's mark'd
with roman swords and my report was once
first with the best of note cymbeline lov'd me
and when a soldier was the theme my name
was not far off then was i as a tree
a storm or robbery call it what you will
shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
and left me bare to weather
guiderius uncertain favour
belarius my fault being nothing as i have told you oft
but that two villains whose false oaths prevaild
before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline
i was confederate with the romans so
follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
where i have liv'd at honest freedom paid
more pious debts to heaven than in all
the fore end of my time but up to th' mountains
this is not hunters' language he that strikes
the venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast
to him the other two shall minister
and we will fear no poison which attends
in place of greater state i'll meet you in the valleys
exeunt guiderius and arviragus
these boys know little they are sons to th' king
nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive
they think they are mine and though traind up thus meanly
i' th' cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
in simple and low things to prince it much
beyond the trick of others this polydore
the heir of cymbeline and britain who
the king his father calld guiderius jove
the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out
into my story say 'thus mine enemy fell
and thus i set my foot ons neck' even then
the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
that acts my words the younger brother cadwal
once arviragus in as like a figure
strikes life into my speech and shows much more
his own conceiving hark the game is rous'd
thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
at three and two years old i stole these babes
thinking to bar thee of succession as
thou refts me of my lands euriphile
thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother
and every day do honour to her grave
myself belarius that am morgan calld
they take for natural father the game is up exit
scene iv
enter pisanio and imogen
imogen thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
was near at hand ne'er long'd my mother so
to see me first as i have now pisanio man
where is posthumus what is in thy mind
that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh
from th' inward of thee one but painted thus
would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
beyond self explication put thyself
vanquish my staider senses what's the matter
why tender'st thou that paper to me with
a look untender if't be summer news
smile to't before if winterly thou need'st
but keep that count'nance still my husband's hand
that drug damnd italy hath out craftied him
and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue
may take off some extremity which to read
would be even mortal to me
and you shall find me wretched man a thing
the most disdaind of fortune
imogen reads 'thy mistress pisanio hath play'd the strumpet in
my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me i speak not
out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as
certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act
for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let
thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity
at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if
the pander to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal'
pisanio what shall i need to draw my sword the paper
hath cut her throat already no 'tis slander
whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath
rides on the posting winds and doth belie
all corners of the world kings queens and states
maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
this viperous slander enters what cheer madam
to lie in watch there and to think on him
to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature
to break it with a fearful dream of him
and cry myself awake that's false to's bed
is it
pisanio alas good lady
imogen i false thy conscience witness iachimo
thou didst accuse him of incontinency
thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
poor i am stale a garment out of fashion
and for i am richer than to hang by th' walls
i must be ripp'd to pieces with me o
mens vows are womens traitors all good seeming
by thy revolt o husband shall be thought
put on for villainy not born where't grows
but worn a bait for ladies
pisanio good madam hear me
were in his time thought false and sinons weeping
did scandal many a holy tear took pity
from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus
wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
from thy great fail come fellow be thou honest
do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him
a little witness my obedience look
i draw the sword myself take it and hit
fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief
thy master is not there who was indeed
the riches of it do his bidding strike
thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
but now thou seem'st a coward
pisanio hence vile instrument
thou shalt not damn my hand
imogen why i must die
and if i do not by thy hand thou art
there is a prohibition so divine
that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart
something's afore't soft soft we'll no defence
obedient as the scabbard what is here
the scriptures of the loyal leonatus
all turnd to heresy away away
corrupters of my faith you shall no more
be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools
believe false teachers though those that are betray'd
stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus
that didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the king
my father and make me put into contempt the suits
of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
it is no act of common passage but
a strain of rareness and i grieve myself
to think when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
that now thou tirest on how thy memory
will then be pang'd by me prithee dispatch
thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
when i desire it too
pisanio o gracious lady
since i receiv'd command to do this busines
i have not slept one wink
imogen do't and to bed then
pisanio i'll wake mine eyeballs first
imogen wherefore then
didst undertake it why hast thou abus'd
mine action and thine own our horses' labour
the time inviting thee the perturb'd court
for my being absent whereunto i never
purpose return why hast thou gone so far
to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
th' elected deer before thee
pisanio but to win time
to lose so bad employment in the which
i have consider'd of a course good lady
imogen talk thy tongue weary speak
i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear
therein false struck can take no greater wound
nor tent to bottom that but speak
pisanio then madam
i thought you would not back again
imogen most like
bringing me here to kill me
pisanio not so neither
my purpose would prove well it cannot be
but that my master is abus'd some villain
ay and singular in his art hath done you both
this cursed injury
imogen some roman courtezan
pisanio no on my life
i'll give but notice you are dead and send him
some bloody sign of it for 'tis commanded
i should do so you shall be miss'd at court
imogen why good fellow
what shall i do the while where bide how live
or in my life what comfort when i am
dead to my husband
pisanio if you'll back to th' court
imogen no court no father nor no more ado
with that harsh noble simple nothing
that cloten whose love suit hath been to me
as fearful as a siege
then not in britain must you bide
imogen where then
hath britain all the sun that shines day night
are they not but in britain i' th' world's volume
our britain seems as of it but not int
in a great pool a swans nest prithee think
there's livers out of britain
pisanio i am most glad
you think of other place th' ambassador
to morrow now if you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is and but disguise
that which t' appear itself must not yet be
but by self danger you should tread a course
pretty and full of view yea happily near
the residence of posthumus so nigh at least
that though his actions were not visible yet
report should render him hourly to your ear
as truly as he moves
though peril to my modesty not death ont
i would adventure
pisanio well then here's the point
you must forget to be a woman change
command into obedience fear and niceness
the handmaids of all women or more truly
woman it pretty self into a waggish courage
ready in gibes quick answer'd saucy and
as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
exposing it but o the harder heart
alack no remedy to the greedy touch
of common kissing titan and forget
your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
you made great juno angry
imogen nay be brief
i see into thy end and am almost
a man already
pisanio first make yourself but like one
'tis in my cloak bag doublet hat hose all
that answer to them would you in their serving
and with what imitation you can borrow
from youth of such a season fore noble lucius
present yourself desire his service tell him
wherein you're happy which will make him know
if that his head have ear in music doubtless
with joy he will embrace you for he's honourable
and doubling that most holy your means abroad
beginning nor supplyment
imogen thou art all the comfort
the gods will diet me with prithee away
there's more to be consider'd but we'll even
all that good time will give us this attempt
i am soldier to and will abide it with
a prince's courage away i prithee
pisanio well madam we must take a short farewell
lest being miss'd i be suspected of
here is a box i had it from the queen
what's int is precious if you are sick at sea
or stomach qualm'd at land a dram of this
will drive away distemper to some shade
and fit you to your manhood may the gods
direct you to the best

queen he goes hence frowning but it honours us
that we have given him cause
cloten 'tis all the better
your valiant britons have their wishes in it

the pow'rs that he already hath in gallia
will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves
his war for britain
queen 'tis not sleepy business
but must be look'd to speedily and strongly
cymbeline our expectation that it would be thus
hath made us forward but my gentle queen
where is our daughter she hath not appear'd
before the roman nor to us hath tender'd
a thing more made of malice than of duty
we have noted it call her before us for
we have been too slight in sufferance exit a messenger
queen royal sir
since the exile of posthumus most retir'd
hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
'tis time must do beseech your majesty
forbear sharp speeches to her she's a lady
so tender of rebukes that words are strokes
re enter messenger
cymbeline where is she sir how
can her contempt be answer'd
messenger please you sir
her chambers are all lock'd and there's no answer
that will be given to th' loud of noise we make
queen my lord when last i went to visit her
she pray'd me to excuse her keeping close
whereto constraind by her infirmity
which daily she was bound to proffer this
she wish'd me to make known but our great court
made me to blame in memory

cloten that man of hers pisanio her old servant
i have not seen these two days
pisanio thou that stand'st so for posthumus
he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence
proceed by swallowing that for he believes
it is a thing most precious but for her
where is she gone haply despair hath seiz'd her
or wing'd with fervour of her love she's flown
to her desir'd posthumus gone she is
to death or to dishonour and my end
can make good use of either she being down

and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
the best she hath and she of all compounded
outsells them all i love her therefore but
disdaining me and throwing favours on
the low posthumus slanders so her judgment
that what's else rare is chok'd and in that point
i will conclude to hate her nay indeed
to be reveng'd upon her for when fools
empty
enter pisanio
come hither ah you precious pander villain
where is thy lady in a word or else
thou art straightway with the fiends
pisanio o good my lord

safe mayst thou wander safe return again
cloten sirrah is this letter true
pisanio sir as i think
cloten it is posthumus' hand i know't sirrah if thou wouldst
not be a villain but do me true service undergo those
employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a
serious industry that is what villainy soe'er i bid thee do to
thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice
for thy preferment
pisanio well my good lord
cloten wilt thou serve me for since patiently and constantly thou
hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus thou
canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower
of mine wilt thou serve me

cloten meet thee at milford haven i forgot to ask him one thing
i'll remember't anon even there thou villain posthumus will i
kill thee i would these garments were come she said upon a
time the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart that she
and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities
with that suit upon my back will i ravish her first kill him
and in her eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my speech of
insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined
which as i say to vex her i will execute in the clothes that
she so prais'd to the court i'll knock her back foot her home
again she hath despis'd me rejoicingly and i'll be merry in my

voluntary mute to my design be but duteous and true preferment

above him in birth alike conversant in general services and
more remarkable in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite what mortality is posthumus thy
head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this
hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces
who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage but my
mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my
commendations my horse is tied up safe out sword and to a
sore purpose fortune put them into my hand this is the very
description of their meeting place and the fellow dares not

scene ii
wales before the cave of belarius
enter from the cave belarius guiderius arviragus and imogen
we'll come to you after hunting
arviragus to imogen brother stay here
are we not brothers
imogen so man and man should be
but clay and clay differs in dignity
whose dust is both alike i am very sick
guiderius go you to hunting i'll abide with him
imogen so sick i am not yet i am not well
but not so citizen a wanton as
stick to your journal course the breach of custom
is breach of all i am ill but your being by me
cannot amend me society is no comfort
to one not sociable i am not very sick
since i can reason of it pray you trust me here
i'll rob none but myself and let me die
stealing so poorly
guiderius i love thee i have spoke it
how much the quantity the weight as much
belarius what how how
arviragus if it be sin to say so sir i yoke me
in my good brother's fault i know not why
i love this youth and i have heard you say
love's reasons without reason the bier at door
and a demand who is't shall die i'd say
'my father not this youth'
belarius aside o noble strain
o worthiness of nature breed of greatness
nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
i'm not their father yet who this should be
doth miracle itself lov'd before me
'tis the ninth hour o' th' morn
arviragus brother farewell
imogen i wish ye sport
arviragus your health to belarius so please you sir
imogen aside these are kind creatures gods what lies i have
empty
experience o thou disprov'st report
th' imperious seas breed monsters for the dish
poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
i am sick still heart sick pisanio
i'll now taste of thy drug swallows some
guiderius i could not stir him
he said he was gentle but unfortunate
dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
arviragus thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
belarius to th' field to th' field
we'll leave you for this time go in and rest
arviragus we'll not be long away
belarius pray be not sick
for you must be our huswife
imogen well or ill
i am bound to you
belarius and shalt be ever exit imogen into the cave
this youth howe'er distress'd appears he hath had
arviragus how angel like he sings
guiderius but his neat cookery he cut our roots in characters
and sauc'd our broths as juno had been sick
and he her dieter
arviragus nobly he yokes
a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
was that it was for not being such a smile
the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
from so divine a temple to commix
guiderius i do note
that grief and patience rooted in him both
mingle their spurs together
arviragus grow patience
and let the stinking elder grief untwine
his perishing root with the increasing vine
belarius it is great morning come away who's there
enter cloten
cloten i cannot find those runagates that villain
belarius those runagates
means he not us i partly know him 'tis
cloten the son o' th' queen i fear some ambush
i saw him not these many years and yet
i know 'tis he we are held as outlaws hence
guiderius he is but one you and my brother search
what companies are near pray you away
let me alone with him exeunt belarius and arviragus
cloten soft what are you
i have heard of such what slave art thou
guiderius a thing
more slavish did i ne'er than answering
'a slave' without a knock
cloten thou art a robber
a law breaker a villain yield thee thief
guiderius to who to thee what art thou have not i
an arm as big as thine a heart as big
thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not
why i should yield to thee
cloten thou villain base
know'st me not by my clothes
guiderius no nor thy tailor rascal
who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
which as it seems make thee
cloten thou precious varlet
my tailor made them not
guiderius hence then and thank
i am loath to beat thee
cloten thou injurious thief
hear but my name and tremble
guiderius what's thy name
cloten cloten thou villain
guiderius cloten thou double villain be thy name
i cannot tremble at it were it toad or adder spider
'twould move me sooner
cloten to thy further fear
i am son to th' queen
guiderius i'm sorry for't not seeming
so worthy as thy birth
cloten art not afeard
guiderius those that i reverence those i fear the wise
at fools i laugh not fear them
cloten die the death
when i have slain thee with my proper hand
i'll follow those that even now fled hence
yield rustic mountaineer exeunt fighting
re enter belarius and arviragus
belarius no company's abroad
arviragus none in the world you did mistake him sure
belarius i cannot tell long is it since i saw him
but time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
which then he wore the snatches in his voice
and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute
'twas very cloten
i wish my brother make good time with him
you say he is so fell
belarius being scarce made up
i mean to man he had not apprehension
or roaring terrors for defect of judgment
is oft the cease of fear
re enter guiderius with clotens head
but see thy brother
guiderius this cloten was a fool an empty purse
could have knock'd out his brains for he had none
yet i not doing this the fool had borne
my head as i do his
belarius what hast thou done
guiderius i am perfect what cut off one clotens head
son to the queen after his own report
who calld me traitor mountaineer and swore
with his own single hand he'd take us in
displace our heads where thank the gods they grow
belarius we are all undone
guiderius why worthy father what have we to lose
but that he swore to take our lives the law
protects not us then why should we be tender
to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
play judge and executioner all himself
for we do fear the law what company
discover you abroad
belarius no single soul
he must have some attendants though his humour
was nothing but mutation ay and that
from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
absolute madness could so far have rav'd
to bring him here alone although perhaps
it may be heard at court that such as we
cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
may make some stronger head the which he hearing
as it is like him might break out and swear
to come alone either he so undertaking
or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
if we do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head
arviragus let ordinance
come as the gods foresay it howsoe'er
my brother hath done well
belarius i had no mind
to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness
guiderius with his own sword
which he did wave against my throat i have ta'en
his head from him i'll throw't into the creek
behind our rock and let it to the sea
and tell the fishes he's the queens son cloten
that's all i reck exit
belarius i fear'twill be reveng'd
would polydore thou hadst not done't though valour
becomes thee well enough
so the revenge alone pursu'd me polydore
i love thee brotherly but envy much
thou hast robb'd me of this deed i would revenges
that possible strength might meet would seek us through
and put us to our answer
belarius well 'tis done
we'll hunt no more to day nor seek for danger
where there's no profit i prithee to our rock
you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay
to dinner presently
arviragus poor sick fidele
i'll willingly to him to gain his colour
i'd let a parish of such clotens blood
and praise myself for charity exit
belarius o thou goddess
thou divine nature thou thyself thou blazonst
in these two princely boys they are as gentle
as zephyrs blowing below the violet
their royal blood enchaf'd as the rud'st wind
that by the top doth take the mountain pine
and make him stoop to th' vale 'tis wonder
that an invisible instinct should frame them
to royalty unlearnd honour untaught
civility not seen from other valour
that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
as if it had been sow'd yet still it's strange
what clotens being here to us portends
re enter guiderius
guiderius where's my brother
i have sent clotens clotpoll down the stream
in embassy to his mother his body's hostage
for his return solemn music
belarius my ingenious instrument
hark polydore it sounds but what occasion
hath cadwal now to give it motion hark
guiderius is he at home
guiderius what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother
it did not speak before all solemn things
should answer solemn accidents the matter
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
is jollity for apes and grief for boys
is cadwal mad
re enter arviragus with imogen as dead bearing
her in his arms
belarius look here he comes
of what we blame him for
arviragus the bird is dead
that we have made so much on i had rather
have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
to have turnd my leaping time into a crutch
than have seen this
guiderius o sweetest fairest lily
my brother wears thee not the one half so well
as when thou grew'st thyself
who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
might'st easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing
jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i
thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
how found you him
arviragus stark as you see
thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber
not as death's dart being laugh'd at his right cheek
guiderius where
arviragus o' th' floor
his arms thus leagu'd i thought he slept and put
my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
answer'd my steps too loud
guiderius why he but sleeps
if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
and worms will not come to thee
whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
the azur'd hare bell like thy veins no nor
the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
out sweet'ned not thy breath the ruddock would
with charitable bill o bill sore shaming
those rich left heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this
to winter ground thy corse
guiderius prithee have done
and do not play in wench like words with that
which is so serious let us bury him
and not protract with admiration what
is now due debt to th' grave
arviragus say where shalls lay him
guiderius by good euriphile our mother
arviragus be't so
have got the mannish crack sing him to th' ground
as once to our mother use like note and words
save that euriphile must be fidele
guiderius cadwal
i cannot sing i'll weep and word it with thee
for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
than priests and fanes that lie
arviragus we'll speak it then
belarius great griefs i see med'cine the less for cloten
and though he came our enemy remember
he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting
together have one dust yet reverence
that angel of the world doth make distinction
of place 'tween high and low our foe was princely
and though you took his life as being our foe
yet bury him as a prince
guiderius pray you fetch him hither
thersites' body is as good as ajax'
arviragus if you'll go fetch him
we'll say our song the whilst brother begin
exit belarius
guiderius nay cadwal we must lay his head to th' east
my father hath a reason for't
arviragus 'tis true
guiderius come on then and remove him
arviragus so begin
empty
nor the furious winter's rages
thou thy worldly task hast done
home art gone and ta'en thy wages
golden lads and girls all must
as chimney sweepers come to dust
arviragus fear no more the frown o' th' great
thou art past the tyrant's stroke
care no more to clothe and eat
to thee the reed is as the oak
all follow this and come to dust
guiderius fear no more the lightning flash
arviragus nor th' all dreaded thunder stone
guiderius fear not slander censure rash
arviragus thou hast finish'd joy and moan
both all lovers young all lovers must
consign to thee and come to dust
guiderius no exorciser harm thee
arviragus nor no witchcraft charm thee
arviragus nothing ill come near thee
both quiet consummation have
and renowned be thy grave
re enter belarius with the body of cloten
guiderius we have done our obsequies come lay him down
belarius here's a few flowers but 'bout midnight more
the herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night
are strewings fit'st for graves upon their faces
you were as flow'rs now wither'd even so
come on away apart upon our knees
the ground that gave them first has them again
their pleasures here are past so is their pain

imogen awaking yes sir to milford haven which is the way
i thank you by yond bush pray how far thither
'ods pittikins can it be six mile yet
i have gone all night faith i'll lie down and sleep
but soft no bedfellow o gods and goddesses
these flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world
this bloody man the care ont i hope i dream
for so i thought i was a cave keeper
and cook to honest creatures but 'tis not so
'twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing
which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes
are sometimes like our judgments blind good faith
i tremble still with fear but if there be
yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
the dream's here still even when i wake it is
without me as within me not imagind felt
a headless man the garments of posthumus
i know the shape of's leg this is his hand
his foot mercurial his martial thigh
the brawns of hercules but his jovial face
murder in heaven how 'tis gone pisanio
all curses madded hecuba gave the greeks
and mine to boot be darted on thee thou
hath here cut off my lord to write and read

hath with his forged letters damnd pisanio
from this most bravest vessel of the world

where is thy head where's that ay me where's that
pisanio might have killd thee at the heart
and left this head on how should this be pisanio
'tis he and cloten malice and lucre in them

and cordial to me have i not found it
murd'rous to th' senses that confirms it home

lucius this forwardness
makes our hopes fair command our present numbers
be muster'd bid the captains look to't now sir
what have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose
soothsayer last night the very gods show'd me a vision
i fast and pray'd for their intelligence thus
i saw jove's bird the roman eagle wing'd
from the spongy south to this part of the west
unless my sins abuse my divination
success to th' roman host
lucius dream often so
and never false soft ho what trunk is here
without his top the ruin speaks that sometime
it was a worthy building how a page
or dead or sleeping on him but dead rather
for nature doth abhor to make his bed
with the defunct or sleep upon the dead
captain he's alive my lord
lucius he'll then instruct us of this body young one
inform us of thy fortunes for it seems
they crave to be demanded who is this
thou mak'st thy bloody pillow or who was he
that otherwise than noble nature did
hath alter'd that good picture what's thy interest
in this sad wreck how came't who is't what art thou
imogen i am nothing or if not
a very valiant briton and a good
that here by mountaineers lies slain alas
there is no more such masters i may wander
from east to occident cry out for service
try many all good serve truly never
find such another master
lucius 'lack good youth
thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than
thy master in bleeding say his name good friend
no harm by it though the gods hear i hope
they'll pardon it say you sir
lucius thy name
imogen fidele sir
lucius thou dost approve thyself the very same
thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
wilt take thy chance with me i will not say
thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure
no less belov'd the roman emperor's letters
than thine own worth prefer thee go with me
imogen i'll follow sir but first ant please the gods
i'll hide my master from the flies as deep
as these poor pickaxes can dig and when
with wild wood leaves and weeds i ha' strew'd his grave
and on it said a century of prayers
such as i can twice o'er i'll weep and sigh
and leaving so his service follow you
so please you entertain me
and rather father thee than master thee
my friends
the boy hath taught us manly duties let us
find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
and make him with our pikes and partisans

a fever with the absence of her son
a madness of which her life's in danger heavens
how deeply you at once do touch me imogen
the great part of my comfort gone my queen
upon a desperate bed and in a time
so needful for this present it strikes me past
the hope of comfort but for thee fellow
who needs must know of her departure and
dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee
by a sharp torture
pisanio sir my life is yours
i humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
i nothing know where she remains why gone
nor when she purposes return beseech your highness
lord good my liege
the day that she was missing he was here
i dare be bound he's true and shall perform
all parts of his subjection loyally for cloten
there wants no diligence in seeking him
and will no doubt be found
cymbeline the time is troublesome
to pisanio we'll slip you for a season but our jealousy
does yet depend
the roman legions all from gallia drawn
are landed on your coast with a supply
of roman gentlemen by the senate sent
cymbeline now for the counsel of my son and queen
i am amaz'd with matter
lord good my liege
your preparation can affront no less
than what you hear of come more for more you're ready
the want is but to put those pow'rs in motion
cymbeline i thank you let's withdraw
and meet the time as it seeks us we fear not
what can from italy annoy us but
we grieve at chances here away exeunt all but pisanio
pisanio i heard no letter from my master since
i wrote him imogen was slain 'tis strange
nor hear i from my mistress who did promise
to yield me often tidings neither know
what is betid to cloten but remain
wherein i am false i am honest not true to be true
these present wars shall find i love my country
even to the note o' th' king or i'll fall in them
all other doubts by time let them be clear'd

wales before the cave of belarius
enter belarius guiderius and arviragus
guiderius the noise is round about us
arviragus what pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
from action and adventure
guiderius nay what hope
have we in hiding us this way the romans
must or for britons slay us or receive us
for barbarous and unnatural revolts
during their use and slay us after
belarius sons
we'll higher to the mountains there secure us
of clotens death we being not known not muster'd
among the bands may drive us to a render
where we have liv'd and so extort from's that
which we have done whose answer would be death
drawn on with torture
guiderius this is sir a doubt
in such a time nothing becoming you
nor satisfying us
arviragus it is not likely
behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes
and ears so cloy'd importantly as now
that they will waste their time upon our note
to know from whence we are
belarius o i am known
of many in the army many years
though cloten then but young you see not wore him
from my remembrance and besides the king
hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves
the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
to have the courtesy your cradle promis'd
but to be still hot summer's tanlings and
the shrinking slaves of winter
guiderius than be so
better to cease to be pray sir to th' army
i and my brother are not known yourself
so out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown
cannot be questioned
i'll thither what thing is't that i never
did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood
but that of coward hares hot goats and venison
never bestrid a horse save one that had
a rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel
nor iron on his heel i am asham'd
to look upon the holy sun to have
the benefit of his blest beams remaining
so long a poor unknown
if you will bless me sir and give me leave
i'll take the better care but if you will not
the hazard therefore due fall on me by
the hands of romans
arviragus so say i amen
belarius no reason i since of your lives you set

posthumus i did
though you it seems come from the fliers
lord i did

but that the heavens fought the king himself
and but the backs of britons seen an flying
through a strait lane the enemy full hearted
lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work
more plentiful than tools to do't struck down
some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
merely through fear that the strait pass was damm'd
with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
to die with length'ned shame
lord where was this lane
which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
an honest one i warrant who deserv'd
so long a breeding as his white beard came to
in doing this for's country athwart the lane
he with two striplings lads more like to run
the country base than to commit such slaughter
with faces fit for masks or rather fairer
than those for preservation cas'd or shame

'tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coind it
'tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
though light take pieces for the figure's sake
you rather mine being yours and so great pow'rs
and cancel these cold bonds o imogen
i'll speak to thee in silence sleeps
solemn music enter as in an apparition sicilius
leonatus father to posthumus an old man attired
like a warrior leading in his hand an ancient
matron his wife and mother to posthumus with
music before them then after other music follows
the two young leonati brothers to posthumus
with wounds as they died in the wars
sicilius no more thou thunder master show
thy spite on mortal flies
with mars fall out with juno chide
that thy adulteries
rates and revenges
hath my poor boy done aught but well
whose face i never saw
i died whilst in the womb he stay'd
attending nature's law
thou orphans' father art
thou shouldst have been and shielded him
from this earth vexing smart
mother lucina lent not me her aid
but took me in my throes
that from me was posthumus ripp'd
came crying 'mongst his foes
a thing of pity
sicilius great nature like his ancestry
that he deserv'd the praise o' th' world
as great sicilius' heir
first brother when once he was mature for man
in britain where was he
that could stand up his parallel
or fruitful object be
in eye of imogen that best
could deem his dignity
mother with marriage wherefore was he mock'd
from leonati seat and cast
from her his dearest one
sweet imogen
sicilius why did you suffer iachimo
slight thing of italy
to taint his nobler heart and brain
with needless jealousy
and to become the geck and scorn
o' th' other's villainy
our parents and us twain
that striking in our country's cause
fell bravely and were slain
our fealty and tenantius' right
with honour to maintain
first brother like hardiment posthumus hath
to cymbeline perform'd
then jupiter thou king of gods
why hast thou thus adjournd
being all to dolours turnd
sicilius thy crystal window ope look out
no longer exercise
upon a valiant race thy harsh
and potent injuries
mother since jupiter our son is good
take off his miseries
sicilius peep through thy marble mansion help
or we poor ghosts will cry
against thy deity
brothers help jupiter or we appeal
and from thy justice fly
jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting
upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt the ghosts
fall on their knees
jupiter no more you petty spirits of region low
offend our hearing hush how dare you ghosts
accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
poor shadows of elysium hence and rest
upon your never withering banks of flow'rs
be not with mortal accidents opprest
no care of yours it is you know 'tis ours
whom best i love i cross to make my gift
the more delay'd delighted be content
your low laid son our godhead will uplift
his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
our jovial star reignd at his birth and in
he shall be lord of lady imogen
and happier much by his affliction made
this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
and so away no farther with your din
express impatience lest you stir up mine
mount eagle to my palace crystalline ascends
sicilius he came in thunder his celestial breath
was sulpherous to smell the holy eagle
more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
as when his god is pleas'd
all thanks jupiter
sicilius the marble pavement closes he is enter'd
his radiant roof away and to be blest
let us with care perform his great behest ghosts vanish
posthumus waking sleep thou has been a grandsire and begot
a father to me and thou hast created
gone they went hence so soon as they were born
and so i am awake poor wretches that depend
on greatness' favour dream as i have done
wake and find nothing but alas i swerve
many dream not to find neither deserve
and yet are steep'd in favours so am i
that have this golden chance and know not why
what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one
be not as is our fangled world a garment
so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
as good as promise
reads 'when as a lions whelp shall to himself unknown
without seeking find and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air
and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches which
being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old
stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries
britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty'
'tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
or senseless speaking or a speaking such
as sense cannot untie be what it is
the action of my life is like it which
i'll keep if but for sympathy
re enter gaoler
gaoler come sir are you ready for death
posthumus over roasted rather ready long ago
gaoler hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are
well cook'd
pays the shot
gaoler a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is you
shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills
which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth
you come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much
drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are
paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier
for being too light the purse too light being drawn of
heaviness o of this contradiction you shall now be quit o the
have no true debitor and creditor but it of what's past is and
to come the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
counters so the acquittance follows
posthumus i am merrier to die than thou art to live
gaoler indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache but a
man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to
bed i think he would change places with his officer for look
you sir you know not which way you shall go
posthumus yes indeed do i fellow
pictur'd you must either be directed by some that take upon them
to know or to take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not
know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you
shall speed in your journey's end i think you'll never return to
tell one
posthumus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct
them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them
gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the
best use of eyes to see the way of blindness i am sure hanging's
enter a messenger
messenger knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
posthumus thou bring'st good news i am calld to be made free
gaoler i'll be hang'd then
posthumus thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the
dead exeunt posthumus and messenger
gaoler unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets
i never saw one so prone yet on my conscience there are verier
knaves desire to live for all he be a roman and there be some
one i would we were all of one mind and one mind good o there
were desolation of gaolers and gallowses i speak against my
present profit but my wish hath a preferment int exit
scene v
britain cymbeline's tent
enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus pisanio lords
officers and attendants
cymbeline stand by my side you whom the gods have made
preservers of my throne woe is my heart
whose rags sham'd gilded arms whose naked breast
stepp'd before targes of proof cannot be found
he shall be happy that can find him if
our grace can make him so
belarius i never saw
such noble fury in so poor a thing
such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought
but beggary and poor looks
cymbeline no tidings of him
but no trace of him
cymbeline to my grief i am
the heir of his reward to belarius guiderius and arviragus
which i will add
to you the liver heart and brain of britain
by whom i grant she lives 'tis now the time
to ask of whence you are report it
belarius sir
in cambria are we born and gentlemen
unless i add we are honest
cymbeline bow your knees
arise my knights o' th' battle i create you
companions to our person and will fit you
with dignities becoming your estates
enter cornelius and ladies
there's business in these faces why so sadly
greet you our victory you look like romans
and not o' th' court of britain
to sour your happiness i must report
the queen is dead
cymbeline who worse than a physician
would this report become but i consider
by med'cine'life may be prolong'd yet death
will seize the doctor too how ended she
cornelius with horror madly dying like her life
which being cruel to the world concluded
most cruel to herself what she confess'd
can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks
were present when she finish'd
cymbeline prithee say
cornelius first she confess'd she never lov'd you only
affected greatness got by you not you
married your royalty was wife to your place
abhorr'd your person
cymbeline she alone knew this
and but she spoke it dying i would not
cornelius your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
with such integrity she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
but that her flight prevented it she had
ta'en off by poison
cymbeline o most delicate fiend
who is't can read a woman is there more
cornelius more sir and worse she did confess she had
for you a mortal mineral which being took
by inches waste you in which time she purpos'd
by watching weeping tendance kissing to
o'ercome you with her show and in time
when she had fitted you with her craft to work
her son into th' adoption of the crown
but failing of her end by his strange absence
grew shameless desperate opend in despite
of heaven and men her purposes repented
the evils she hatch'd were not effected so
cymbeline heard you all this her women
lady we did so please your highness
cymbeline mine eyes
were not in fault for she was beautiful
mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
that thought her like her seeming it had been vicious
to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
that it was folly in me thou mayst say
and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all
roman prisoners guarded posthumus behind and imogen
thou com'st not caius now for tribute that
the britons have raz'd out though with the loss
of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
that their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter
of you their captives which ourself have granted
so think of your estate
lucius consider sir the chance of war the day
was yours by accident had it gone with us
our prisoners with the sword but since the gods
will have it thus that nothing but our lives
may be calld ransom let it come sufficeth
a roman with a romans heart can suffer
augustus lives to think ont and so much
for my peculiar care this one thing only
i will entreat my boy a briton born
let him be ransom'd never master had
a page so kind so duteous diligent
so feat so nurse like let his virtue join
with my request which i'll make bold your highness
cannot deny he hath done no briton harm
though he have serv'd a roman save him sir
and spare no blood beside
cymbeline i have surely seen him
his favour is familiar to me boy
thou hast look'd thyself into my grace
and art mine own i know not why wherefore
and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt
fitting my bounty and thy state i'll give it
yea though thou do demand a prisoner
the noblest ta'en
imogen i humbly thank your highness
lucius i do not bid thee beg my life good lad
and yet i know thou wilt
imogen no no alack
there's other work in hand i see a thing
must shuffle for itself
lucius the boy disdains me
he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
that place them on the truth of girls and boys
why stands he so perplex'd
cymbeline what wouldst thou boy
i love thee more and more think more and more
what's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak
wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend
than i to your highness who being born your vassal
am something nearer
cymbeline wherefore ey'st him so
imogen i'll tell you sir in private if you please
to give me hearing
cymbeline ay with all my heart
and lend my best attention what's thy name
imogen fidele sir
cymbeline thou'rt my good youth my page
cymbeline and imogen converse apart
belarius is not this boy reviv'd from death
arviragus one sand another
not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
who died and was fidele what think you
guiderius the same dead thing alive
belarius peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear
creatures may be alike were't he i am sure
he would have spoke to us
belarius be silent let's see further
pisanio aside it is my mistress
since she is living let the time run on
to good or bad cymbeline and imogen advance
cymbeline come stand thou by our side
make thy demand aloud to iachimo sir step you forth
give answer to this boy and do it freely
or by our greatness and the grace of it
which is our honour bitter torture shall
imogen my boon is that this gentleman may render
of whom he had this ring
posthumus aside what's that to him
cymbeline that diamond upon your finger say
how came it yours
iachimo thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
which to be spoke would torture thee
cymbeline how me
iachimo i am glad to be constraind to utter that
i got this ring 'twas leonatus' jewel
whom thou didst banish and which more may grieve thee
as it doth me a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
'twixt sky and ground wilt thou hear more my lord
cymbeline all that belongs to this
iachimo that paragon thy daughter
for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
quail to remember give me leave i faint
cymbeline my daughter what of her renew thy strength
than die ere i hear more strive man and speak
iachimo upon a time unhappy was the clock
that struck the hour was in rome accurs'd
the mansion where 'twas at a feast o would
our viands had been poisond or at least
those which i heav'd to head the good posthumus
what should i say he was too good to be
where ill men were and was the best of all
amongst the rar'st of good ones sitting sadly
for beauty that made barren the swelld boast
of him that best could speak for feature laming
the shrine of venus or straight pight minerva
postures beyond brief nature for condition
a shop of all the qualities that man
loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
fairness which strikes the eye
cymbeline i stand on fire
come to the matter
unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus
most like a noble lord in love and one
that had a royal lover took his hint
and not dispraising whom we prais'd therein
he was as calm as virtue he began
his mistress' picture which by his tongue being made
and then a mind put int either our brags
were crack'd of kitchen trulls or his description
prov'd us unspeaking sots
iachimo your daughter's chastity there it begins
he spake of her as dian had hot dreams
and she alone were cold whereat i wretch
made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
upon his honour'd finger to attain
in suit the place of's bed and win this ring
by hers and mine adultery he true knight
no lesser of her honour confident
and would so had it been a carbuncle
of phoebus' wheel and might so safely had it
been all the worth of's car away to britain
post i in this design well may you sir
remember me at court where i was taught
of your chaste daughter the wide difference
'twixt amorous and villainous being thus quench'd
of hope not longing mine italian brain
gan in your duller britain operate
and to be brief my practice so prevaild
that i returnd with simular proof enough
to make the noble leonatus mad
by wounding his belief in her renown
with tokens thus and thus averring notes
of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet
o cunning how i got it nay some marks
of secret on her person that he could not
but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
methinks i see him now
posthumus coming forward ay so thou dost
italian fiend ay me most credulous fool
egregious murderer thief anything
that's due to all the villains past in being
to come o give me cord or knife or poison
some upright justicer thou king send out
for torturers ingenious it is i
that all th' abhorred things o' th' earth amend
that killd thy daughter villain like i lie
that caus'd a lesser villain than myself
a sacrilegious thief to do't the temple
of virtue was she yea and she herself
spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
the dogs o' th' street to bay me every villain
be calld posthumus leonatus and
be villainy less than 'twas o imogen
my queen my life my wife o imogen
imogen peace my lord hear hear
posthumus shalls have a play of this thou scornful page
there lies thy part strikes her she falls
pisanio o gentlemen help
mine and your mistress o my lord posthumus
you ne'er killd imogen till now help help
mine honour'd lady
cymbeline does the world go round
posthumus how comes these staggers on me
cymbeline if this be so the gods do mean to strike me
to death with mortal joy
pisanio how fares my mistress
imogen o get thee from my sight
thou gav'st me poison dangerous fellow hence
breathe not where princes are
cymbeline the tune of imogen
pisanio lady
the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
a precious thing i had it from the queen
cymbeline new matter still
imogen it poisond me
cornelius o gods
i left out one thing which the queen confess'd
which must approve thee honest 'if pisanio
have' said she 'given his mistress that confection
which i gave him for cordial she is serv'd
as i would serve a rat'
cornelius the queen sir very oft importund me
to temper poisons for her still pretending
the satisfaction of her knowledge only
in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
of no esteem i dreading that her purpose
was of more danger did compound for her
a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
the present pow'r of life but in short time
all offices of nature should again
imogen most like i did for i was dead
belarius my boys
there was our error
guiderius this is sure fidele
imogen why did you throw your wedded lady from you
think that you are upon a rock and now
throw me again embracing him
posthumus hang there like fruit my soul
till the tree die
what mak'st thou me a dullard in this act
wilt thou not speak to me
imogen kneeling your blessing sir
belarius to guiderius and arviragus though you did love this
youth i blame ye not
you had a motive for't
cymbeline my tears that fall
prove holy water on thee imogen
thy mother's dead
cymbeline o she was naught and long of her it was
that we meet here so strangely but her son
is gone we know not how nor where
pisanio my lord
now fear is from me i'll speak troth lord cloten
upon my lady's missing came to me
with his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
if i discover'd not which way she was gone
it was my instant death by accident
then in my pocket which directed him
to seek her on the mountains near to milford
where in a frenzy in my master's garments
which he enforc'd from me away he posts
with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
my lady's honour what became of him
i further know not
guiderius let me end the story
i slew him there
i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
pluck a hard sentence prithee valiant youth
deny't again
guiderius i have spoke it and i did it
cymbeline he was a prince
guiderius a most incivil one the wrongs he did me
were nothing prince like for he did provoke me
with language that would make me spurn the sea
if it could so roar to me i cut off's head
to tell this tale of mine
cymbeline i am sorry for thee
by thine own tongue thou art condemnd and must
endure our law thou'rt dead
imogen that headless man
i thought had been my lord
cymbeline bind the offender
and take him from our presence
belarius stay sir king
as well descended as thyself and hath
more of thee merited than a band of clotens
had ever scar for to the guard let his arms alone
they were not born for bondage
cymbeline why old soldier
wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
by tasting of our wrath how of descent
as good as we
arviragus in that he spake too far
belarius we will die all three
but i will prove that two ons are as good
as i have given out him my sons i must
for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
though haply well for you
arviragus your danger's ours
guiderius and our good his
belarius have at it then by leave
thou hadst great king a subject who
cymbeline what of him he is
a banish'd traitor
belarius he it is that hath
assum'd this age indeed a banish'd man
i know not how a traitor
cymbeline take him hence
the whole world shall not save him
belarius not too hot
first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
as i have receiv'd it
cymbeline nursing of my sons
belarius i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee
ere i arise i will prefer my sons
then spare not the old father mighty sir
these two young gentlemen that call me father
and think they are my sons are none of mine
they are the issue of your loins my liege
and blood of your begetting
belarius so sure as you your father's i old morgan
am that belarius whom you sometime banish'd
your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
itself and all my treason that i suffer'd
was all the harm i did these gentle princes
for such and so they are these twenty years
have i traind up those arts they have as
could put into them my breeding was sir as
your highness knows their nurse euriphile
upon my banishment i mov'd her to't
having receiv'd the punishment before
for that which i did then beaten for loyalty
excited me to treason their dear loss
the more of you 'twas felt the more it shap'd
unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir
here are your sons again and i must lose
two of the sweet'st companions in the world
the benediction of these covering heavens
to inlay heaven with stars
cymbeline thou weep'st and speak'st
the service that you three have done is more
unlike than this thou tellst i lost my children
if these be they i know not how to wish
a pair of worthier sons
belarius be pleas'd awhile
this gentleman whom i call polydore
most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius
your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
in a most curious mantle wrought by th' hand
of his queen mother which for more probation
i can with ease produce
cymbeline guiderius had
upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
it was a mark of wonder
belarius this is he
who hath upon him still that natural stamp
to be his evidence now
cymbeline o what am i
a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother
rejoic'd deliverance more blest pray you be
that after this strange starting from your orbs
you may reign in them now o imogen
thou hast lost by this a kingdom
imogen no my lord
i have got two worlds by't o my gentle brothers
but i am truest speaker you calld me brother
when i was but your sister i you brothers
when we were so indeed
cymbeline did you e'er meet
arviragus ay my good lord
guiderius and at first meeting lov'd
continu'd so until we thought he died
cornelius by the queens dram she swallow'd
cymbeline o rare instinct
hath to it circumstantial branches which
distinction should be rich in where how liv'd you
and when came you to serve our roman captive
how parted with your brothers how first met them
why fled you from the court and whither these
and your three motives to the battle with
i know not how much more should be demanded
and all the other by dependences
from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
posthumus anchors upon imogen
and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
on him her brothers me her master hitting
each object with a joy the counterchange
is severally in all let's quit this ground
and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
to belarius thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
imogen you are my father too and did relieve me
to see this gracious season
save these in bonds let them be joyful too
for they shall taste our comfort
imogen my good master
i will yet do you service
lucius happy be you
cymbeline the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
he would have well becom'd this place and grac'd
the thankings of a king
posthumus i am sir
in poor beseeming 'twas a fitment for
the purpose i then follow'd that i was he
speak iachimo i had you down and might
have made you finish
iachimo kneeling i am down again
but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
as then your force did take that life beseech you
which i so often owe but your ring first
and here the bracelet of the truest princess
posthumus kneel not to me
the pow'r that i have on you is to spare you
the malice towards you to forgive you live
and deal with others better
cymbeline nobly doom'd
we'll learn our freeness of a son in law
pardons the word to all
arviragus you holp us sir
as you did mean indeed to be our brother
posthumus your servant princes good my lord of rome
call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought
great jupiter upon his eagle back'd
appear'd to me with other spritely shows
of mine own kindred when i wak'd i found
this label on my bosom whose containing
is so from sense in hardness that i can
make no collection of it let him show
his skill in the construction
soothsayer here my good lord
lucius read and declare the meaning
soothsayer reads 'when as a lions whelp shall to himself
unknown without seeking find and be embrac'd by
a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall
be lopp'd branches which being dead many years shall
after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow
then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate
and flourish in peace and plenty'
the fit and apt construction of thy name
being leo natus doth import so much
to cymbeline the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
which we call 'mollis aer' and 'mollis aer'
we term it 'mulier' which 'mulier' i divine
is this most constant wife who even now
answering the letter of the oracle
unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about
with this most tender air
soothsayer the lofty cedar royal cymbeline
personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
thy two sons forth who by belarius stoln
for many years thought dead are now reviv'd
to the majestic cedar joind whose issue
promises britain peace and plenty
cymbeline well
my peace we will begin and caius lucius
although the victor we submit to caesar
to pay our wonted tribute from the which
we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
have laid most heavy hand
soothsayer the fingers of the pow'rs above do tune
the harmony of this peace the vision
which i made known to lucius ere the stroke
of yet this scarce cold battle at this instant
is full accomplish'd for the roman eagle
lessend herself and in the beams o' th' sun
so vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
th'imperial caesar caesar should again unite
his favour with the radiant cymbeline
which shines here in the west
cymbeline laud we the gods
and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
from our bless'd altars publish we this peace
to all our subjects set we forward let
friendly together so through lud's town march
and in the temple of great jupiter
our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
set on there never was a war did cease
ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace exeunt

is not this something more than fantasy
hor before my god i might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes
mar is it not like the king
hor as thou art to thyself
such was the very armour he had on
when he th' ambitious norway combated
so frownd he once when in an angry parle
he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
mar thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
hor in what particular thought to work i know not
but in the gross and scope of my opinion
this bodes some strange eruption to our state
mar good now sit down and tell me he that knows
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week
what might be toward that this sweaty haste
doth make the night joint labourer with the day
who is't that can inform me
hor that can i
at least the whisper goes so our last king
whose image even but now appear'd to us
was as you know by fortinbras of norway
dar'd to the combat in which our valiant hamlet
for so this side of our known world esteem'd him
did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact
well ratified by law and heraldry
did forfeit with his life all those his lands
which he stood seiz'd of to the conqueror
against the which a moiety competent
was gaged by our king which had returnd
to the inheritance of fortinbras
and carriage of the article designd
his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras
of unimproved mettle hot and full
hath in the skirts of norway here and there
shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes
for food and diet to some enterprise
that hath a stomach int which is no other
as it doth well appear unto our state
but to recover of us by strong hand
so by his father lost and this i take it
is the main motive of our preparations
the source of this our watch and the chief head
of this post haste and romage in the land
ber i think it be no other but e'en so
well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars
hor a mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
a little ere the mightiest julius fell
the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman streets
as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
disasters in the sun and the moist star
upon whose influence neptune's empire stands
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
and even the like precurse of fierce events
as harbingers preceding still the fates
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climature and countrymen
enter ghost again
but soft behold lo where it comes again
i'll cross it though it blast me stay illusion
spreads his arms
if thou hast any sound or use of voice
speak to me
if there be any good thing to be done
speak to me
if thou art privy to thy country's fate
which happily foreknowing may avoid
o speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth
for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
the cock crows
speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus
hor do if it will not stand
ber 'tis here
hor 'tis here
mar 'tis gone
exit ghost
we do it wrong being so majestical
to offer it the show of violence
for it is as the air invulnerable
and our vain blows malicious mockery
hor and then it started like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons i have heard
the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine and of the truth herein
this present object made probation
some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallow'd and so gracious is the time
hor so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us impart what we have seen to night
unto young hamlet for upon my life
this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
as needful in our loves fitting our duty
let's do't i pray and i this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt
scene ii
flourish enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet
polonius laertes and his sister ophelia voltemand cornelius
lords attendant
king though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
the memory be green and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
therefore our sometime sister now our queen
th' imperial jointress to this warlike state
have we as 'twere with a defeated joy
with an auspicious and a dropping eye
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
in equal scale weighing delight and dole
taken to wife nor have we herein barr'd
your better wisdoms which have freely gone
with this affair along for all our thanks
holding a weak supposal of our worth
or thinking by our late dear brother's death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame
colleagued with this dream of his advantage
he hath not faild to pester us with message
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father with all bands of law
to our most valiant brother so much for him
now for ourself and for this time of meeting
to norway uncle of young fortinbras
who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
of this his nephew's purpose to suppress
his further gait herein in that the levies
the lists and full proportions are all made
out of his subject and we here dispatch
you good cornelius and you voltemand
for bearers of this greeting to old norway
giving to you no further personal power
of these dilated articles allow gives a paper
farewell and let your haste commend your duty
cor volt in that and all things will we show our duty
king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
exeunt voltemand and cornelius
and now laertes what's the news with you
you told us of some suit what is't laertes
you cannot speak of reason to the dane
and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
the head is not more native to the heart
the hand more instrumental to the mouth
than is the throne of denmark to thy father
what wouldst thou have laertes
laer my dread lord
your leave and favour to return to france
from whence though willingly i came to denmark
to show my duty in your coronation
yet now i must confess that duty done
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
king have you your father's leave what says polonius
pol he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition and at last
upon his will i seald my hard consent
i do beseech you give him leave to go
king take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin hamlet and my son
king how is it that the clouds still hang on you
ham not so my lord i am too much i' th' sun
queen good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou know'st 'tis common all that lives must die
passing through nature to eternity
ham ay madam it is common
why seems it so particular with thee
ham seems madam nay it is i know not 'seems'
'tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
nor customary suits of solemn black
nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath
no nor the fruitful river in the eye
nor the dejected havior of the visage
together with all forms moods shapes of grief
'that can denote me truly these indeed seem
but i have that within which passeth show
these but the trappings and the suits of woe
king 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father
that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow but to persever
in obstinate condolement is a course
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
a heart unfortified a mind impatient
an understanding simple and unschoold
for what we know must be and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart fie 'tis a fault to heaven
a fault against the dead a fault to nature
to reason most absurd whose common theme
from the first corse till he that died to day
'this must be so' we pray you throw to earth
this unprevailing woe and think of us
as of a father for let the world take note
you are the most immediate to our throne
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son
do i impart toward you for your intent
in going back to school in wittenberg
and we beseech you bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
queen let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
ham i shall in all my best obey you madam
king why 'tis a loving and a fair reply
be as ourself in denmark madam come
this gentle and unforc'd accord of hamlet
no jocund health that denmark drinks to day
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again
respeaking earthly thunder come away

would have mournd longer married with my uncle

marcellus and bernardo on their watch
been thus encount'red a figure like your father
armed at point exactly cap a pe
appears before them and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk'd
by their oppress'd and fear surprised eyes
within his truncheons length whilst they distilld
almost to jelly with the act of fear
stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did
where as they had deliver'd both in time
form of the thing each word made true and good
the apparition comes i knew your father

ham did you not speak to it

itself to motion like as it would speak
but even then the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish'd from our sight

and we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it

scene iii
elsinore a room in the house of polonius
enter laertes and ophelia
laer my necessaries are embark'd farewell
and sister as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant do not sleep
oph do you doubt that
laer for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
a violet in the youth of primy nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and suppliance of a minute
no more
oph no more but so
laer think it no more
in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
the inward service of the mind and soul
grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will but you must fear
his greatness weigh'd his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as unvalued persons do
carve for himself for on his choice depends
and therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed which is no further
than the main voice of denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs
to his unmast'red importunity
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
and keep you in the rear of your affection
out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon
virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
the canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclos'd
contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near
oph i shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart but good my brother
do not as some ungracious pastors do
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
laer o fear me not
enter polonius
i stay too long but here my father comes
a double blessing is a double grace
occasion smiles upon a second leave
pol yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
and you are stay'd for there my blessing with thee
and these few precepts in thy memory
nor any unproportiond thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new hatch'd unfledg'd comrade beware
of entrance to a quarrel but being in
bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear but few thy voice
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
and they in france of the best rank and station
are most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all to thine own self be true
thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee
laer most humbly do i take my leave my lord
pol the time invites you go your servants tend
laer farewell ophelia and remember well
what i have said to you
oph 'tis in my memory lock'd
and you yourself shall keep the key of it
laer farewell exit
oph so please you something touching the lord hamlet
pol marry well bethought
'tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private time to you and you yourself
have of your audience been most free and bounteous
if it be so as so 'tis put on me
and that in way of caution i must tell you
you do not understand yourself so clearly
as it behooves my daughter and your honour
oph he hath my lord of late made many tenders
of his affection to me
pol affection pooh you speak like a green girl
unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them
oph i do not know my lord what i should think
pol marry i will teach you think yourself a baby
that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly
running it thus you'll tender me a fool
oph my lord he hath importund me with love
in honourable fashion
pol ay fashion you may call it go to go to
oph and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
with almost all the holy vows of heaven
pol ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
even in their promise as it is a making
you must not take for fire from this time
be something scanter of your maiden presence
set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley for lord hamlet
believe so much in him that he is young
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you in few ophelia
do not believe his vows for they are brokers
but mere implorators of unholy suits
breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
the better to beguile this is for all
i would not in plain terms from this time forth
have you so slander any moment leisure
as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look to't i charge you come your ways
oph i shall obey my lord
empty
elsinore the platform before the castle
enter hamlet horatio and marcellus
ham the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
hor it is a nipping and an eager air
ham what hour now
hor i think it lacks of twelve
mar no it is struck
hor indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
what does this mean my lord
ham the king doth wake to night and takes his rouse
keeps wassail and the swagg'ring upspring reels
and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge
hor is it a custom
ham ay marry is't
but to my mind though i am native here
more honour'd in the breach than the observance
this heavy headed revel east and west
makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations
they clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
soil our addition and indeed it takes
from our achievements though perform'd at height
the pith and marrow of our attribute
so oft it chances in particular men
that for some vicious mole of nature in them
since nature cannot choose his origin
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
the form of plausive manners that these men
carrying i say the stamp of one defect
being nature's livery or fortune's star
their virtues else be they as pure as grace
as infinite as man may undergo
from that particular fault the dram of e'il
doth all the noble substance often dout to his own scandal
enter ghost
hor look my lord it comes
ham angels and ministers of grace defend us
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
be thy intents wicked or charitable
thou com'st in such a questionable shape
king father royal dane o answer me
let me not burst in ignorance but tell
why thy canoniz'd bones hearsed in death
have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd
hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again what may this mean
that thou dead corse again in complete steel
revisits thus the glimpses of the moon
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
say why is this wherefore what should we do
ghost beckons hamlet
hor it beckons you to go away with it
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone
mar look with what courteous action
it waves you to a more removed ground
hor no by no means
ham it will not speak then will i follow it
hor do not my lord
ham why what should be the fear
i do not set my life at a pins fee
and for my soul what can it do to that
being a thing immortal as itself
it waves me forth again i'll follow it
hor what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
that beetles o'er his base into the sea
and there assume some other horrible form
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness think of it
the very place puts toys of desperation
without more motive into every brain
that looks so many fadoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath
ham it waves me still
mar you shall not go my lord
ham hold off your hands
hor be ruld you shall not go
ham my fate cries out
and makes each petty artire in this body
as hardy as the nemean lions nerve
ghost beckons
still am i calld unhand me gentlemen
by heaven i'll make a ghost of him that lets me
exeunt ghost and hamlet
hor he waxes desperate with imagination
mar let's follow 'tis not fit thus to obey him
hor have after to what issue wail this come
mar something is rotten in the state of denmark
hor heaven will direct it

ham whither wilt thou lead me speak i'll go no further
ghost mark me
ham i will
ghost my hour is almost come
when i to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
must render up myself
ham alas poor ghost
ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
ham speak i am bound to hear
ghost so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
ham what
ghost i am thy father's spirit
doom'd for a certain term to walk the night
and for the day confind to fast in fires
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purg'd away but that i am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison house
would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
thy knotted and combined locks to part
and each particular hair to stand an end
like quills upon the fretful porpentine
but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood list list o list
if thou didst ever thy dear father love
ham o god
ham murther
ghost murther most foul as in the best it is
but this most foul strange and unnatural
ham haste me to know't that i with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love
may sweep to my revenge
ghost i find thee apt
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf
'tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abus'd but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown
ham o my prophetic soul
my uncle
ghost ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
o wicked wit and gifts that have the power
so to seduce won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming virtuous queen
o hamlet what a falling off was there
from me whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
so lust though to a radiant angel link'd
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage
but soft methinks i scent the morning air
brief let me be sleeping within my orchard
my custom always of the afternoon
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial
the leperous distilment whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilverr it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body
and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
and curd like eager droppings into milk
the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
and a most instant tetter bark'd about
most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust
thus was i sleeping by a brother's hand
of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
unhous'led disappointed unaneld
no reckoning made but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head
ham o horrible o horrible most horrible
ghost if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
let not the royal bed of denmark be
but howsoever thou pursuest this act
taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
to prick and sting her fare thee well at once
the glowworm shows the matin to be near
and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
adieu adieu adieu remember me exit
ham o all you host of heaven o earth what else
and you my sinews grow not instant old
but bear me stiffly up remember thee
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe remember thee
yea from the table of my memory
i'll wipe away all trivial fond records
all saws of books all forms all pressures past
that youth and observation copied there
and thy commandment all alone shall live
unmix'd with baser matter yes by heaven
o most pernicious woman
o villain villain smiling damned villain
my tables meet it is i set it down
that one may smile and smile and be a villain
at least i am sure it may be so in denmark writes
so uncle there you are now to my word
it is 'adieu adieu remember me'

or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
as 'well well we know' or 'we could an if we would'
or 'if we list to speak' or 'there be an if they might'
that you know aught of me this is not to do
so grace and mercy at your most need help you

with all my love i do commend me to you
and what so poor a man as hamlet is
may do t' express his love and friending to you

pol give him this money and these notes reynaldo
pol you shall do marvells wisely good reynaldo
before you visit him to make inquire
of his behaviour
rey my lord i did intend it
pol marry well said very well said look you sir
enquire me first what danskers are in paris
and how and who what means and where they keep
what company at what expense and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
than your particular demands will touch it
take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him
as thus 'i know his father and his friends
and in part him' do you mark this reynaldo
rey ay very well my lord
pol 'and in part him but' you may say 'not well
but if't be he i mean he's very wild
addicted so and so' and there put on him
what forgeries you please marry none so rank
but sir such wanton wild and usual slips
as are companions noted and most known
to youth and liberty
rey as gaming my lord
pol ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
drabbing you may go so far
rey my lord that would dishonour him
pol faith no as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him
that's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
a savageness in unreclaimed blood
of general assault
rey but my good lord
pol wherefore should you do this
rey ay my lord
i would know that
and i believe it is a fetch of warrant
you laying these slight sullies on my son
as 'twere a thing a little soild i' th' working

'good sir' or so or 'friend' or 'gentleman
of man and country

pol and then sir does 'a this 'a does what was i about to say
by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave

there was 'a gaming there o'ertook ins rouse
there falling out at tennis' or perchance
'i saw him enter such a house of sale'
videlicet a brothel or so forth
see you now
your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach
with windlasses and with assays of bias
by indirections find directions out

enter ophelia
how now ophelia what's the matter
oph o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted
pol with what i' th' name of god i
oph my lord as i was sewing in my closet
lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac'd
no hat upon his head his stockings fould
ungart'red and down gyved to his ankle
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors he comes before me
pol mad for thy love
oph my lord i do not know
but truly i do fear it
pol what said he
oph he took me by the wrist and held me hard
then goes he to the length of all his arm
and with his other hand thus o'er his brow
as he would draw it long stay'd he so
at last a little shaking of mine arm
and thrice his head thus waving up and down
he rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being that done he lets me go
and with his head over his shoulder turnd
he seem'd to find his way without his eyes
for out o' doors he went without their help
pol come go with me i will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures i am sorry
what have you given him any hard words of late
oph no my good lord but as you did command
i did repel his letters and denied
pol that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him i fear'd he did but trifle
and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
by heaven it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion come go we to the king
this must be known which being kept close might move

moreover that we much did long to see you
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending something have you heard
sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was what it should be
more than his father's death that thus hath put him
so much from th' understanding of himself
i cannot dream of i entreat you both
that being of so young clays brought up with him
and since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time so by your companies
so much as from occasion you may glean
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that opend lies within our remedy
queen good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you
and sure i am two men there are not living
to whom he more adheres if it will please you
to show us so much gentry and good will
as to expend your time with us awhile
for the supply and profit of our hope
as fits a king's remembrance
ros both your majesties
might by the sovereign power you have of us
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty
guil but we both obey
and here give up ourselves in the full bent
to lay our service freely at your feet
to be commanded
queen thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz
and i beseech you instantly to visit
my too much changed son go some of you

his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
enter polonius voltemand and cornelius
welcome my good friends
say voltemand what from our brother norway
volt most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress
his nephew's levies which to him appear'd
to be a preparation 'gainst the polack
but better look'd into he truly found
it was against your highness whereat griev'd
was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
on fortinbras which he in brief obeys
receives rebuke from norway and in fine
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give th' assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old norway overcome with joy
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
and his commission to employ those soldiers
so levied as before against the polack
gives a paper
that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for this enterprise
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down
king it likes us well
and at our more consider'd time we'll read
answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your well took labour
most welcome home exeunt ambassadors
pol this business is well ended
my liege and madam to expostulate
what majesty should be what duty is
why day is day night is night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
i will be brief your noble son is mad
what is't but to be nothing else but mad
but let that go
queen more matter with less art
pol madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity
and pity 'tis 'tis true a foolish figure
but farewell it for i will use no art

king as of a man faithful and honourable
pol i would fain prove so but what might you think
when i had seen this hot love on the wing
as i perceiv'd it i must tell you that
before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if i had play'd the desk or table book
or look'd upon this love with idle sight
what might you think no i went round to work
and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
'lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
this must not be' and then i prescripts gave her
that she should lock herself from his resort
admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice
and he repulsed a short tale to make
thence to a watch thence into a weakness
thence to a lightness and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves
and all we mourn for
king do you think 'tis this
queen it may be very like
pol hath there been such a time i would fain know that
that i have positively said ''tis so'
when it prov'd otherwise
pol points to his head and shoulder take this from this if this
be otherwise

where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
within the centre

be you and i behind an arras then
mark the encounter if he love her not

deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
empty
ham denmark's a prison
ros then is the world one
ham a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
dungeons denmark being one o' th' worst
ros we think not so my lord
ham why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison
ros why then your ambition makes it one 'tis too narrow for your
empty
king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
guil which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
ham a dream itself is but a shadow
ros truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadow's shadow
ham then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows shall we to th' court for by my
fay i cannot reason

you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free
visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak
ham why anything but to th' purpose you were sent for and
there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen
have sent for you
ros to what end my lord
ham that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the
obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with
ros aside to guildenstern what say you
ham aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold
not off
guil my lord we were sent for
ham i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my
mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a
piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in
faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in
action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what
is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman
neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
ham why did you laugh then when i said 'man delights not me'
ros to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them
on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
ham he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall
have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle o' th' sere and the lady shall say her mind
empty
ros even those you were wont to take such delight in the
tragedians of the city
ham how chances it they travel their residence both in
reputation and profit was better both ways
ros i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
empty
ham do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the
city are they so follow'd
ham how comes it do they grow rusty
ros nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is
sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top
of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort these are now
the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call
them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
dare scarce come thither
ham what are they children who maintains 'em how are they
escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
themselves to common players as it is most like if their means
are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession
ros faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a
while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question
ham is't possible
guil o there has been much throwing about of brains
ros ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
ham it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
little 'sblood there is something in this more than natural if
philosophy could find it out
flourish for the players
guil there are the players
ham gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come th'
with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i
tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like
entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father

1 play what speech my good lord
ham i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted
not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as i
receiv'd it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes
set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury
nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
affectation but calld it an honest method as wholesome as
sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech int
i chiefly lov'd 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it
your memory begin at this line let me see let me see
'the rugged pyrrhus like th' hyrcanian beast '
'tis not so it begins with pyrrhus
'the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms
black as his purpose did the night resemble
when he lay couched in the ominous horse
hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
with heraldry more dismal head to foot
now is be total gules horridly trick'd
bak'd and impasted with the parching streets
that lend a tyrannous and a damned light
to their lord's murther roasted in wrath and fire
and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore
with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
old grandsire priam seeks'

rebellious to his arm lies where it falls

seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner pyrrhus' ear for lo his sword
of reverend priam seem'd i' th' air to stick
so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
and like a neutral to his will and matter
did nothing
but as we often see against some storm
a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
the bold winds speechless and the orb below
as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region so after pyrrhus' pause
and never did the cyclops' hammers fall
on mars's armour forg'd for proof eterne
with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword
now falls on priam
out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
in general synod take away her power

o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction in a dream of passion
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wannd
tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect
a broken voice and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
for hecuba
that he should weep for her what would he do
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have he would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
make mad the guilty and appal the free
confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears
yet i
a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak
and can say nothing no not for a king
upon whose property and most dear life
a damnd defeat was made am i a coward
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by th' nose gives me the lie i' th' throat
as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha
'swounds i should take it for it cannot be
but i am pigeon liver'd and lack gall
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain

they have proclaim'd their malefactions
for murther though it have no tongue will speak
with most miraculous organ i'll have these players
play something like the murther of my father

may be a devil and the devil hath power
t' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy

act iii scene i
enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz guildenstern and lords
king and can you by no drift of circumstance
get from him why he puts on this confusion
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
ros he does confess he feels himself distracted
but from what cause he will by no means speak
guil nor do we find him forward to be sounded
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
of his true state
queen did he receive you well
ros most like a gentleman
guil but with much forcing of his disposition
ros niggard of question but of our demands
most free in his reply
queen did you assay him
to any pastime
ros madam it so fell out that certain players
and there did seem in him a kind of joy
to hear of it they are here about the court
and as i think they have already order
this night to play before him
pol 'tis most true
and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter
king with all my heart and it doth much content me
to hear him so inclind
and drive his purpose on to these delights
ros we shall my lord
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
king sweet gertrude leave us too
for we have closely sent for hamlet hither
that he as 'twere by accident may here
affront ophelia
her father and myself lawful espials
will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
and gather by him as he is behav'd
if't be th' affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for
queen i shall obey you
and for your part ophelia i do wish
that your good beauties be the happy cause
of hamlet's wildness so shall i hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again
to both your honours
exit queen
pol ophelia walk you here gracious so please you
we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book
that show of such an exercise may colour
your loneliness we are oft to blame in this
'tis too much prov'd that with devotions visage
and pious action we do sugar o'er
the devil himself
king aside o 'tis too true
the harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

ham to be or not to be that is the question
whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
th' oppressor's wrong the proud mans contumely
the pangs of despis'd love the law's delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of th' unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
the undiscover'd country from whose bourn
no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
be all my sins rememb'red
oph good my lord
how does your honour for this many a day
ham i humbly thank you well well well

ham ha ha are you honest
oph my lord
ham are you fair
ham that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty
oph could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
ham ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox
but now the time gives it proof i did love you once
oph indeed my lord you made me believe so
ham you should not have believ'd me for virtue cannot so
empty
oph i was the more deceived
ham get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me
i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my
beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give
them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i
do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all

enter king and polonius
king love his affections do not that way tend
nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little
was not like madness there's something in his soul
o'er which his melancholy sits on brood
and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
will be some danger which for to prevent
i have in quick determination
for the demand of our neglected tribute
haply the seas and countries different
with variable objects shall expel
this something settled matter in his heart
whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
from fashion of himself what think you ont
pol it shall do well but yet do i believe
the origin and commencement of his grief
sprung from neglected love how now ophelia
we heard it all my lord do as you please
but if you hold it fit after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him
to show his grief let her be round with him
and i'll be plac'd so please you in the ear

to england send him or confine him where
your wisdom best shall think

scene ii

trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our
players do i had as live the town crier spoke my lines nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a
soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to
tatters to very rags to split the cars of the groundlings who
for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it
player i warrant your honour
ham be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with
this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of
whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though
it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious
grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i
have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to
speak it profanely that neither having the accent of
strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's
journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated
humanity so abominably
player i hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us sir
ham o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them
that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered that's villanous

since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
and could of men distinguish her election
hath scald thee for herself for thou hast been
as one in suff'ring all that suffers nothing
a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those
whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
that is not passions slave and i will wear him
in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart

which i have told thee of my father's death

even with the very comment of thy soul
observe my uncle if his occulted guilt
it is a damned ghost that we have seen
and my imaginations are as foul
as vulcans stithy give him heedful note

hautboys play the dumb show enters
enter a king and a queen very lovingly the queen embracing
him and he her she kneels and makes show of protestation
unto him he takes her up and declines his head upon her
him asleep leaves him anon comes in a fellow takes off his
crown kisses it pours poison in the sleeper's ears and
leaves him the queen returns finds the king dead and makes
passionate action the poisoner with some three or four mutes
comes in again seem to condole with her the dead body is
carried away the poisoner wooes the queen with gifts she
seems harsh and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts
his love
empty
ham marry this is miching malhecho it means mischief
oph belike this show imports the argument of the play
enter prologue
ham we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel
they'll tell all
oph will he tell us what this show meant
ham ay or any show that you'll show him be not you asham'd to
show he'll not shame to tell you what it means
oph you are naught you are naught i'll mark the play
here stooping to your clemency
we beg your hearing patiently exit
ham is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
oph 'tis brief my lord
ham as womans love
enter two players as king and queen
king full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
neptune's salt wash and tellus' orbed ground
and thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
unite comutual in most sacred bands
queen so many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count o'er ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late
so far from cheer and from your former state
that i distrust you yet though i distrust
discomfort you my lord it nothing must
for womens fear and love holds quantity
now what my love is proof hath made you know
and as my love is siz'd my fear is so
where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
where little fears grow great great love grows there
king faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
my operant powers their functions leave to do
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
honour'd belov'd and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou
such love must needs be treason in my breast
when second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who killed the first
ham aside wormwood wormwood
queen the instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift but none of love
a second time i kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed
king i do believe you think what now you speak
purpose is but the slave to memory
of violent birth but poor validity
which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
but fill unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary 'tis that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
what to ourselves in passion we propose
the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament
grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange
that even our loves should with our fortunes change
for 'tis a question left us yet to prove
whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies
the poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
and who in want a hollow friend doth try
directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where i begun
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
queen nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
to desperation turn my trust and hope
an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what i would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
if once a widow ever i be wife
ham if she should break it now
king 'tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile
queen sleep rock thy brain
he sleeps
and never come mischance between us twain
empty
ham madam how like you this play
queen the lady doth protest too much methinks
ham o but she'll keep her word
king have you heard the argument is there no offence int
ham no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i' th'
king what do you call the play
ham 'the mousetrap' marry how tropically this play is the
image of a murther done in vienna gonzago is the duke's name
his wife baptista you shall see anon 'tis a knavish piece of
work but what o' that your majesty and we that have free
souls it touches us not let the galld jade winch our withers
are unwrung
enter lucianus
this is one lucianus nephew to the king
ham i could interpret between you and your love if i could see
the puppets dallying
oph you are keen my lord you are keen
ham it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
oph still better and worse
ham so you must take your husbands begin murtherer pox leave
thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth
bellow for revenge
luc thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
with hecate's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
thy natural magic and dire property
on wholesome life usurp immediately
pours the poison in his ears
ham he poisons him i' th' garden for's estate his name's gonzago
the story is extant and written in very choice italian you
shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of gonzago's wife
oph the king rises
queen how fares my lord
pol give o'er the play
king give me some light away
all lights lights lights
exeunt all but hamlet and horatio
ham why let the strucken deer go weep
the hart ungalled play
for some must watch while some must sleep
thus runs the world away
fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my raz'd
shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir

enter rosencrantz and guildenstern
ham sir a whole history
guil the king sir
ham ay sir what of him
guil is in his retirement marvellous distemper'd
ham with drink sir
guil no my lord rather with choler
ham your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
plunge him into far more choler
not so wildly from my affair
ham i am tame sir pronounce
guil the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit
hath sent me to you
ham you are welcome
guil nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer i will do
your mother's commandment if not your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business
guil what my lord
ham make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseas'd but sir such
answer is i can make you shall command or rather as you say
my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you
empty
ros then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement and admiration
ham o wonderful son that can so stonish a mother but is there no
sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration impart
ham we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any
further trade with us
ros my lord you once did love me
ham and do still by these pickers and stealers
ros good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely
bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
your friend
ham sir i lack advancement
ros how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself
ham ay sir but 'while the grass grows' the proverb is something
empty
enter the players with recorders
o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do
you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me
into a toil
guil o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly
ham i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe
guil my lord i cannot
guil believe me i cannot
ham i do beseech you
guil i know no touch of it my lord
ham it is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your
fingers and thumbs give it breath with your mouth and it will
discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops
guil but these cannot i command to any utt'rance of harmony i
have not the skill
ham why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you
pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my
lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music
excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it
speak 'sblood do you think i am easier to be play'd on than a
pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me
you cannot play upon me
enter polonius
god bless you sir
pol my lord the queen would speak with you and presently
pol by th' mass and 'tis like a camel indeed
ham methinks it is like a weasel
pol it is back'd like a weasel
ham or like a whale
pol very like a whale
ham then will i come to my mother by and by they fool me to the
top of my bent i will come by and by
pol i will say so exit
ham 'by and by' is easily said leave me friends
'tis now the very witching time of night
when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood
and do such bitter business as the day
would quake to look on soft now to my mother
o heart lose not thy nature let not ever
the soul of nero enter this firm bosom
let me be cruel not unnatural
i will speak daggers to her but use none
how in my words somever she be shent
to give them seals never my soul consent exit
scene iii
a room in the castle
enter king rosencrantz and guildenstern
king i like him not nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range therefore prepare you
i your commission will forthwith dispatch
and he to england shall along with you
hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
out of his lunacies
guil we will ourselves provide
most holy and religious fear it is
to keep those many many bodies safe
that live and feed upon your majesty
ros the single and peculiar life is bound
with all the strength and armour of the mind
to keep itself from noyance but much more
the lives of many the cesse of majesty
dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
what's near it with it it is a massy wheel
fix'd on the summit of the highest mount
to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
are mortis'd and adjoind which when it falls
each small annexment petty consequence
attends the boist'rous ruin never alone
did the king sigh but with a general groan
for we will fetters put upon this fear
which now goes too free footed
both we will haste us
exeunt gentlemen
enter polonius
pol my lord he's going to his mother's closet
behind the arras i'll convey myself
to hear the process i'll warrant she'll tax him home
and as you said and wisely was it said
since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
the speech of vantage fare you well my liege
i'll call upon you ere you go to bed
and tell you what i know
king thanks dear my lord
exit polonius
o my offence is rank it smells to heaven
it hath the primal eldest curse upont
a brother's murther pray can i not
my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
and like a man to double business bound
i stand in pause where i shall first begin
and both neglect what if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brother's blood
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence
and what's in prayer but this twofold force
or pardond being down then i'll look up
my fault is past but o what form of prayer
can serve my turn 'forgive me my foul murther'
that cannot be since i am still possess'd
of those effects for which i did the murther
my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardond and retain th' offence
in the corrupted currents of this world
offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
buys out the law but 'tis not so above
there is no shuffling there the action lies
in his true nature and we ourselves compelld
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
to give in evidence what then what rests
try what repentance can what can it not
yet what can it when one cannot repent
o wretched state o bosom black as death
o limed soul that struggling to be free
bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
be soft as sinews of the new born babe
all may be well he kneels
enter hamlet
ham now might i do it pat now he is praying
and now i'll do't and so he goes to heaven
and so am i reveng'd that would be scannd
a villain kills my father and for that
i his sole son do this same villain send
why this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father grossly full of bread
with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
but in our circumstance and course of thought
'tis heavy with him and am i then reveng'd
to take him in the purging of his soul
when he is fit and seasoned for his passage
empty
when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed
at gaming swearing or about some act
that has no relish of salvation int
then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
and that his soul may be as damnd and black
as hell whereto it goes my mother stays
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days exit
king rises my words fly up my thoughts remain below
scene iv
the queens closet
enter queen and polonius
pol he will come straight look you lay home to him
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
and that your grace hath screend and stood between
much heat and him i'll silence me even here
pray you be round with him
ham within mother mother mother
polonius hides behind the arras
enter hamlet
ham now mother what's the matter
queen hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
ham mother you have my father much offended
queen come come you answer with an idle tongue
ham go go you question with a wicked tongue
queen why how now hamlet
ham what's the matter now
ham no by the rood not so
you are the queen your husband's brother's wife
and would it were not so you are my mother
queen nay then i'll set those to you that can speak
ham come come and sit you down you shall not budge i
you go not till i set you up a glass
where you may see the inmost part of you
queen what wilt thou do thou wilt not murther me
help help ho
ham draws how now a rat dead for a ducat dead
makes a pass through the arras and kills polonius
pol behind o i am slain
queen o me what hast thou done
ham nay i know not is it the king
queen o what a rash and bloody deed is this
ham a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
as kill a king and marry with his brother
queen as kill a king
lifts up the arras and sees polonius
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hinds peace sit you down
and let me wring your heart for so i shall
if it be made of penetrable stuff
if damned custom have not braz'd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense
in noise so rude against me
ham such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innocent love
and sets a blister there makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths o such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul and sweet religion makes
yea this solidity and compound mass
with tristful visage as against the doom
is thought sick at the act
queen ay me what act
that roars so loud and thunders in the index
ham look here upon th's picture and on this
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
hyperions curls the front of jove himself
a station like the herald mercury
new lighted on a heaven kissing hill
a combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set his seal
to give the world assurance of a man
this was your husband look you now what follows
here is your husband like a mildew'd ear
blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
you cannot call it love for at your age
the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble
and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
would step from this to this sense sure you have
else could you not have motion but sure that sense
is apoplex'd for madness would not err
nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thralld
but it reserv'd some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference what devil was't
eyes without feeling feeling without sight
ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope
o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
if thou canst mutine in a matrons bones
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
and reason panders will
queen o hamlet speak no more
thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul
and there i see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct
ham nay but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
stew'd in corruption honeying and making love
over the nasty sty
these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet hamlet
ham a murtherer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord a vice of kings
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
and put it in his pocket
queen no more
ham a king of shreds and patches
save me and hover o'er me with your wings
you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure
queen alas he's mad
ham do you not come your tardy son to chide
that laps'd in time and passion lets go by
th' important acting of your dread command
o say
ghost do not forget this visitation
but look amazement on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
speak to her hamlet
ham how is it with you lady
queen alas how is't with you
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with th' encorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
your bedded hairs like life in excrements
start up and stand an end o gentle son
upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look
ham on him on him look you how pale he glares
his form and cause conjoind preaching to stones
would make them capable do not look upon me
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects then what i have to do
queen to whom do you speak this
ham do you see nothing there
queen nothing at all yet all that is i see
ham nor did you nothing hear
queen no nothing but ourselves
ham why look you there look how it steals away
my father in his habit as he liv'd
look where he goes even now out at the portal
exit ghost
this bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in
ham ecstasy
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
and makes as healthful music it is not madness
that i have utt'red bring me to the test
and i the matter will reword which madness
would gambol from mother for love of grace
lay not that flattering unction to your soul
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
whiles rank corruption mining all within
infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
repent what's past avoid what is to come
and do not spread the compost on the weeds
to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
ham o throw away the worser part of it
and live the purer with the other half
good night but go not to my uncle's bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat
of habits evil is angel yet in this
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery
that aptly is put on refrain to night
to the next abstinence the next more easy
for use almost can change the stamp of nature
and either master the devil or throw him out
with wondrous potency once more good night
and when you are desirous to be blest
i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord
i do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so
to punish me with this and this with me
that i must be their scourge and minister
the death i gave him so again good night
i must be cruel only to be kind
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one word more good lady
queen what shall i do
ham not this by no means that i bid you do
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
make you to ravel all this matter out
that i essentially am not in madness
but mad in craft 'twere good you let him know
for who that's but a queen fair sober wise
would from a paddock from a bat a gib

his liberty is full of threats to all
to you yourself to us to every one
alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd
it will be laid to us whose providence
should have kept short restraind and out of haunt
this mad young man but so much was our love
but like the owner of a foul disease
to keep it from divulging let it feed
even on the pith of life where is he gone
queen to draw apart the body he hath killd
o'er whom his very madness like some ore
among a mineral of metals base
shows itself pure he weeps for what is done

exeunt all but hamlet
how all occasions do inform against me
if his chief good and market of his time
be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
sure he that made us with such large discourse
looking before and after gave us not
that capability and godlike reason
to fust in us unus'd now whether it be
bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on th' event
a thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom
why yet i live to say 'this thing's to do'
sith i have cause and will and strength and means
to do't examples gross as earth exhort me
witness this army of such mass and charge
led by a delicate and tender prince
whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
makes mouths at the invisible event
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune death and danger dare
is not to stir without great argument
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honour's at the stake how stand i then
that have a father kllld a mother staind
excitements of my reason and my blood
and let all sleep while to my shame i see
the imminent death of twenty thousand men
that for a fantasy and trick of fame
go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
which is not tomb enough and continent
to hide the slain o from this time forth
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth exit

her mood will needs be pitied
gent she speaks much of her father says she hears
there's tricks i' th' world and hems and beats her heart
spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
that carry but half sense her speech is nothing
yet the unshaped use of it doth move
the hearers to collection they aim at it
and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
indeed would make one think there might be thought
hor 'twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds
queen let her come in

this give these fellows some means to the king they have
letters for him ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of
very warlike appointment gave us chase finding ourselves too
slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple i
boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so i
of mercy but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for
them let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou
to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death i have words
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too
light for the bore of the matter these good fellows will bring
thee where i am rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course
for england of them i have much to tell thee farewell
'he that thou knowest thine hamlet'
come i will give you way for these your letters
to him from whom you brought them exeunt
scene vii
elsinore another room in the castle
enter king and laertes
king now must your conscience my acquittance seal
and you must put me in your heart for friend
sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursued my life
why you proceeded not against these feats
so crimeful and so capital in nature
as by your safety wisdom all things else
you mainly were stirr'd up
king o for two special reasons
which may to you perhaps seein much unsinew'd
but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
lives almost by his looks and for myself
my virtue or my plague be it either which
that as the star moves not but in his sphere
i could not but by her the other motive
why to a public count i might not go
is the great love the general gender bear him
who dipping all his faults in their affection
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
convert his gives to graces so that my arrows
too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind
would have reverted to my bow again
laer and so have i a noble father lost
a sister driven into desp'rate terms
whose worth if praises may go back again
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections but my revenge will come
king break not your sleeps for that you must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger
and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
and that i hope will teach you to imagine
enter a messenger with letters
how now what news
mess letters my lord from hamlet
this to your majesty this to the queen
king from hamlet who brought them
mess sailors my lord they say i saw them not
they were given me by claudio he receiv'd them
of him that brought them
leave us
exit messenger
reads'high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your
kingdom to morrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes
when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the
occasion of my sudden and more strange return
empty
what should this mean are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing
king 'tis hamlet's character 'naked'
and in a postscript here he says 'alone'
can you advise me
laer i am lost in it my lord but let him come
it warms the very sickness in my heart
that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
'thus didest thou'
king if it be so laertes
as how should it be so how otherwise
laer ay my lord
so you will not o'errule me to a peace
king to thine own peace if he be now returnd
as checking at his voyage and that he means
no more to undertake it i will work him
to exploit now ripe in my device
under the which he shall not choose but fall
and for his death no wind
but even his mother shall uncharge the practice
laer my lord i will be ruld
the rather if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ
king it falls right
you have been talk'd of since your travel much
and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality
wherein they say you shine your sun of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one and that in my regard
laer what part is that my lord
king a very riband in the cap of youth
yet needfull too for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
thin settled age his sables and his weeds
importing health and graveness two months since
here was a gentleman of normandy
i have seen myself and serv'd against the french
and they can well on horseback but this gallant
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
as had he been incorps'd and demi natur'd
with the brave beast so far he topp'd my thought
that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
come short of what he did
laer a norman was't
king a norman
laer upon my life lamound
king the very same
and gem of all the nation
king he made confession of you
and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defence
and for your rapier most especially
that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
he swore had neither motion guard nor eye
if you oppos'd them sir this report of his
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming o'er to play with you
now out of this
laer what out of this my lord
king laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow
a face without a heart'
laer why ask you this
king not that i think you did not love your father
and that i see in passages of proof
time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
and nothing is at a like goodness still
for goodness growing to a plurisy
dies in his own too much that we would do
we should do when we would for this 'would' changes
and hath abatements and delays as many
and then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
that hurts by easing but to the quick o' th' ulcer
hamlet comes back what would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son in deed
more than in words
laer to cut his throat i' th' church
king no place indeed should murther sanctuarize
revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
will you do this keep close within your chamber
we'll put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads he being remiss
most generous and free from all contriving
will not peruse the foils so that with ease
or with a little shuffling you may choose
a sword unbated and in a pass of practice
requite him for your father
and for that purpose i'll anoint my sword
i bought an unction of a mountebank
so mortal that but dip a knife in it
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
collected from all simples that have virtue
under the moon can save the thing from death
this is but scratch'd withal i'll touch my point
with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
it may be death
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape if this should fall
and that our drift look through our bad performance
'twere better not assay'd therefore this project
should have a back or second that might hold
if this did blast in proof soft let me see
we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings
i ha't
when in your motion you are hot and dry
and that he calls for drink i'll have prepar'd him
a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck
our purpose may hold there but stay what noise
enter queen
how now sweet queen
queen one woe doth tread upon another's heel
so fast they follow your sister's drownd laertes
laer drownd o where
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
there with fantastic garlands did she come
of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them
there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
clamb'ring to hang an envious sliver broke
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
as one incapable of her own distress
or like a creature native and indued
unto that element but long it could not be
till that her garments heavy with their drink
pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death
laer alas then she is drownd
queen drownd drownd
and therefore i forbid my tears but yet
it is our trick nature her custom holds
let shame say what it will when these are gone
the woman will be out adieu my lord

ancient gentlemen but gard'ners ditchers and grave makers they

purpose confess thyself

great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his
fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of
his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of
his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth
of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will
scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no
hor not a jot more my lord

of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
his kibe how long hast thou been a grave maker
clown of all the days i' th' year i came to't that day that our
last king hamlet overcame fortinbras
ham how long is that since
clown cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it was the

rhenish on my head once this same skull sir was yorick's

clown e'en that
ham let me see takes the skull alas poor yorick i knew him
horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he
hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes and now how abhorred
in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those
lips that i have kiss'd i know not how oft where be your gibes
now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that
were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your
chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this
favour she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio
tell me one thing
hor what's that my lord
ham dost thou think alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth
hor e'en so
ham and smelt so pah
puts down the skull
hor e'en so my lord
imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it
stopping a bunghole
hor 'twere to consider too curiously to consider so
ham no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty
enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died
alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is
earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beer barrel
imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay
o that that earth which kept the world in awe
should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw
but soft but soft aside here comes the king
enter priests with a coffin in funeral procession king
queen laertes with lords attendant
the queen the courtiers who is this they follow
and with such maimed rites this doth betoken
the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
fordo it own life 'twas of some estate
retires with horatio
laer what ceremony else
ham that is laertes
a very noble youth mark
laer what ceremony else
priest her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
as we have warranty her death was doubtful
and but that great command o'ersways the order
she should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
her maiden strewments and the bringing home
of bell and burial
laer must there no more be done
priest no more be done
we should profane the service of the dead
to sing a requiem and such rest to her
as to peace parted souls
and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest
a minist'ring angel shall my sister be
when thou liest howling
ham what the fair ophelia
queen sweets to the sweet farewell
scatters flowers
i hop'd thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife
i thought thy bride bed to have deck'd sweet maid
laer o treble woe
fall ten times treble on that cursed head
whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
depriv'd thee of hold off the earth awhile
till i have caught her once more in mine arms
leaps in the grave
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
till of this flat a mountain you have made
t' o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head
ham comes forward what is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand
like wonder wounded hearers this is i
hamlet the dane leaps in after laertes
laer the devil take thy soul
grapples with him
ham thou pray'st not well
i prithee take thy fingers from my throat
yet have i in me something dangerous
which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand
king pluck thein asunder
queen hamlet hamlet
all gentlemen
hor good my lord be quiet
the attendants part them and they come out of the
empty
ham why i will fight with him upon this theme
queen o my son what theme
ham i lov'd ophelia forty thousand brothers
could not with all their quantity of love
make up my sum what wilt thou do for her
king o he is mad laertes
queen for love of god forbear him
ham 'swounds show me what thou't do
woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself
woo't drink up esill eat a crocodile
to outface me with leaping in her grave
be buried quick with her and so will i
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw
millions of acres on us till our ground
singeing his pate against the burning zone
make ossa like a wart nay an thou'lt mouth
i'll rant as well as thou
queen this is mere madness
and thus a while the fit will work on him
when that her golden couplets are disclos'd
his silence will sit drooping
ham hear you sir
what is the reason that you use me thus
i lov'd you ever but it is no matter
let hercules himself do what he may
the cat will mew and dog will have his day
empty
king i pray thee good horatio wait upon him
to laertes strengthen your patience in our last night's speech
we'll put the matter to the present push
good gertrude set some watch over your son
this grave shall have a living monument
an hour of quiet shortly shall we see
till then in patience our proceeding be
empty
scene ii
elsinore a hall in the castle
ham so much for this sir now shall you see the other
you do remember all the circumstance
hor remember it my lord
ham sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
that would not let me sleep methought i lay
worse than the mutinies in the bilboes rashly
and prais'd be rashness for it let us know
our indiscretion sometime serves us well
when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us
rough hew them how we will
hor that is most certain
ham up from my cabin
my sea gown scarf'd about me in the dark
grop'd i to find out them had my desire
finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again making so bold
my fears forgetting manners to unseal
their grand commission where i found horatio
larded with many several sorts of reasons
importing denmark's health and england's too
with hoo such bugs and goblins in my life
that on the supervise no leisure bated
no not to stay the finding of the axe
my head should be struck off
hor is't possible
ham here's the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou bear me how i did proceed
ham being thus benetted round with villanies
or i could make a prologue to my brains
they had begun the play i sat me down
devis'd a new commission wrote it fair
i once did hold it as our statists do
a baseness to write fair and labour'd much
how to forget that learning but sir now
it did me yeomans service wilt thou know
th' effect of what i wrote
ham an earnest conjuration from the king
as england was his faithful tributary
as love between them like the palm might flourish
as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma 'tween their amities
and many such like as's of great charge
that on the view and knowing of these contents
without debatement further more or less
he should the bearers put to sudden death
hor how was this seald
ham why even in that was heaven ordinant
i had my father's signet in my purse
which was the model of that danish seal
folded the writ up in the form of th' other
subscrib'd it gave't th' impression plac'd it safely
the changeling never known now the next day
was our sea fight and what to this was sequent
thou know'st already
ham why man they did make love to this employment
they are not near my conscience their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow
'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell incensed points
of mighty opposites
hor why what a king is this
ham does it not thinks't thee stand me now upon
he that hath killd my king and whor'd my mother
thrown out his angle for my proper life
and with such coz'nage is't not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm and is't not to be damnd
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil
hor it must be shortly known to him from england
what is the issue of the business there
ham it will be short the interim is mine
and a mans life is no more than to say 'one'
that to laertes i forgot myself
for by the image of my cause i see
the portraiture of his i'll court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
into a tow'ring passion
hor peace who comes here
enter young osric a courtier
osr your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
ham i humbly thank you sir aside to horatio dost know this
hor aside to hamlet no my good lord
ham aside to horatio thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a
vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be
lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis
a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt
osr sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart
a thing to you from his majesty
ham i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your
bonnet to his right use 'tis for the head
ham no believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly
osr it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
ham but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
osr exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as 'twere i cannot
tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that
he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter
ham i beseech you remember
hamlet moves him to put on his hat
osr nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is
full of most excellent differences of very soft society and
great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card
or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of
what part a gentleman would see
ham sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i
know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great
article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make
would trace him his umbrage nothing more
osr your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
ham the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath
osr sir
hor aside to hamlet is't not possible to understand in another
tongue you will do't sir really
ham what imports the nomination of this gentleman
osr of laertes
empty
ham of him sir
osr i know you are not ignorant
ham i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
much approve me well sir
osr you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
ham i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in
excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
osr i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
ham what's his weapon
osr rapier and dagger
ham that's two of his weapons but well
osr the king sir hath wager'd with him six barbary horses
against the which he has impond as i take it six french
rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and
so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy
very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of
very liberal conceit
hor aside to hamlet i knew you must be edified by the margent
ere you had done
osr the carriages sir are the hangers
ham the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then
but on six barbary horses against six french swords their
assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that's the french
bet against the danish why is this all impond as you call it
osr the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between
laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
ham how if i answer no
osr i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
ham sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be
brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose
i will win for him if i can if not i will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits
ham to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
osr i commend my duty to your lordship
ham yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it
himself there are no tongues else for's turn
hor this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
ham he did comply with his dug before he suck'd it thus has he
and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes
on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter
a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and
them to their trial the bubbles are out
enter a lord
lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who
brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to
know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will
take longer time
ham i am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure
if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided
i be so able as now
ham in happy time
lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
laertes before you fall to play
ham she well instructs me
exit lord
hor you will lose this wager my lord
ham i do not think so since he went into france i have been in
continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not
think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter
ham it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman
hor if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit
ham not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come' if it be
not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
the readiness is all since no man knows aught of what he leaves
what is't to leave betimes let be
attendants with foils and gauntlets
a table and flagons of wine on it
king come hamlet come and take this hand from me
the king puts laertes' hand into hamlet's
ham give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong
but pardont as you are a gentleman
this presence knows
and you must needs have heard how i am punish'd
with sore distraction what i have done
roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
was't hamlet wrong'd laertes never hamlet
if hamlet from himself be taken away
and when he's not himself does wrong laertes
then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
who does it then his madness if't be so
hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd
his madness is poor hamlet's enemy
sir in this audience
free me so far in your most generous thoughts
that i have shot my arrow o'er the house
and hurt my brother
laer i am satisfied in nature
whose motive in this case should stir me most
to my revenge but in my terms of honour
i stand aloof and will no reconcilement
till by some elder masters of known honour
i have a voice and precedent of peace
i do receive your offer'd love like love
and will not wrong it
ham i embrace it freely
and will this brother's wager frankly play
give us the foils come on
laer come one for me
ham i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance
your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night
stick fiery off indeed
ham no by this bad
king give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet
you know the wager
ham very well my lord
your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side
king i do not fear it i have seen you both
but since he is better'd we have therefore odds
laer this is too heavy let me see another
ham this likes me well these foils have all a length
osr ay my good lord
king set me the stoups of wine upon that table
if hamlet give the first or second hit
or quit in answer of the third exchange
let all the battlements their ordnance fire
the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath
and in the cup an union shall he throw
richer than that which four successive kings
in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups
the trumpet to the cannoneer without
the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth
'now the king drinks to hamlet' come begin
and you the judges bear a wary eye
ham come on sir
laer come my lord they play
ham one
laer no
ham judgment
laer well again
king stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine
here's to thy health
drum trumpets sound a piece goes off within
give him the cup
ham i'll play this bout first set it by awhile
come they play another hit what say you
laer a touch a touch i do confess't
king our son shall win
here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet
ham good madam
king gertrude do not drink
queen i will my lord i pray you pardon me drinks
king aside it is the poisond cup it is too late
ham i dare not drink yet madam by and by
queen come let me wipe thy face
laer my lord i'll hit him now
laer aside and yet it is almost against my conscience
ham come for the third laertes you but dally
pray you pass with your best violence
i am afeard you make a wanton of me
laer say you so come on play
osr nothing neither way
laer have at you now
laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they
change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes
ham nay come again the queen falls
osr look to the queen there ho
hor they bleed on both sides how is it my lord
osr how is't laertes
laer why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric
i am justly killd with mine own treachery
ham how does the queen
king she sounds to see them bleed
queen no no the drink the drink o my dear hamlet
ham o villany ho let the door be lock'd
treachery seek it out
laertes falls
laer it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain
no medicine in the world can do thee good
in thee there is not half an hour of life
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand
unbated and envenom'd the foul practice
hath turnd itself on me lo here i lie
i can no more the king the king's to blame
ham the point envenom'd too
then venom to thy work hurts the king
all treason treason
king o yet defend me friends i am but hurt
ham here thou incestuous murd'rous damned dane
drink off this potion is thy union here
follow my mother king dies
laer he is justly serv'd
exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
mine and my father's death come not upon thee
nor thine on me dies
ham heaven make thee free of it i follow thee
i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu
you that look pale and tremble at this chance
that are but mutes or audience to this act
had i but time as this fell sergeant death
is strict in his arrest o i could tell you
thou liv'st report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied
hor never believe it
i am more an antique roman than a dane
here's yet some liquor left
ham as th'art a man
give me the cup let go by heaven i'll ha't
o good horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
absent thee from felicity awhile
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
to tell my story march afar off and shot within
what warlike noise is this
osr young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
to the ambassadors of england gives
this warlike volley
ham o i die horatio
the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
but i do prophesy th' election lights
on fortinbras he has my dying voice
so tell him with th' occurrents more and less
which have solicited the rest is silence dies
hor now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
march within
why does the drum come hither
enter fortinbras and english ambassadors with drum
fort where is this sight
hor what is it you will see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
fort this quarry cries on havoc o proud death
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck
ambassador the sight is dismal
and our affairs from england come too late
to tell him his commandment is fulfilld
that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
where should we have our thanks
hor not from his mouth
had it th' ability of life to thank you
he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question
you from the polack wars and you from england
are here arriv'd give order that these bodies
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about so shall you hear
of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
of accidental judgments casual slaughters
of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause
and in this upshot purposes mistook
falln on th' inventors' heads all this can i
truly deliver
fort let us haste to hear it
for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
hor of that i shall have also cause to speak
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
but let this same be presently perform'd
even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance
on plots and errors happen
fort let four captains
for he was likely had he been put on
to have prov'd most royally and for his passage
the soldiers' music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him
take up the bodies such a sight as this
becomes the field but here shows much amiss
go bid the soldiers shoot
exeunt marching after the which a peal of ordnance
are shot off

king so shaken as we are so wan with care
find we a time for frighted peace to pant
and breathe short winded accents of new broils
to be commenc'd in stronds afar remote
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood
nor bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs

forthwith a power of english shall we levy
whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
to chase these pagans in those holy fields
over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
which fourteen hundred years ago were naild
but this our purpose now is twelvemonth old
and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go
therefore we meet not now then let me hear
of you my gentle cousin westmoreland
what yesternight our council did decree
in forwarding this dear expedience
west my liege this haste was hot in question
and many limits of the charge set down
but yesternight when all athwart there came
whose worst was that the noble mortimer
leading the men of herefordshire to fight
against the irregular and wild glendower
was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
a thousand of his people butchered
upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
such beastly shameless transformation
by those welshwomen done as may not be
without much shame retold or spoken of
brake off our business for the holy land
west this match'd with other did my gracious lord
for more uneven and unwelcome news
came from the north and thus it did import
on holy rood day the gallant hotspur there
young harry percy and brave archibald
that ever valiant and approved scot
at holmedon met
where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
and shape of likelihood the news was told
for he that brought them in the very heat
and pride of their contention did take horse
uncertain of the issue any way
king here is a dear a true industrious friend
sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse
staind with the variation of each soil
betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights
balk'd in their own blood did sir walter see
on holmedons plains of prisoners hotspur took
mordake earl of fife and eldest son
to beaten douglas and the earl of athol
of murray angus and menteith
and is not this an honourable spoil
a gallant prize ha cousin is it not
west in faith
king yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin
in envy that my lord northumberland
should be the father to so blest a son
a son who is the theme of honour's tongue
amongst a grove the very straightest plant
who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride
whilst i by looking on the praise of him
see riot and dishonour stain the brow
of my young harry o that it could be prov'd
in cradle clothes our children where they lay
and calld mine percy his plantagenet
then would i have his harry and he mine
but let him from my thoughts what think you coz
of this young percy's pride the prisoners
which he in this adventure hath surpris'd
to his own use he keeps and sends me word
i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
west this is his uncle's teaching this worcester
which makes him prune himself and bristle up
the crest of youth against your dignity
king but i have sent for him to answer this
and for this cause awhile we must neglect
our holy purpose to jerusalem
cousin on wednesday next our council we
will hold at windsor so inform the lords
but come yourself with speed to us again
for more is to be said and to be done

fal now hal what time of day is it lad
prince thou art so fat witted with drinking of old sack and
unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after
noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
wouldest truly know what a devil hast thou to do with the time
and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping
houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in
flame coloured taffeta i see no reason why thou shouldst be so
superfluous to demand the time of the day
fal indeed you come near me now hal for we that take purses go
by the moon and the seven stars and not by phoebus he that
wand'ring knight so fair and i prithee sweet wag when thou art
king as god save thy grace majesty i should say for grace thou
wilt have none
fal no by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to
an egg and butter
prince well how then come roundly roundly
fal marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that
are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's
beauty let us be diana's foresters gentlemen of the shade
minions of the moon and let men say we be men of good
government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste
mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
us that are the moons men doth ebb and flow like the sea being
governed as the sea is by the moon as for proof now a purse
of gold most resolutely snatch'd on monday night and most
dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with swearing 'lay by'
and spent with crying 'bring in now ill as low an ebb as the
foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge
of the gallows
fal by the lord thou say'st true lad and is not my hostess of
the tavern a most sweet wench
a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
fal how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and thy

exit falstaff
poins now my good sweet honey lord ride with us to morrow i
have a jest to execute that i cannot manage alone falstaff
already waylaid yourself and i will not be there and when they
have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut this head off
from my shoulders
prince how shall we part with them in setting forth
poins why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and
then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they
shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them
prince yea but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses by
poins tut our horses they shall not see i'll tie them in the
wood our wizards we will change after we leave them and
sirrah i have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our
noted outward garments
prince yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us
poins well for two of them i know them to be as true bred
cowards as ever turnd back and for the third if he fight
longer than he sees reason i'll forswear arms the virtue of
this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat
he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he
endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest
prince well i'll go with thee provide us all things necessary
and meet me to night in eastcheap there i'll sup farewell
poins farewell my lord exit
prince i know you all and will awhile uphold
the unyok'd humour of your idleness
yet herein will i imitate the sun
who doth permit the base contagious clouds
that when he please again to lie himself
being wanted he may be more wond'red at
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
of vapours that did seem to strangle him
if all the year were playing holidays
to sport would be as tedious as to work
but when they seldom come they wish'd for come
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
so when this loose behaviour i throw off
by how much better than my word i am
by so much shall i falsify mens hopes
and like bright metal on a sullen ground
my reformation glitt'ring o'er my fault
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
than that which hath no foil to set it off
i'll so offend to make offence a skill
redeeming time when men think least i will exit
scene iii
enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt
with others
king my blood hath been too cold and temperate
unapt to stir at these indignities
and you have found me for accordingly
you tread upon my patience but be sure
i will from henceforth rather be myself
mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud
wor our house my sovereign liege little deserves
the scourge of greatness to be us'd on it
and that same greatness too which our own hands
have holp to make so portly
north my lord
king worcester get thee gone for i do see
danger and disobedience in thine eye
o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
the moody frontier of a servant brow
tou have good leave to leave us when we need
'your use and counsel we shall send for you
exit worcester
you were about to speak
north yea my good lord
those prisoners in your highness' name demanded
which harry percy here at holmedon took
were as he says not with such strength denied
either envy therefore or misprision
is guilty of this fault and not my son
hot my liege i did deny no prisoners
but i remember when the fight was done
when i was dry with rage and extreme toll
breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
show'd like a stubble land at harvest home
and 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
a pouncet box which ever and anon
he gave his nose and took't away again
who therewith angry when it next came there
took it in snuff and still he smild and talk'd
and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
he calld them untaught knaves unmannerly
to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
betwixt the wind and his nobility
he questioned me amongst the rest demanded
my prisoners in your majesty's behalf
i then all smarting with my wounds being cold
to be so pest'red with a popingay
out of my grief and my impatience
answer'd neglectingly i know not what
he should or he should not for he made me mad
to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
was parmacity for an inward bruise
and that it was great pity so it was
this villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
out of the bowels of the harmless earth
which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
so cowardly and but for these vile 'guns
he would himself have been a soldier
this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
and i beseech you let not his report
come current for an accusation
betwixt my love and your high majesty
blunt the circumstance considered good my lord
whate'er lord harry percy then had said
to such a person and in such a place
at such a time with all the rest retold
may reasonably die and never rise
to do him wrong or any way impeach
king why yet he doth deny his prisoners
but with proviso and exception
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
his brother in law the foolish mortimer
who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
the lives of those that he did lead to fight
against that great magician damnd glendower
whose daughter as we hear the earl of march
hath lately married shall our coffers then
shall we buy treason and indent with fears
when they have lost and forfeited themselves
no on the barren mountains let him starve
for i shall never hold that man my friend
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted mortimer
hot revolted mortimer
he never did fall off my sovereign liege
but by the chance of war to prove that true
those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
when on the gentle severns sedgy bank
in single opposition hand to hand
he did confound the best part of an hour
in changing hardiment with great glendower
three times they breath'd and three times did they drink
upon agreement of swift severns flood
who then affrighted with their bloody looks
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants
never did base and rotten policy
colour her working with such deadly wounds
nor never could the noble mortimer
receive so many and all willingly
then let not him be slandered with revolt
king thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
he never did encounter with glendower
i tell thee
as owen glendower for an enemy
art thou not asham'd but sirrah henceforth
let me not hear you speak of mortimer
send me your prisoners with the speediest means
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you my lord northumberland
we license your departure with your son
send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
exeunt king blunt and train
i will not send them i will after straight
and tell him so for i will else my heart
albeit i make a hazard of my head
north what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
here comes your uncle
enter worcester
hot speak of mortimer
zounds i will speak of him and let my soul
want mercy if i do not join with him
and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
but i will lift the downtrod mortimer
as high in the air as this unthankful king
as this ingrate and cank'red bolingbroke
north brother the king hath made your nephew mad
wor who struck this heat up after i was gone
hot he will forsooth have all my prisoners
and when i urg'd the ransom once again
of my wive's brother then his cheek look'd pale
trembling even at the name of mortimer
wor i cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd
by richard that dead is the next of blood
north he was i heard the proclamation
and then it was when the unhappy king
whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth
upon his irish expedition
from whence he intercepted did return
to be depos'd and shortly murdered
live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of
hot but soft i pray you did king richard then
proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
heir to the crown
north he did myself did hear it
hot nay then i cannot blame his cousin king
that wish'd him on the barren mountains starve
but shall it be that you that set the crown
upon the head of this forgetful man
of murtherous subornation shall it be
that you a world of curses undergo
being the agents or base second means
the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
o pardon me that i descend so low
to show the line and the predicament
wherein you range under this subtile king
shall it for shame be spoken in these days
or fill up chronicles in time to come
did gage them both in an unjust behalf
as both of you god pardon it have done
to put down richard that sweet lovely rose
and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
and shall it in more shame be further spoken
that you are foold discarded and shook off
by him for whom these shames ye underwent
no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt
of this proud king who studies day and night
to answer all the debt he owes to you
even with the bloody payment of your deaths
therefore i say
wor peace cousin say no more
and now i will unclasp a secret book
and to your quick conceiving discontents
i'll read you matter deep and dangerous
as to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear
hot if he fall in good night or sink or swim
send danger from the east unto the west
so honour cross it from the north to south
and let them grapple o the blood more stirs
to rouse a lion than to start a hare
north imagination of some great exploit
drives him beyond the bounds of patience
to pluck bright honour from the pale fac'd moon
or dive into the bottom of the deep
where fadom line could never touch the ground
and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
without corrival all her dignities
but out upon this half fac'd fellowship
wor he apprehends a world of figures here
but not the form of what he should attend
hot i cry you mercy
wor those same noble scots
that are your prisoners
hot i'll keep them all
by god he shall not have a scot of them
no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
i'll keep them by this hand
wor you start away
and lend no ear unto my purposes
hot nay i will that is flat
he said he would not ransom mortimer
forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer
but i will find him when he lies asleep
and in his ear i'll holloa 'mortimer'
empty
i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but 'mortimer' and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion
hot all studies here i solemnly defy
save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke
and that same sword and buckler prince of wales
but that i think his father loves him not
and would be glad he met with some mischance
i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale
wor farewell kinsman i will talk to you
when you are better temper'd to attend
north why what a wasp stung and impatient fool
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
hot why look you i am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods
nettled and stung with pismires when i hear
of this vile politician bolingbroke
in richard's time what do you call the place
a plague upon it it is in gioucestershire
'twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
his uncle york where i first bow'd my knee
unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke
when you and he came back from ravenspurgh
north at berkeley castle
hot you say true
why what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
look 'when his infant fortune came to age'
and 'gentle harry percy' and 'kind cousin
o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me
good uncle tell your tale for i have done
we will stay your leisure
hot i have done i' faith
wor then once more to your scottish prisoners
deliver them up without their ransom straight
and make the douglas' son your only mean
for powers in scotland which for divers reasons
which i shall send you written be assur'd
will easily be granted to northumberland you my lord
your son in scotland being thus employ'd
of that same noble prelate well belov'd
the archbishop
hot of york is it not
wor true who bears hard
his brother's death at bristow the lord scroop
i speak not this in estimation
as what i think might be but what i know
is ruminated plotted and set down
and only stays but to behold the face
hot i smell it upon my life it will do well
north before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip
hot why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
and then the power of scotland and of york
to join with mortimer ha
wor and so they shall
hot in faith it is exceedingly well aim'd
wor and 'tis no little reason bids us speed
to save our heads by raising of a head
the king will always think him in our debt
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied
till he hath found a time to pay us home
and see already how he doth begin
to make us strangers to his looks of love
hot he does he does we'll be reveng'd on him
wor cousin farewell no further go in this
than i by letters shall direct your course
when time is ripe which will be suddenly
where you and douglas and our pow'rs at once
as i will fashion it shall happily meet
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
which now we hold at much uncertainty
north farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust
hot uncle adieu o let the hours be short
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport exeunt

art accompanied for though the camomile the more it is trodden
on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears that thou art my son i have partly thy mother's
word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of
thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth
warrant me if then thou be son to me here lies the point why
being son to me art thou so pointed at shall the blessed sun of
ask'd shall the son of england prove a thief and take purses a
question to be ask'd there is a thing harry which thou hast
often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name
of pitch this pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile
so doth the company thou keepest for harry now i do not speak
to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion
not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous
man whom i have often noted in thy company but i know not his
empty

look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as i think
his age some fifty or by'r lady inclining to threescore and
now i remember me his name is falstaff if that man should be
lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry i see virtue in his
looks if then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit
by the tree then peremptorily i speak it there is virtue in
that falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell me now
thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month
play my father

act iii scene i
bangor the archdeacons house
enter hotspur worcester lord mortimer owen glendower
mort these promises are fair the parties sure
hot lord mortimer and cousin glendower
will you sit down
and uncle worcester a plague upon it
i have forgot the map
glend no here it is
sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur
for by that name as oft as lancaster
doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
owen glendower spoke of
glend i cannot blame him at my nativity
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
of burning cressets and at my birth
the frame and huge foundation of the earth
shak'd like a coward
hot why so it would have done at the same season if your
mother's cat had but kittend though yourself had never been
empty
hot and i say the earth was not of my mind
if you suppose as fearing you it shook
glend the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
hot o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
and not in fear of your nativity
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
by the imprisoning of unruly wind
shakes the old beldame earth and topples down
steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth
our grandam earth having this distemp'rature
in passion shook
glend cousin of many men
i do not bear these crossings give me leave
to tell you once again that at my birth
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
these signs have mark'd me extraordinary
and all the courses of my life do show
i am not in the roll of common men
where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
that chides the banks of england scotland wales
which calls me pupil or hath read to me
and bring him out that is but womans son
can trace me in the tedious ways of art
and hold me pace in deep experiments
mort peace cousin percy you will make him mad
glend i can call spirits from the vasty deep
hot why so can i or so can any man
but will they come when you do call for them
glend why i can teach you cousin to command the devil
hot and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil
by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence
mort come come no more of this unprofitable chat
glend three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
against my power thrice from the banks of wye
and sandy bottom'd severn have i sent him
bootless home and weather beaten back
hot home without boots and in foul weather too
how scapes he agues in the devils name
glend come here's the map shall we divide our right
according to our threefold order ta'en
into three limits very equally
england from trent and severn hitherto
by south and east is to my part assignd
all westward wales beyond the severn shore
and all the fertile land within that bound
to owen glendower and dear coz to you
the remnant northward lying off from trent
and our indentures tripartite are drawn
which being sealed interchangeably
to morrow cousin percy you and i
and my good lord of worcester will set forth
to meet your father and the scottish bower
as is appointed us at shrewsbury
my father glendower is not ready yet
nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
to glend within that space you may have drawn together
your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
glend a shorter time shall send me to you lords
from whom you now must steal and take no leave
for there will be a world of water shed
upon the parting of your wives and you
hot methinks my moiety north from burton here
in quantity equals not one of yours
see how this river comes me cranking in
and cuts me from the best of all my land
a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out
i'll have the current ill this place damm'd up
in a new channel fair and evenly
it shall not wind with such a deep indent
to rob me of so rich a bottom here
glend not wind it shall it must you see it doth
mort yea but
mark how he bears his course and runs me up
with like advantage on the other side
gelding the opposed continent as much
as on the other side it takes from you
and on this north side win this cape of land
and then he runs straight and even
hot i'll have it so a little charge will do it
glend i will not have it alt'red
hot will not you
glend no nor you shall not
hot who shall say me nay
glend no that will i
hot let me not understand you then speak it in welsh
for i was traind up in the english court
where being but young i framed to the harp
many an english ditty lovely well
and gave the tongue a helpful ornament
a virtue that was never seen in you
hot marry
and i am glad of it with all my heart
i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
than one of these same metre ballet mongers
or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
nothing so much as mincing poetry
'tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag
glend come you shall have trent turnd
hot i do not care i'll give thrice so much land
to any well deserving friend
but in the way of bargain mark ye me
i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
glend the moon shines fair you may away by night
i'll haste the writer and withal
break with your wives of your departure hence
i am afraid my daughter will run mad
so much she doteth on her mortimer exit
mort fie cousin percy how you cross my father
hot i cannot choose sometimes he angers me
with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
a clip wing'd griffin and a moulten raven
a couching lion and a ramping cat
and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff
as puts me from my faith i tell you what
he held me last night at least nine hours
in reckoning up the several devils' names
that were his lackeys i cried 'hum' and 'well go to'
but mark'd him not a word o he is as tedious
as a tired horse a railing wife
with cheese and garlic in a windmill far
than feed on cates and have him talk to me
in any summer house in christendom
mort in faith he is a worthy gentleman
exceedingly well read and profited
in strange concealments valiant as a lion
and wondrous affable and as bountiful
as mines of india shall i tell you cousin
he holds your temper in a high respect
when you come 'cross his humour faith he does
i warrant you that man is not alive
might so have tempted him as you have done
without the taste of danger and reproof
but do not use it oft let me entreat you
wor in faith my lord you are too wilful blame
and since your coming hither have done enough
to put him quite besides his patience
you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
and that's the dearest grace it renders you
yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
defect of manners want of government
pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
the least of which haunting a nobleman
loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain
upon the beauty of all parts besides
beguiling them of commendation
hot well i am schoold good manners be your speed
enter glendower with the ladies
mort this is the deadly spite that angers me
my wife can speak no english i no welsh
glend my daughter weeps she will not part with you
she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
mort good father tell her that she and my aunt percy
shall follow in your conduct speedily
glendower speaks to her in welsh and she answers
him in the same
one that no persuasion can do good upon
the lady speaks in welsh
mort i understand thy looks that pretty welsh
which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
i am too perfect in and but for shame
in such a barley should i answer thee
the lady again in welsh
i understand thy kisses and thou mine
and that's a feeling disputation
till i have learnt thy language for thy tongue
makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd
sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r
with ravishing division to her lute
glend nay if you melt then will she run mad
the lady speaks again in welsh
mort o i am ignorance itself in this
glend she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
and rest your gentle head upon her lap
and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
as is the difference betwixt day and night
the hour before the heavenly harness'd team
begins his golden progress in the east
mort with all my heart i'll sit and hear her sing
by that time will our book i think be drawn
glend do so
hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
and straight they shall be here sit and attend
hot come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick
quick that i may lay my head in thy lap
lady p go ye giddy goose
the music plays
hot now i perceive the devil understands welsh
and 'tis no marvel be is so humorous
by'r lady he is a good musician
altogether governd by humours lie still ye thief and hear the
lady sing in welsh
hot i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish
lady p wouldst thou have thy head broken
hot no
lady p then be still
hot neither 'tis a womans fault
lady p now god help thee
hot to the welsh lady's bed
hot peace she sings
here the lady sings a welsh song
come kate i'll have your song too
lady p not mine in good sooth
hot not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a
comfit maker's wife 'not you in good sooth' and 'as true as i
live' and 'as god shall mend me' and 'as sure as day'
and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
as if thou ne'er walk'st further than finsbury
a good mouth filling oath and leave 'in sooth'
and such protest of pepper gingerbread
to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing
lady p i will not sing
hot 'tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher an
the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so
come in when ye will exit

as hot lord percy is on fire to go
and then to horse immediately
mort with all my heart
empty
scene ii
london the palace
enter the king prince of wales and others
king lords give us leave the prince of wales and i
must have some private conference but be near at hand
for we shall presently have need of you
i know not whether god will have it so
for some displeasing service i have done
that in his secret doom out of my blood
he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
but thou dost in thy passages of life
make me believe that thou art only mark'd
for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings tell me else
could such inordinate and low desires
such barren pleasures rude society
as thou art match'd withal and grafted to
accompany the greatness of thy blood
and hold their level with thy princely heart
prince so please your majesty i would i could
quit all offences with as clear excuse
as well as i am doubtless i can purge
myself of many i am charged withal
yet such extenuation let me beg
which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
i may for some things true wherein my youth
hath faulty wand'red and irregular
and pardon on lily true submission
king god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry
at thy affections which do hold a wing
quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
and art almost an alien to the hearts
of all the court and princes of my blood
the hope and expectation of thy time
is ruind and the soul of every man
prophetically do forethink thy fall
had i so lavish of my presence been
so common hackney'd in the eyes of men
so stale and cheap to vulgar company
opinion that did help me to the crown
and left me in reputeless banishment
a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
by being seldom seen i could not stir
but like a comet i was wond'red at
that men would tell their children 'this is he'
others would say 'where which is bolingbroke'
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
and dress'd myself in such humility
that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts
even in the presence of the crowned king
thus did i keep my person fresh and new
my presence like a robe pontifical
ne'er seen but wond'red at and so my state
seldom but sumptuous show'd like a feast
and won by rareness such solemnity
the skipping king he ambled up and down
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
had his great name profaned with their scorns
and gave his countenance against his name
to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
of every beardless vain comparative
grew a companion to the common streets
enfeoff'd himself to popularity
that being dally swallowed by mens eyes
they surfeited with honey and began
to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
so when he had occasion to be seen
he was but as the cuckoo is in june
heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
as sick and blunted with community
afford no extraordinary gaze
such as is bent on unlike majesty
when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
but rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down
slept in his face and rend'red such aspect
being with his presence glutted gorg'd and full
and in that very line harry standest thou
for thou hast lost thy princely privilege
with vile participation not an eye
but is aweary of thy common sight
save mine which hath desir'd to see thee more
which now doth that i would not have it do
make blind itself with foolish tenderness
prince i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
king for all the world
as thou art to this hour was richard then
when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh
and even as i was then is percy now
now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
he hath more worthy interest to the state
than thou the shadow of succession
for of no right nor colour like to right
he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
and being no more in debt to years than thou
leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
to bloody battles and to bruising arms
what never dying honour hath he got
against renowmed douglas whose high deeds
whose hot incursions and great name in arms
holds from all soldiers chief majority
and military title capital
through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
this infant warrior in his enterprises
discomfited great douglas ta'en him once
enlarged him and made a friend of him
to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
and shake the peace and safety of our throne
and what say you to this percy northumberland
the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer
capitulate against us and are up
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
which art my nearest and dearest enemy'
thou that art like enough through vassal fear
base inclination and the start of spleen
to fight against me under percy's pay
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
to show how much thou art degenerate
prince do not think so you shall not find it so
and god forgive them that so much have sway'd
your majesty's good thoughts away from me
and in the closing of some glorious day
be bold to tell you that i am your son
when i will wear a garment all of blood
and stain my favours in a bloody mask
which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
and that shall be the day whene'er it lights
that this same child of honour and renown
this gallant hotspur this all praised knight
and your unthought of harry chance to meet
would they were multitudes and on my head
my shames redoubled for the time will come
that i shall make this northern youth exchange
his glorious deeds for my indignities
percy is but my factor good my lord
to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
and i will call hall to so strict account
that he shall render every glory up
yea even the slightest worship of his time
this in the name of god i promise here
the which if he be pleas'd i shall perform
i do beseech your majesty may salve
the long grown wounds of my intemperance
if not the end of life cancels all bands
and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
king a hundred thousand rebels die in this
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed
blunt so hath the business that i come to speak of
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word
that douglas and the english rebels met
the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury
a mighty and a fearful head they are

act iv scene i
the rebel camp near shrewsbury
enter harry hotspur worcester and douglas
hot well said my noble scot if speaking truth
such attribution should the douglas have
as not a soldier of this seasons stamp
should go so general current through the world
by god i cannot flatter i defy
the tongues of soothers but a braver place
in my heart's love hath no man than yourself
nay task me to my word approve me lord
doug thou art the king of honour
no man so potent breathes upon the ground
enter one with letters
hot do so and 'tis well
what letters hast thou there i can but thank you
messenger these letters come from your father
hot letters from him why comes he not himself
mess he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
hot zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
in such a justling time who leads his power
under whose government come they along
wor i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
mess he did my lord four days ere i set forth
and at the time of my departure thence
he was much fear'd by his physicians
wor i would the state of time had first been whole
ere he by sickness had been visited
his health was never better worth than now
hot sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
the very lifeblood of our enterprise
he writes me here that inward sickness
and that his friends by deputation could not
so soon be drawn no did he think it meet
to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
on any soul remov'd but on his own
yet doth he give us bold advertisement
that with our small conjunction we should on
to see how fortune is dispos'd to us
for as he writes there is no quailing now
of all our purposes what say you to it
wor your father's sickness is a maim to us
hot a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
and yet in faith it is not his present want
seems more than we shall find it were it good
to set the exact wealth of all our states
all at one cast to set so rich a man
on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
it were not good for therein should we read
the very list the very utmost bound
of all our fortunes
doug faith and so we should
where now remains a sweet reversion
we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
is to come in
a comfort of retirement lives in this
hot a rendezvous a home to fly unto
if that the devil and mischance look big
wor but yet i would your father had been here
the quality and hair of our attempt
brooks no division it will be thought
by some that know not why he is away
that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
and think how such an apprehension
may turn the tide of fearful faction
and breed a kind of question in our cause
must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
and stop all sight holes every loop from whence
the eye of reason may pry in upon us
this absence of your father's draws a curtain
that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
before not dreamt of
hot you strain too far
i rather of his absence make this use
it lends a lustre and more great opinion
than if the earl were here for men must think
if we without his help can make a head
to push against a kingdom with his help
we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down
yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
doug as heart can think there is not such a word
spoke of in scotland as this term of fear
enter sir richard vernon
hot my cousin vernon welcome by my soul
the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong
is marching hitherwards with him prince john
hot no harm what more
ver and further i have learnd
the king himself in person is set forth
or hitherwards intended speedily
with strong and mighty preparation
hot he shall be welcome too where is his son
the nimble footed madcap prince of wales
and bid it pass
ver all furnish'd all in arms
all plum'd like estridges that with the wind
bated like eagles having lately bath'd
glittering in golden coats like images
as full of spirit as the month of may
and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
i saw young harry with his beaver on
rise from the ground like feathered mercury
and vaulted with such ease into his seat
as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
to turn and wind a fiery pegasus
and witch the world with noble horsemanship
hot no more no more worse than the sun in march
this praise doth nourish agues let them come
they come like sacrifices in their trim
and to the fire ey'd maid of smoky war
the mailed mars shall on his altar sit
up to the ears in blood i am on fire
to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
and yet not ours come let me taste my horse
who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
against the bosom of the prince of wales
harry to harry shall hot horse to horse
meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse
that glendower were come
i learnd in worcester as i rode along
he cannot draw his power this fourteen days
doug that's the worst tidings that i hear of yet
wor ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
hot what may the king's whole battle reach unto
ver to thirty thousand
hot forty let it be
my father and glendower being both away
the powers of us may serve so great a day
doomsday is near die all die merrily
doug talk not of dying i am out of fear
of death or death's hand for this one half year
empty

banes such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lieve hear the
devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than
a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck i press'd me none but such
toasts and butter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than
pins' heads and they have bought out their services and now my
whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants
gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as lazarus in the
such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust
serving men younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters
and ostlers trade falln the cankers of a calm world and a long
peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old fac'd
ancient and such have i to fill up the rooms of them that have
bought out their services that you would think that i had a
hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine keeping from eating draff and husks a mad fellow met me
on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and
not march through coventry with them that's flat nay and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on
for indeed i had the most of them out of prison there's but a
shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two
napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a
herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth
stoln from my host at saint albans or the red nose innkeeper
of daventry but that's all one they'll find linen enough on
every hedge

ribs bare but sirrah make haste percy 's already in the

hot why say you so looks he no for supply
ver so do we
wor good cousin be advis'd stir not to night
ver do not my lord
doug you do not counsel well
you speak it out of fear and cold heart
ver do me no slander douglas by my life

as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
which of us fears
doug yea or to night
ver content
hot to night say i
come come it may not be i wonder much
being men of such great leading as you are
that you foresee not what impediments
drag back our expedition certain horse
of my cousin vernons are not yet come up
and now their pride and mettle is asleep
their courage with hard labour tame and dull
that not a horse is half the half of himself
hot so are the horses of the enemy
in general journey bated and brought low
the better part of ours are full of rest
wor the number of the king exceedeth ours
for god's sake cousin stay till all come in
the trumpet sounds a parley
blunt i come with gracious offers from the king
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
hot welcome sir walter blunt and would to god
you were of our determination
some of us love you well and even those some
envy your great deservings and good name
because you are not of our quality
but stand against us like an enemy
blunt and god defend but still i should stand so
you stand against anointed majesty
but to my charge the king hath sent to know
the nature of your griefs and whereupon
you conjure from the breast of civil peace
such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
audacious cruelty if that the king
have any way your good deserts forgot
which he confesseth to be manifold
he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
and pardon absolute for yourself and these
herein misled by your suggestion
hot the king is kind and well we know the king
knows at what time to promise when to pay
my father and my uncle and myself
did give him that same royalty he wears
and when he was not six and twenty strong
sick in the world's regard wretched and low
a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
and when he heard him swear and vow to god
he came but to be duke of lancaster
to sue his livery and beg his peace
with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
my father in kind heart and pity mov'd
swore him assistance and performed it too
now when the lords and barons of the realm
perceiv'd northumberland did lean to him
the more and less came in with cap and knee
attended him on bridges stood in lanes
laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
give him their heirs as pages followed him
even at the heels in golden multitudes
he presently as greatness knows itself
steps me a little higher than his vow
made to my father while his blood was poor
upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh
and now forsooth takes on him to reform
that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
cries out upon abuses seems to weep
over his country's wrongs and by this face
this seeming brow of justice did he win
the hearts of all that he did angle for
proceeded further cut me off the heads
of all the favourites that the absent king
in deputation left behind him here
when he was personal in the irish war
hot then to the point
in short time after lie depos'd the king
soon after that depriv'd him of his life
and in the neck of that task'd the whole state
to make that worse suff'red his kinsman march
who is if every owner were well placid
indeed his king to be engag'd in wales
there without ransom to lie forfeited
disgrac'd me in my happy victories
rated mine uncle from the council board
in rage dismiss'd my father from the court
broke an oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
and in conclusion drove us to seek out
this head of safety and withal to pry
into his title the which we find
too indirect for long continuance
blunt shall i return this answer to the king
hot not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile
some surety for a safe return again
and in the morning early shall mine uncle
bring him our purposes and so farewell
blunt i would you would accept of grace and love
hot and may be so we shall
blunt pray god you do

sir m my good lord
i guess their tenour
arch like enough you do
to morrow good sir michael is a day
must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury
as i am truly given to understand
the king with mighty and quick raised power
meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael
what with the sickness of northumberland
whose power was in the first proportion
and what with owen glendower's absence thence
who with them was a rated sinew too
and comes not in overruld by prophecies
to wage an instant trial with the king
sir m why my good lord you need not fear
there is douglas and lord mortimer
arch no mortimer is not there
sir m but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy
and there is my lord of worcester and a head
of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
arch and so there is but yet the king hath drawn
the special head of all the land together
the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt
and many moe corrivals and dear men
of estimation and command in arms
sir m doubt not my lord they shall be well oppos'd
arch i hope no less yet needful 'tis to fear
and to prevent the worst sir michael speed
for if lord percy thrive not ere the king
dismiss his power he means to visit us
for he hath heard of our confederacy
therefore make haste i must go write again
to other friends and so farewell sir michael

in richard's time and posted day and night
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
when yet you were in place and in account
nothing so strong and fortunate as i
it was myself my brother and his son
that brought you home and boldly did outdare
and you did swear that oath at doncaster
that you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state
nor claim no further than your new falln right
the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
to this we swore our aid but in short space
it it raind down fortune show'ring on your head
and such a flood of greatness fell on you
what with our help what with the absent king
what with the injuries of a wanton time
and the contrarious winds that held the king
so long in his unlucky irish wars
that all in england did repute him dead
and from this swarm of fair advantages
you took occasion to be quickly woo'd
to gripe the general sway into your hand
forgot your oath to us at doncaster
and being fed by us you us'd us so
as that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
that even our love thirst not come near your sight
for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
we were enforc'd for safety sake to fly
out of your sight and raise this present head
whereby we stand opposed by such means
as you yourself have forg'd against yourself
by unkind usage dangerous countenance
and violation of all faith and troth
king these things indeed you have articulate
proclaim'd at market crosses read in churches
to face the garment of rebellion
with some fine colour that may please the eye
of fickle changelings and poor discontents
which gape and rub the elbow at the news
of hurlyburly innovation
and never yet did insurrection want
such water colours to impaint his cause
of pell mell havoc and confusion
prince in both our armies there is many a soul
shall pay full dearly for this encounter
if once they join in trial tell your nephew
the prince of wales doth join with all the world
in praise of henry percy by my hopes
this present enterprise set off his head
i do not think a braver gentleman
more active valiant or more valiant young
to grace this latter age with noble deeds
for my part i may speak it to my shame
i have a truant been to chivalry
and so i hear he doth account me too
yet this before my father's majesty
i am content that he shall take the odds
of his great name and estimation
and will to save the blood on either side
try fortune with him in a single fight
albeit considerations infinite
do make against it no good worcester no
we love our people well even those we love
that are misled upon your cousins part
and will they take the offer of our grace
both he and they and you yea every man
shall be my friend again and i'll be his
so tell your cousin and bring me word
what he will do but if he will not yield
and they shall do their office so be gone
we will not now be troubled with reply
we offer fair take it advisedly
exit worcester with vernon
prince it will not be accepted on my life
the douglas and the hotspur both together
are confident against the world in arms
king hence therefore every leader to his charge
for on their answer will we set on them
exeunt manent prince falstaff
fal hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so
'tis a point of friendship
prince nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
say thy prayers and farewell
fal i would 'twere bedtime hal and all well
prince why thou owest god a death
empty
fal 'tis not due yet i would be loath to pay him before his day
'tis no matter honour pricks me on yea but how if honour prick
me off when i come on how then can honor set to a leg no or
an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no honour hath no
skill in surgery then no what is honour a word what is that
word honour air a trim reckoning who hath it he that died a
wednesday doth he feel it no doth be bear it no 'tis
insensible then yea to the dead but will it not live with the
living no why detraction will not suffer it therefore i'll
none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism
scene ii
the rebel camp
enter worcester and sir richard vernon
wor o no my nephew must not know sir richard
the liberal and kind offer of the king
ver 'twere best he did
wor then are we all undone
it is not possible it cannot be
the king should keep his word in loving us
to punish this offence in other faults
suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
for treason is but trusted like the fox
who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
will have a wild trick of his ancestors
look how we can or sad or merrily
interpretation will misquote our looks
and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
the better cherish'd still the nearer death
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
and an adopted name of privilege
a hare brained hotspur governd by a spleen
all his offences live upon my head
and on his father's we did train him on
and his corruption being taken from us
we as the spring of all shall pay for all
therefore good cousin let not harry know
in any case the offer of the king
ver deliver what you will i'll say 'tis so
here comes your cousin
hot my uncle is returnd
deliver up my lord of westmoreland
uncle what news
wor the king will bid you battle presently
doug defy him by the lord of westmoreland
hot lord douglas go you and tell him so
doug marry and shall and very willingly
wor there is no seeming mercy in the king
hot did you beg any god forbid
wor i told him gently of our grievances
of his oath breaking which he mended thus
by now forswearing that he is forsworn
he calls us rebels traitors aid will scourge
with haughty arms this hateful name in us
enter douglas
doug arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown
and westmoreland that was engag'd did bear it
which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
wor the prince of wales stepp'd forth before the king
and nephew challeng'd you to single fight
hot o would the quarrel lay upon our heads
and that no man might draw short breath to day
but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me
how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt
no by my soul i never in my life
unless a brother should a brother dare
to gentle exercise and proof of arms
he gave you all the duties of a man
trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
spoke your deservings like a chronicle
making you ever better than his praise
by still dispraising praise valued with you
and which became him like a prince indeed
he made a blushing cital of himself
as if lie mast'red there a double spirit
of teaching and of learning instantly
there did he pause but let me tell the world
if he outlive the envy of this day
england did never owe so sweet a hope
so much misconstrued in his wantonness
hot cousin i think thou art enamoured
upon his follies never did i hear
of any prince so wild a libertine
i will embrace him with a soldier's arm
that he shall shrink under my courtesy
arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
better consider what you have to do

can lift your blood up with persuasion
enter a messenger
mess my lord here are letters for you
hot i cannot read them now
to spend that shortness basely were too long

if die brave death when princes die with us
now for our consciences the arms are fair
when the intent of bearing them is just
enter another messenger

to end the one of us and would to god
thy name in arms were now as great as mine

but thoughts the slave of life and life time's fool
and time that takes survey of all the world
but that the earthy and cold hand of death
lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust
and food for dies
prince for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart
ill weav'd ambition how much art thou shrunk
when that this body did contain a spirit
a kingdom for it was too small a bound
but now two paces of the vilest earth
is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
if thou wert sensible of courtesy
i should not make so dear a show of zeal
but let my favours hide thy mangled face
and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself
for doing these fair rites of tenderness
adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
but not rememb'red in thy epitaph

i could have better spar'd a better man

falstaff riseth up
powder me and eat me too to morrow 'sblood 'twas time to
counterfeit or that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot
too counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die is to be a
counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not
the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image
of life indeed the better part of valour is discretion in the
which better part i have saved my life zounds i am afraid of
this gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he should
prove the better counterfeit therefore i'll make him sure yea
and i'll swear i killd him why may not he rise as well as i

without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st
fal no that's certain i am not a double man but if i be not
jack falstaff then am i a jack there 's percy if your father
will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next percy
prince why percy i killd myself and saw thee dead
fal didst thou lord lord how this world is given to lying i
grant you i was down and out of breath and so was he but we
rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury
clock if i may be believ'd so if not let them that should
reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take it
upon my death i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man
were alive and would deny it zounds i would make him eat a
piece of my sword
prince this is the strangest fellow brother john

for my part if a lie may do thee grace

northumberland what news lord bardolph every minute now
should be the father of some stratagem
full of high feeding madly hath broke loose

lord bardolph noble earl
i bring you certain news from shrewsbury
northumberland good an god will
lord bardolph as good as heart can wish
the king is almost wounded to the death
and in the fortune of my lord your son
prince harry slain outright and both the blunts
and westmoreland and stafford fled the field
and harry monmouth's brawn the hulk sir john
is prisoner to your son o such a day
so fought so followed and so fairly won
came not till now to dignify the times

saw you the field came you from shrewsbury
lord bardolph i spake with one my lord that came from thence
that freely rend'red me these news for true
enter travers
northumberland here comes my servant travers whom i sent
on tuesday last to listen after news
lord bardolph my lord i over rode him on the way
and he is furnish'd with no certainties
more than he haply may retail from me
northumberland now travers what good tidings comes with you
travers my lord sir john umfrevile turnd me back
out rode me after him came spurring hard
a gentleman almost forspent with speed
that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
he ask'd the way to chester and of him
i did demand what news from shrewsbury
he told me that rebellion had bad luck
and that young harry percy's spur was cold
with that he gave his able horse the head
and bending forward struck his armed heels
up to the rowel head and starting so
he seem'd in running to devour the way
staying no longer question
northumberland ha again
said he young harry percy's spur was cold
of hotspur coldspur that rebellion
had met ill luck
lord bardolph my lord i'll tell you what
if my young lord your son have not the day
i'll give my barony never talk of it
northumberland why should that gentleman that rode by travers
give then such instances of loss
lord bardolph who he
he was some hilding fellow that had stoln
the horse he rode on and upon my life
spoke at a venture look here comes more news
enter morton
northumberland yea this mans brow like to a title leaf
so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
hath left a witness'd usurpation
say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
morton i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord
where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
to fright our party
northumberland how doth my son and brother
thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
so dull so dread in look so woe begone
drew priam's curtain in the dead of night
and would have told him half his troy was burnt
but priam found the fire ere he his tongue
and i my percy's death ere thou report'st it
this thou wouldst say 'your son did thus and thus
your brother thus so fought the noble douglas'
stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
but in the end to stop my ear indeed
ending with 'brother son and all are dead'
morton douglas is living and your brother yet
but for my lord your son
northumberland why he is dead
see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
he that but fears the thing he would not know
hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
that what he fear'd is chanced yet speak morton
tell thou an earl his divination lies
and make thee rich for doing me such wrong
morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid
your spirit is too true your fears too certain
northumberland yet for all this say not that percy's dead
i see a strange confession in thine eye
thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
to speak a truth if he be slain say so
the tongue offends not that reports his death
and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
hath but a losing office and his tongue
sounds ever after as a sullen bell
rememb'red tolling a departing friend
lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead
morton i am sorry i should force you to believe
that which i would to god i had not seen
but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
rend'ring faint quittance wearied and out breath'd
the never daunted percy to the earth
from whence with life he never more sprung up
in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
even to the dullest peasant in his camp
being bruited once took fire and heat away
from the best temper'd courage in his troops
for from his metal was his party steeled
which once in him abated an the rest
turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
so did our men heavy in hotspur's loss
lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
fly from the field then was that noble worcester
too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious scot
the bloody douglas whose well labouring sword
had three times slain th' appearance of the king
of those that turnd their backs and in his flight
stumbling in fear was took the sum of all
is that the king hath won and hath sent out
a speedy power to encounter you my lord
under the conduct of young lancaster
and westmoreland this is the news at full
northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn
in poison there is physic and these news
having been well that would have made me sick
and as the wretch whose fever weak'ned joints
like strengthless hinges buckle under life
impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
weak'ned with grief being now enrag'd with grief
are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif
thou art a guard too wanton for the head
now bind my brows with iron and approach
the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
to frown upon th' enrag'd northumberland
let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
keep the wild flood confind let order die
and let this world no longer be a stage
to feed contention in a ling'ring act
but let one spirit of the first born cain
reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
and darkness be the burier of the dead
lord bardolph this strained passion doth you wrong my lord
morton sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
the lives of all your loving complices
lean on your health the which if you give o'er
to stormy passion must perforce decay
you cast th' event of war my noble lord
and summ'd the account of chance before you said
'let us make head' it was your pre surmise
you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
more likely to fall in than to get o'er
you were advis'd his flesh was capable
of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd
yet did you say 'go forth' and none of this
though strongly apprehended could restrain
the stiff borne action what hath then befalln
or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
lord bardolph we all that are engaged to this loss
knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
that if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one
and yet we ventur'd for the gain propos'd
chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd
and since we are o'erset venture again
come we will put forth body and goods
morton 'tis more than time and my most noble lord
i hear for certain and dare speak the truth
with well appointed pow'rs he is a man
who with a double surety binds his followers
my lord your son had only but the corpse
but shadows and the shows of men to fight
for that same word 'rebellion did divide
the action of their bodies from their souls
and they did fight with queasiness constraind
as men drink potions that their weapons only
seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
as fish are in a pond but now the bishop
turns insurrection to religion
suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts
he's follow'd both with body and with mind
and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
of fair king richard scrap'd from pomfret stones
derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
gasping for life under great bolingbroke
northumberland i knew of this before but to speak truth
this present grief had wip'd it from my mind
go in with me and counsel every man
the aptest way for safety and revenge
get posts and letters and make friends with speed
never so few and never yet more need exeunt

page he said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but
for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he
knew for
falstaff men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of
this foolish compounded clay man is not able to invent anything
that intends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on
me i am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in
other men i do here walk before thee like a sow that hath
overwhelm'd all her litter but one if the prince put thee into
have no judgment thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be
worn in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never mannd with
an agate till now but i will inset you neither in gold nor
silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your
master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose
chin is not yet fledge i will sooner have a beard grow in the
palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he
will not stick to say his face is a face royal god may finish it
when he will 'tis not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at
and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his
father was a bachelor he may keep his own grace but he's almost
out of mine i can assure him what said master dommelton about
the satin for my short cloak and my slops
page he said sir you should procure him better assurance than
bardolph he would not take his band and yours he liked not the
empty
falstaff let him be damnd like the glutton pray god his tongue
be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascal yea forsooth knave to
whoreson smooth pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with
them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security i
had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop
it with security i look'd 'a should have sent me two and twenty
yards of satin as i am a true knight and he sends me security
well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of
abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and
yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
page he's gone into smithfield to buy your worship horse
falstaff i bought him in pauls and he'll buy me a horse in
smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the stews i were
mannd hors'd and wiv'd

prince for striking him about bardolph

shrewsbury and as i hear is now going with some charge to the
lord john of lancaster
chief justice what to york call him back again

chief justice i am sure he is to the hearing of anything good
servant sir john
falstaff what a young knave and begging is there not wars is
there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the
rebels need soldiers though it be a shame to be on any side but
one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were
it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
servant you mistake me sir
falstaff why sir did i say you were an honest man setting my
knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied in my throat if i
servant i pray you sir then set your knighthood and your
soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your
throat if you say i am any other than an honest man
falstaff i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that which
grows to me if thou get'st any leave of me hang me if thou
tak'st leave thou wert better be hang'd you hunt counter
hence avaunt
servant sir my lord would speak with you
chief justice sir john falstaff a word with you
am glad to see your lordship abroad i heard say your lordship
was sick i hope your lordship goes abroad by advice your
lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack
of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and i most
humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
empty
chief justice sir john i sent for you before your expedition to
empty
falstaff ant please your lordship i hear his majesty is returnd
chief justice i talk not of his majesty you would not come when i
sent for you
falstaff and i hear moreover his highness is falln into this
same whoreson apoplexy
chief justice well god mend him i pray you let me speak with you
falstaff this apoplexy as i take it is a kind of lethargy ant
please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson
empty
chief justice what tell you me of it be it as it is
perturbation of the brain i have read the cause of his effects
in galen it is a kind of deafness
chief justice i think you are falln into the disease for you
hear not what i say to you
falstaff very well my lord very well rather ant please you it
is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that
i am troubled withal
chief justice to punish you by the heels would amend the attention
of your ears and i care not if i do become your physician
lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect
of poverty but how i should be your patient to follow your
prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or
indeed a scruple itself
chief justice i sent for you when there were matters against you
for your life to come speak with me
falstaff as i was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws
of this land service i did not come
chief justice well the truth is sir john you live in great
falstaff he that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less
chief justice your means are very slender and your waste is
empty
falstaff i would it were otherwise i would my means were greater
and my waist slenderer
chief justice you have misled the youthful prince
falstaff the young prince hath misled me i am the fellow with the
great belly and he my dog
chief justice well i am loath to gall a new heald wound your
night's exploit on gadshill you may thank th' unquiet time for
your quiet o'erposting that action
falstaff my lord
chief justice but since all is well keep it so wake not a
sleeping wolf
falstaff to wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox
chief justice what you are as a candle the better part burnt
empty
falstaff a wassail candle my lord all tallow if i did say of
chief justice there is not a white hair in your face but should
have his effect of gravity
falstaff his effect of gravy gravy
chief justice you follow the young prince up and down like his
ill angel
falstaff not so my lord your ill angel is light but hope he
that looks upon me will take me without weighing and yet in some
respects i grant i cannot go i cannot tell virtue is of so
little regard in these costermongers' times that true valour is
wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to
man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a
gooseberry you that are old consider not the capacities of us
that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the
bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our
youth must confess are wags too
chief justice do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
that are written down old with all the characters of age have
you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a
your wind short your chin double your wit single and every
part about you blasted with antiquity and will you yet call
yourself young fie fie fie sir john
falstaff my lord i was born about three of the clock in the
afternoon with a white head and something a round belly for my
voice i have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems to
approve my youth further i will not the truth is i am only old
in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for
a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him for
rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord i have check'd
him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes and
sackcloth but in new silk and old sack
chief justice well god send the prince a better companion
falstaff god send the companion a better prince i cannot rid my
hands of him
chief justice well the king hath sever'd you i hear you are
going with lord john of lancaster against the archbishop and the
earl of northumberland
pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home that our armies
join not in a hot day for by the lord i take but two shirts
out with me and i mean not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a
hot day and i brandish anything but a bottle i would i might
never spit white again there is not a dangerous action can peep
out his head but i am thrust upon it well i cannot last ever
but it was alway yet the trick of our english nation if they
have a good thing to make it too common if ye will needs say i
am an old man you should give me rest i would to god my name
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
perpetual motion
chief justice well be honest be honest and god bless your
empty
falstaff will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me
empty
chief justice not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
bear crosses fare you well commend me to my cousin
empty
falstaff if i do fillip me with a three man beetle a man can no
more separate age and covetousness than 'a can part young limbs
and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the
other and so both the degrees prevent my curses boy
page sir
falstaff what money is in my purse
page seven groats and two pence
falstaff i can get no remedy against this consumption of the
purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease
to the prince this to the earl of westmoreland and this to old
mistress ursula whom i have weekly sworn to marry since i
perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin about it you know
where to find me exit page a pox of this gout or a gout of
this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
toe 'tis no matter if i do halt i have the wars for my colour
and my pension shall seem the more reasonable a good wit will
make use of anything i will turn diseases to commodity
empty
york the archbishop's palace
enter the archbishop thomas mowbray the earl marshal lord hastings
and lord bardolph
archbishop thus have you heard our cause and known our means
and my most noble friends i pray you all
speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
and first lord marshal what say you to it
mowbray i well allow the occasion of our amis
but gladly would be better satisfied
to look with forehead bold and big enough
upon the power and puissance of the king
hastings our present musters grow upon the file
to five and twenty thousand men of choice
and our supplies live largely in the hope
of great northumberland whose bosom burns
with an incensed fire of injuries
lord bardolph the question then lord hastings standeth thus
whether our present five and twenty thousand
hastings with him we may
lord bardolph yea marry there's the point
but if without him we be thought too feeble
my judgment is we should not step too far
till we had his assistance by the hand
for in a theme so bloody fac'd as this
conjecture expectation and surmise
of aids incertain should not be admitted
archbishop 'tis very true lord bardolph for indeed
lord bardolph it was my lord who lind himself with hope
eating the air and promise of supply
flatt'ring himself in project of a power
much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
and so with great imagination
proper to madmen led his powers to death
and winking leapt into destruction
hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt
to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
indeed the instant action a cause on foot
lives so in hope as in an early spring
we see th' appearing buds which to prove fruit
hope gives not so much warrant as despair
that frosts will bite them when we mean to build
we first survey the plot then draw the model
and when we see the figure of the house
then we must rate the cost of the erection
which if we find outweighs ability
in fewer offices or at least desist
to build at all much more in this great work
which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
and set another up should we survey
the plot of situation and the model
consent upon a sure foundation
question surveyors know our own estate
how able such a work to undergo
to weigh against his opposite or else
using the names of men instead of men
like one that draws the model of a house
beyond his power to build it who half through
gives o'er and leaves his part created cost
a naked subject to the weeping clouds
and waste for churlish winter's tyranny
hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
should be still born and that we now possess'd
the utmost man of expectation
even as we are to equal with the king
lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand
hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
for his divisions as the times do brawl
are in three heads one power against the french
and one against glendower perforce a third
must take up us so is the unfirm king
in three divided and his coffers sound
with hollow poverty and emptiness
and come against us in full puissance
need not be dreaded
hastings if he should do so
he leaves his back unarm'd the french and welsh
baying at his heels never fear that
lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither
hastings the duke of lancaster and westmoreland
against the welsh himself and harry monmouth
but who is substituted against the french
archbishop let us on
and publish the occasion of our arms
the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
their over greedy love hath surfeited
an habitation giddy and unsure
hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
o thou fond many with what loud applause
didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke
before he was what thou wouldst have him be
thou beastly feeder art so full of him
that thou provok'st thyself to cast him up
so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
thy glutton bosom of the royal richard
and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
and howlst to find it what trust is in these times
they that when richard liv'd would have him die
are now become enamour'd on his grave
thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
after th' admired heels of bolingbroke
criest now 'o earth yield us that king again
and take thou this' o thoughts of men accurs'd
past and to come seems best things present worst
mowbray shall we go draw our numbers and set on
hastings we are time's subjects and time bids be gone

remember so weak a composition

to know thy face to morrow or to take note how many pair of silk
stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy
peach colour'd ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as

warkworth before the castle
enter northumberland lady northumberland and lady percy
northumberland i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
give even way unto my rough affairs
put not you on the visage of the times
and be like them to percy troublesome
do what you will your wisdom be your guide
northumberland alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
and but my going nothing can redeem it
lady percy o yet for god's sake go not to these wars
the time was father that you broke your word
when you were more endear'd to it than now
when your own percy when my heart's dear harry
threw many a northward look to see his father
bring up his powers but he did long in vain
there were two honours lost yours and your sons
for yours the god of heaven brighten it
for his it stuck upon him as the sun
in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
did all the chivalry of england move
to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
he had no legs that practis'd not his gait
and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
for those who could speak low and tardily
would turn their own perfection to abuse
to seem like him so that in speech in gait
in diet in affections of delight
in military rules humours of blood
he was the mark and glass copy and book
that fashiond others and him o wondrous him
o miracle of men him did you leave
second to none unseconded by you
in disadvantage to abide a field
where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name
did seem defensible so you left him
never o never do his ghost the wrong
to hold your honour more precise and nice
with others than with him let them alone
the marshal and the archbishop are strong
had my sweet harry had but half their numbers
to day might i hanging on hotspur's neck
northumberland beshrew your heart
fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
with new lamenting ancient oversights
but i must go and meet with danger there
or it will seek me in another place
and find me worse provided
lady northumberland o fly to scotland
till that the nobles and the armed commons
have of their puissance made a little taste
then join you with them like a rib of steel
to make strength stronger but for all our loves
first let them try themselves so did your son
he was so suff'red so came i a widow
and never shall have length of life enough
to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
for recordation to my noble husband
northumberland come come go in with me 'tis with my mind
that makes a still stand running neither way
fain would i go to meet the archbishop
but many thousand reasons hold me back
i will resolve for scotland there am i
till time and vantage crave my company exeunt

enter the king in his nightgown with a page
king go call the earls of surrey and of warwick
but ere they come bid them o'er read these letters
and well consider of them make good speed exit page
how many thousands of my poorest subjects
are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep
nature's soft nurse how have i frightened thee
that thou no more will weigh my eyelids down
and steep my senses in forgetfulness
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
and hush'd with buzzing night flies to thy slumber
than in the perfum'd chambers of the great
under the canopies of costly state
and lulld with sound of sweetest melody
o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
in loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch
a watch case or a common 'larum bell
wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
in cradle of the rude imperious surge
and in the visitation of the winds
who take the ruffian billows by the top
curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
with deafing clamour in the slippery clouds
that with the hurly death itself awakes
canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose
to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude
and in the calmest and most stillest night
deny it to a king then happy low lie down
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
enter warwick and surrey
warwick many good morrows to your majesty
king is it good morrow lords
warwick 'tis one o'clock and past
king why then good morrow to you all my lords
have you read o'er the letters that i sent you
warwick we have my liege
how foul it is what rank diseases grow
and with what danger near the heart of it
warwick it is but as a body yet distempered
which to his former strength may be restored
with good advice and little medicine
my lord northumberland will soon be coold
king o god that one might read the book of fate
and see the revolution of the times
make mountains level and the continent
into the sea and other times to see
the beachy girdle of the ocean
too wide for neptune's hips how chances mock
and changes fill the cup of alteration
with divers liquors o if this were seen
the happiest youth viewing his progress through
what perils past what crosses to ensue
would shut the book and sit him down and die
'tis not ten years gone
did feast together and in two years after
were they at wars it is but eight years since
this percy was the man nearest my soul
who like a brother toild in my affairs
and laid his love and life under my foot
yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard
gave him defiance but which of you was by
to warwick you cousin nevil as i may remember
when richard with his eye brim full of tears
did speak these words now prov'd a prophecy
'northumberland thou ladder by the which
my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne'
though then god knows i had no such intent
but that necessity so bow'd the state
that i and greatness were compelld to kiss
'the time shall come' thus did he follow it
'the time will come that foul sin gathering head
shall break into corruption so went on
and the division of our amity
warwick there is a history in all mens lives
figuring the natures of the times deceas'd
the which observ'd a man may prophesy
with a near aim of the main chance of things
as yet not come to life who in their seeds
and weak beginning lie intreasured
such things become the hatch and brood of time
and by the necessary form of this
that great northumberland then false to him
would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
which should not find a ground to root upon
unless on you
king are these things then necessities
then let us meet them like necessities
and that same word even now cries out on us
they say the bishop and northumberland
are fifty thousand strong
rumour doth double like the voice and echo
the numbers of the feared please it your grace
to go to bed upon my soul my lord
the powers that you already have sent forth
shall bring this prize in very easily
to comfort you the more i have receiv'd
a certain instance that glendower is dead
your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
and these unseasoned hours perforce must ad

act iv scene i
yorkshire within the forest of gaultree
enter the archbishop of york mowbray hastings and others
archbishop what is this forest calld
hastings 'tis gaultree forest ant shall please your grace
archbishop here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
hastings we have sent forth already
archbishop 'tis well done
my friends and brethren in these great affairs
i must acquaint you that i have receiv'd
new dated letters from northumberland
their cold intent tenour and substance thus
here doth he wish his person with such powers
as might hold sortance with his quality
the which he could not levy whereupon
to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
that your attempts may overlive the hazard
and fearful meeting of their opposite
mowbray thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
and dash themselves to pieces
enter a messenger
hastings now what news
messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile
in goodly form comes on the enemy
upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out
let us sway on and face them in the field
enter westmoreland
archbishop what well appointed leader fronts us here
mowbray i think it is my lord of westmoreland
westmoreland health and fair greeting from our general
the prince lord john and duke of lancaster
archbishop say on my lord of westmoreland in peace
westmoreland then my lord
unto your grace do i in chief address
the substance of my speech if that rebellion
came like itself in base and abject routs
led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
and countenanc'd by boys and beggary
i say if damnd commotion so appear'd
in his true native and most proper shape
you reverend father and these noble lords
of base and bloody insurrection
with your fair honours you lord archbishop
whose see is by a civil peace maintaind
whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
whose white investments figure innocence
the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
turning your books to graves your ink to blood
your pens to lances and your tongue divine
to a loud trumpet and a point of war
archbishop wherefore do i this so the question stands
briefly to this end we are all diseas'd
and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
have brought ourselves into a burning fever
and we must bleed for it of which disease
our late king richard being infected died
i take not on me here as a physician
nor do i as an enemy to peace
troop in the throngs of military men
but rather show awhile like fearful war
to diet rank minds sick of happiness
and purge th' obstructions which begin to stop
our very veins of life hear me more plainly
i have in equal balance justly weigh'd
what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
we see which way the stream of time doth run
and are enforc'd from our most quiet there
by the rough torrent of occasion
and have the summary of all our griefs
when time shall serve to show in articles
which long ere this we offer'd to the king
and might by no suit gain our audience
when we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
we are denied access unto his person
the dangers of the days but newly gone
whose memory is written on the earth
with yet appearing blood and the examples
of every minute's instance present now
hath put us in these ill beseeming arms
not to break peace or any branch of it
but to establish here a peace indeed
concurring both in name and quality
westmoreland when ever yet was your appeal denied
what peer hath been subornd to grate on you
that you should seal this lawless bloody book
of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine
and consecrate commotions bitter edge
archbishop my brother general the commonwealth
to brother horn an household cruelty
i make my quarrel in particular
westmoreland there is no need of any such redress
or if there were it not belongs to you
that feel the bruises of the days before
and suffer the condition of these times
to lay a heavy and unequal hand
upon our honours
westmoreland o my good lord mowbray
construe the times to their necessities
and you shall say indeed it is the time
and not the king that doth you injuries
yet for your part it not appears to me
that you should have an inch of any ground
to build a grief on were you not restor'd
to all the duke of norfolk's signiories
your noble and right well rememb'red father's
mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost
that need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me
the king that lov'd him as the state stood then
was force perforce compelld to banish him
and then that henry bolingbroke and he
their neighing coursers daring of the spur
their armed staves in charge their beavers down
their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
and the loud trumpet blowing them together
then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
my father from the breast of bolingbroke
o when the king did throw his warder down
his own life hung upon the staff he threw
then threw he down himself and all their lives
have since miscarried under bolingbroke
westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
the earl of hereford was reputed then
in england the most valiant gentleman
who knows on whom fortune would then have smild
but if your father had been victor there
he ne'er had borne it out of coventry
for all the country in a general voice
cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
and bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the king
but this is mere digression from my purpose
here come i from our princely general
to know your griefs to tell you from his grace
that he will give you audience and wherein
it shall appear that your demands are just
you shall enjoy them everything set off
that might so much as think you enemies
mowbray but he hath forc'd us to compel this offer
westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so
this offer comes from mercy not from fear
for lo within a ken our army lies
upon mine honour all too confident
to give admittance to a thought of fear
our battle is more full of names than yours
our men more perfect in the use of arms
our armour all as strong our cause the best
then reason will our hearts should be as good
mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley
westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence
a rotten case abides no handling
hastings hath the prince john a full commission
in very ample virtue of his father
to hear and absolutely to determine
of what conditions we shall stand upon
westmoreland that is intended in the generals name
i muse you make so slight a question
for this contains our general grievances
each several article herein redress'd
all members of our cause both here and hence
that are insinewed to this action
acquitted by a true substantial form
and present execution of our wills
to us and to our purposes confind
we come within our awful banks again
and knit our powers to the arm of peace
in sight of both our battles we may meet
and either end in peace which god so frame
or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
which must decide it
archbishop my lord we will do so exit westmoreland
mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me
that no conditions of our peace can stand
hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace
upon such large terms and so absolute
our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such
that every slight and false derived cause
yea every idle nice and wanton reason
shall to the king taste of this action
that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
we shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
and good from bad find no partition
of dainty and such picking grievances
for he hath found to end one doubt by death
revives two greater in the heirs of life
and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
and keep no tell tale to his memory
that may repeat and history his los
to new remembrance for full well he knows
he cannot so precisely weed this land
as his misdoubts present occasion
that plucking to unfix an enemy
he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
so that this land like an offensive wife
that hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes
as he is striking holds his infant up
and hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
that was uprear'd to execution
hastings besides the king hath wasted all his rods
on late offenders that he now doth lack
so that his power like to a fangless lion
may offer but not hold
archbishop 'tis very true
and therefore be assur'd my good lord marshal
if we do now make our atonement well
our peace will like a broken limb united
grow stronger for the breaking
mowbray be it so
here is returnd my lord of westmoreland
westmoreland the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship
to meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies
mowbray your grace of york in god's name then set forward
archbishop before and greet his grace my lord we come

another part of the forest
enter from one side mowbray attended afterwards the archbishop
hastings and others from the other side prince john of lancaster
prince john you are well encount'red here my cousin mowbray
good day to you gentle lord archbishop
and so to you lord hastings and to all
my lord of york it better show'd with you
when that your flock assembled by the bell
encircled you to hear with reverence
your exposition on the holy text
than now to see you here an iron man
cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
that man that sits within a monarch's heart
and ripens in the sunshine of his favour
would he abuse the countenance of the king
alack what mischiefs might he set abroach
in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop
it is even so who hath not heard it spoken
how deep you were within the books of god
to us the speaker in his parliament
to us th' imagind voice of god himself
between the grace the sanctities of heaven
and our dull workings o who shall believe
but you misuse the reverence of your place
employ the countenance and grace of heav'n
as a false favourite doth his prince's name
in deeds dishonourable you have ta'en up
under the counterfeited zeal of god
the subjects of his substitute my father
and both against the peace of heaven and him
archbishop good my lord of lancaster
i am not here against your father's peace
but as i told my lord of westmoreland
the time misord'red doth in common sense
crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
to hold our safety up i sent your grace
the parcels and particulars of our grief
the which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court
whereon this hydra son of war is born
with grant of our most just and right desires
and true obedience of this madness cur'd
stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
mowbray if not we ready are to try our fortunes
to the last man
hastings and though we here fall down
we have supplies to second our attempt
if they miscarry theirs shall second them
and so success of mischief shall be born
whiles england shall have generation
prince john you are too shallow hastings much to shallow
to sound the bottom of the after times
westmoreland pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
how far forth you do like their articles
prince john i like them all and do allow them well
and swear here by the honour of my blood
my father's purposes have been mistook
and some about him have too lavishly
my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd
upon my soul they shall if this may please you
discharge your powers unto their several counties
as we will ours and here between the armies
let's drink together friendly and embrace
that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
of our restored love and amity
archbishop i take your princely word for these redresses
prince john i give it you and will maintain my word
hastings go captain and deliver to the army
this news of peace let them have pay and part
i know it will please them hie thee captain
exit officer
archbishop to you my noble lord of westmoreland
westmoreland i pledge your grace and if you knew what pains
i have bestow'd to breed this present peace
you would drink freely but my love to ye
shall show itself more openly hereafter
westmoreland i am glad of it
health to my lord and gentle cousin mowbray
mowbray you wish me health in very happy season
for i am on the sudden something ill
archbishop against ill chances men are ever merry
but heaviness foreruns the good event
westmoreland therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
serves to say thus 'some good thing comes to morrow'
archbishop believe me i am passing light in spirit
shouts within
prince john the word of peace is rend'red hark how they shout
mowbray this had been cheerful after victory
archbishop a peace is of the nature of a conquest
for then both parties nobly are subdu'd
and neither party loser
prince john go my lord
and let our army be discharged too
exit westmoreland
march by us that we may peruse the men
we should have cop'd withal
archbishop go good lord hastings

exit hastings

i do arrest thee traitor of high treason
and you lord archbishop and you lord mowbray
mowbray is this proceeding just and honourable
westmoreland is your assembly so
archbishop will you thus break your faith
prince john i pawnd thee none
i promis'd you redress of these same grievances
whereof you did complain which by mine honour
i will perform with a most christian care

the very extremest inch of possibility i have found'red nine

dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not
love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel
he drinks no wine there's never none of these demure boys come
to any proof for thin drink doth so over cool their blood and
making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male
green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they
are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too
but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two fold
operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all
apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue
which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of
your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before
cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the
badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it
and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes it
illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the
rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital
captain the heart who great and puff'd up with this retinue
doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris so
that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets
it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil
till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes
it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did
naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and
bare land manured husbanded and tilld with excellent
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris
the first humane principle i would teach them should be to
forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack

king now lords if god doth give successful end
to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
we will our youth lead on to higher fields
and draw no swords but what are sanctified
our navy is address'd our power connected
our substitutes in absence well invested
only we want a little personal strength
and pause us till these rebels now afoot

shall soon enjoy
king humphrey my son of gloucester
where is the prince your brother
prince humphrey i think he's gone to hunt my lord at windsor
king and how accompanied
king is not his brother thomas of clarence with him
prince humphrey no my good lord he is in presence here
clarence what would my lord and father
king nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
thou hast a better place in his affection
than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
and noble offices thou mayst effect
between his greatness and thy other brethren
therefore omit him not blunt not his love
nor lose the good advantage of his grace
by seeming cold or careless of his will
for he is gracious if he be observ'd
he hath a tear for pity and a hand
open as day for melting charity
yet notwithstanding being incens'd he is flint
as humorous as winter and as sudden
his temper therefore must be well observ'd
chide him for faults and do it reverently
when you perceive his blood inclind to mirth
but being moody give him line and scope
till that his passions like a whale on ground
confound themselves with working learn this thomas
and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
that the united vessel of their blood
as force perforce the age will pour it in
shall never leak though it do work as strong
as aconitum or rash gunpowder
clarence i shall observe him with all care and love
king why art thou not at windsor with him thomas
clarence he is not there to day he dines in london
king and how accompanied canst thou tell that
clarence with poins and other his continual followers
king most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
is overspread with them therefore my grief
stretches itself beyond the hour of death
the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
in forms imaginary th'unguided days
and rotten times that you shall look upon
when i am sleeping with my ancestors
for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
when means and lavish manners meet together
towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay
warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
the prince but studies his companions
like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
'tis needful that the most immodest word
be look'd upon and learnt which once attaind
your highness knows comes to no further use
but to be known and hated so like gross terms
the prince will in the perfectness of time
shall as a pattern or a measure live
by which his grace must mete the lives of other
turning past evils to advantages

are by the shrieve of yorkshire overthrown
the manner and true order of the fight
king and wherefore should these good news make me sick
will fortune never come with both hands full
but write her fair words still in foulest letters
she either gives a stomach and no food
such are the poor in health or else a feast
and takes away the stomach such are the rich
that have abundance and enjoy it not
i should rejoice now at this happy news
and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
prince humphrey comfort your majesty
clarence o my royal father
westmoreland my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
warwick be patient princes you do know these fits
are with his highness very ordinary
stand from him give him air he'll straight be well
clarence no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
th' incessant care and labour of his mind
hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
prince humphrey the people fear me for they do observe
unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
the seasons change their manners as the year

this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
that from this golden rigol hath divorc'd
so many english kings thy due from me
is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood

my due from thee is this imperial crown

and thou wilt have me die assur'd of it
which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
to stab at half an hour of my life

prince o pardon me my liege but for my tears
the moist impediments unto my speech
i had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke
ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
the course of it so far there is your crown
and he that wears the crown immortally
long guard it yours kneeling if i affect it more
than as your honour and as your renown
which my most inward true and duteous spirit
teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
god witness with me when i here came in
and found no course of breath within your majesty
how cold it struck my heart if i do feign
o let me in my present wildness die
and never live to show th' incredulous world
the noble change that i have purposed
coming to look on you thinking you dead
i spake unto this crown as having sense
and thus upbraided it 'the care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father
therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
other less fine in carat is more precious
preserving life in med'cine potable
but thou most fine most honour'd most renownd
hast eat thy bearer up' thus my most royal liege
accusing it i put it on my head
that had before my face murd'red my father
the quarrel of a true inheritor
but if it did infect my blood with joy
or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
did with the least affection of a welcome
give entertainment to the might of it
let god for ever keep it from my head
and make me as the poorest vassal is
king o my son
god put it in thy mind to take it hence
that thou mightst win the more thy father's love
pleading so wisely in excuse of it
come hither harry sit thou by my bed
and hear i think the very latest counsel
that ever i shall breathe god knows my son
by what by paths and indirect crook'd ways
i met this crown and i myself know well
to thee it shall descend with better quiet
better opinion better confirmation
for all the soil of the achievement goes
with me into the earth it seem'd in me
but as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand
and i had many living to upbraid
my gain of it by their assistances
which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
wounding supposed peace all these bold fears
for all my reign hath been but as a scene
acting that argument and now my death
changes the mood for what in me was purchas'd
falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
so thou the garland wear'st successively
yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do
thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
to be again displac'd which to avoid
i cut them off and had a purpose now
to lead out many to the holy land
lest rest and lying still might make them look
too near unto my state therefore my harry
be it thy course to busy giddy minds
with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
may waste the memory of the former days
that strength of speech is utterly denied me
how i came by the crown o god forgive
and grant it may with thee in true peace live
prince my gracious liege
you won it wore it kept it gave it me
then plain and right must my possession be
which i with more than with a common pain
'gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
enter prince john of lancaster warwick lords and others
prince john health peace and happiness to my royal father
king thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john
but health alack with youthful wings is flown
from this bare wither'd trunk upon thy sight
my worldly business makes a period
where is my lord of warwick
prince my lord of warwick
king doth any name particular belong
unto the lodging where i first did swoon
king laud be to god even there my life must end
it hath been prophesied to me many years
i should not die but in jerusalem
which vainly i suppos'd the holy land
but bear me to that chamber there i'll lie
in that jerusalem shall harry die exeunt

young pigeons
davy yes sir here is now the smith's note for shoeing and

short legg'd hens a joint of mutton and any pretty little tiny
kickshaws tell william cook
davy doth the man of war stay all night sir
shallow yea davy i will use him well a friend i' th' court is
better than a penny in purse use his men well davy for they
are arrant knaves and will backbite
davy no worse than they are backbitten sir for they have
shallow well conceited davy about thy business davy
davy i beseech you sir to countenance william visor of woncot
against clement perkes o' th' hill
shallow there is many complaints davy against that visor that
visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge
davy i grant your worship that he is a knave sir but yet god
forbid sir but a knave should have some countenance at his
friend's request an honest man sir is able to speak for
himself when a knave is not i have serv'd your worship truly
bear out a knave against an honest man i have but a very little
credit with your worship the knave is mine honest friend sir

exit shallow bardolph look to our horses exeunt bardolph
and page if i were sawed into quantities i should make four
dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as master shallow it is a
wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his mens
spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves
like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned
into a justice like serving man their spirits are so married in
conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to
being near their master if to his men i would curry with master
shallow that no man could better command his servants it is
certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught
as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed
of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow
to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six
fashions which is four terms or two actions and 'a shall laugh
without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight
oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up

westminster the palace
enter severally warwick and the lord chief justice
warwick how now my lord chief justice whither away
chief justice how doth the king
chief justice i hope not dead
warwick he's walk'd the way of nature
and to our purposes he lives no more
chief justice i would his majesty had calld me with him
the service that i truly did his life
hath left me open to all injuries
warwick indeed i think the young king loves you not
chief justice i know he doth not and do arm myself
to welcome the condition of the time
than i have drawn it in my fantasy
enter lancaster clarence gloucester
westmoreland and others
warwick here comes the heavy issue of dead harry
o that the living harry had the temper
of he the worst of these three gentlemen
how many nobles then should hold their places
that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
chief justice o god i fear all will be overturnd
gloucester clarence good morrow cousin
prince john we meet like men that had forgot to speak
warwick we do remember but our argument
is all too heavy to admit much talk
prince john well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
chief justice peace be with us lest we be heavier
prince humphrey o good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
and i dare swear you borrow not that face
of seeming sorrow it is sure your own
you stand in coldest expectation
i am the sorrier would 'twere otherwise
clarence well you must now speak sir john falstaff fair
which swims against your stream of quality
chief justice sweet princes what i did i did in honour
led by th' impartial conduct of my soul
and never shall you see that i will beg
a ragged and forestalld remission
if truth and upright innocency fail me
and tell him who hath sent me after him
warwick here comes the prince
enter king henry the fifth attended
chief justice good morrow and god save your majesty
king this new and gorgeous garment majesty
sits not so easy on me as you think
brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
this is the english not the turkish court
not amurath an amurath succeeds
for by my faith it very well becomes you
sorrow so royally in you appears
that i will deeply put the fashion on
and wear it in my heart why then be sad
but entertain no more of it good brothers
than a joint burden laid upon us all
for me by heaven i bid you be assur'd
i'll be your father and your brother too
let me but bear your love i'll bear your cares
but harry lives that shall convert those tears
by number into hours of happiness
brothers we hope no otherwise from your majesty
king you all look strangely on me and you most
you are i think assur'd i love you not
chief justice i am assur'd if i be measur'd rightly
your majesty hath no just cause to hate me
king no
how might a prince of my great hopes forget
what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
th' immediate heir of england was this easy
may this be wash'd in lethe and forgotten
chief justice i then did use the person of your father
the image of his power lay then in me
and in th' administration of his law
whiles i was busy for the commonwealth
your highness pleased to forget my place
the majesty and power of law and justice
and struck me in my very seat of judgment
whereon as an offender to your father
i gave bold way to my authority
and did commit you if the deed were ill
be you contented wearing now the garland
to have a son set your decrees at nought
to pluck down justice from your awful bench
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
that guards the peace and safety of your person
and mock your workings in a second body
question your royal thoughts make the case yours
be now the father and propose a son
hear your own dignity so much profand
see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
behold yourself so by a son disdaind
and then imagine me taking your part
and in your power soft silencing your son
after this cold considerance sentence me
what i have done that misbecame my place
my person or my liege's sovereignty
king you are right justice and you weigh this well
therefore still bear the balance and the sword
and i do wish your honours may increase
till you do live to see a son of mine
offend you and obey you as i did
so shall i live to speak my father's words
'happy am i that have a man so bold
and not less happy having such a son
that would deliver up his greatness so
into the hands of justice' you did commit me
for which i do commit into your hand
th' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear
with this remembrance that you use the same
with the like bold just and impartial spirit
as you have done 'gainst me there is my hand
you shall be as a father to my youth
and i will stoop and humble my intents
to your well practis'd wise directions
and princes all believe me i beseech you
my father is gone wild into his grave
for in his tomb lie my affections
and with his spirits sadly i survive
to mock the expectation of the world
to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
rotten opinion who hath writ me down
hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
where it shall mingle with the state of floods
and flow henceforth in formal majesty
now call we our high court of parliament
and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
that the great body of our state may go
in equal rank with the best governd nation
that war or peace or both at once may be
in which you father shall have foremost hand
our coronation done we will accite
as i before rememb'red all our state
and god consigning to my good intents
no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
god shorten harry's happy life one day exeunt

london an ante chamber in the king's palace
enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury my lord i'll tell you that self bill is urg'd
which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign
was like and had indeed against us pass'd
did push it out of farther question
ely but how my lord shall we resist it now
canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us
we lose the better half of our possession
for all the temporal lands which men devout
by testament have given to the church
would they strip from us being valu'd thus
as much as would maintain to the king's honour
full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
and to relief of lazars and weak age
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
a hundred alms houses right well supplied
and to the coffers of the king beside
a thousand pounds by th' year thus runs the bill
ely this would drink deep
canterbury 't would drink the cup and all
ely but what prevention
canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard
canterbury the courses of his youth promis'd it not
the breath no sooner left his father's body
but that his wildness mortified in him
seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
consideration like an angel came
and whipp'd th' offending adam out of him
leaving his body as a paradise
t'envelop and contain celestial spirits
never was such a sudden scholar made
with such a heady currance scouring faults
nor never hydra headed wilfulnes
so soon did lose his seat and all at once
as in this king
ely we are blessed in the change
canterbury hear him but reason in divinity
and all admiring with an inward wish
you would desire the king were made a prelate
hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
list his discourse of war and you shall hear
a fearful battle rend'red you in music
turn him to any cause of policy
the gordian knot of it he will unloose
familiar as his garter that when he speaks
the air a charter'd libertine is still
and the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears
to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
so that the art and practic part of life
which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
since his addiction was to courses vain
his companies unletter'd rude and shallow
his hours filld up with riots banquets sports
and never noted in him any study
any retirement any sequestration
from open haunts and popularity
ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
and so the prince obscur'd his contemplation
under the veil of wildness which no doubt
grew like the summer grass fastest by night
unseen yet crescive in his faculty
canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceas'd
and therefore we must needs admit the means
how things are perfected
ely but my good lord
how now for mitigation of this bill
incline to it or no
canterbury he seems indifferent
or rather swaying more upon our part
than cherishing th' exhibiters against us
for i have made an offer to his majesty
upon our spiritual convocation
and in regard of causes now in hand
which i have opend to his grace at large
as touching france to give a greater sum
did to his predecessors part withal
ely how did this offer seem receiv'd my lord
canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty
save that there was not time enough to hear
as i perceiv'd his grace would fain have done
the severals and unhidden passages
of his true tides to some certain dukedoms
and generally to the crown and seat of france
deriv'd from edward his great grandfather
canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant
crav'd audience and the hour i think is come
to give him hearing is it four o'clock
ely it is
canterbury then go we in to know his embassy
which i could with a ready guess declare
before the frenchman speak a word of it
ely i'll wait upon you and i long to hear it exeunt

before we hear him of some things of weight
that task our thoughts concerning us and france
the bishop of ely
canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne
and make you long become it
king henry sure we thank you
my learned lord we pray you to proceed
and justly and religiously unfold
why the law salique that they have in france
or should or should not bar us in our claim
and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
or nicely charge your understanding soul
with opening titles miscreate whose right
suits not in native colours with the truth
for god doth know how many now in health
shall drop their blood in approbation
of what your reverence shall incite us to
therefore take heed how you impawn our person
how you awake our sleeping sword of war
we charge you in the name of god take heed
without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
are every one a woe a sore complaint
'gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
that makes such waste in brief mortality
under this conjuration speak my lord
for we will hear note and believe in heart
that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
as pure as sin with baptism
canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
to this imperial throne there is no bar
to make against your highness' claim to france
but this which they produce from pharamond
'in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant'
'no woman shall succeed in salique land'
which salique land the french unjustly gloze
to be the realm of france and pharamond
the founder of this law and female bar
yet their own authors faithfully affirm
between the floods of sala and of elbe
where charles the great having subdu'd the saxons
there left behind and settled certain french
who holding in disdain the german women
for some dishonest manners of their life
establish'd then this law to wit no female
should be inheritrix in salique land
which salique as i said 'twixt elbe and sala
is at this day in germany calld meisen
was not devised for the realm of france
nor did the french possess the salique land
until four hundred one and twenty years
after defunction of king pharamond
idly suppos'd the founder of this law
who died within the year of our redemption
four hundred twenty six and charles the great
subdu'd the saxons and did seat the french
beyond the river sala in the year
king pepin which deposed childeric
did as heir general being descended
of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
make claim and title to the crown of france
hugh capet also who usurp'd the crown
of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male
of the true line and stock of charles the great
to find his title with some shows of truth
though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
daughter to charlemain who was the son
to lewis the emperor and lewis the son
of charles the great also king lewis the tenth
who was sole heir to the usurper capet
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of france till satisfied
that fair queen isabel his grandmother
was lineal of the lady ermengare
daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine
was re united to the crown of france
so that as clear as is the summer's sun
king pepins title and hugh capet's claim
king lewis his satisfaction all appear
to hold in right and tide of the female
so do the kings of france unto this day
howbeit they would hold up this salique law
to bar your highness claiming from the female
and rather choose to hide them in a net
usurp'd from you and your progenitors
king henry may i with right and conscience make this claim
canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign
for in the book of numbers is it writ
when the man dies let the inheritance
descend unto the daughter gracious lord
stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
look back into your mighty ancestors
go my dread lord to your great grandsire's tomb
and your great uncle's edward the black prince
who on the french ground play'd a tragedy
making defeat on the fun power of france
whiles his most mighty father on a hill
stood smiling to behold his lions whelp
forage in blood of french nobility
o noble english that could entertain
with half their forces the full pride of france
and let another half stand laughing by
ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead
and with your puissant arm renew their feats
you are their heir you sit upon their throne
the blood and courage that renowned them
runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege
is in the very may morn of his youth
ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
do all expect that you should rouse yourself
westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might
so hath your highness never king of england
had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
whose hearts have left their bodies here in england
and lie paviliond in the fields of france
canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege
with blood and sword and fire to win your right
in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
will raise your highness such a mighty sum
bring in to any of your ancestors
king henry we must not only arm t' invade the french
but lay down our proportions to defend
against the scot who will make road upon us
with all advantages
canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign
shall be a wall sufficient to defend
our inland from the pilfering borderers
king henry we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
for you shall read that my great grandfather
never went with his forces into france
but that the scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
came pouring like the tide into a breach
with ample and brim fulness of his force
galling the gleaned land with hot assays
girdling with grievous siege castles and towns
that england being empty of defence
canterbury she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
for hear her but exampled by herself
when all her chivalry hath been in france
and she a mourning widow of her nobles
she hath herself not only well defended
but taken and impounded as a stray
the king of scots whom she did send to france
to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings
and make her chronicle as rich with praise
with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries
westmoreland but there's a saying very old and true
'if that you will france win
then with scotland first begin'
for once the eagle england being in prey
to her unguarded nest the weasel scot
comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
playing the mouse in absence of the cat
to tear and havoc more than she can eat
yet that is but a crush'd necessity
since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
th' advised head defends itself at home
for government though high and low and lower
put into parts doth keep in one consent
congreeing in a full and natural close
like music
the state of man in divers functions
setting endeavour in continual motion
to which is fixed as an aim or but
obedience for so work the honey bees
creatures that by a rule in nature teach
the act of order to a peopled kingdom
they have a king and officers of sorts
where some like magistrates correct at home
others like merchants venture trade abroad
make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
which pillage they with merry march bring home
to the tent royal of their emperor
who busied in his majesty surveys
the singing masons building roofs of gold
the civil citizens kneading up the honey
the poor mechanic porters crowding in
their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
the sad ey'd justice with his surly hum
the lazy yawning drone i this infer
that many things having full reference
to one consent may work contrariously
as many arrows loosed several ways
come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
as many lines close in the dials centre
so many a thousand actions once afoot
end in one purpose and be all well home
divide your happy england into four
whereof take you one quarter into france
and you withal shall make all gallia shake
if we with thrice such powers left at home
cannot defend our own doors from the dog
let us be worried and our nation lose
the name of hardiness and policy
king henry call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
exeunt some attendants
and yours the noble sinews of our power
france being ours we'll bend it to our awe
or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit
ruling in large and ample empery
o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
tombless with no remembrance over them
either our history shall with full mouth
speak freely of our acts or else our grave
not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph
enter ambassadors of france
now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
your greeting is from him not from the king
ambassador may't please your majesty to give us leave
freely to render what we have in charge
or shall we sparingly show you far of
the dauphins meaning and our embassy
unto whose grace our passion is as subject
as are our wretches fett'red in our prisons
therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
tell us the dauphins mind
ambassador thus then in few
your highness lately sending into france
did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
of your great predecessor king edward the third
in answer of which claim the prince our master
and bids you be advis'd there's nought in france
that can be with a nimble galliard won
you cannot revel into dukedoms there
he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks
king henry what treasure uncle
exeter tennis balls my liege
his present and your pains we thank you for
when we have match'd our rackets to these balls
we will in france by god's grace play a set
shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
that all the courts of france will be disturb'd
with chaces and we understand him well
how he comes o'er us with our wilder days
not measuring what use we made of them
and therefore living hence did give ourself
to barbarous licence as 'tis ever common
that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
be like a king and show my sail of greatness
when i do rouse me in my throne of france
for that i have laid by my majesty
and plodded like a man for working days
but i will rise there with so full a glory
yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
hath turnd his balls to gun stones and his soul
shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands
mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
and some are yet ungotten and unborn
that shall have cause to curse the dauphins scorn
to whom i do appeal and in whose name
tell you the dauphin i am coming on
to venge me as i may and to put forth
my rightful hand in a well hallow'd cause
so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
his jest will savour but of shallow wit
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
convey them with safe conduct fare you well
exeunt ambassadors
king henry we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy hour
that may give furth'rance to our expedition
for we have now no thought in us but france
save those to god that run before our business
therefore let our proportions for these wars
be soon collected and all things thought upon
that may with reasonable swiftness ad
more feathers to our wings for god before
therefore let every man now task his thought

scroop no doubt my liege if each man do his best
king henry i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
we carry not a heart with us from hence
that grows not in a fair consent with ours
nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
cambridge never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
than is your majesty there's not i think a subject
that sits in heart grief and uneasines
under the sweet shade of your government
grey true those that were your father's enemies
have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
with hearts create of duty and of zeal
king henry we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
and shall forget the office of our hand
according to the weight and worthiness
scroop so service shall with steeled sinews toil
and labour shall refresh itself with hope
to do your grace incessant services
king henry we judge no less uncle of exeter
enlarge the man committed yesterday
that raild against our person we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on

let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
king henry o let us yet be merciful
cambridge so may your highness and yet punish too
grey sir
you show great mercy if you give him life
after the taste of much correction
king henry alas your too much love and care of me
are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch
shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man
though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
and tender preservation of our person
would have him punish'd and now to our french causes

your highness bade me ask for it to day

my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
what see you in those papers that you lose
so much complexion look ye how they change
that have so cowarded and chas'd your blood
out of appearance
cambridge i do confess my fault
and do submit me to your highness' mercy
grey scroop to which we all appeal
king henry the mercy that was quick in us but late
by your own counsel is suppress'd and killd
you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
see you my princes and my noble peers
these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
you know how apt our love was to accord
to furnish him with an appertinents
belonging to his honour and this man
hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir'd
and sworn unto the practices of france
to kill us here in hampton to the which
this knight no less for bounty bound to us
what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
that knew'st the very bottom of my soul
that almost mightst have coind me into gold
wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use
may it be possible that foreign hire
could out of thee extract one spark of evil
that might annoy my finger 'tis so strange
as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
treason and murder ever kept together
as two yoke devils sworn to either's purpose
working so grossly in a natural cause
that admiration did not whoop at them
but thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in
wonder to wait on treason and on murder
and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
that wrought upon thee so preposterously
and other devils that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle up damnation
with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
from glist'ring semblances of piety
but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
if that same demon that hath gulld thee thus
should with his lion gait walk the whole world
and tell the legions 'i can never win
a soul so easy as that englishmans'
o how hast thou with jealousy infected
the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
why so didst thou come they of noble family
why so didst thou seem they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
not working with the eye without the ear
and but in purged judgment trusting neither
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
to mark the full fraught man and best indued
with some suspicion i will weep for thee
for this revolt of thine methinks is like
another fall of man their faults are open
and god acquit them of their practices
exeter i arrest thee of high treason by the name of richard earl
of cambridge
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop
of masham
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey
knight of northumberland
scroop our purposes god justly hath discover'd
and i repent my fault more than my death
although my body pay the price of it
cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce
although i did admit it as a motive
the sooner to effect what i intended
but god be thanked for prevention
which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice
beseeching god and you to pardon me
grey never did faithful subject more rejoice
at the discovery of most dangerous treason
prevented from a damned enterprise
my fault but not my body pardon sovereign
king henry god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
you have conspir'd against our royal person
joind with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
receiv'd the golden earnest of our death
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
his princes and his peers to servitude
his subjects to oppression and contempt
touching our person seek we no revenge
but we our kingdom's safety must so tender
whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
we do deliver you get you therefore hence
poor miserable wretches to your death
the taste whereof god of his mercy give
you patience to endure and true repentance
of all your dear offences bear them hence
exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
shall be to you as us like glorious
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
since god so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way
to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way
then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
our puissance into the hand of god
putting it straight in expedition

how modest in exception and withal

were but the outside of the roman brutus

in cases of defence 'tis best to weigh

which of a weak and niggardly projection
doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting

french king think we king harry strong

the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us

that haunted us in our familiar paths
witness our too much memorable shame

whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
up in the air crownd with the golden sun

even in your hearts there will he rake for it

deliver up the crown and to take mercy
on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
opens his vasty jaws and on your head

do not in grant of all demands at large
sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
he'll call you to so hot an answer of it
that caves and womby vaultages of france
shall chide your trespass and return your mock
in second accent of his ordinance
dauphin say if my father render fair return
it is against my will for i desire
as matching to his youth and vanity
i did present him with the paris balls
exeter he'll make your paris louvre shake for it
were it the mistress court of mighty europe
and be assur'd you'll find a difference
as we his subjects have in wonder found
between the promise of his greener days
and these he masters now now he weighs time
even to the utmost grain that you shall read
french king to morrow shall you know our mind at full

the well appointed king at hampton pier
embark his royalty and his brave fleet
with silken streamers the young phorbus fanning
play with your fancies and in them behold
upon the hempen tackle ship boys climbing
hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
to sounds confus'd behold the threaden sails
draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea
breasting the lofty surge o do but think
you stand upon the rivage and behold
a city on th' inconstant billows dancing
for so appears this fleet majestical
holding due course to harfleur follow follow
grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
and leave your england as dead midnight still
guarded with grandsires babies and old women
for who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
with one appearing hair that will not follow
these culld and choice drawn cavaliers to france
work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
behold the ordnance on their carriages
with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
suppose th' ambassador from the french comes back
tells harry that the king doth offer him
katherine his daughter and with her to dowry
the offer likes not and the nimble gunner
with linstock now the devilish cannon touches

as modest stillness and humility
but when the blast of war blows in our ears
then imitate the action of the tiger
stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
disguise fair nature with hard favour'd rage
then lend the eye a terrible aspect
let it pry through the portage of the head
as fearfully as doth a galled rock
o'erhang and jutty his confounded base
swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
to his full height on on you noblest english
whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof
fathers that like so many alexanders
have in these parts from morn till even fought
dishonour not your mothers now attest
that those whom you calld fathers did beget you
be copy now to men of grosser blood
and teach them how to war and you good yeomen
whose limbs were made in england show us here
the mettle of your pasture let us swear
that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not
for there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes

exeunt all but boy
boy as young as i am i have observ'd these three swashers i am
boy to them all three but all they three though they would
serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do
not amount to a man for bardolph he is white liver'd and
red fac'd by the means whereof 'a faces it out but fights not
for pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the
he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought
a coward but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
deeds for 'a never broke any mans head but his own and that
was against a post when he was drunk they will steal anything
and call it purchase bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve
leagues and sold it for three halfpence nym and bardolph are
sworn brothers in filching and in calais they stole a
fire shovel i knew by that piece of service the men would carry
gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my
manhood if i should take from another's pocket to put into mine
for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i must leave them and
seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak
stomach and therefore i must cast it up exit

king henry how yet resolves the governor of the town
this is the latest parle we will admit
or like to men proud of destruction
defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
if i begin the batt'ry once again
i will not leave the half achieved harfleur
till in her ashes she lie buried
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
and the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart
in liberty of bloody hand shall range
your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants
what is it then to me if impious war
array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends
do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats
enlink'd to waste and desolation
what is't to me when you yourselves are cause
if your pure maidens fall into the hand
of hot and forcing violation
what rein can hold licentious wickednes
we may as bootless spend our vain command
upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil
as send precepts to the leviathan
to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur
take pity of your town and of your people
whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
of heady murder spoil and villainy
the blind and bloody with foul hand
defile the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters
your fathers taken by the silver beards
and their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls
your naked infants spitted upon pikes
whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd
do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
at herod's bloody hunting slaughtermen
what say you will you yield and this avoid
governor our expectation hath this day an end
the dauphin whom of succours we entreated
returns us that his powers are yet not ready
to raise so great a siege therefore great king
we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
enter our gates dispose of us and ours
for we no longer are defensible
king henry open your gates exit governor come uncle exeter
go you and enter harfleur there remain

our mettle is bred out and they will give
their bodies to the lust of english youth

scene vi
enter captains english and welsh gower and fluellen
gower how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge
fluellen i assure you there is very excellent services committed
at the bridge
gower is the duke of exeter safe
fluellen the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon and a
man that i love and honour with my soul and my heart and my
duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power he is
not god be praised and blessed any hurt in the world but
is an aunchient lieutenant there at the bridge i think in my
very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony and he is
man of no estimation in the world but i did see him do as
gallant service
gower what do you call him
fluellen he is calld aunchient pistol
gower i know him not
enter pistol
fluellen here is the man
the duke of exeter doth love thee well
fluellen ay i praise god and i have merited some love at his
empty
pistol bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
and giddy fortune's furious fickle wheel
that goddess blind
that stands upon the rolling restless stone
fluellen by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is painted
fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to
signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning
and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look
you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and
rolls in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description
of it fortune is an excellent moral
pistol fortune is bardolph's foe and frowns on him
for he hath stoln a pax and hanged must 'a be
a damned death
and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
but exeter hath given the doom of death
for pax of little price
therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
and let not bardolph's vital thread be cut
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
speak captain for his life and i will thee requite
fluellen aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning
pistol why then rejoice therefore
for if look you he were my brother i would desire the duke to
use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline
ought to be used
pistol die and be damnd and figo for thy friendship
fluellen it is well
pistol the fig of spain exit
fluellen very good
gower why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i remember him
now a bawd a cutpurse
as you shall see in a summer's day but it is very well what he
has spoke to me that is well i warrant you when time is serve
gower why 'tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to
the wars to grace himself at his return into london under the
form of a soldier and such fellows are perfect in the great
commanders' names and they will learn you by rote where services
were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a
convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgrac'd what
terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the
a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp will
do among foaming bottles and ale wash'd wits is wonderful to be
thought on but you must learn to know such slanders of the age
or else you may be marvellously mistook
fluellen i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is not
the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if i
find a hole in his coat i will tell him my mind drum within
hark you the king is coming and i must speak with him from the
empty
and gloucester
god pless your majesty
king henry how now fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge
fluellen ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has very
gallantly maintaind the pridge the french is gone off look
you and there is gallant and most prave passages marry th'
athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced
to retire and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge i can
tell your majesty the duke is a prave man
fluellen the perdition of th' athversary hath been very great
reasonable great marry for my part i think the duke hath lost
never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a
church one bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o' fire and his
lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes
plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire's
empty
king henry we would have all such offenders so cut off and we
be nothing compelld from the villages nothing taken but paid
for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful
language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner
tucket enter montjoy
montjoy you know me by my habit
king henry well then i know thee what shall i know of thee
montjoy my master's mind
king henry unfold it
seem'd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than
rashness tell him we could have rebuk'd him at harfleur but
that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
england shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our
sufferance bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost
the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re answer his
pettiness would bow under for our losses his exchequer is too
too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling
at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction to this add
defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
followers whose condemnation is pronounc'd so far my king and
master so much my office
king henry what is thy name i know thy quality
montjoy montjoy
king henry thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
and tell thy king i do not seek him now
without impeachment for to say the sooth
though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
unto an enemy of craft and vantage
my people are with sickness much enfeebled
my numbers lessend and those few i have
almost no better than so many french
who when they were in health i tell thee herald
i thought upon one pair of english legs
did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
hath blown that vice in me i must repent
go therefore tell thy master here i am
my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
my army but a weak and sickly guard
yet god before tell him we will come on
though france himself and such another neighbour
stand in our way there's for thy labour montjoy
go bid thy master well advise himself
if we may pass we will if we be hind'red
discolour and so montjoy fare you well
the sum of all our answer is but this
we would not seek a battle as we are
nor as we are we say we will not shun it
so tell your master
montjoy i shall deliver so thanks to your highness exit
gloucester i hope they will not come upon us now
king henry we are in god's hand brother not in theirs
march to the bridge it now draws toward night
and on to morrow bid them march away exeunt

the french camp near agincourt
enter the constable of france the lord rambures the duke of orleans
the dauphin with others
constable tut i have the best armour of the world
would it were day
orleans you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his
empty
orleans will it never be morning
dauphin my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you talk of
horse and armour
orleans you are as well provided of both as any prince in the
empty
dauphin what a long night is this i will not change my horse with
any that treads but on four pasterns ca ha he bounds from the
earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the
pegasus chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i soar i
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of
empty
orleans he's of the colour of the nutmeg
dauphin and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for perseus
he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water
never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his
rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
may call beasts
constable indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent
dauphin it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
orleans no more cousin
dauphin nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of
the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my
palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into
eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all 'tis a
subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns
sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and
him i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus 'wonder
of nature'
orleans i have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress
dauphin then did they imitate that which i compos'd to my courser
for my horse is my mistress
orleans your mistress bears well
dauphin me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a
good and particular mistress
constable nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
dauphin so perhaps did yours
constable mine was not bridled
dauphin o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a
kern of ireland your french hose off and in your strait
empty
constable you have good judgment in horsemanship
dauphin be warnd by me then they that ride so and ride not
warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have my horse to my
empty
dauphin i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
constable i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to
my mistress
dauphin 'le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la
truie lavee au bourbier' thou mak'st use of anything
constable yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any such
proverb so little kin to the purpose
rambures my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent
to night are those stars or suns upon it
dauphin some of them will fall to morrow i hope
constable and yet my sky shall not want
dauphin that may be for you bear a many superfluously and 'twere
more honour some were away
constable ev'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as
well were some of your brags dismounted
dauphin would i were able to load him with his desert will it
never be day i will trot to morrow a mile and my way shall be
paved with english faces
way but i would it were morning for i would fain be about the
ears of the english
rambures who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
constable you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
dauphin 'tis midnight i'll go arm myself exit
orleans the dauphin longs for morning
rambures he longs to eat the english
constable i think he will eat all he kills
orleans by the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince
orleans he is simply the most active gentleman of france
constable doing is activity and he will still be doing
orleans he never did harm that i heard of
constable nor will do none to morrow he will keep that good name
empty
orleans i know him to be valiant
constable i was told that by one that knows him better than you
orleans what's he
constable marry he told me so himself and he said he car'd not
orleans he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
constable by my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but
his lackey
'tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate
orleans ill wind never said well
constable i will cap that proverb with 'there is flattery in
empty
orleans and i will take up that with 'give the devil his due'
constable well plac'd there stands your friend for the devil
orleans you are the better at proverbs by how much 'a fools bolt
is soon shot'
constable you have shot over
orleans 'tis not the first time you were overshot
enter a messenger
messenger my lord high constable the english lie within fifteen
hundred paces of your tents
constable who hath measur'd the ground
messenger the lord grandpre
alas poor harry of england he longs not for the dawning as we
empty
orleans what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
england to mope with his fat braind followers so far out of his
empty
constable if the english had any apprehension they would run
empty
orleans that they lack for if their heads had any intellectual
armour they could never wear such heavy head pieces
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
orleans foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a russian
bear and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples you may as
well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
lip of a lion
constable just just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs
in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their
wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel
they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
constable then shall we find to morrow they have only stomachs to
eat and none to fight now is it time to arm come shall we
about it
orleans it is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
we shall have each a hundred englishmen exeunt

from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
the hum of either army stilly sounds
that the fix'd sentinels almost receive
the secret whispers of each other's watch
fire answers fire and through their paly flames
each battle sees the other's umber'd face
steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
the armourers accomplishing the knights
give dreadful note of preparation
the country cocks do crow the clocks do ton
and the third hour of drowsy morning name
proud of their numbers and secure in soul
the confident and over lusty french
do the low rated english play at dice
and chide the cripple tardy gaited night
who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
so tediously away the poor condemned english
sit patiently and inly ruminate
the morning's danger and their gesture sad
investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats
presenteth them unto the gazing moon
so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold
the royal captain of this ruind band
walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
let him cry 'praise and glory on his head'
for forth he goes and visits all his host
and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
upon his royal face there is no note
how dread an army hath enrounded him
nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
unto the weary and all watched night
but freshly looks and over bears attaint
with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
that every wretch pining and pale before
beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
his liberal eye doth give to every one
thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
behold as may unworthiness define
a little touch of harry in the night
and so our scene must to the battle fly
where o for pity we shall much disgrace
with four or five most vile and ragged foils
right ill dispos'd in brawl ridiculous
the name of agincourt yet sit and see
scene i
france the english camp at agincourt
enter the king bedford and gloucester
king henry gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger
the greater therefore should our courage be
good morrow brother bedford god almighty
there is some soul of goodness in things evil
would men observingly distil it out
for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
besides they are our outward consciences
and preachers to us all admonishing
that we should dress us fairly for our end
thus may we gather honey from the weed
and make a moral of the devil himself
enter erpingham
good morrow old sir thomas erpingham
a good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of france
since i may say 'now lie i like a king'
king henry 'tis good for men to love their present pains
upon example so the spirit is eased
and when the mind is quick'ned out of doubt
the organs though defunct and dead before
break up their drowsy grave and newly move
with casted slough and fresh legerity
lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both
commend me to the princes in our camp
desire them all to my pavilion

he knock that about yours
pistol art thou his friend

pistol the figo for thee then
king henry i thank you god be with you
pistol my name is pistol calld exit
enter fluellen and gower
gower captain fluellen
fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak fewer it is the
greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you
would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great
you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle taddle nor
pibble pabble in pompey's camp i warrant you you shall find the
ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it
gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be
an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own
conscience now
gower i will speak lower
fluellen i pray you and beseech you that you will
exeunt gower and fluellen
king henry though it appear a little out of fashion
enter three soldiers john bates alexander court
and michael williams
court brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks
empty
bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the
approach of day
williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we
shall never see the end of it who goes there
king henry a friend
king henry under sir thomas erpingham
williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray
you what thinks he of our estate
king henry even as men wreck'd upon a sand that look to be wash'd
off the next tide
bates he hath not told his thought to the king
king henry no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it
to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells
to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to
by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his
affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop
they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of
fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any
appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his
empty
bates he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as
cold a night as 'tis he could wish himself in thames up to the
we were quit here
king henry by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i
think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
bates then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be
ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved
king henry i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds
methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's
company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if
we know we are the king's subjects if his cause be wrong our
obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a
heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads
chopp'd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day
and cry all 'we died at such a place' some swearing some crying
for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some
upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i
can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their
argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black
matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were
against all proportion of subjection
king henry so if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of
his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father
that sent him or if a servant under his master's command
transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
master the author of the servant's damnation but this is not so
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant
for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
services besides there is no king be his cause never so
spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out
with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the
guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling
virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars
with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law
and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they
have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his
vengeance so that here men are punish'd for before breach of the
king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the
death they have borne life away and where they would be safe
they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king
guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited every subject's
therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man
in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so
death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly
lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes
it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he
let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare
williams 'tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his
own head the king is not to answer for it
to fight lustily for him
king henry i myself heard the king say he would not be ransom'd
williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our
throats are cut he may be ransom'd and we ne'er the wiser
king henry if i live to see it i will never trust his word after
williams you pay him then that's a perilous shot out of an
elder gun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a
monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with
fanning in his face with a peacock's feather you'll never trust
king henry your reproof is something too round i should be angry
with you if the time were convenient
williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live
king henry i embrace it
williams how shall i know thee again
king henry give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my
bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it i will make it
my quarrel
williams here's my glove give me another of thine
williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me
and say after to morrow 'this is my glove' by this hand i will
take thee a box on the ear
king henry if ever i live to see it i will challenge it
williams thou dar'st as well be hang'd
king henry well i will do it though i take thee in the king's
empty
williams keep thy word fare thee well
bates be friends you english fools be friends we have
king henry indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one
they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it
is no english treason to cut french crowns and to morrow the
king himself will be a clipper
exeunt soldiers
upon the king let us our lives our souls
our debts our careful wives
our children and our sins lay on the king
we must bear all o hard condition
of every fool whose sense no more can feel
but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect that private men enjoy
and what have kings that privates have not too
save ceremony save general ceremony
and what art thou thou idol ceremony
what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
what are thy rents what are thy comings in
what is thy soul of adoration
art thou aught else but place degree and form
creating awe and fear in other men
wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
than they in fearing
what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
but poisond flattery o be sick great greatness
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
thinks thou the fiery fever will go out
will it give place to flexure and low bending
canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
command the health of it no thou proud dream
that play'st so subtly with a king's repose
i am a king that find thee and i know
'tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
the sword the mace the crown imperial
the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
the farced tide running fore the king
that beats upon the high shore of this world
no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony
not all these laid in bed majestical
can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
who with a body filld and vacant mind
gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
never sees horrid night the child of hell
but like a lackey from the rise to set
sweats in the eye of pheebus and all night
doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
and follows so the ever running year
with profitable labour to his grave
and but for ceremony such a wretch
winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
had the fore hand and vantage of a king
the slave a member of the country's peace
enjoys it but in gross brain little wots

five hundred poor i have in yearly pay

and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
the vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
'tis positive 'gainst all exceptions lords
who in unnecessary action swarm
about our squares of battle were enow

and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
with torch staves in their hand and their poor jades
lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
the gum down roping from their pale dead eyes
and in their pale dull mouths the gimmald bit
lies foul with chaw'd grass still and motionless
and their executors the knavish crows
fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
description cannot suit itself in words
to demonstrate the life of such a battle
constable they have said their prayers and they stay for death

exeter there's five to one besides they all are fresh
salisbury god's arm strike with us 'tis a fearful odds
god bye you princes all i'll to my charge
if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter
and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
bedford farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee
exeter farewell kind lord fight valiantly to day
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it
for thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour
exit salisbury
bedford he is as full of valour as of kindness
princely in both
westmoreland o that we now had here
but one ten thousand of those men in england
that do no work to day
king what's he that wishes so
my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
if we are mark'd to die we are enow
to do our country loss and if to live
the fewer men the greater share of honour
god's will i pray thee wish not one man more
nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
it yearns me not if men my garments wear
such outward things dwell not in my desires
but if it be a sin to covet honour
i am the most offending soul alive
no faith my coz wish not a man from england
god's peace i would not lose so great an honour
as one man more methinks would share from me
for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
that he which hath no stomach to this fight
let him depart his passport shall be made
and crowns for convoy put into his purse
we would not die in that mans company
that fears his fellowship to die with us
this day is calld the feast of crispian
he that outlives this day and comes safe home
will stand a tip toe when this day is nam'd
and rouse him at the name of crispian
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
and say 'to morrow is saint crispian'
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
and say 'these wounds i had on crispians day'
old men forget yet all shall be forgot
but he'll remember with advantages
what feats he did that day then shall our names
familiar in his mouth as household words
harry the king bedford and exeter
be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red
this story shall the good man teach his son
and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
from this day to the ending of the world
but we in it shall be remembered
we few we happy few we band of brothers
for he to day that sheds his blood with me
shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
this day shall gentle his condition
shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here
and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
that fought with us upon saint crispins day
re enter salisbury
salisbury my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
the french are bravely in their battles set
and will with all expedience charge on us

without more help could fight this royal battle

you know your places god be with you all
tucket enter montjoy
montjoy once more i come to know of thee king harry
if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
before thy most assured overthrow
thou needs must be englutted besides in mercy
the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
thy followers of repentance that their souls
may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
must lie and fester
king henry who hath sent thee now
montjoy the constable of france
king henry i pray thee bear my former answer back
good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
the man that once did sell the lions skin
while the beast liv'd was killd with hunting him
a many of our bodies shall no doubt
find native graves upon the which i trust
shall witness live in brass of this day's work
and those that leave their valiant bones in france
dying like men though buried in your dunghills
they shall be fam'd for there the sun shall greet them
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
mark then abounding valour in our english
that being dead like to the bullet's grazing
break out into a second course of mischief
killing in relapse of mortality
let me speak proudly tell the constable
we are but warriors for the working day
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
there's not a piece of feather in our host
good argument i hope we will not fly
and time hath worn us into slovenry
but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers' heads
and turn them out of service if they do this
as if god please they shall my ransom then
come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
they shall have none i swear but these my joints
which if they have as i will leave 'em them
shall yield them little tell the constable
montjoy i shall king harry and so fare thee well
thou never shalt hear herald any more exit

his bruised helmet and his bended sword
before him through the city he forbids it
being free from vainness and self glorious pride

shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
king henry to cry amen to that thus we appear
queen isabel you english princes an i do salute you
burgundy my duty to you both on equal love
great kings of france and england that i have labour'd
with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
to bring your most imperial majesties
your mightiness on both parts best can witness
since then my office hath so far prevaild
that face to face and royal eye to eye
you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
if i demand before this royal view
what rub or what impediment there is
why that the naked poor and mangled peace
dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births
should not in this best garden of the world
alas she hath from france too long been chas'd
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
corrupting in it own fertility
her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
unpruned dies her hedges even pleach'd
like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
conceives by idleness and nothing teems
but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
losing both beauty and utility
and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
defective in their natures grow to wildness
even so our houses and ourselves and children
the sciences that should become our country
but grow like savages as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood
to swearing and stern looks diffus'd attire
and everything that seems unnatural
which to reduce into our former favout
you are assembled and my speech entreats
that i may know the let why gentle peace
should not expel these inconveniences
king henry if duke of burgundy you would the peace
whose want gives growth to th' imperfections
which you have cited you must buy that peace
with full accord to all our just demands
whose tenours and particular effects
you have enscheduld briefly in your hands
burgundy the king hath heard them to the which as yet
there is no answer made
king henry well then the peace
french king i have but with a cursorary eye
o'erglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
to appoint some of your council presently
to sit with us once more with better heed
to re survey them we will suddenly
pass our accept and peremptory answer
king henry brother we shall go uncle exeter
and brother clarence and you brother gloucester
warwick and huntington go with the king
augment or alter as your wisdoms best
shall see advantageable for our dignity
any thing in or out of our demands

queen isabel our gracious brother i will go with them

when articles too nicely urg'd be stood on

within the fore rank of our articles
queen isabel she hath good leave

king henry fair katherine and most fair
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
such as will enter at a lady's ear
and plead his love suit to her gentle heart
katherine your majesty shall mock me i cannot speak your england
king henry o fair katherine if you will love me soundly with your
your english tongue do you like me kate
katherine pardonnez moi i cannot tell vat is like me
king henry an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
katherine que dit il que je suis semblable a les anges
alice oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi dit il
king henry i said so dear katherine and i must not blush to
affirm it
katherine o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
empty
full of deceits
alice oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is
de princess
king henry the princess is the better english woman i' faith
kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou
canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst
find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my
farm to buy my crown i know no ways to mince it in love but
directly to say 'i love you' then if you urge me farther than
answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say
you lady
katherine sauf votre honneur me understand well
king henry marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither
words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in
measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a
lady at leap frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour
on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i
or bound my horse for her favours i could lay on like a butcher
and sit like a jack an apes never off but before god kate i
cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor i have no
cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use
till urg'd nor never break for urging if thou canst love a
fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sunburning
that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there
let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou
canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i
thee too and while thou liv'st dear kate take a fellow of
plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right
because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these
fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into
ladies' favours they do always reason themselves out again
what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good
leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will
turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will
wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is
it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a
soldier take a soldier take a king and what say'st thou then
to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee
katherine is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france
king henry no it is not possible you should love the enemy of
france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of
france for i love france so well that i will not part with a
village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is
katherine i cannot tell vat is dat
king henry no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure
will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her
husband's neck hardly to be shook off je quand sur le
possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi
let me see what then saint denis be my speed donc votre est
france et vous etes mienne it is as easy for me kate to
conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall
never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me
meilleur que langlais lequel je parle
king henry no faith is't not kate but thy speaking of my
tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to
be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much
english canst thou love me
katherine i cannot tell
king henry can any of your neighbours tell kate i'll ask them
come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into
your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and i
love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the
rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever
thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells
me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore
needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between
saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half
english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the
beard shall we not what say'st thou my fair flower de luce
katherine i do not know dat
now promise kate you will endeavour for your french part of
such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and
a bachelor how answer you la plus belle katherine du monde mon
tres cher et divin deesse
katherine your majestee ave fausse french enough to deceive de
most sage damoiselle dat is en france
king henry now fie upon my false french by mine honour in true
english i love thee kate by which honour i dare not swear thou
lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost
beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when
he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with
an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them
but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear
my comfort is that old age that in layer up of beauty can do
no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the
worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and
better and therefore tell me most fair katherine will you have
me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your
'harry of england i am thine' which word thou shalt no sooner
bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud 'england is
thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet
is thine' who though i speak it before his face if he be not
fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good
fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is
music and thy english broken therefore queen of all katherine
break thy mind to me in broken english wilt thou have me
katherine dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere
him kate
katherine den it sall also content me
king henry upon that i kiss your hand and i can you my queen

king henry it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
before they are married would she say
alice oui vraiment
king henry o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear kate
fashion we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty that
follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults as i will
do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in
denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding kissing
her you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more
eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the
french council and they should sooner persuade henry of england
than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father
enter the french power and the english lords
teach you our princess english
king henry i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i
love her and that is good english
burgundy is she not apt
king henry our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of
flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in
her that he will appear in his true likeness
burgundy pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for
conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked
and blind can you blame her then being a maid yet ros'd over
with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of
a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self it were my lord a
hard condition for a maid to consign to
king henry yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and
empty
burgundy they are then excus'd my lord when they see not what
they do
empty
burgundy i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach
her to know my meaning for maids well summer'd and warm kept are
like flies at bartholomew tide blind though they have their
eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not
abide looking on
king henry this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and
so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she
must be blind too
king henry it is so and you may some of you thank love for my
blindness who cannot see many a fair french city for one fair
french maid that stands in my way
french king yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls
that war hath never ent'red
king henry shall kate be my wife
french king so please you
king henry i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait
me the way to my will
french king we have consented to all terms of reason
king henry is't so my lords of england
westmoreland the king hath granted every article
his daughter first and then in sequel all
according to their firm proposed natures
exeter only he hath not yet subscribed this

occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your highness
fils henri roi d'angleterre heritier de france and thus in
latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex angliae et
haeres franciae
french king nor this i have not brother so denied
but our request shall make me let it pass
king henry i pray you then in love and dear alliance
let that one article rank with the rest
and thereupon give me your daughter
french king take her fair son and from her blood raise up
of france and england whose very shores look pale
with envy of each other's happiness
may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
plant neighbourhood and christian like accord
in their sweet bosoms that never war advance
his bleeding sword 'twixt england and fair france
lords amen
king henry now welcome kate and bear me witness all
that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen floulish
combine your hearts in one your realms in one
as man and wife being two are one in love
so be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
that never may ill office or fell jealousy
which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
to make divorce of their incorporate league
that english may as french french englishmen
receive each other god speak this amen
king henry prepare we for our marriage on which day

his arms spread wider than a dragons wings
his sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire
more dazzled and drove back his enemies
than mid day sun fierce bent against their faces
what should i say his deeds exceed all speech
he ne'er lift up his hand but conquered
exeter we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
henry is dead and never shall revive
upon a wooden coffin we attend
we with our stately presence glorify
like captives bound to a triumphant car
what shall we curse the planets of mishap
that plotted thus our glory's overthrow
or shall we think the subtle witted french
conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
by magic verses have contriv'd his end
winchester he was a king bless'd of the king of kings
unto the french the dreadful judgment day
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought
the church's prayers made him so prosperous
gloucester the church where is it had not churchmen
empty
his thread of life had not so soon decay'd
none do you like but an effeminate prince
whom like a school boy you may overawe
winchester gloucester whate'er we like thou art
empty
thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
more than god or religious churchmen may
gloucester name not religion for thou lov'st the flesh
and ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
except it be to pray against thy foes
bedford cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
let's to the altar heralds wait on us
instead of gold we'll offer up our arms
since arms avail not now that henry's dead
when at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck
our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
and none but women left to wail the dead
henry the fifth thy ghost i invocate
prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
combat with adverse planets in the heavens
a far more glorious star thy soul will make
than julius caesar or bright
enter a messenger
sad tidings bring i to you out of france
of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
guienne champagne rheims orleans
paris guysors poictiers are all quite lost
bedford what say'st thou man before dead henry's corse
speak softly or the loss of those great towns
will make him burst his lead and rise from death
gloucester is paris lost is rouen yielded up
if henry were recalld to life again
exeter how were they lost what treachery was us'd
messenger no treachery but want of men and money
amongst the soldiers this is muttered
that here you maintain several factions
and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought
you are disputing of your generals
one would have ling'ring wars with little cost
another would fly swift but wanteth wings
a third thinks without expense at all
awake awake english nobility
let not sloth dim your honours new begot
cropp'd are the flower de luces in your arms
of england's coat one half is cut away
exeter were our tears wanting to this funeral
these tidings would call forth their flowing tides

o whither shall we fly from this reproach
gloucester we will not fly but to our enemies' throats
bedford if thou be slack i'll fight it out
bedford gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness
an army have i muster'd in my thoughts
wherewith already france is overrun
enter a third messenger
third messenger my gracious lords to add to your
wherewith you now bedew king henry's hearse
i must inform you of a dismal fight
betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
winchester what wherein talbot overcame is't so
third messenger o no wherein lord talbot was
empty
the circumstance i'll tell you more at large
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord
retiring from the siege of orleans
by three and twenty thousand of the french
was round encompassed and set upon
no leisure had he to enrank his men
he wanted pikes to set before his archers
instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
they pitched in the ground confusedly
to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
more than three hours the fight continued
where valiant talbot above human thought
hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
here there and everywhere enrag'd he slew
the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms
all the whole army stood agaz'd on him
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
'a talbot a talbot' cried out amain
and rush'd into the bowels of the battle
here had the conquest fully been seald up
if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward
with purpose to relieve and follow them
cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
hence grew the general wreck and massacre
enclosed were they with their enemies
a base walloon to win the dauphins grace
thrust talbot with a spear into the back
whom all france with their chief assembled strength
durst not presume to look once in the face
bedford is talbot slain then i will slay myself
whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
unto his dastard foemen is betray'd
third messenger o no he lives but is took prisoner
and lord scales with him and lord hungerford
most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise
bedford his ransom there is none but i shall pay
i'll hale the dauphin headlong from his throne
his crown shall be the ransom of my friend
four of their lords i'll change for one of ours
bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
to keep our great saint george's feast withal
ten thousand soldiers with me i will take
whose bloody deeds shall make an europe quake
third messenger so you had need for orleans is besieg'd
the english army is grown weak and faint
the earl of salisbury craveth supply
and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
since they so few watch such a multitude
either to quell the dauphin utterly
or bring him in obedience to your yoke
bedford i do remember it and here take my leave
to go about my preparation exit
gloucester i'll to the tower with all the haste i can
to view th' artillery and munition
and then i will proclaim young henry king exit
exeter to eltham will i where the young king is
being ordaind his special governor
winchester aside each hath his place and function to
empty
i am left out for me nothing remains
but long i will not be jack out of office
the king from eltham i intend to steal
and sit at chiefest stern of public weal exeunt
scene 2
france before orleans
sound a flourish enter charles the dauphin alencon
charles mars his true moving even as in the heavens
so in the earth to this day is not known
late did he shine upon the english side
now we are victors upon us he smiles
what towns of any moment but we have
at pleasure here we lie near orleans
otherwhiles the famish'd english like pale ghosts
faintly besiege us one hour in a month
alencon they want their porridge and their fat bull
either they must be dieted like mules
and have their provender tied to their mouths
or piteous they will look like drowned mice
reignier let's raise the siege why live we idly here
talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
remaineth none but mad braind salisbury
and he may well in fretting spend his gall
nor men nor money hath he to make war
charles sound sound alarum we will rush on them
him i forgive my death that killeth me
when he sees me go back one foot or flee exeunt
here alarum they are beaten hack by the english with
great loss re enter charles alencon and reignier
charles who ever saw the like what men have i
dogs cowards dastards i would ne'er have fled
but that they left me midst my enemies
reignier salisbury is a desperate homicide
he fighteth as one weary of his life
do rush upon us as their hungry prey
alencon froissart a countryman of ours records
england all olivers and rowlands bred
during the time edward the third did reign
more truly now may this be verified
for none but samsons and goliases
it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten
lean raw bond rascals who would e'er suppose
they had such courage and audacity
empty
and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
of old i know them rather with their teeth
the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege
reignier i think by some odd gimmers or device
their arms are set like clocks still to strike on
else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
by my consent we'll even let them alone
alencon be it so
bastard where's the prince dauphin i have news for him
charles bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us
bastard methinks your looks are sad your cheer appalld
hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
be not dismay'd for succour is at hand
a holy maid hither with me i bring
which by a vision sent to her from heaven
ordained is to raise this tedious siege
and drive the english forth the bounds of france
exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome
what's past and what's to come she can descry
speak shall i call her in believe my words
for they are certain and unfallible
charles go call her in exit bastard
but first to try her skill
reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place
question her proudly let thy looks be stern
by this means shall we sound what skill she hath
joan la pucelle
reignier fair maid is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats
pucelle reignier is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me
where is the dauphin come come from behind
i know thee well though never seen before
be not amaz'd there's nothing hid from me
in private will i talk with thee apart
stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
reignier she takes upon her bravely at first dash
my wit untraind in any kind of art
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleas'd
to shine on my contemptible estate
lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs
and to suns parching heat display'd my cheeks
god's mother deigned to appear to me
and in a vision full of majesty
willd me to leave my base vocation
and free my country from calamity
in complete glory she reveald herself
and whereas i was black and swart before
with those clear rays which she infus'd on me
that beauty am i bless'd with which you may see
ask me what question thou canst possible
and i will answer unpremeditated
my courage try by combat if thou dar'st
and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex
resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
charles thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
only this proof i'll of thy valour make
in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
otherwise i renounce all confidence
pucelle i am prepar'd here is my keen edg'd sword
deck'd with five flower de luces on each side
the which at touraine in saint katherine's churchyard
out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth
pucelle and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man
here they fight and joan la pucelle overcomes
charles stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon
and fightest with the sword of deborah
pucelle christ's mother helps me else i were too weak
charles whoe'er helps thee 'tis thou that must help me
impatiently i burn with thy desire
my heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd
excellent pucelle if thy name be so
'tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus
pucelle i must not yield to any rites of love
for my professions sacred from above
when i have chased all thy foes from hence
then will i think upon a recompense
charles meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
reignier my lord methinks is very long in talk
alencon doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
else ne'er could he so long protract his speech
alencon he may mean more than we poor men do know
these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
reignier my lord where are you what devise you on
shall we give o'er orleans or no
pucelle why no i say distrustful recreants
fight till the last gasp i will be your guard
charles what she says i'll confirm we'll fight it out
pucelle assignd am i to be the english scourge
this night the siege assuredly i'll raise
since i have entered into these wars
glory is like a circle in the water
which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
with henry's death the english circle ends
dispersed are the glories it included
now am i like that proud insulting ship
which caesar and his fortune bare at once
charles was mahomet inspired with a dove
helen the mother of great constantine
nor yet saint philip's daughters were like thee
bright star of venus falln down on the earth
how may i reverently worship thee enough
alencon leave off delays and let us raise the siege
reignier woman do what thou canst to save our honours
drive them from orleans and be immortaliz'd

boy father i know and oft have shot at them
howe'er unfortunate i miss'd my aim
master gunner but now thou shalt not be thou ruld
by me
chief master gunner am i of this town
something i must do to procure me grace
the prince's espials have informed me
wont through a secret grate of iron bars
in yonder tower to overpeer the city
and thence discover how with most advantage
they may vex us with shot or with assault
to intercept this inconvenience
a piece of ordnance 'gainst it i have plac'd
and even these three days have i watch'd
if i could see them now do thou watch
for i can stay no longer
and thou shalt find me at the governor's exit
boy father i warrant you take you no care
i'll never trouble you if i may spy them exit
enter salisbury and talbot on the turrets with
sir william glansdale sir thomas gargrave
and others
salisbury talbot my life my joy again returnd
how wert thou handled being prisoner
or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd
talbot the earl of bedford had a prisoner
calld the brave lord ponton de santrailles
for him was i exchang'd and ransomed
but with a baser man of arms by far
once in contempt they would have barter'd me
which i disdaining scornd and craved death
rather than i would be so vile esteem'd
in fine redeem'd i was as i desir'd
but o the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
if i now had him brought into my power
salisbury yet tellst thou not how thou wert entertaind
talbot with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
in open market place produc'd they me
to be a public spectacle to all
here said they is the terror of the french
the scarecrow that affrights our children so
then broke i from the officers that led me
and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
my grisly countenance made others fly
none durst come near for fear of sudden death
in iron walls they deem'd me not secure
so great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
that they suppos'd i could rend bars of steel
and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
that walk'd about me every minute while
and if i did but stir out of my bed
enter the boy with a linstock
salisbury i grieve to hear what torments you endur'd
but we will be reveng'd sufficiently
now it is supper time in orleans
here through this grate i count each one
and view the frenchmen how they fortify
let us look in the sight will much delight thee
sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale
let me have your express opinions
gargrave i think at the north gate for there stand lords
glansdale and i here at the bulwark of the bridge
talbot for aught i see this city must be famish'd
or with light skirmishes enfeebled
here they shoot and salisbury and gargrave
fall down
salisbury o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
gargrave o lord have mercy on me woeful man
talbot what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
how far'st thou mirror of all martial men
one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
accursed tower accursed fatal hand
that hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy
in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame
henry the fifth he first traind to the wars
whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
yet liv'st thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail
the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
heaven be thou gracious to none alive
if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
bear hence his body i will help to bury it
sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life
speak unto talbot nay look up to him
salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
thou shalt not die whiles
he beckons with his hand and smiles on me
remember to avenge me on the french'
plantagenet i will and like thee nero
play on the lute beholding the towns burn
wretched shall france be only in my name
here an alarum and it thunders and lightens
what stir is this what tumult's in the heavens
whence cometh this alarum and the noise
enter a messenger
messenger my lord my lord the french have gather'd

it irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd
frenchmen i'll be a salisbury to you

talbot heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder

i must go victual orleans forthwith
a short alarum then enter the town with soldiers
o'ertake me if thou canst i scorn thy strength
go go cheer up thy hungry starved men
help salisbury to make his testament
talbot my thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel
i know not where i am nor what i do
a witch by fear not force like hannibal
drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
are from their hives and houses driven away
they calld us for our fierceness english dogs
now like to whelps we crying run away
a short alarum
or tear the lions out of england's coat
renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead
sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
or horse or oxen from the leopard
as you fly from your oft subdued slaves
alarum here another skirmish
it will not be retire into your trenches
you all consented unto salisbury's death
for none would strike a stroke in his revenge
in spite of us or aught that we could do

enter talbot bedford burgundy and forces
with scaling ladders their drums beating a dead
empty
talbot lord regent and redoubted burgundy
by whose approach the regions of artois
wallon and picardy are friends to us
this happy night the frenchmen are secure
having all day carous'd and banqueted
as fitting best to quittance their deceit
contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery
bedford coward of france how much he wrongs his fame
despairing of his own arm's fortitude
to join with witches and the help of hell
burgundy traitors have never other company
but what's that pucelle whom they term so pure
talbot a maid they say
bedford a maid and be so martial
if underneath the standard of the french
she carry armour as she hath begun
talbot well let them practise and converse with spirits
god is our fortress in whose conquering name
let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
bedford ascend brave talbot we will follow thee
talbot not all together better far i guess
that we do make our entrance several ways
that if it chance the one of us do fail
bedford agreed i'll to yond corner
burgundy and i to this
talbot and here will talbot mount or make his grave
now salisbury for thee and for the right
of english henry shall this night appear
how much in duty i am bound to both

half ready and half unready
alencon how now my lords what all unready so
bastard unready ay and glad we 'scap'd so well
reignier 'twas time i trow to wake and leave our beds
hearing alarums at our chamber doors
alencon of all exploits since first i follow'd arms
ne'er heard i of a warlike enterprise
more venturous or desperate than this
reignier if not of hell the heavens sure favour him
alencon here cometh charles i marvel how he sped
enter charles and la pucelle
bastard tut holy joan was his defensive guard
charles is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
didst thou at first to flatter us withal
make us partakers of a little gain
that now our loss might be ten times so much
pucelle wherefore is charles impatient with his friend
sleeping or waking must i still prevail
or will you blame and lay the fault on me
improvident soldiers had your watch been good
this sudden mischief never could have falln
charles duke of alencon this was your default
that being captain of the watch to night
did look no better to that weighty charge
alencon had all your quarters been as safely kept
as that whereof i had the government
bastard mine was secure
reignier and so was mine my lord
charles and for myself most part of all this night
within her quarter and mine own precinct
i was employ'd in passing to and fro
about relieving of the sentinels
then how or which way should they first break in
pucelle question my lords no further of the case
how or which way 'tis sure they found some place
and now there rests no other shift but this
to gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispers'd
and lay new platforms to endamage them
alarum enter an english soldier crying
'a talbot a talbot' they fly leaving their
clothes behind
soldier i'll be so bold to take what they have left
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword
for i have loaden me with many spoils

and others
bedford the day begins to break and night is fled
whose pitchy mantle over veild the earth
here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
retreat sounded
talbot bring forth the body of old salisbury
the middle centre of this cursed town
now have i paid my vow unto his soul
for every drop of blood was drawn from him
there hath at least five frenchmen died to night
and that hereafter ages may behold
what ruin happened in revenge of him
within their chiefest temple i'll erect
a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd
upon the which that every one may read
the treacherous manner of his mournful death
and what a terror he had been to france
but lords in all our bloody massacre
i muse we met not with the dauphins grace
his new come champion virtuous joan of arc
nor any of his false confederates
bedford 'tis thought lord talbot when the fight began
rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds
they did amongst the troops of armed men
burgundy myself as far as i could well discern
for smoke and dusky vapours of the night
am sure i scar'd the dauphin and his trull
when arm in arm they both came swiftly running
like to a pair of loving turtle doves
that could not live asunder day or night
after that things are set in order here
we'll follow them with all the power we have
enter a messenger
call ye the warlike talbot for his acts
so much applauded through the realm of france
talbot here is the talbot who would speak with him
messenger the virtuous lady countess of auvergne
with modesty admiring thy renown
by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
to visit her poor castle where she lies
that she may boast she hath beheld the man
whose glory fills the world with loud report
will turn into a peaceful comic sport
when ladies crave to be encount'red with
you may not my lord despise her gentle suit
talbot ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
could not prevail with all their oratory
yet hath a womans kindness overruld
and therefore tell her i return great thanks
and in submission will attend on her
will not your honours bear me company
and i have heard it said unbidden guests
are often welcomest when they are gone
talbot well then alone since there's no remedy
i mean to prove this lady's courtesy
come hither captain whispers you perceive my mind
captain i do my lord and mean accordingly exeunt
scene 3
auvergne the castle
enter the countess and her porter
and when you have done so bring the keys to me
porter madam i will
countess the plot is laid if all things fall out right
i shall as famous be by this exploit
as scythian tomyris by cyrus' death
great is the rumour of this dreadful knight
and his achievements of no less account
fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
to give their censure of these rare reports
messenger madam according as your ladyship desir'd
by message crav'd so is lord talbot come
countess and he is welcome what is this the man
messenger madam it is
countess is this the scourge of france
is this talbot so much fear'd abroad
that with his name the mothers still their babes
i see report is fabulous and false
i thought i should have seen some hercules
and large proportion of his strong knit limbs
alas this is a child a silly dwarf
it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
should strike such terror to his enemies
talbot madam i have been bold to trouble you
but since your ladyship is not at leisure
i'll sort some other time to visit you going
countess what means he now go ask him whither he
empty
to know the cause of your abrupt departure
talbot marry for that she's in a wrong belief
i go to certify her talbot's here
re enter porter with keys
countess if thou be he then art thou prisoner
talbot prisoner to whom
countess to me blood thirsty lord
and for that cause i traind thee to my house
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
but now the substance shall endure the like
and i will chain these legs and arms of thine
that hast by tyranny these many years
wasted our country slain our citizens
and sent our sons and husbands captivate
talbot ha ha ha
countess laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to
empty
talbot i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
whereon to practise your severity
countess why art not thou the man
talbot i am indeed
countess then have i substance too
talbot no no i am but shadow of myself
you are deceiv'd my substance is not here
for what you see is but the smallest part
and least proportion of humanity
i tell you madam were the whole frame here
your roof were not sufficient to contain 't
countess this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
he will be here and yet he is not here
how can these contrarieties agree
talbot that will i show you presently
winds his horn drums strike up
a peal of ordnance enter soldiers
how say you madam are you now persuaded
that talbot is but shadow of himself
with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
razeth your cities and subverts your towns
and in a moment makes them desolate
countess victorious talbot pardon my abuse
i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
and more than may be gathered by thy shape
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
for i am sorry that with reverence
i did not entertain thee as thou art
the mind of talbot as you did mistake
the outward composition of his body
what you have done hath not offended me
nor other satisfaction do i crave
but only with your patience that we may
taste of your wine and see what cates you have
for soldiers' stomachs always serve them well
countess with all my heart and think me honoured
to feast so great a warrior in my house exeunt
london the temple garden
enter the earls of somerset suffolk and warwick
richard plantagenet vernon and another lawyer
plantagenet great lords and gentlemen what means this
empty
dare no man answer in a case of truth
suffolk within the temple hall we were too loud
the garden here is more convenient
plantagenet then say at once if i maintaind the truth
suffolk faith i have been a truant in the law
and never yet could frame my will to it
and therefore frame the law unto my will
somerset judge you my lord of warwick then between us
warwick between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
between two blades which bears the better temper
between two horses which doth bear him best
between two girls which hath the merriest eye
but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
good faith i am no wiser than a daw
plantagenet tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
the truth appears so naked on my side
that any purblind eye may find it out
somerset and on my side it is so well apparelld
so clear so shining and so evident
that it will glimmer through a blind mans eye
plantagenet since you are tongue tied and so loath to speak
let him that is a true born gentleman
and stands upon the honour of his birth
if he suppose that i have pleaded truth
from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
somerset let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
but dare maintain the party of the truth
pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
warwick i love no colours and without all colour
of base insinuating flattery
suffolk i pluck this red rose with young somerset
and say withal i think he held the right
vernon stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
till you conclude that he upon whose side
the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
shall yield the other in the right opinion
somerset good master vernon it is well objected
if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
plantagenet and i
i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
giving my verdict on the white rose side
somerset prick not your finger as you pluck it off
lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
and fall on my side so against your will
vernon if i my lord for my opinion bleed
opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
and keep me on the side where still i am
somerset well well come on who else
empty
the argument you held was wrong in you
in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
plantagenet now somerset where is your argument
somerset here in my scabbard meditating that
shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
plantagenet meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
empty
for pale they look with fear as witnessing
somerset no plantagenet
'tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
plantagenet hath not thy rose a canker somerset
somerset hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
plantagenet ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
somerset well i'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
where false plantagenet dare not be seen
plantagenet now by this maiden blossom in my hand
i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
suffolk turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
plantagenet proud pole i will and scorn both him and
empty
suffolk i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat
somerset away away good william de la pole
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him
his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence
third son to the third edward king of england
spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
plantagenet he bears him on the place's privilege
or durst not for his craven heart say thus
somerset by him that made me i'll maintain my words
on any plot of ground in christendom
was not thy father richard earl of cambridge
for treason executed in our late king's days
corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
and till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman
plantagenet my father was attached not attainted
condemnd to die for treason but no traitor
and that i'll prove on better men than somerset
were growing time once ripened to my will
for your partaker pole and you yourself
i'll note you in my book of memory
look to it well and say you are well warnd
somerset ay thou shalt find us ready for thee still
and know us by these colours for thy foes
for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
plantagenet and by my soul this pale and angry rose
as cognizance of my blood drinking hate
will i for ever and my faction wear
until it wither with me to my grave
or flourish to the height of my degree
and so farewell until i meet thee next exit
somerset have with thee pole farewell ambitious
richard exit
plantagenet how i am brav'd and must perforce endure
empty
warwick this blot that they object against your house
shall be wip'd out in the next parliament
calld for the truce of winchester and gloucester
and if thou be not then created york
meantime in signal of my love to thee
against proud somerset and william pole
will i upon thy party wear this rose
and here i prophesy this brawl to day
grown to this faction in the temple garden
shall send between the red rose and the white
a thousand souls to death and deadly night
plantagenet good master vernon i am bound to you
that you on my behalf would pluck a flower
lawyer and so will i
plantagenet thanks gentle sir
come let us four to dinner i dare say
this quarrel will drink blood another day exeunt
scene 5
the tower of london
enter mortimer brought in a chair and gaolers
mortimer kind keepers of my weak decaying age
let dying mortimer here rest himself
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
and these grey locks the pursuivants of death
nestor like aged in an age of care
argue the end of edmund mortimer
these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
wax dim as drawing to their exigent
weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief
and pithless arms like to a withered vine
that droops his sapless branches to the ground
unable to support this lump of clay
swift winged with desire to get a grave
as witting i no other comfort have
but tell me keeper will my nephew come
first keeper richard plantagenet my lord will come
we sent unto the temple unto his chamber
and answer was returnd that he will come
mortimer enough my soul shall then be satisfied
poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
before whose glory i was great in arms
this loathsome sequestration have i had
and even since then hath richard been obscur'd
depriv'd of honour and inheritance
but now the arbitrator of despairs
just death kind umpire of mens miseries
with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
i would his troubles likewise were expir'd
that so he might recover what was lost
first keeper my lord your loving nephew now is come
mortimer richard plantagenet my friend is he come
plantagenet ay noble uncle thus ignobly us'd
your nephew late despised richard comes
mortimer direct mine arms i may embrace his neck
and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
that i may kindly give one fainting kiss
and now declare sweet stem from york's great stock
plantagenet first lean thine aged back against mine arm
and in that ease i'll tell thee my disease
this day in argument upon a case
some words there grew 'twixt somerset and me
among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
and did upbraid me with my father's death
which obloquy set bars before my tongue
else with the like i had requited him
therefore good uncle for my father's sake
and for alliance sake declare the cause
my father earl of cambridge lost his head
mortimer that cause fair nephew that imprisond me
and hath detaind me all my flow'ring youth
within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
was cursed instrument of his decease
plantagenet discover more at large what cause that was
for i am ignorant and cannot guess
mortimer i will if that my fading breath permit
henry the fourth grandfather to this king
depos'd his nephew richard edward's son
the first begotten and the lawful heir
of edward king the third of that descent
during whose reign the percies of the north
finding his usurpation most unjust
endeavour'd my advancement to the throne
the reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
was for that young richard thus remov'd
i was the next by birth and parentage
for by my mother i derived am
from lionel duke of clarence third son
to king edward the third whereas he
from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree
being but fourth of that heroic line
but mark as in this haughty great attempt
they laboured to plant the rightful heir
i lost my liberty and they their lives
succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign
thy father earl of cambridge then deriv'd
from famous edmund langley duke of york
marrying my sister that thy mother was
again in pity of my hard distress
levied an army weening to redeem
and have installd me in the diadem
but as the rest so fell that noble earl
and was beheaded thus the mortimers
plantagenet of which my lord your honour is the last
mortimer true and thou seest that i no issue have
and that my fainting words do warrant death
thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather
but yet be wary in thy studious care
plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail with me
but yet methinks my father's execution
was nothing less than bloody tyranny
mortimer with silence nephew be thou politic
and like a mountain not to be remov'd
but now thy uncle is removing hence
as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
with long continuance in a settled place
plantagenet o uncle would some part of my young years
might but redeem the passage of your age
mortimer thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer
empty
which giveth many wounds when one will kill
only give order for my funeral
and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
and prosperous be thy life in peace and war dies
plantagenet and peace no war befall thy parting soul
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
and like a hermit overpass'd thy days
well i will lock his counsel in my breast
and what i do imagine let that rest
keepers convey him hence and i myself
exeunt gaolers hearing out the body of mortimer
here dies the dusky torch of mortimer
chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort
and for those wrongs those bitter injuries
which somerset hath offer'd to my house
i doubt not but with honour to redress
and therefore haste i to the parliament
either to be restored to my blood
or make my ill th' advantage of my good exit
london the parliament house
flourish enter the king exeter gloucester warwick somerset and suffolk
the bishop of winchester richard plantagenet and others
gloucester offers to put up a bill winchester snatches it and tears it
winchester com'st thou with deep premeditated lines
with written pamphlets studiously devis'd
humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse
or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge
do it without invention suddenly
purpose to answer what thou canst object
gloucester presumptuous priest this place commands my
empty
or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me
think not although in writing i preferr'd
the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
that therefore i have forg'd or am not able
verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
as very infants prattle of thy pride
thou art a most pernicious usurer
froward by nature enemy to peace
lascivious wanton more than well beseems
a man of thy profession and degree
and for thy treachery what's more manifest
in that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
as well at london bridge as at the tower
beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
from envious malice of thy swelling heart
winchester gloucester i do defy thee lords vouchsafe
to give me hearing what i shall reply
if i were covetous ambitious or perverse
as he will have me how am i so poor
or how haps it i seek not to advance
or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
and for dissension who preferreth peace
more than i do except i be provok'd
it is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the duke
it is because no one should sway but he
no one but he should be about the king
and that engenders thunder in his breast
and makes him roar these accusations forth
but he shall know i am as good
gloucester as good
thou bastard of my grandfather
winchester ay lordly sir for what are you i pray
gloucester am i not protector saucy priest
winchester and am not i a prelate of the church
gloucester yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
and useth it to patronage his theft
winchester unreverent gloucester
gloucester thou art reverend
touching thy spiritual function not thy life
winchester rome shall remedy this
warwick roam thither then
warwick ay see the bishop be not overborne
somerset methinks my lord should be religious
and know the office that belongs to such
warwick methinks his lordship should be humbler
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead
somerset yes when his holy state is touch'd so near
warwick state holy or unhallow'd what of that
is not his grace protector to the king
plantagenet aside plantagenet i see must hold his
lest it be said 'speak sirrah when you should
must your bold verdict enter talk with lords'
else would i have a fling at winchester
king henry uncles of gloucester and of winchester
the special watchmen of our english weal
i would prevail if prayers might prevail
to join your hearts in love and amity
o what a scandal is it to our crown
that two such noble peers as ye should jar
civil dissension is a viperous worm
that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
a noise within 'down with the tawny coats'
what tumult's this
warwick an uproar i dare warrant
begun through malice of the bishop's men
a noise again 'stones stones'
enter the mayor of london attended
mayor o my good lords and virtuous henry
the bishop and the duke of gloucester's men
forbidden late to carry any weapon
have filld their pockets full of pebble stones
and banding themselves in contrary parts
do pelt so fast at one another's pate
that many have their giddy brains knock'd out
our windows are broke down in every street
and we for fear compelld to shut our shops
enter in skirmish the retainers of gloucester and
king henry we charge you on allegiance to ourself
to hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace
pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
first serving man nay if we be forbidden stones we'll
fall to it with our teeth
second serving man do what ye dare we are as resolute
skirmish again
gloucester you of my household leave this peevish broil
and set this unaccustom'd fight aside
empty
just and upright and for your royal birth
inferior to none but to his majesty
and ere that we will suffer such a prince
so kind a father of the commonweal
to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
we and our wives and children all will fight
and have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes
first serving man ay and the very parings of our nails
gloucester stay stay i say
and if you love me as you say you do
let me persuade you to forbear awhile
king henry o how this discord doth afflict my soul
can you my lord of winchester behold
my sighs and tears and will not once relent
who should be pitiful if you be not
or who should study to prefer a peace
if holy churchmen take delight in broils
except you mean with obstinate repulse
to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
you see what mischief and what murder too
hath been enacted through your enmity
then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
winchester he shall submit or i will never yield
gloucester compassion on the king commands me stoop
or i would see his heart out ere the priest
should ever get that privilege of me
hath banish'd moody discontented fury
as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
why look you still so stem and tragical
gloucester here winchester i offer thee my hand
king henry fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach
that malice was a great and grievous sin
and will not you maintain the thing you teach
but prove a chief offender in the same
warwick sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
what shall a child instruct you what to do
winchester well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee
love for thy love and hand for hand i give
gloucester aside ay but i fear me with a hollow
empty
see here my friends and loving countrymen
this token serveth for a flag of truce
betwixt ourselves and all our followers
so help me god as i dissemble not
king henry o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester
how joyful am i made by this contract
away my masters trouble us no more
but join in friendship as your lords have done
first serving man content i'll to the surgeons
second serving man and so will i
third serving man and i will see what physic the tavern
affords exeunt servants mayor c
warwick accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
we do exhibit to your majesty
gloucester well urg'd my lord of warwick for sweet
empty
an if your grace mark every circumstance
you have great reason to do richard right
especially for those occasions
at eltham place i told your majesty
king henry and those occasions uncle were of force
therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
warwick let richard be restored to his blood
so shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd
winchester as will the rest so willeth winchester
king henry if richard will be true not that alone
but all the whole inheritance i give
that doth belong unto the house of york
from whence you spring by lineal descent
plantagenet thy humble servant vows obedience
and humble service till the point of death
and in reguerdon of that duty done
i girt thee with the valiant sword of york
rise richard like a true plantagenet
and rise created princely duke of york
plantagenet and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
and as my duty springs so perish they
that grudge one thought against your majesty
all welcome high prince the mighty duke of york
somerset aside perish base prince ignoble duke of
gloucester now will it best avail your majesty
to cross the seas and to be crownd in france
the presence of a king engenders love
amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
as it disanimates his enemies
king henry when gloucester says the word king henry
empty
for friendly counsel cuts off many foes
gloucester your ships already are in readiness
exeter ay we may march in england or in france
not seeing what is likely to ensue
this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love
and will at last break out into a flame
as fest'red members rot but by degree
till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
so will this base and envious discord breed
and now i fear that fatal prophecy
was in the mouth of every sucking babe
that henry born at monmouth should win all
and henry born at windsor should lose all
which is so plain that exeter doth wish
his days may finish ere that hapless time exit
scene 2
france before rouen
enter la pucelle disguis'd with four soldiers dressed
like countrymen with sacks upon their backs
through which our policy must make a breach
take heed be wary how you place your words
talk like the vulgar sort of market men
that come to gather money for their corn
if we have entrance as i hope we shall
and that we find the slothful watch but weak
i'll by a sign give notice to our friends
that charles the dauphin may encounter them
first soldier our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
therefore we'll knock knocks
watch within qui est la

and once again we'll sleep secure in rouen
bastard here ent'red pucelle and her practisants
now she is there how will she specify
here is the best and safest passage in
alencon by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
which once discernd shows that her meaning is
no way to that for weakness which she ent'red
enter la pucelle on the top thrusting out
a torch burning
that joineth rouen unto her countrymen
but burning fatal to the talbotites exit
bastard see noble charles the beacon of our friend
the burning torch in yonder turret stands

a prophet to the fall of all our foes
alencon defer no time delays have dangerous ends

and then do execution on the watch alarum exeunt

an alarum excursions bedford brought in sick in
a chair enter talbot and burgundy without

before he'll buy again at such a rate
'twas full of darnel do you like the taste
burgundy scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
and make thee curse the harvest of that corn
charles your grace may starve perhaps before that time
bedford o let no words but deeds revenge this treason
pucelle what you do good grey beard break a
and run a tilt at death within a chair
talbot foul fiend of france and hag of all despite
encompass'd with thy lustful paramours
becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
and twit with cowardice a man half dead
damsel i'll have a bout with you again
or else let talbot perish with this shame
pucelle are ye so hot sir yet pucelle hold thy peace
if talbot do but thunder rain will follow
god speed the parliament who shall be the speaker
talbot dare ye come forth and meet us in the field
pucelle belike your lordship takes us then for fools
to try if that our own be ours or no
talbot i speak not to that railing hecate
but unto thee alencon and the rest
will ye like soldiers come and fight it out
alencon signior no
talbot signior hang base muleteers of france
and dare not take up arms like gentlemen
pucelle away captains let's get us from the walls
for talbot means no goodness by his looks
god b'uy my lord we came but to tell you
that we are here exeunt from the walls
talbot and there will we be too ere it be long
or else reproach be talbot's greatest fame
vow burgundy by honour of thy house
prick'd on by public wrongs sustaind in france
and i as sure as english henry lives
and as his father here was conqueror
as sure as in this late betrayed town
great coeur de lions heart was buried
so sure i swear to get the town or die
burgundy my vows are equal partners with thy vows
talbot but ere we go regard this dying prince
the valiant duke of bedford come my lord
we will bestow you in some better place
bedford lord talbot do not so dishonour me
here will i sit before the walls of rouen
and will be partner of your weal or woe
burgundy courageous bedford let us now persuade you
bedford not to be gone from hence for once i read
that stout pendragon in his litter sick
came to the field and vanquished his foes
methinks i should revive the soldiers' hearts
because i ever found them as myself
then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe
and now no more ado brave burgundy
but gather we our forces out of hand
and set upon our boasting enemy
exeunt against the town all but bedford and attendants
an alarum excursions enter sir john fastolfe
and a captain
captain whither away sir john fastolfe in such haste
fastolfe whither away to save myself by flight
captain what will you and leave lord talbot

they that of late were daring with their scoffs
are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
bedford dies and is carried in by two in his chair
an alarum re enter talbot burgundy and the rest
talbot lost and recovered in a day again
this is a double honour burgundy
yet heavens have glory for this victory
burgundy warlike and martial talbot burgundy

talbot thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now
i think her old familiar is asleep
now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks
what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief
that such a valiant company are fled
now will we take some order in the town
placing therein some expert officers
and then depart to paris to the king
for there young henry with his nobles lie
talbot but yet before we go let's not forget
the noble duke of bedford late deceas'd
but see his exequies fulfilld in rouen
a braver soldier never couched lance
a gentler heart did never sway in court
but kings and mightiest potentates must die
for that's the end of human misery exeunt
scene 3
the plains near rouen
and forces
pucelle dismay not princes at this accident
nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
care is no cure but rather corrosive
for things that are not to be remedied
let frantic talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail
we'll pull his plumes and take away his train
if dauphin and the rest will be but ruld
and of thy cunning had no diffidence
one sudden foil shall never breed distrust
bastard search out thy wit for secret policies
and we will make thee famous through the world
alencon we'll set thy statue in some holy place
and have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint
employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
pucelle then thus it must be this doth joan devise
by fair persuasions mix'd with sug'red words
to leave the talbot and to follow us
charles ay marry sweeting if we could do that
france were no place for henry's warriors
nor should that nation boast it so with us
but be extirped from our provinces
alencon for ever should they be expuls'd from france
and not have tide of an earldom here
pucelle your honours shall perceive how i will work
to bring this matter to the wished end
hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
their powers are marching unto paris ward
here sound an english march enter and pass over
at a distance talbot and his forces
there goes the talbot with his colours spread
and all the troops of english after him
french march enter the duke of burgundy and
his forces
now in the rearward comes the duke and his
summon a parley we will talk with him
trumpets sound a parley
charles a parley with the duke of burgundy
burgundy who craves a parley with the burgundy
pucelle the princely charles of france thy countryman
burgundy what say'st thou charles for i am marching
empty
charles speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words
pucelle brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
burgundy speak on but be not over tedious
pucelle look on thy country look on fertile france
and see the cities and the towns defac'd
by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
as looks the mother on her lowly babe
when death doth close his tender dying eyes
see see the pining malady of france
behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast
strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
return thee therefore with a flood of tears
and wash away thy country's stained spots
burgundy either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
or nature makes me suddenly relent
pucelle besides all french and france exclaims on thee
doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
that will not trust thee but for profit's sake

enter sir john fastolfe
to haste unto your coronation
a letter was deliver'd to my hands
writ to your grace from th' duke of burgundy
talbot shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
i vow'd base knight when i did meet thee next
to tear the garter from thy cravens leg plucking it off
which i have done because unworthily
thou wast installed in that high degree
pardon me princely henry and the rest
when but in all i was six thousand strong
and that the french were almost ten to one
before we met or that a stroke was given
like to a trusty squire did run away
in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
myself and divers gentlemen beside
were there surpris'd and taken prisoners
then judge great lords if i have done amiss
or whether that such cowards ought to wear
gloucester to say the truth this fact was infamous
and ill beseeming any common man
much more a knight a captain and a leader
talbot when first this order was ordaind my lords
knights of the garter were of noble birth
valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
such as were grown to credit by the wars
not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
but always resolute in most extremes
doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
profaning this most honourable order
and should if i were worthy to be judge
be quite degraded like a hedge born swain
that doth presume to boast of gentle blood
king henry stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy
empty
be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
and now my lord protector view the letter
sent from our uncle duke of burgundy
gloucester viewing the superscription what means his
grace that he hath chang'd his style
no more but plain and bluntly 'to the king'
hath he forgot he is his sovereign
or doth this churlish superscription
pretend some alteration in good will
what's here reads 'i have upon especial cause
together with the pitiful complaints
of such as your oppression feeds upon
forsaken your pernicious faction
and joind with charles the rightful king of france'
o monstrous treachery can this be so
that in alliance amity and oaths
there should be found such false dissembling guile
king henry what doth my uncle burgundy revolt
gloucester he doth my lord and is become your foe
gloucester it is the worst and all my lord he writes
king henry why then lord talbot there shall talk with
empty
and give him chastisement for this abuse
how say you my lord are you not content
talbot content my liege yes but that i am prevented
i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd
king henry then gather strength and march unto him
empty
and what offence it is to flout his friends
talbot i go my lord in heart desiring still
you may behold confusion of your foes exit
enter vernon and basset
vernon grant me the combat gracious sovereign
basset and me my lord grant me the combat too
york this is my servant hear him noble prince
somerset and this is mine sweet henry favour him
king henry be patient lords and give them leave to speak
and wherefore crave you combat or with whom
vernon with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
basset and i with him for he hath done me wrong
king henry what is that wrong whereof you both
complain first let me know and then i'll answer you
basset crossing the sea from england into france
this fellow here with envious carping tongue
upbraided me about the rose i wear
saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
about a certain question in the law
argu'd betwixt the duke of york and him
with other vile and ignominious terms
in confutation of which rude reproach
and in defence of my lord's worthiness
i crave the benefit of law of arms
vernon and that is my petition noble lord
for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
yet know my lord i was provok'd by him
and he first took exceptions at this badge
pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart
york will not this malice somerset be left
somerset your private grudge my lord of york will out
though ne'er so cunningly you smother it
king henry good lord what madness rules in brainsick
men when for so slight and frivolous a cause
good cousins both of york and somerset
quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace
york let this dissension first be tried by fight
and then your highness shall command a peace
somerset the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
york there is my pledge accept it somerset
vernon nay let it rest where it began at first
basset confirm it so mine honourable lord
and perish ye with your audacious prate
presumptuous vassals are you not asham'd
with this immodest clamorous outrage
to trouble and disturb the king and us
and you my lords methinks you do not well
to bear with their perverse objections
much less to take occasion from their mouths
to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
let me persuade you take a better course
king henry come hither you that would be combatants
henceforth i charge you as you love our favour
quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
and you my lords remember where we are
in france amongst a fickle wavering nation
if they perceive dissension in our looks
and that within ourselves we disagree
how will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
to wilful disobedience and rebel
when foreign princes shall be certified
that for a toy a thing of no regard
king henry's peers and chief nobility
destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of france
o think upon the conquest of my father
my tender years and let us not forgo
that for a trifle that was bought with blood
let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
i see no reason if i wear this rose
that any one should therefore be suspicious
i more incline to somerset than york
both are my kinsmen and i love them both
as well they may upbraid me with my crown
because forsooth the king of scots is crownd
but your discretions better can persuade
than i am able to instruct or teach
and therefore as we hither came in peace
so let us still continue peace and love
to be our regent in these parts of france
and good my lord of somerset unite
your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
go cheerfully together and digest
your angry choler on your enemies
ourself my lord protector and the rest
after some respite will return to calais
from thence to england where i hope ere long
with charles alencon and that traitorous rout
flourish exeunt all but york warwick
exeter vernon
warwick my lord of york i promise you the king
prettily methought did play the orator
york and so he did but yet i like it not
in that he wears the badge of somerset
warwick tush that was but his fancy blame him not
i dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
other affairs must now be managed
exeunt all but exeter
exeter well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice
for had the passions of thy heart burst out
i fear we should have seen decipher'd there
more rancorous spite more furious raging broils
than yet can be imagind or suppos'd
but howsoe'er no simple man that sees
this jarring discord of nobility
this factious bandying of their favourites
but that it doth presage some ill event
'tis much when sceptres are in childrens hands
but more when envy breeds unkind division
there comes the ruin there begins confusion exit

of an invincible unconquer'd spirit
this is the latest glory of thy praise

but o malignant and ill boding stars
now thou art come unto a feast of death
therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
by sudden flight come dally not be gone
john is my name talbot and am i your son

dishonour not her honourable name
to make a bastard and a slave of me
the world will say he is not talbot's blood
that basely fled when noble talbot stood
john he that flies so will ne'er return again
talbot if we both stay we both are sure to die
john then let me stay and father do you fly
your loss is great so your regard should be
my worth unknown no loss is known in me
upon my death the french can little boast
in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
flight cannot stain the honour you have won
but mine it will that no exploit have done
but if i bow they'll say it was for fear
there is no hope that ever i will stay
if the first hour i shrink and run away
here on my knee i beg mortality
rather than life preserv'd with infamy
talbot shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb
john ay rather than i'll shame my mother's womb
talbot upon my blessing i command thee go
john to fight i will but not to fly the foe
john no part of him but will be shame in me
talbot thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
john yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
talbot thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain
john you cannot witness for me being slain
if death be so apparent then both fly
talbot and leave my followers here to fight and die
my age was never tainted with such shame
john and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide
stay go do what you will the like do i
for live i will not if my father die
talbot then here i take my leave of thee fair son
born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
come side by side together live and die

and lay them gently on thy tender side
who art thou say that i may honour thee
margaret margaret my name and daughter to a king
the king of naples whosoe'er thou art
be not offended nature's miracle
thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
so doth the swan her downy cygnets save
keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
yet if this servile usage once offend
go and be free again as suffolk's friend she is going
o stay aside i have no power to let her pass
my hand would free her but my heart says no
as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind
fie de la pole disable not thyself
hast not a tongue is she not here thy prisoner
wilt thou be daunted at a womans sight
ay beauty's princely majesty is such
confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
margaret say earl of suffolk if thy name be so
for i perceive i am thy prisoner
suffolk aside how canst thou tell she will deny thy
empty
before thou make a trial of her love
margaret why speak'st thou not what ransom must i
empty
suffolk aside she's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd
she is a woman therefore to be won
margaret wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
empty
then how can margaret be thy paramour
margaret i were best leave him for he will not hear
suffolk aside there all is marr'd there lies a cooling
empty
margaret he talks at random sure the man is mad
suffolk aside and yet a dispensation may be had
margaret and yet i would that you would answer me
suffolk aside i'll win this lady margaret for whom
margaret he talks of wood it is some carpenter
suffolk aside yet so my fancy may be satisfied
and peace established between these realms
but there remains a scruple in that too
for though her father be the king of naples
duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor
and our nobility will scorn the match
margaret hear ye captain are you not at leisure
suffolk aside it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much
madam i have a secret to reveal
margaret aside what though i be enthralld he seems
a knight
and will not any way dishonour me
suffolk lady vouchsafe to listen what i say
margaret aside perhaps i shall be rescu'd by the french
and then i need not crave his courtesy
suffolk sweet madam give me hearing in a cause
margaret aside tush women have been captivate ere
suffolk lady wherefore talk you so
margaret i cry you mercy 'tis but quid for quo
suffolk say gentle princess would you not suppose
your bondage happy to be made a queen
margaret to be a queen in bondage is more vile
than is a slave in base servility
for princes should be free
suffolk and so shall you
if happy england's royal king be free
suffolk i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen
to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
and set a precious crown upon thy head
if thou wilt condescend to be my
margaret what
suffolk his love
margaret i am unworthy to be henry's wife
suffolk no gentle madam i unworthy am
to woo so fair a dame to be his wife
how say you madam are ye so content
margaret an if my father please i am content
suffolk then call our captains and our colours forth
and madam at your father's castle walls
we'll crave a parley to confer with him
sound a parley enter reignier on the walls
see reignier see thy daughter prisoner
reignier to whom
suffolk to me
i am a soldier and unapt to weep
or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness
suffolk yes there is remedy enough my lord
consent and for thy honour give consent
thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
whom i with pain have woo'd and won thereto
and this her easy held imprisonment
hath gaind thy daughter princely liberty
reignier speaks suffolk as he thinks
that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
reignier upon thy princely warrant i descend
to give thee answer of thy just demand
exit reignier from the walls
suffolk and here i will expect thy coming
trumpets sound enter reignier below
reignier welcome brave earl into our territories
command in anjou what your honour pleases
suffolk thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child
what answer makes your grace unto my suit
reignier since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
to be the princely bride of such a lord
upon condition i may quietly
enjoy mine own the country maine and anjou
free from oppression or the stroke of war
my daughter shall be henry's if he please
suffolk that is her ransom i deliver her
and those two counties i will undertake
reignier and i again in henry's royal name
as deputy unto that gracious king
give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
suffolk reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks
because this is in traffic of a king
aside and yet methinks i could be well content
to be mine own attorney in this case
i'll over then to england with this news
and make this marriage to be solemniz'd
in golden palaces as it becomes
reignier i do embrace thee as i would embrace
the christian prince king henry were he here
margaret farewell my lord good wishes praise and
empty
shall suffolk ever have of margaret she is going
suffolk farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret
no princely commendations to my king
margaret such commendations as becomes a maid
suffolk words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed
but madam i must trouble you again
no loving token to his majesty
margaret yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
never yet taint with love i send the king
suffolk and this withal kisses her
margaret that for thyself i will not so presume
to send such peevish tokens to a king
exeunt reignier and margaret
thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
solicit henry with her wondrous praise
bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
and natural graces that extinguish art
repeat their semblance often on the seas
that when thou com'st to kneel at henry's feet
thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder exit

york bring forth that sorceress condemnd to burn
enter la pucelle guarded and a shepherd
shepherd ah joan this kills thy father's heart outright
have i sought every country far and near
and now it is my chance to find thee out
must i behold thy timeless cruel death
ah joan sweet daughter joan i'll die with thee
pucelle decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
thou art no father nor no friend of mine
shepherd out out my lords an please you 'tis not so
i did beget her all the parish knows
her mother liveth yet can testify
she was the first fruit of my bach'lorship
warwick graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
york this argues what her kind of life hath been
wicked and vile and so her death concludes
shepherd fie joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
and for thy sake have i shed many a tear
deny me not i prithee gentle joan
pucelle peasant avaunt you have subornd this man
of purpose to obscure my noble birth
shepherd 'tis true i gave a noble to the priest
the morn that i was wedded to her mother
kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
wilt thou not stoop now cursed be the time
of thy nativity i would the milk
had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
o burn her burn her hanging is too good exit
york take her away for she hath liv'd too long
to fill the world with vicious qualities
pucelle first let me tell you whom you have condemnd
not me begotten of a shepherd swain
virtuous and holy chosen from above
by inspiration of celestial grace
to work exceeding miracles on earth
i never had to do with wicked spirits
but you that are polluted with your lusts
staind with the guiltless blood of innocents
corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
because you want the grace that others have
you judge it straight a thing impossible
no misconceived joan of arc hath been
a virgin from her tender infancy
chaste and immaculate in very thought
whose maiden blood thus rigorously effus'd
will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
york ay ay away with her to execution
warwick and hark ye sirs because she is a maid
spare for no fagots let there be enow
place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
pucelle will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
then joan discover thine infirmity
that warranteth by law to be thy privilege
i am with child ye bloody homicides
murder not then the fruit within my womb
although ye hale me to a violent death
york now heaven forfend the holy maid with child
warwick the greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought
is all your strict preciseness come to this
i did imagine what would be her refuge
warwick well go to we'll have no bastards live
especially since charles must father it
pucelle you are deceiv'd my child is none of his
it was alencon that enjoy'd my love
york alencon that notorious machiavel
it dies an if it had a thousand lives
pucelle o give me leave i have deluded you
'twas neither charles nor yet the duke i nam'd
warwick a married man that's most intolerable
york why here's a girl i think she knows not well
there were so many whom she may accuse
warwick it's sign she hath been liberal and free
york and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
use no entreaty for it is in vain
pucelle then lead me hence with whom i leave my
empty
upon the country where you make abode
but darkness and the gloomy shade of death
environ you till mischief and despair
drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
exit guarded
york break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
thou foul accursed minister of hell
enter cardinal beaufort attended
cardinal lord regent i do greet your excellence
for know my lords the states of christendom
mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils
have earnestly implor'd a general peace
betwixt our nation and the aspiring french
and here at hand the dauphin and his train
approacheth to confer about some matter
york is all our travail turnd to this effect
after the slaughter of so many peers
so many captains gentlemen and soldiers
and sold their bodies for their country's benefit
shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
have we not lost most part of all the towns
by treason falsehood and by treachery
our great progenitors had conquered
o warwick warwick i foresee with grief
the utter loss of all the realm of france
warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace
it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
enter charles alencon bastard reignier and others
charles since lords of england it is thus agreed
that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in france
we come to be informed by yourselves
what the conditions of that league must be
york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes
the hollow passage of my poisond voice
by sight of these our baleful enemies
cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus
of mere compassion and of lenity
to ease your country of distressful war
an suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
you shall become true liegemen to his crown
and charles upon condition thou wilt swear
to pay him tribute and submit thyself
thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him
and still enjoy thy regal dignity
alencon must he be then as shadow of himself
and yet in substance and authority
retain but privilege of a private man
this proffer is absurd and reasonless
charles 'tis known already that i am possess'd
with more than half the gallian territories
and therein reverenc'd for their lawful king
shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
detract so much from that prerogative
as to be calld but viceroy of the whole
that which i have than coveting for more
be cast from possibility of all
york insulting charles hast thou by secret means
us'd intercession to obtain a league
and now the matter grows to compromise
stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
either accept the title thou usurp'st
of benefit proceeding from our king
and not of any challenge of desert
reignier to charles my lord you do not well in
empty
to cavil in the course of this contract
if once it be neglected ten to one
we shall not find like opportunity
alencon to charles to say the truth it is your policy
to save your subjects from such massacre
and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
by our proceeding in hostility
although you break it when your pleasure serves
warwick how say'st thou charles shall our condition
empty
charles it shall
only reserv'd you claim no interest
in any of our towns of garrison
york then swear allegiance to his majesty
as thou art knight never to disobey
nor be rebellious to the crown of england
charles and the rest give tokens of fealty
so now dismiss your army when ye please
hang up your ensigns let your drums be still
for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt
scene 5
london the palace
enter suffolk in conference with the king
gloucester and exeter
king henry your wondrous rare description noble earl
her virtues graced with external gifts
do breed love's settled passions in my heart
and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
so am i driven by breath of her renown
either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
where i may have fruition of her love
suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale
is but a preface of her worthy praise
had i sufficient skill to utter them
would make a volume of enticing lines
able to ravish any dull conceit
and which is more she is not so divine
so full replete with choice of all delights
but with as humble lowliness of mind
she is content to be at your command
command i mean of virtuous intents
to love and honour henry as her lord
therefore my lord protector give consent
that margaret may be england's royal queen
gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin
you know my lord your highness is betroth'd
unto another lady of esteem
how shall we then dispense with that contract
and not deface your honour with reproach
suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
or one that at a triumph having vow'd
by reason of his adversary's odds
a poor earls daughter is unequal odds
and therefore may be broke without offence
gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than
empty
her father is no better than an earl
although in glorious titles he excel
suffolk yes my lord her father is a king
the king of naples and jerusalem
as his alliance will confirm our peace
and keep the frenchmen in allegiance
gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do
because he is near kinsman unto charles
exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
where reignier sooner will receive than give
suffolk a dow'r my lords disgrace not so your king
that he should be so abject base and poor
to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
and not to seek a queen to make him rich
so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
as market men for oxen sheep or horse
marriage is a matter of more worth
than to be dealt in by attorneyship
not whom we will but whom his grace affects
must be companion of his nuptial bed
and therefore lords since he affects her most
it most of all these reasons bindeth us
for what is wedlock forced but a hell
an age of discord and continual strife
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
and is a pattern of celestial peace
whom should we match with henry being a king
but margaret that is daughter to a king
her peerless feature joined with her birth
approves her fit for none but for a king
her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
will answer our hope in issue of a king
for henry son unto a conqueror
is likely to beget more conquerors
if with a lady of so high resolve
as is fair margaret he be link'd in love
then yield my lords and here conclude with me
that margaret shall be queen and none but she
king henry whether it be through force of your report
my noble lord of suffolk or for that
with any passion of inflaming love
i cannot tell but this i am assur'd
i feel such sharp dissension in my breast
such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
as i am sick with working of my thoughts
take therefore shipping post my lord to france
agree to any covenants and procure
that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come
to cross the seas to england and be crownd
for your expenses and sufficient charge
among the people gather up a tenth
be gone i say for till you do return
i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
and you good uncle banish all offence
if you do censure me by what you were
not what you are i know it will excuse
this sudden execution of my will
and so conduct me where from company
gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last
exeunt gloucester and exeter
suffolk thus suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes
as did the youthful paris once to greece
with hope to find the like event in love
but prosper better than the troyan did
margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
but i will rule both her the king and realm exit

i had in charge at my depart for france

the dukes of orleans calaber bretagne and alencon
seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops

in sight of england and her lordly peers
deliver up my title in the queen
to your most gracious hands that are the substance
of that great shadow i did represent
the happiest gift that ever marquis gave
the fairest queen that ever king receiv'd
king henry suffolk arise welcome queen margaret
i can express no kinder sign of love
lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face
a world of earthly blessings to my soul
if sympathy of love unite our thoughts
queen great king of england and my gracious lord
the mutual conference that my mind hath had
by day by night waking and in my dreams
in courtly company or at my beads
with you mine alder liefest sovereign
with ruder terms such as my wit affords

king henry her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
her words y clad with wisdom's majesty
makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys

here are the articles of contracted peace

gloucester reads 'imprimis it is agreed between the french king
charles and william de la pole marquess of suffolk ambassador
for henry king of england that the said henry shall espouse the
lady margaret daughter unto reignier king of naples sicilia
and jerusalem and crown her queen of england ere the thirtieth
of may next ensuing
released and delivered to the king her father'
lets the paper fall
king henry uncle how now
gloucester pardon me gracious lord
some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
and dimm'd mine eyes that i can read no further
king henry uncle of winchester i pray read on
cardinal reads 'item it is further agreed between them that the
duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over
england's own proper cost and charges without having any dowry'
king henry they please us well lord marquess kneel down
we here create thee the first duke of suffolk
and girt thee with the sword cousin of york
we here discharge your grace from being regent
i' th' parts of france till term of eighteen months
be full expir'd thanks uncle winchester
gloucester york buckingham somerset
salisbury and warwick
in entertainment to my princely queen
come let us in and with all speed provide
to see her coronation be perform'd
exeunt king queen and suffolk
gloucester brave peers of england pillars of the state
to you duke humphrey must unload his grief
your grief the common grief of all the land
what did my brother henry spend his youth
his valour coin and people in the wars
in winter's cold and summer's parching heat
to conquer france his true inheritance
and did my brother bedford toil his wits
to keep by policy what henry got
have you yourselves somerset buckingham
brave york salisbury and victorious warwick
receiv'd deep scars in france and normandy
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself
with all the learned council of the realm
early and late debating to and fro
how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
and had his highness in his infancy
crowned in paris in despite of foes
and shall these labours and these honours die
shall henry's conquest bedford's vigilance
your deeds of war and all our counsel die
o peers of england shameful is this league
fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
razing the characters of your renown
defacing monuments of conquer'd france
undoing all as all had never been
cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse
this peroration with such circumstance
for france 'tis ours and we will keep it still
gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can
but now it is impossible we should
suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast
unto the poor king reignier whose large style
agrees not with the leanness of his purse
salisbury now by the death of him that died for all
these counties were the keys of normandy
but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son
warwick for grief that they are past recovery
for were there hope to conquer them again
my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
anjou and maine myself did win them both
and are the cities that i got with wounds
deliver'd up again with peaceful words
mort dieu
york for suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
that dims the honour of this warlike isle
france should have torn and rent my very heart
before i would have yielded to this league
i never read but england's kings have had
large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
to match with her that brings no vantages
gloucester a proper jest and never heard before
that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
for costs and charges in transporting her
she should have stay'd in france and starv'd in france
empty
cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot
it was the pleasure of my lord the king
gloucester my lord of winchester i know your mind
but 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye
rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
i see thy fury if i longer stay
we shall begin our ancient bickerings
lordings farewell and say when i am gone
i prophesied france will be lost ere long exit
cardinal so there goes our protector in a rage
'tis known to you he is mine enemy
nay more an enemy unto you all
consider lords he is the next of blood
and heir apparent to the english crown
had henry got an empire by his marriage
and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
there's reason he should be displeas'd at it
look to it lords let not his smoothing words
bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
what though the common people favour him
calling him 'humphrey the good duke of gloucester'
'jesu maintain your royal excellence'
with 'god preserve the good duke humphrey'
i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
he will be found a dangerous protector
buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign
he being of age to govern of himself
cousin of somerset join you with me
and all together with the duke of suffolk
we'll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat
i'll to the duke of suffolk presently exit
somerset cousin of buckingham though humphrey's pride
and greatness of his place be grief to us
yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
his insolence is more intolerable
than all the princes in the land beside
if gloucester be displac'd he'll be protector
buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector
despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
salisbury pride went before ambition follows him
while these do labour for their own preferment
behoves it us to labour for the realm
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester
did bear him like a noble gentleman
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal
more like a soldier than a man o' th' church
as stout and proud as he were lord of all
swear like a ruffian and demean himself
warwick my son the comfort of my age
thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
hath won the greatest favour of the commons
excepting none but good duke humphrey
and brother york thy acts in ireland
in bringing them to civil discipline
thy late exploits done in the heart of france
when thou wert regent for our sovereign
have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
in what we can to bridle and suppress
the pride of suffolk and the cardinal
with somerset's and buckingham's ambition
and as we may cherish duke humphrey's deeds
while they do tend the profit of the land
warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land
and common profit of his country
york and so says york aside for he hath greatest cause
salisbury then let's make haste away and look unto the main
that maine which by main force warwick did win
and would have kept so long as breath did last
main chance father you meant but i meant maine
which i will win from france or else be slain
exeunt warwick and salisbury
york anjou and maine are given to the french
paris is lost the state of normandy
stands on a tickle point now they are gone
suffolk concluded on the articles
to changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
i cannot blame them all what is't to them
'tis thine they give away and not their own
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
and purchase friends and give to courtezans
still revelling like lords till all be gone
while as the silly owner of the goods
weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
ready to starve and dare not touch his own
so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue
while his own lands are bargaind for and sold
methinks the realms of england france and ireland
bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
as did the fatal brand althaea burnt
unto the prince's heart of calydon
anjou and maine both given unto the french
cold news for me for i had hope of france
a day will come when york shall claim his own
and therefore i will take the nevils' parts
and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey
and when i spy advantage claim the crown
for that's the golden mark i seek to hit
nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right
nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
nor wear the diadem upon his head
whose church like humours fits not for a crown
watch thou and wake when others be asleep
to pry into the secrets of the state
till henry surfeiting in joys of love
with his new bride and england's dear bought queen
and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars
then will i raise aloft the milk white rose
with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd
and in my standard bear the arms of york
to grapple with the house of lancaster
whose bookish rule hath pulld fair england down exit
scene ii
the duke of gloucester's house
enter duke and his wife eleanor
duchess why droops my lord like over ripend corn
hanging the head at ceres' plenteous load
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows
as frowning at the favours of the world
why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth
what see'st thou there king henry's diadem
enchas'd with all the honours of the world
if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
until thy head be circled with the same
put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
what is't too short i'll lengthen it with mine
and having both together heav'd it up
we'll both together lift our heads to heaven
and never more abase our sight so low
gloucester o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord
banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
and may that thought when i imagine ill
against my king and nephew virtuous henry
be my last breathing in this mortal world
my troublous dreams this night doth make me sad
duchess what dream'd my lord tell me and i'll requite it
with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream
gloucester methought this staff mine office badge in court
but as i think it was by th' cardinal
and on the pieces of the broken wand
were plac'd the heads of edmund duke of somerset
and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
this was my dream what it doth bode god knows
duchess tut this was nothing but an argument
that he that breaks a stick of gloucester's grove
shall lose his head for his presumption
but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke
in the cathedral church of westminster
and in that chair where kings and queens were crownd
where henry and dame margaret kneeld to me
and on my head did set the diadem
gloucester nay eleanor then must i chide outright
presumptuous dame ill nurtur'd eleanor
art thou not second woman in the realm
and the protector's wife belov'd of him
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
to tumble down thy husband and thyself
from top of honour to disgrace's feet
away from me and let me hear no more
duchess what what my lord are you so choleric
with eleanor for telling but her dream
next time i'll keep my dreams unto myself
and not be check'd
gloucester nay be not angry i am pleas'd again
messenger my lord protector 'tis his highness' pleasure
you do prepare to ride unto saint albans
where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
gloucester i go come nell thou wilt ride with us
duchess yes my good lord i'll follow presently
exeunt gloucester and messenger
follow i must i cannot go before
while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
were i a man a duke and next of blood
and smooth my way upon their headless necks
and being a woman i will not be slack
to play my part in fortune's pageant
where are you there sir john nay fear not man
we are alone here's none but thee and i
enter hume
hume jesus preserve your royal majesty
duchess what say'st thou majesty i am but grace

duchess what say'st thou man hast thou as yet conferr'd
with margery jourdain the cunning witch of eie

seal up your lips and give no words but mum
the business asketh silent secrecy
dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
i dare not say from the rich cardinal
and from the great and new made duke of suffolk
yet i do find it so for to be plain
they knowing dame eleanor's aspiring humour
have hired me to undermine the duchess
and buzz these conjurations in her brain
they say 'a crafty knave does need no broker'
yet am i suffolk and the cardinals broker
hume if you take not heed you shall go near
well so its stands and thus i fear at last
hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck
and her attainture will be humphrey's fall
sort how it will i shall have gold for all exit

queen reads 'to my lord protector' are your supplications to
his lordship let me see them what is thine
first petitioner mine is ant please your grace against john
goodman my lord cardinals man for keeping my house and lands
and wife and all from me
suffolk thy wife too that's some wrong indeed what's yours
what's here reads 'against the duke of suffolk for enclosing
the commons of melford' how now sir knave
second petitioner alas sir i am but a poor petitioner of our
peter presenting his petition against my master thomas horner
for saying that the duke of york was rightful heir to the crown
queen what say'st thou did the duke of york say he was rightful
heir to the crown
peter that my master was no forsooth my master said that he
was and that the king was an usurper
suffolk who is there enter servant take this fellow in and
send for his master with a pursuivant presently we'll hear more
of your matter before the king
queen and as for you that love to be protected
under the wings of our protector's grace
begin your suits anew and sue to him
tears the supplications
away base cullions suffolk let them go
all come let's be gone exeunt
queen my lord of suffolk say is this the guise
is this the fashions in the court of england
is this the government of britains isle
what shall king henry be a pupil still
under the surly gloucester's governance
am i a queen in title and in style
and must be made a subject to a duke
i tell thee pole when in the city tours
thou ranst a tilt in honour of my love
and stolst away the ladies' hearts of france
i thought king henry had resembled thee
in courage courtship and proportion
to number ave maries on his beads
his champions are the prophets and apostles
his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
his study is his tilt yard and his loves
are brazen images of canonized saints
i would the college of the cardinals
would choose him pope and carry him to rome
and set the triple crown upon his head
that were a state fit for his holiness
your highness came to england so will i
in england work your grace's full content
queen beside the haughty protector have we beaufort
the imperious churchman somerset buckingham
and grumbling york and not the least of these
but can do more in england than the king
suffolk and he of these that can do most of all
cannot do more in england than the nevils
salisbury and warwick are no simple peers
as that proud dame the lord protector's wife
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife
strangers in court do take her for the queen
she bears a duke's revenues on her back
and in her heart she scorns our poverty
shall i not live to be aveng'd on her
contemptuous base born callet as she is
she vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day
was better worth than all my father's lands
till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
suffolk madam myself have lim'd a bush for her
and plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
that she will light to listen to the lays
and never mount to trouble you again
so let her rest and madam list to me
for i am bold to counsel you in this
although we fancy not the cardinal
till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
as for the duke of york this late complaint
will make but little for his benefit
so one by one we'll weed them all at last
and you yourself shall steer the happy helm
sound a sennet enter the king duke humphrey

let york be regent i will yield to him
warwick whether your grace be worthy yea or no
dispute not that york is the worthier
cardinal ambitious warwick let thy betters speak
warwick the cardinals not my better in the field
buckingham all in this presence are thy betters warwick
salisbury peace son and show some reason buckingham
why somerset should be preferr'd in this
queen because the king forsooth will have it so
gloucester madam the king is old enough himself
to give his censure these are no womens matters
queen if he be old enough what needs your grace
to be protector of his excellence
gloucester madam i am protector of the realm
and at his pleasure will resign my place
since thou wert king as who is king but thou
the commonwealth hath daily run to wrack
the dauphin hath prevaild beyond the seas
and all the peers and nobles of the realm
have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
cardinal the commons hast thou rack'd the clergy's bags
are lank and lean with thy extortions
somerset thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
have cost a mass of public treasury
upon offenders hath exceeded law
and left thee to the mercy of the law
queen thy sale of offices and towns in france
if they were known as the suspect is great
would make thee quickly hop without thy head
exit gloucester the queen drops queen her fan
give me my fan what minion can ye not
she gives the duchess a box on the ear
i cry your mercy madam was it you
could i come near your beauty with my nails
i could set my ten commandments in your face
king henry sweet aunt be quiet 'twas against her will
duchess against her will good king look to 't in time
she'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
though in this place most master wear no breeches
she shall not strike dame eleanor unreveng'd exit
buckingham lord cardinal i will follow eleanor
and listen after humphrey how he proceeds
she'll gallop far enough to her destruction exit
re enter gloucester
gloucester now lords my choler being overblown
with walking once about the quadrangle
i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
as for your spiteful false objections
prove them and i lie open to the law
but god in mercy so deal with my soul
as i in duty love my king and country
i say my sovereign york is meetest man
to be your regent in the realm of france
suffolk before we make election give me leave
to show some reason of no little force
that york is most unmeet of any man
york i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet
first for i cannot flatter thee in pride
next if i be appointed for the place
my lord of somerset will keep me here
till france be won into the dauphins hands
last time i danc'd attendance on his will

this is the law and this duke humphrey's doom
somerset i humbly thank your royal majesty
horner and i accept the combat willingly
peter alas my lord i cannot fight for god's sake pity my case

buckingham such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
under the countenance and confederacy
of lady eleanor the protector's wife
the ringleader and head of all this rout
have practis'd dangerously against your state
dealing with witches and with conjurers

queen gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
and look thyself be faultless thou wert best
gloucester madam for myself to heaven i do appeal
how i have lov'd my king and commonweal
and for my wife i know not how it stands
noble she is but if she have forgot
honour and virtue and convers'd with such
as like to pitch defile nobility
i banish her my bed and company
and give her as a prey to law and shame
that hath dishonoured gloucester's honest name
king henry well for this night we will repose us here

scene ii
london the duke of york's garden
enter york salisbury and warwick
york now my good lords of salisbury and warwick
our simple supper ended give me leave
in this close walk to satisfy myself
which is infallible to england's crown
salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full
warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good
the nevils are thy subjects to command
york then thus
edward the third my lords had seven sons
the first edward the black prince prince of wales
the second william of hatfield and the third
lionel duke of clarence next to whom
the fifth was edmund langley duke of york
the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester
william of windsor was the seventh and last
edward the black prince died before his father
and left behind him richard his only son
who after edward the third's death reignd as king
till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster
the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt
crownd by the name of henry the fourth
sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
and him to pomfret where as all you know
harmless richard was murdered traitorously
warwick father the duke hath told the truth
thus got the house of lancaster the crown
york which now they hold by force and not by right
for richard the first sons heir being dead
the issue of the next son should have reignd
salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir
i claim the crown had issue philippe a daughter
who married edmund mortimer earl of march
edmund had issue roger earl of march
roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor
salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke
as i have read laid claim unto the crown
and but for owen glendower had been king
who kept him in captivity till he died
but to the rest
my mother being heir unto the crown
married richard earl of cambridge who was
to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son son
by her i claim the kingdom she was heir
to roger earl of march who was the son
of edmund mortimer who married philippe
sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence
so if the issue of the elder son
succeed before the younger i am king
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt
the fourth son york claims it from the third
till lionels issue fails his should not reign
it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
then father salisbury kneel we together
and in this private plot be we the first
that shall salute our rightful sovereign
with honour of his birthright to the crown
york we thank you lords but i am not your king
till i be crownd and that my sword be staind
with heart blood of the house of lancaster
and that's not suddenly to be perform'd
but with advice and silent secrecy
do you as i do in these dangerous days
wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence
at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition
at buckingham and all the crew of them
that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey
'tis that they seek and they in seeking that
shall find their deaths if york can prophesy
salisbury my lord break we off we know your mind at full
warwick my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
shall one day make the duke of york a king

duchess ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
for whilst i think i am thy married wife
and thou a prince protector of this land

the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
and when i start the envious people laugh
and bid me be advised how i tread
ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
trowest thou that e'er i'll look upon the world
or count them happy that enjoy the sun

sometimes i'll say i am duke humphrey's wife
and he a prince and ruler of the land
yet so he ruld and such a prince he was
as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess
was made a wonder and a pointing stock
to every idle rascal follower
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
hang over thee as sure it shortly will
with her that hateth thee and hates us all
and york and impious beaufort that false priest
have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings
and fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
but fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd
nor never seek prevention of thy foes
gloucester ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry
i must offend before i be attainted
and had i twenty times so many foes
all these could not procure me any scathe
so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
why yet thy scandal were not wip'd away
but i in danger for the breach of law
thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell

act iii scene i
the abbey at bury st edmunds
sound a sennet enter the king the queen cardinal suffolk york
buckingham salisbury and warwick to the parliament
king henry i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
'tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
whate'er occasion keeps him from us now
queen can you not see or will ye not observe
with what a majesty he bears himself
how insolent of late he is become
how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
we know the time since he was mild and affable
and if we did but glance a far off look
immediately he was upon his knee
that all the court admir'd him for submission
but meet him now and be it in the morn
when every one will give the time of day
and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
disdaining duty that to us belongs
small curs are not regarded when they grin
but great men tremble when the lion roars
and humphrey is no little man in england
first note that he is near you in descent
and should you fall he is the next will mount
me seemeth then it is no policy
respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
that he should come about your royal person
or be admitted to your highness' council
by flattery hath he won the commons' hearts
and when he please to make commotion
'tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted
suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
the reverent care i bear unto my lord
if it be fond can it a womans fear
which fear if better reasons can supplant
i will subscribe and say i wrong'd the duke
my lord of suffolk buckingham and york
reprove my allegation if you can
or else conclude my words effectual
suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke
and had i first been put to speak my mind
i think i should have told your grace's tale
upon my life began her devilish practices
or if he were not privy to those faults
yet by reputing of his high descent
as next the king he was successive heir
and such high vaunts of his nobility
did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
and in his simple show he harbours treason
no no my sovereign gloucester is a man
unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
cardinal did he not contrary to form of law
devise strange deaths for small offences done
york and did he not in his protectorship
levy great sums of money through the realm
for soldiers' pay in france and never sent it
by means whereof the towns each day revolted
buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
king henry my lords at once the care you have of us
to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall
queen ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
for he's disposed as the hateful raven
is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
for he's inclind as is the ravenous wolf
who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
take heed my lord the welfare of us all
hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
enter somerset
somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign
king henry welcome lord somerset what news from france
is utterly bereft you all is lost
king henry cold news lord somerset but god's will be done
york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france
as firmly as i hope for fertile england
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
and caterpillars eat my leaves away
but i will remedy this gear ere long
or sell my title for a glorious grave
enter gloucester
pardon my liege that i have stay'd so long
suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon
unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
i do arrest thee of high treason here
gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
nor change my countenance for this arrest
a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
the purest spring is not so free from mud
as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
york 'tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france
and being protector stay'd the soldiers' pay
by means whereof his highness hath lost france
gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it
i never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
nor ever had one penny bribe from france
so help me god as i have watch'd the night
ay night by night in studying good for england
that doit that e'er i wrested from the king
be brought against me at my trial day
no many a pound of mine own proper store
because i would not tax the needy commons
have i dispursed to the garrisons
and never ask'd for restitution
cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much
gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god
york in your protectorship you did devise
strange tortures for offenders never heard of
gloucester why 'tis well known that whiles i was protector
pity was all the fault that was in me
for i should melt at an offender's tears
and lowly words were ransom for their fault
unless it were a bloody murderer
or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers
i never gave them condign punishment
murder indeed that bloody sin i tortur'd
above the felon or what trespass else
but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
i do arrest you in his highness' name
and here commit you to my lord cardinal
to keep until your further time of trial
king henry my lord of gloucester 'tis my special hope
that you will clear yourself from all suspense
my conscience tells me you are innocent
gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
and charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand
foul subornation is predominant
and equity exild your highness' land
i know their complot is to have my life
and if my death might make this island happy
and prove the period of their tyranny
i would expend it with all willingness
but mine is made the prologue to their play
for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue
the envious load that lies upon his heart
and dogged york that reaches at the moon
whose overweening arm i have pluck'd back
by false accuse doth level at my life
and you my sovereign lady with the rest
causeless have laid disgraces on my head
my liefest liege to be mine enemy
ay all of you have laid your heads together
myself had notice of your conventicles
and all to make away my guiltless life
i shall not want false witness to condemn me
nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
the ancient proverb will be well effected
'a staff is quickly found to beat a dog'
cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable
from treasons secret knife and traitor's rage
be thus upbraided chid and rated at
and the offender granted scope of speech
'twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
as if she had suborned some to swear
false allegations to o'erthrow his state
queen but i can give the loser leave to chide
beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
and well such losers may have leave to speak
buckingham he'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
lord cardinal he is your prisoner
cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
before his legs be firm to bear his body
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
for good king henry thy decay i fear exit guarded
king henry my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
do or undo as if ourself were here
queen what will your highness leave the parliament
king henry ay margaret my heart is drownd with grief
whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
my body round engirt with misery
for what's more miserable than discontent
ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see
and yet good humphrey is the hour to come
that e'er i prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith
what louring star now envies thy estate
that these great lords and margaret our queen
do seek subversion of thy harmless life
thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
and as the butcher takes away the calf
and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
bearing it to the bloody slaughter house
and as the dam runs lowing up and down
looking the way her harmless young one went
and can do nought but wail her darling's loss
even so myself bewails good gloucester's case
with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
look after him and cannot do him good
so mighty are his vowed enemies
his fortunes i will weep and 'twixt each groan
say 'who's a traitor gloucester he is none' exit
henry my lord is cold in great affairs
too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show
beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
with sorrow snares relenting passengers
or as the snake rolld in a flow'ring bank
with shining checker'd slough doth sting a child
that for the beauty thinks it excellent
believe me lords were none more wise than i
and yet herein i judge mine own wit good
to rid us from the fear we have of him
cardinal that he should die is worthy policy
but yet we want a colour for his death
'tis meet he be condemnd by course of law
suffolk but in my mind that were no policy
the king will labour still to save his life
the commons haply rise to save his life
and yet we have but trivial argument
more than mistrust that shows him worthy death
suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i
york 'tis york that hath more reason for his death
but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk
say as you think and speak it from your souls
were't not all one an empty eagle were set
to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
as place duke humphrey for the king's protector
queen so the poor chicken should be sure of death
suffolk madam 'tis true and were't not madness then
who being accus'd a crafty murderer
his guilt should be but idly posted over
because his purpose is not executed
no let him die in that he is a fox
by nature prov'd an enemy to the flock
before his chaps be staind with crimson blood
as humphrey prov'd by reasons to my liege
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
be it by gins by snares by subtlety
so he be dead for that is good deceit
which mates him first that first intends deceit
queen thrice noble suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke
suffolk not resolute except so much were done
for things are often spoke and seldom meant
but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
seeing the deed is meritorious
and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
say but the word and i will be his priest
ere you can take due orders for a priest
say you consent and censure well the deed
and i'll provide his executioner
i tender so the safety of my liege
suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
queen and so say i
york and i and now we three have spoke it
it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
enter a post
to signify that rebels there are up
and put the englishmen unto the sword
send succours lords and stop the rage betime
before the wound do grow uncurable
for being green there is great hope of help
cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
what counsel give you in this weighty cause
york that somerset be sent as regent thither
'tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd
somerset if york with all his far fet policy
had been the regent there instead of me
he never would have stay'd in france so long
york no not to lose it all as thou hast done
i rather would have lost my life betimes
than bring a burden of dishonour home
by staying there so long till all were lost
show me one scar character'd on thy skin
mens flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win
if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
no more good york sweet somerset be still
thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
might happily have prov'd far worse than his
york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all
somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame
cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is
th' uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
and temper clay with blood of englishmen
collected choicely from each county some
and try your hap against the irishmen
york i will my lord so please his majesty
suffolk why our authority is his consent
and what we do establish he confirms
then noble york take thou this task in hand
york i am content provide me soldiers lords
whiles i take order for mine own affairs
suffolk a charge lord york that i will see perform'd
cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him
that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
and so break off the day is almost spent
lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event
york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days
at bristol i expect my soldiers
for there i'll ship them all for ireland
suffolk i'll see it truly done my lord of york
exeunt all but york
and change misdoubt to resolution
be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art
resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying
let pale fac'd fear keep with the mean born man
and find no harbour in a royal heart
faster than spring time show'rs comes thought on thought
and not a thought but thinks on dignity
my brain more busy than the labouring spider
weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
to send me packing with an host of men
i fear me you but warm the starved snake
who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts
'twas men i lack'd and you will give them me
i take it kindly yet be well assur'd
you put sharp weapons in a madmans hands
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band
i will stir up in england some black storm
shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
until the golden circuit on my head
like to the glorious suns transparent beams
do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw
and for a minister of my intent
i have seduc'd a headstrong kentishman
john cade of ashford
to make commotion as full well he can
under the tide of john mortimer
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
and fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
were almost like a sharp quilld porpentine
and in the end being rescu'd i have seen
him caper upright like a wild morisco
shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
full often like a shag hair'd crafty kern
hath he conversed with the enemy
and undiscover'd come to me again
and given me notice of their villainies
for that john mortimer which now is dead
in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
by this i shall perceive the commons' mind
how they affect the house and claim of york
say he be taken rack'd and tortured
i know no pain they can inflict upon him
will make him say i mov'd him to those arms
say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will
why then from ireland come i with my strength
for humphrey being dead as he shall be
and henry put apart the next for me exit
scene ii
bury st edmunds a room of state
enter two or three murderers running over the stage
from the murder of duke humphrey
first murderer run to my lord of suffolk let him know
we have dispatch'd the duke as he commanded
second murderer o that it were to do what have we done
enter suffolk
first murderer here comes my lord
suffolk now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing
first murderer ay my good lord he's dead
suffolk why that's well said go get you to my house
i will reward you for this venturous deed
the king and all the peers are here at hand
have you laid fair the bed is all things well
according as i gave directions
suffolk away be gone exeunt murderers
sound trumpets enter the king the queen
cardinal somerset with attendants
king henry go call our uncle to our presence straight
say we intend to try his grace to day
if he be guilty as 'tis published
suffolk i'll call him presently my noble lord exit
king henry lords take your places and i pray you all
proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle gloucester
he be approv'd in practice culpable
queen god forbid any malice should prevail
that faultless may condemn a nobleman
pray god he may acquit him of suspicion
king henry i thank thee meg these words content me much
re enter suffolk
how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou
where is our uncle what's the matter suffolk
suffolk dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead
cardinal god's secret judgment i did dream to night
the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
the king swoons
queen how fares my lord help lords the king is dead
somerset rear up his body wring him by the nose
queen run go help help o henry ope thine eyes
suffolk he doth revive again madam be patient
king o heavenly god
queen how fares my gracious lord
king henry what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me
came he right now to sing a ravens note
whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs
and thinks he that the chirping of a wren
by crying comfort from a hollow breast
can chase away the first conceived sound
hide not thy poison with such sug'red words
lay not thy hands on me forbear i say
their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny
sits in grim majesty to fright the world
look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
yet do not go away come basilisk
and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
for in the shade of death i shall find joy
in life but double death'now gloucester's dead
queen why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus
although the duke was enemy to him
and for myself foe as he was to me
might liquid tears or heart offending groans
or blood consuming sighs recall his life
i would be blind with weeping sick with groans
look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs
and all to have the noble duke alive
what know i how the world may deem of me
for it is known we were but hollow friends
it may be judg'd i made the duke away
and princes' courts be filld with my reproach
this get i by his death ay me unhappy
to be a queen and crownd with infamy
king henry ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man
queen be woe for me more wretched than he is
what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
i am no loathsome leper look on me
what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy
erect his statue and worship it
and make my image but an alehouse sign
was i for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
and twice by awkward wind from england's bank
drove back again unto my native clime
what boded this but well forewarning wind
did seem to say 'seek not a scorpions nest
nor set no footing on this unkind shore'
and he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves
and bid them blow towards england's blessed shore
or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
yet aeolus would not be a murderer
but left that hateful office unto thee
the pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me
knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore
with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
the splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
because thy flinty heart more hard than they
might in thy palace perish margaret
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs
when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
i stood upon the hatches in the storm
and when the dusky sky began to rob
my earnest gaping sight of thy land's view
i took a costly jewel from my neck
a heart it was bound in with diamonds
and so i wish'd thy body might my heart
and even with this i lost fair england's view
and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
and calld them blind and dusky spectacles
for losing ken of albions wished coast
how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue
the agent of thy foul inconstancy
to sit and witch me as ascanius did
when he to madding dido would unfold
am i not witch'd like her or thou not false like him
ay me i can no more die margaret
for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
noise within enter warwick salisbury
and many commons
warwick it is reported mighty sovereign
that good duke humphrey traitorously is murd'red
by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means
the commons like an angry hive of bees
and care not who they sting in his revenge
myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
until they hear the order of his death
king henry that he is dead good warwick 'tis too true
but how he died god knows not henry
enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
and comment then upon his sudden death
warwick that shall i do my liege stay salisbury
with the rude multitude till i return exit
king henry o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life
if my suspect be false forgive me god
for judgment only doth belong to thee
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
upon his face an ocean of salt tears
to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
but all in vain are these mean obsequies
and to survey his dead and earthy image
what were it but to make my sorrow greater
bed put forth with the body enter warwick
warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body
king henry that is to see how deep my grave is made
for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
for seeing him i see my life in death
warwick as surely as my soul intends to live
to free us from his father's wrathful curse
i do believe that violent hands were laid
upon the life of this thrice famed duke
suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow
warwick see how the blood is settled in his face
oft have i seen a timely parted ghost
of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
being all descended to the labouring heart
attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy
which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
to blush and beautify the cheek again
but see his face is black and full of blood
his eye balls further out than when he liv'd
staring full ghastly like a strangled man
his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd with struggling
his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdu'd
his well proportiond beard made rough and rugged
like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged
it cannot be but he was murd'red here
the least of all these signs were probable
suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death
myself and beaufort had him in protection
and we i hope sir are no murderers
warwick but both of you were vow'd duke humphrey's foes
and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
and 'tis well seen he found an enemy
queen then you belike suspect these noblemen
as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death
warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
but will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter
who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
but may imagine how the bird was dead
although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
queen are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife
is beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons
suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
that slanders me with murder's crimson badge
say if thou dar'st proud lord of warwickshire
that i am faulty in duke humphrey's death
exeunt cardinal somerset and others
queen he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
nor cease to be an arrogant controller
though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
warwick madam be still with reverence may i say
for every word you speak in his behalf
is slander to your royal dignity
suffolk blunt witted lord ignoble in demeanour
if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
thy mother took into her blameful bed
was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art
and never of the nevils' noble race
warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
and i should rob the deathsman of his fee
quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild
i would false murd'rous coward on thy knee
make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
and after all this fearful homage done
give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men
suffolk thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood
if from this presence thou dar'st go with me
warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence
unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee
and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost
exeunt suffolk and warwick
thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just
and he but naked though lock'd up in steel
whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
a noise within
queen what noise is this
re enter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn
king why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
here in our presence dare you be so bold
why what tumultuous clamour have we here
set all upon me mighty sovereign
re enter salisbury
salisbury to the commons within sirs stand apart the king
shall know your mind
dread lord the commons send you word by me
unless lord suffolk straight be done to death
or banished fair england's territories
they will by violence tear him from your palace
and torture him with grievous ling'ring death
they say in him they fear your highness' death
and mere instinct of love and loyalty
free from a stubborn opposite intent
as being thought to contradict your liking
makes them thus forward in his banishment
they say in care of your most royal person
that if your highness should intend to sleep
and charge that no man should disturb your rest
in pain of your dislike or pain of death
were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
that slily glided towards your majesty
it were but necessary you were wak'd
lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
and therefore do they cry though you forbid
that they will guard you whe'er you will or no
from such fell serpents as false suffolk is
with whose envenomed and fatal sting
they say is shamefully bereft of life
commons within an answer from the king my lord of salisbury
suffolk 'tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
could send such message to their sovereign
but you my lord were glad to be employ'd
to show how quaint an orator you are
but all the honour salisbury hath won
is that he was the lord ambassador
sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
king henry go salisbury and tell them all from me
i thank them for their tender loving care
and had i not been cited so by them
yet did i purpose as they do entreat
for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
mischance unto my state by suffolk's means
and therefore by his majesty i swear
whose far unworthy deputy i am
he shall not breathe infection in this air
exit salisbury
queen o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk
king henry ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
no more i say if thou dost plead for him
thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
had i but said i would have kept my word
but when i swear it is irrevocable
if after three days' space thou here be'st found
on any ground that i am ruler of
come warwick come good warwick go with me
i have great matters to impart to thee
exeunt all but queen and suffolk
queen mischance and sorrow go along with you
heart's discontent and sour affliction
be playfellows to keep you company
there's two of you the devil make a third
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations
queen fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch
has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them
would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
i would invent as bitter searching terms
as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
with full as many signs of deadly hate
as lean fac'd envy in her loathsome cave
mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
mine hair be fix'd an end as one distract
ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
and even now my burdend heart would break
should i not curse them poison be their drink
gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks
their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings
and boding screech owls make the consort full
all the foul terrors in dark seated hell
queen enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself
and these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass
or like an overcharged gun recoil
and turns the force of them upon thyself
suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
now by the ground that i am banish'd from
well could i curse away a winter's night
where biting cold would never let grass grow
and think it but a minute spent in sport
queen o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand
that i may dew it with my mournful tears
nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
to wash away my woeful monuments
o could this kiss be printed in thy hand
that thou might'st think upon these by the seal
through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee
'tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by
as one that surfeits thinking on a want
i will repeal thee or be well assur'd
adventure to be banished myself
and banished i am if but from thee
go speak not to me even now be gone
o go not yet even thus two friends condemnd
embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
loather a hundred times to part than die
suffolk thus is poor suffolk ten times banished
once by the king and three times thrice by thee
'tis not the land i care for wert thou thence
a wilderness is populous enough
so suffolk had thy heavenly company
for where thou art there is the world itself
with every several pleasure in the world
and where thou art not desolation
i can no more live thou to joy thy life
enter vaux
queen whither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee
vaux to signify unto his majesty
that cardinal beaufort is at point of death
for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
sometime he talks as if duke humphrey's ghost
were by his side sometime he calls the king
the secrets of his overcharged soul
and i am sent to tell his majesty
that even now he cries aloud for him
queen go tell this heavy message to the king exit vaux
ay me what is this world what news are these
but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss
omitting suffolk's exile my souls treasure
why only suffolk mourn i not for thee
and with the southern clouds contend in tears
now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming
if thou be found by me thou art but dead
suffolk if i depart from thee i cannot live
and in thy sight to die what were it else
but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
here could i breathe my soul into the air
as mild and gentle as the cradle babe
dying with mother's dug between its lips
where from thy sight i should be raging mad
to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
or i should breathe it so into thy body
and then it liv'd in sweet elysium
to die by thee were but to die in jest
from thee to die were torture more than death
o let me stay befall what may befall
queen away though parting be a fretful corrosive
it is applied to a deathful wound
for whereso'er thou art in this world's globe
i'll have an iris that shall find thee out
suffolk i go
queen and take my heart with thee she kisses him
suffolk a jewel lock'd into the woefullst cask
that ever did contain a thing of worth
even as a splitted bark so sunder we
this way fall i to death
queen this way for me exeunt severally

so thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
king henry ah what a sign it is of evil life
where death's approach is seen so terrible
warwick beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee
died he not in his bed where should he die
can i make men live whe'er they will or no
o torture me no more i will confess
alive again then show me where he is
i'll give a thousand pound to look upon him
he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
comb down his hair look look it stands upright
like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul
give me some drink and bid the apothecary
king henry o thou eternal mover of the heavens
look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
o beat away the busy meddling fiend
that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
and from his bosom purge this black despair
warwick see how the pangs of death do make him grin
salisbury disturb him not let him pass peaceably
king henry peace to his soul if god's good pleasure be
lord card'nal if thou think'st on heavens bliss
he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him
warwick so bad a death argues a monstrous life
king henry forbear to judge for we are sinners all
close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
and let us all to meditation exeunt
act iv scene i
the coast of kent
alarum fight at sea ordnance goes off enter a lieutenant
a shipmaster and his mate and walter whitmore with sailors
lieutenant the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
is crept into the bosom of the sea
and now loud howling wolves arouse the jades
that drag the tragic melancholy night
who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
clip dead mens graves and from their misty jaws
breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs
or with their blood stain this discoloured shore
master this prisoner freely give i thee
and thou that art his mate make boot of this
the other walter whitmore is thy share
first gentleman what is my ransom master let me know
master a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
mate and so much shall you give or off goes yours
lieutenant what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
and bear the name and port of gentlemen
the lives of those which we have lost in fight
be counterpois'd with such a petty sum
first gentleman i'll give it sir and therefore spare my life
second gentleman and so will i and write home for it straight
whitmore i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
to suffolk and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
and so should these if i might have my will
lieutenant be not so rash take ransom let him live
suffolk look on my george i am a gentleman
whitmore and so am i my name is walter whitmore
how now why start'st thou what doth death affright
suffolk thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
a cunning man did calculate my birth
and told me that by water i should die
yet let not this make thee be bloody minded
thy name is gualtier being rightly sounded
whitmore gualtier or walter which it is i care not
never yet did base dishonour blur our name
therefore when merchant like i sell revenge
broke be my sword my arms torn and defac'd
and i proclaim'd a coward through the world
suffolk stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
the duke of suffolk william de la pole
whitmore the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags
suffolk ay but these rags are no part of the duke
jove sometime went disguis'd and why not i
lieutenant but jove was never slain as thou shalt be
the honourable blood of lancaster
must not be shed by such a jaded groom
hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
bareheaded plodded by my foot cloth mule
and thought thee happy when i shook my head
how often hast thou waited at my cup
fed from my trencher kneeld down at the board
when i have feasted with queen margaret
remember it and let it make thee crestfalln
how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
and duly waited for my coming forth
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
whitmore speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain
lieutenant first let my words stab him as he hath me
suffolk base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
lieutenant convey him hence and on our longboat's side
strike off his head
lieutenant poole
suffolk poole
lieutenant ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
troubles the silver spring where england drinks
now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
for swallowing the treasure of the realm
thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground
and thou that smildst at good duke humphrey's death
against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
for daring to affy a mighty lord
unto the daughter of a worthless king
having neither subject wealth nor diadem
by devilish policy art thou grown great
and like ambitious sylla overgorg'd
with gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france
the false revolting normans thorough thee
hath slain their governors surpris'd our forts
and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
the princely warwick and the nevils all
whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
as hating thee are rising up in arms
and now the house of york thrust from the crown
by shameful murder of a guiltless king
and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
under the which is writ 'invitis nubibus'
the commons here in kent are up in arms
and to conclude reproach and beggary
is crept into the palace of our king
and all by thee away convey him hence
suffolk o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder
upon these paltry servile abject drudges
small things make base men proud this villain here
being captain of a pinnace threatens more
drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives
it is impossible that i should die
by such a lowly vassal as thyself
thy words move rage and not remorse in me
i go of message from the queen to france
i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel
lieutenant walter
whitmore come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death
suffolk gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear
what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
first gentleman my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
suffolk suffolk's imperial tongue is stem and rough
us'd to command untaught to plead for favour
far be it we should honour such as these
with humble suit no rather let my head
stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
save to the god of heaven and to my king
and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
true nobility is exempt from fear
more can i bear than you dare execute
lieutenant hale him away and let him talk no more
suffolk come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
that this my death may never be forgot
great men oft die by vile bezonians
a roman sworder and banditto slave
murder'd sweet tully brutus' bastard hand
stabb'd julius caesar savage islanders
exit walter with suffolk
lieutenant and as for these whose ransom we have set
it is our pleasure one of them depart
therefore come you with us and let him go
exeunt all but the first gentleman
re enter whitmore with suffolk's body
whitmore there let his head and lifeless body lie
until the queen his mistress bury it exit

sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art thou hast most
traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other
books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to
be us'd and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou
hast built a paper mill it will be proved to thy face that thou
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and
such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear
them about matters they were not able to answer moreover thou
hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou
hast hang'd them when indeed only for that cause they have
been most worthy to live thou dost ride in a foot cloth dost

but to maintain the king the realm and you
large gifts have i bestow'd on learned clerks
because my book preferr'd me to the king

you cannot but forbear to murder me
this tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
for your behoof
cade tut when struck'st thou one blow in the field

commodities upon our bills
cade marry presently

lov'd well when they were alive now part them again lest they
consult about the giving up of some more towns in france

borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the
streets and at every corner have them kiss away exeunt

buckingham ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee
and therefore yet relent and save my life
know cade we come ambassadors from the king
unto the commons whom thou hast misled
and here pronounce free pardon to them all
clifford what say ye countrymen will ye relent
and yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you
or let a rebel lead you to your deaths
who loves the king and will embrace his pardon
fling up his cap and say 'god save his majesty'
who hateth him and honours not his father
henry the fifth that made all france to quake
shake he his weapon at us and pass by
all god save the king god save the king
and you base peasants do ye believe him will you needs be
hang'd with your about your necks hath my sword therefore broke
through london gates that you should leave me at the white hart
in southwark i thought ye would never have given out these arms
till you had recovered your ancient freedom but you are all
recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the
nobility let them break your backs with burdens take your
houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before
your faces for me i will make shift for one and so god's curse
all we'll follow cade we'll follow cade
clifford is cade the son of henry the fifth
that thus you do exclaim you'll go with him
will he conduct you through the heart of france
and make the meanest of you earls and dukes
alas he hath no home no place to fly to
nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
unless by robbing of your friends and us
were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar
should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you
methinks already in this civil broil
i see them lording it in london streets
crying 'villiago' unto all they meet
better ten thousand base born cades miscarry
than you should stoop unto a frenchmans mercy
to france to france and get what you have lost
spare england for it is your native coast
henry hath money you are strong and manly
all a clifford a clifford we'll follow the king and clifford
cade was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
multitude the name of henry the fifth hales them to an hundred

enter cade
cade fie on ambitions fie on myself that have a sword and yet am
ready to famish these five days have i hid me in these woods and
durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now
am i so hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a
wall have i climb'd into this garden to see if i can eat grass
or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a
mans stomach this hot weather and i think this word 'sallet'
was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my
brain pain had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time
when i have been dry and bravely marching it hath serv'd me
instead of a quart pot to drink in and now the word 'sallet'
must serve me to feed on
enter iden
and may enjoy such quiet walks as these
this small inheritance my father left me
contenteth me and worth a monarchy
i seek not to wax great by others' waning
or gather wealth i care not with what envy
sufficeth that i have maintains my state

cade here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for
entering his fee simple without leave ah villain thou wilt
head to him but i'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and
swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part
iden why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be
i know thee not why then should i betray thee
is't not enough to break into my garden
and like a thief to come to rob my grounds
climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
cade brave thee ay by the best blood that ever was broach'd and
days yet come thou and thy five men and if i do not leave you
all as dead as a door nail i pray god i may never eat grass
empty
iden nay it shall ne'er be said while england stands
that alexander iden an esquire of kent
took odds to combat a poor famish'd man
oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine
see if thou canst outface me with thy looks
set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
and if mine arm be heaved in the air
thy grave is digg'd already in the earth
as for words whose greatness answers words
let this my sword report what speech forbears
cade by my valour the most complete champion that ever i heard
steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly bond
clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath i beseech
fight cade falls o i am slain famine and no other hath slain
me let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the
ten meals i have lost and i'd defy them all wither garden and
be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house
because the unconquered soul of cade is fled
iden is't cade that i have slain that monstrous traitor
sword i will hallow thee for this thy deed
and hang thee o'er my tomb when i am dead
ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
to emblaze the honour that thy master got
cade iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell kent from
me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be
cowards for i that never feared any am vanquished by famine
not by valour dies
iden how much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge
die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
and as i thrust thy body in with my sword
so wish i i might thrust thy soul to hell
unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
and there cut off thy most ungracious head
which i will bear in triumph to the king
leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon exit
act v scene i
fields between dartford and blackheath
enter york and his army of irish with drum and colours
york from ireland thus comes york to claim his right
and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head
to entertain great england's lawful king
ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
let them obey that knows not how to rule
this hand was made to handle nought but gold
i cannot give due action to my words
except a sword or sceptre balance it
a sceptre shall it have have i a soul
on which i'll toss the flower de luce of france
enter buckingham
the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble
buckingham york if thou meanest well i greet thee well
york humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting
art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
buckingham a messenger from henry our dread liege
to know the reason of these arms in peace
or why thou being a subject as i am
against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
should raise so great a power without his leave
york aside scarce can i speak my choler is so great
o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint
i am so angry at these abject terms
and now like ajax telamonius
on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury
i am far better born than is the king
more like a king more kingly in my thoughts
but i must make fair weather yet awhile
till henry be more weak and i more strong
that i have given no answer all this while
my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
the cause why i have brought this army hither
is to remove proud somerset from the king
seditious to his grace and to the state
buckingham that is too much presumption on thy part
but if thy arms be to no other end
the king hath yielded unto thy demand
the duke of somerset is in the tower
buckingham upon mine honour he is prisoner
york then buckingham i do dismiss my pow'rs
soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves
meet me to morrow in saint george's field
you shall have pay and everything you wish
and let my sovereign virtuous henry
command my eldest son nay all my sons

but boldly stand and front him to his face
york how now is somerset at liberty
then york unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts
shall i endure the sight of somerset
false king why hast thou broken faith with me
knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
king did i call thee no thou art not king
not fit to govern and rule multitudes
which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor
that head of thine doth not become a crown
thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
whose smile and frown like to achilles' spear
is able with the change to kill and cure
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
and with the same to act controlling laws
give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler
somerset o monstrous traitor i arrest thee york
of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown
obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
if they can brook i bow a knee to man
sirrah call in my sons to be my bail exit attendant

we are thy sovereign clifford kneel again
for thy mistaking so we pardon thee
clifford this is my king york i do not mistake
but thou mistakes me much to think i do
to bedlam with him is the man grown mad
king henry ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
makes him oppose himself against his king
clifford he is a traitor let him to the tower
queen he is arrested but will not obey
his sons he says shall give their words for him
york will you not sons
edward ay noble father if our words will serve
richard and if words will not then our weapons shall
clifford why what a brood of traitors have we here
york look in a glass and call thy image so
i am thy king and thou a false heart traitor
call hither to the stake my two brave bears
they may astonish these fell lurking curs
bid salisbury and warwick come to me
enter the earls of warwick and salisbury
clifford are these thy bears we'll bait thy bears to death
and manacle the berard in their chains
if thou dar'st bring them to the baiting place
richard oft have i seen a hot o'er weening cur
run back and bite because he was withheld
who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
and such a piece of service will you do
if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick
clifford hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
as crooked in thy manners as thy shape
york nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
clifford take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
king henry why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
old salisbury shame to thy silver hair
thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
o where is faith o where is loyalty
if it be banish'd from the frosty head
where shall it find a harbour in the earth
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
and shame thine honourable age with blood
why art thou old and want'st experience
or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
salisbury my lord i have considered with myself
the tide of this most renowned duke
and in my conscience do repute his grace
the rightful heir to england's royal seat
king henry hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
salisbury i have
king henry canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
salisbury it is great sin to swear unto a sin
but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
to do a murd'rous deed to rob a man
to force a spotless virgins chastity
to reave the orphan of his patrimony
to wring the widow from her custom'd right
and have no other reason for this wrong
but that he was bound by a solemn oath
queen a subtle traitor needs no sophister
king henry call buckingham and bid him arm himself
york call buckingham and all the friends thou hast
clifford the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true
warwick you were best to go to bed and dream again
to keep thee from the tempest of the field
clifford i am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
than any thou canst conjure up to day
and that i'll write upon thy burgonet
might i but know thee by thy household badge
warwick now by my father's badge old nevils crest
the rampant bear chaind to the ragged staff
as on a mountain top the cedar shows
that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
even to affright thee with the view thereof
clifford and from thy burgonet i'll rend thy bear
and tread it under foot with all contempt
despite the berard that protects the bear
young clifford and so to arms victorious father
to quell the rebels and their complices
richard fie charity for shame speak not in spite
young clifford foul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tell
richard if not in heaven you'll surely sup in hell

empty
i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
and giv'n unto the house of york such head
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
what is it but to make thy sepulchre
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
the duke is made protector of the realm
and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
the trembling lamb environed with wolves
had i been there which am a silly woman
the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
before i would have granted to that act
but thou prefer'st thy life before thine honour
both from thy table henry and thy bed
until that act of parliament be repeald
whereby my son is disinherited
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
will follow mine if once they see them spread
and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
and utter ruin of the house of york
thus do i leave thee come son let's away
our army is ready come we'll after them
queen margaret thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone

i'll see your grace till then i'll follow her
queen margaret come son away we may not linger thus
exeunt queen margaret and the prince
king henry poor queen how love to me and to her son
hath made her break out into terms of rage
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle

the loss of those three lords torments my heart
i'll write unto them and entreat them fair
come cousin you shall be the messenger
exeter and i i hope shall reconcile them all exeunt
scene ii
sandal castle near wakefield in yorkshire
richard brother though i be youngest give me leave
edward no i can better play the orator
montague but i have reasons strong and forcible
enter the duke of york
york why how now sons and brother at a strife
what is your quarrel how began it first
edward no quarrel but a slight contention
york about what
richard about that which concerns your grace and us
york mine boy not till king henry be dead
richard your right depends not on his life or death
edward now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
it will outrun you father in the end
york i took an oath that he should quietly reign
edward but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
richard no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
richard i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak
york thou canst not son it is impossible
richard an oath is of no moment being not took
before a true and lawful magistrate
that hath authority over him that swears
henry had none but did usurp the place
then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose
your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
therefore to arms and father do but think
within whose circuit is elysium
and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
why do we linger thus i cannot rest
until the white rose that i wear be dy'd
even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart
york richard enough i will be king or die
brother thou shalt to london presently
and whet on warwick to this enterprise
thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk
you edward shall unto my lord cobham
with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise
in them i trust for they are soldiers
witty courteous liberal full of spirit
while you are thus employ'd what resteth more
but that i seek occasion how to rise
and yet the king not privy to my drift
nor any of the house of lancaster
enter a messenger
messenger the queen with all the northern earls and lords
intend here to besiege you in your castle
she is hard by with twenty thousand men
and therefore fortify your hold my lord
york ay with my sword what think'st thou that we fear them
edward and richard you shall stay with me
my brother montague shall post to london
let noble warwick cobham and the rest
whom we have left protectors of the king
and trust not simple henry nor his oaths
montague brother i go i'll win them fear it not
and thus most humbly i do take my leave exit
enter sir john and sir hugh mortimer
york sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles
you are come to sandal in a happy hour
the army of the queen mean to besiege us
sir john she shall not need we'll meet her in the field
york what with five thousand men
a womans general what should we fear
a march afar off
edward i hear their drums let's set our men in order
and issue forth and bid them battle straight
york five men to twenty though the odds be great
i doubt not uncle of our victory
many a battle have i won in france

field of battle between sandal castle and wakefield
alarum enter rutland and his tutor
rutland ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands
ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes
enter clifford and soldiers
clifford chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
as for the brat of this accursed duke
whose father slew my father he shall die
tutor and i my lord will bear him company
tutor ah clifford murder not this innocent child
lest thou be hated both of god and man
exit forced off by soldiers
clifford how now is he dead already or is it fear
that makes him close his eyes i'll open them
rutland so looks the pent up lion o'er the wretch
that trembles under his devouring paws
and so he walks insulting o'er his prey
and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
and not with such a cruel threat'ning look
sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath
be thou reveng'd on men and let me live
clifford in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter
rutland then let my father's blood open it again
he is a man and clifford cope with him
clifford had i thy brethren here their lives and thine
no if i digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
the sight of any of the house of york
is as a fury to torment my soul
and till i root out their accursed line
and leave not one alive i live in hell
empty
rutland o let me pray before i take my death
clifford such pity as my rapier's point affords
rutland i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
clifford thy father hath
rutland but 'twas ere i was born
thou hast one son for his sake pity me
lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
he be as miserably slain as i
ah let me live in prison all my days
and when i give occasion of offence
clifford no cause
thy father slew my father therefore die stabs him
rutland di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae dies
clifford plantagenet i come plantagenet
and this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade
shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
congeald with this do make me wipe off both exit
scene iv
another part of the field
york the army of the queen hath got the field
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
and all my followers to the eager foe
turn back and fly like ships before the wind
or lambs pursu'd by hunger starved wolves
my sons god knows what hath bechanced them
but this i know they have demeand themselves
like men born to renown by life or death
three times did richard make a lane to me
and full as oft came edward to my side
with purple falchion painted to the hilt
in blood of those that had encount'red him
and when the hardiest warriors did retire
richard cried 'charge and give no foot of ground'
and cried 'a crown or else a glorious tomb
a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
with this we charg'd again but out alas
we bodg'd again as i have seen a swan
and spend her strength with over matching waves
a short alarum within
ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
and i am faint and cannot fly their fury
and were i strong i would not shun their fury
the sands are numb'red that make up my life
here must i stay and here my life must end
enter queen margaret clifford northumberland
the prince of wales and soldiers
i dare your quenchless fury to more rage
i am your butt and i abide your shot
northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
with downright payment show'd unto my father
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
and made an evening at the noontide prick
york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
a bird that will revenge upon you all
scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
why come you not what multitudes and fear
clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further
so doves do peck the falcons piercing talons
so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers
york o clifford but bethink thee once again
and in thy thought o'errun my former time
and if thou canst for blushing view this face
whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word
but buckler with thee blows twice two for one
queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
i would prolong awhile the traitor's life
wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much
to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
what valour were it when a cur doth grin
when he might spurn him with his foot away
it is war's prize to take all vantages
and ten to one is no impeach of valour
they lay hands on york who struggles
clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net
york so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
so true men yield with robbers so o'er match'd
northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now
come make him stand upon this molehill here
that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
yet parted but the shadow with his hand
what was it you that would be england's king
was't you that revelld in our parliament
and made a preachment of your high descent
where are your mess of sons to back you now
the wanton edward and the lusty george
and where's that valiant crook back prodigy
was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
or with the rest where is your darling rutland
look york i staind this napkin with the blood
that valiant clifford with his rapier's point
made issue from the bosom of the boy
and if thine eyes can water for his death
i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
i should lament thy miserable state
what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
that not a tear can fall for rutland's death
why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport
york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
a crown for york and lords bow low to him
hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
ay marry sir now looks he like a king
ay this is he that took king henry's chair
and this is he was his adopted heir
but how is it that great plantagenet
is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath
as i bethink me you should not be king
till our king henry had shook hands with death
and will you pale your head in henry's glory
and rob his temples of the diadem
o 'tis a fault too too
off with the crown and with the crown his head
and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
clifford that is my office for my father's sake
queen margaret nay stay let's hear the orisons he makes
york she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france
whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
how ill beseeming is it in thy sex
to triumph like an amazonian trull
but that thy face is visard like unchanging
made impudent with use of evil deeds
i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
to tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom deriv'd
were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears the type of king of naples
of both the sicils and jerusalem
yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
unless the adage must be verified
that beggars mounted run their horse to death
'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
but god he knows thy share thereof is small
'tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd
the contrary doth make thee wond'red at
'tis government that makes them seem divine
the want thereof makes thee abominable
thou art as opposite to every good
or as the south to the septentrion
o tiger's heart wrapp'd in a womans hide
how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child
to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
and yet be seen to bear a womans face
women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
bid'st thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
and when the rage allays the rain begins
these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies
and every drop cries vengeance for his death
'gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman
northumberland beshrew me but his passions move me so
that hardly can i check my eyes from tears
york that face of his the hungry cannibals
would not have touch'd would not have staind with blood
but you are more inhuman more inexorable
see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
this cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy
and i with tears do wash the blood away
keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
and if thou tellst the heavy story right
upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears
and say 'alas it was a piteous deed'
there take the crown and with the crown my curse
as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
hard hearted clifford take me from the world
my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
northumberland had he been slaughter man to all my kin
i should not for my life but weep with him
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
queen margaret what weeping ripe my lord northumberland
think but upon the wrong he did us all
and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
stabbing him
queen margaret and here's to right our gentle hearted king
stabbing him
york open thy gate of mercy gracious god
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
empty
queen margaret off with his head and set it on york gates
so york may overlook the town of york
flourish exeunt
a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire
a march enter edward richard and their power
edward i wonder how our princely father scap'd
or whether he be scap'd away or no
from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit
had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
had he been slain we should have heard the news
or had he scap'd methinks we should have heard
the happy tidings of his good escape
richard i cannot joy until i be resolv'd
where our right valiant father is become
i saw him in the battle range about
and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth
methought he bore him in the thickest troop
as doth a lion in a herd of neat
or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
so fled his enemies my warlike father
methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son
see how the morning opes her golden gates
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
how well resembles it the prime of youth
trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love
edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
not separated with the racking clouds
see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
as if they vow'd some league inviolable
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
in this the heaven figures some event
edward 'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
i think it cites us brother to the field
that we the sons of brave plantagenet
each one already blazing by our meeds
should notwithstanding join our lights together
whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear
upon my target three fair shining suns
richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it
you love the breeder better than the male
enter a messenger blowing
but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
messenger ah one that was a woeful looker on
when as the noble duke of york was slain
edward o speak no more for i have heard too much
richard say how he died for i will hear it all
messenger environed he was with many foes
and stood against them as the hope of troy
against the greeks that would have ent'red troy
but hercules himself must yield to odds
and many strokes though with a little axe
hews down and fells the hardest timber'd oak
by many hands your father was subdu'd
of unrelenting clifford and the queen
who crownd the gracious duke in high despite
laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
and after many scorns many foul taunts
they took his head and on the gates of york
they set the same and there it doth remain
edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
o clifford boist'rous clifford thou hast slain
the flow'r of europe for his chivalry
and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
now my souls palace is become a prison
ah would she break from hence that this my body
might in the ground be closed up in rest
never o never shall i see more joy
richard i cannot weep for all my body's moisture
scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart
nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden
for self same wind that i should speak withal
is kindling coals that fires all my breast
and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
to weep is to make less the depth of grief
tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
or die renowned by attempting it
edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
his dukedom and his chair with me is left
richard nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun
for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
either that is thine or else thou wert not his
march enter warwick montague and their army
warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
stab poinards in our flesh till all were told
the words would add more anguish than the wounds
o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
edward o warwick warwick that plantagenet
which held thee dearly as his souls redemption
is by the stern lord clifford done to death
warwick ten days ago i drownd these news in tears
and now to add more measure to your woes
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp
tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
were brought me of your loss and his depart
i then in london keeper of the king
muster'd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends
and very well appointed as i thought
march'd toward saint albans to intercept the queen
bearing the king in my behalf along
that she was coming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament
touching king henry's oath and your succession
short tale to make we at saint albans met
our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought
but whether 'twas the coldness of the king
who look'd full gently on his warlike queen
that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
or whether 'twas report of her success
who thunders to his captives blood and death
i cannot judge but to conclude with truth
their weapons like to lightning came and went
our soldiers' like the night owls lazy flight
or like an idle thresher with a flail
fell gently down as if they struck their friends
i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
with promise of high pay and great rewards
but all in vain they had no heart to fight
so that we fled the king unto the queen
lord george your brother norfolk and myself
in haste post haste are come to join with you
for in the marches here we heard you were
making another head to fight again
edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
and when came george from burgundy to england
warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
and for your brother he was lately sent
with aid of soldiers to this needful war
richard 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
but ne'er till now his scandal of retire
warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
were he as famous and as bold in war
richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not
'tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
but in this troublous time what's to be done
shall we go throw away our coats of steel
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
numbering our ave maries with our beads
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our devotion with revengeful arms
if for the last say 'ay' and to it lords
and therefore comes my brother montague
attend me lords the proud insulting queen
with clifford and the haught northumberland
and of their feather many moe proud birds
have wrought the easy melting king like wax
he swore consent to your succession
his oath enrolled in the parliament
and now to london all the crew are gone
to frustrate both his oath and what beside
their power i think is thirty thousand strong
now if the help of norfolk and myself
with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
will but amount to five and twenty thousand
why via to london will we march amain
and once again bestride our foaming steeds
and once again cry 'charge upon our foes'
but never once again turn back and fly
ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
that cries 'retire' if warwick bid him stay
edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
and when thou failst as god forbid the hour
must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york
the next degree is england's royal throne
for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd
in every borough as we pass along
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
king edward valiant richard montague
stay we no longer dreaming of renown
but sound the trumpets and about our task
richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
edward then strike up drums god and saint george for us
enter a messenger
messenger the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
the queen is coming with a puissant host
and craves your company for speedy counsel
warwick why then it sorts brave warriors let's away
empty
scene ii
before york
flourish enter king henry queen margaret the prince of wales clifford
northumberland with drum and trumpets
yonder's the head of that arch enemy
that sought to be encompass'd with your crown
doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
king henry ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
to see this sight it irks my very soul
withhold revenge dear god 'tis not my fault
nor wittingly have i infring'd my vow
clifford my gracious liege this too much lenity
and harmful pity must be laid aside
not to the beast that would usurp their den
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
not his that spoils her young before her face
who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
not he that sets his foot upon her back
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
ambitious york did level at thy crown
thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
and raise his issue like a loving sire
thou being a king bless'd with a goodly son
didst yield consent to disinherit him
which argued thee a most unloving father
unreasonable creatures feed their young
and though mans face be fearful to their eyes
yet in protection of their tender ones
who hath not seen them even with those wings
which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight
offering their own lives in their young's defence
for shame my liege make them your precedent
were it not pity that this goodly boy
should lose his birthright by his father's fault
and long hereafter say unto his child
'what my great grandfather and grandsire got
my careless father fondly gave away'
ah what a shame were this look on the boy
and let his manly face which promiseth
to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
king henry full well hath clifford play'd the orator
inferring arguments of mighty force
but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
that things ill got had ever bad success
and happy always was it for that son
whose father for his hoarding went to hell
i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
and would my father had left me no more
as brings a thousand fold more care to keep
than in possession any jot of pleasure
ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
queen margaret my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
and this soft courage makes your followers faint
you promis'd knighthood to our forward son
unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
edward kneel down
and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
prince of wales my gracious father by your kingly leave
i'll draw it as apparent to the crown
and in that quarrel use it to the death
clifford why that is spoken like a toward prince
enter a messenger
messenger royal commanders be in readiness
for with a band of thirty thousand men
comes warwick backing of the duke of york
proclaims him king and many fly to him
darraign your battle for they are at hand
clifford i would your highness would depart the field
the queen hath best success when you are absent
queen margaret ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
king henry why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay
northumberland be it with resolution then to fight
prince of wales my royal father cheer these noble lords
and hearten those that fight in your defence
march enter edward george richard warwick
norfolk montague and soldiers
edward now perjur'd henry wilt thou kneel for grace
and set thy diadem upon my head
or bide the mortal fortune of the field
queen margaret go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
edward i am his king and he should bow his knee
since when his oath is broke for as i hear
you that are king though he do wear the crown
have caus'd him by new act of parliament
to blot out me and put his own son in
clifford and reason too
who should succeed the father but the son
richard are you there butcher o i cannot speak
clifford ay crook back here i stand to answer thee
or any he the proudest of thy sort
clifford ay and old york and yet not satisfied
richard for god's sake lords give signal to the fight
warwick what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown
queen margaret why how now long tongu'd warwick dare you speak
when you and i met at saint albans last
your legs did better service than your hands
warwick then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine
clifford you said so much before and yet you fled
warwick 'twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
richard northumberland i hold thee reverently
break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
the execution of my big swoln heart
upon that clifford that cruel child killer
clifford i slew thy father callst thou him a child
richard ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed
king henry have done with words my lords and hear me speak
king henry i prithee give no limits to my tongue
i am a king and privileg'd to speak
clifford my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
cannot be cur'd by words therefore be still
richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword
by him that made us all i am resolv'd
that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
edward say henry shall i have my right or no
a thousand men have broke their fasts to day
warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head
for york in justice puts his armour on
prince of wales if that be right which warwick says is right
there is no wrong but every thing is right
richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands
for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
queen margaret but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
richard iron of naples hid with english gilt
whose father bears the title of a king
as if a channel should be calld the sea
sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
to let thy tongue detect thy base born heart
edward a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
to make this shameless callet know herself
helen of greece was fairer far than thou
although thy husband may be menelaus
by that false woman as this king by thee
his father revelld in the heart of france
and tam'd the king and made the dauphin stoop
and had he match'd according to his state
he might have kept that glory to this day
but when he took a beggar to his bed
and grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day
even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him
that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france
for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
and we in pity of the gentle king
had slipp'd our claim until another age
george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
and that thy summer bred us no increase
we set the axe to thy usurping root
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
yet know thou since we have begun to strike
or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods
edward and in this resolution i defy thee
not willing any longer conference
since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
and either victory or else a grave
queen margaret stay edward
edward no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay
these words will cost ten thousand lives this day
scene iii
a field of battle between towton and saxton in yorkshire
alarum excursions enter warwick
warwick forspent with toil as runners with a race
i lay me down a little while to breathe
for strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
have robb'd my strong knit sinews of their strength
and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile
enter edward running
for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded
warwick how now my lord what hap what hope of good
enter george
george our hap is lost our hope but sad despair
our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
what counsel give you whither shall we fly
edward bootless is flight they follow us with wings
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
enter richard
thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance
and in the very pangs of death he cried
like to a dismal clangor heard from far
'warwick revenge brother revenge my death'
so underneath the belly of their steeds
that staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
warwick then let the earth be drunken with our blood
why stand we like soft hearted women here
wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
and look upon as if the tragedy
were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
here on my knee i vow to god above
i'll never pause again never stand still
till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine
or fortune given me measure of revenge
edward o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
thou setter up and plucker down of kings
beseeching thee if with thy will it stands
that to my foes this body must be prey
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
now lords take leave until we meet again
where'er it be in heaven or in earth
let me embrace thee in my weary arms
i that did never weep now melt with woe
that winter should cut off our spring time so
warwick away away once more sweet lords farewell
george yet let us all together to our troops
and give them leave to fly that will not stay
and call them pillars that will stand to us
and if we thrive promise them such rewards
as victors wear at the olympian games
for yet is hope of life and victory
forslow no longer make we hence amain exeunt
scene iv
another part of the field
excursions enter richard and clifford
richard now clifford i have singled thee alone
suppose this arm is for the duke of york
and this for rutland both bound to revenge
wert thou environd with a brazen wall
this is the hand that stabbed thy father york
and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland
and here's the heart that triumphs in their death
and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
to execute the like upon thyself
and so have at thee they fight
enter warwick clifford flies
richard nay warwick single out some other chase
for i myself will hunt this wolf to death exeunt
another part of the field
alarum enter king henry alone
king henry this battle fares like to the morning's war
when dying clouds contend with growing light
what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
can neither call it perfect day nor night
now sways it this way like a mighty sea
forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind
now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
now one the better then another best
both tugging to be victors breast to breast
yet neither conqueror nor conquered
so is the equal poise of this fell war
here on this molehill will i sit me down
to whom god will there be the victory
for margaret my queen and clifford too
have chid me from the battle swearing both
would i were dead if god's good will were so
for what is in this world but grief and woe
o god methinks it were a happy life
to be no better than a homely swain
to sit upon a hill as i do now
to carve out dials quaintly point by point
thereby to see the minutes how they run
how many makes the hour full complete
how many hours brings about the day
how many years a mortal man may live
when this is known then to divide the times
so many hours must i tend my flock
so many hours must i take my rest
so many hours must i contemplate
so many hours must i sport myself
so many days my ewes have been with young
so many weeks ere the poor fools will can
so many years ere i shall shear the fleece
pass'd over to the end they were created
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
to kings that fear their subjects' treachery
o yes it doth a thousand fold it doth
and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
is far beyond a prince's delicates
his viands sparkling in a golden cup
his body couched in a curious bed
when care mistrust and treason waits on him
alarum enter a son that hath killd his father at
one door and a father that hath killd his son at
another door
this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight
may be possessed with some store of crowns
and i that haply take them from him now
may yet ere night yield both my life and them
to some man else as this dead man doth me
who's this o god it is my father's face
whom in this conflict i unwares have killd
o heavy times begetting such events
from london by the king was i press'd forth
came on the part of york press'd by his master
and i who at his hands receiv'd my life
have by my hands of life bereaved him
pardon me god i knew not what i did
and pardon father for i knew not thee
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
and no more words till they have flow'd their fill
king henry o piteous spectacle o bloody times
whiles lions war and battle for their dens
weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear
and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief
enter father bearing of his son
father thou that so stoutly hath resisted me
give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
for i have bought it with an hundred blows
but let me see is this our foemans face
ah no no no no it is mine only son
throw up thine eye see see what show'rs arise
blown with the windy tempest of my heart
upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart
o pity god this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly
erroneous mutinous and unnatural
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
o pity pity gentle heaven pity
the red rose and the white are on his face
the fatal colours of our striving houses
the one his purple blood right well resembles
the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
wither one rose and let the other flourish
if you contend a thousand lives must perish
son how will my mother for a father's death
father how will my wife for slaughter of my son
shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied
king henry how will the country for these woeful chances
misthink the king and not be satisfied
son was ever son so rued a father's death
father was ever father so bemoand his son
king henry was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe
much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
son i'll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
father these arms of mine shall be thy winding sheet
my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
and so obsequious will thy father be
even for the loss of thee having no more
as priam was for all his valiant sons
i'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will
for i have murdered where i should not kill
king henry sad hearted men much overgone with care
here sits a king more woeful than you are
alarums excursions enter queen margaret
prince of wales and exeter
prince of wales fly father fly for all your friends are fled
and warwick rages like a chafed bull
away for death doth hold us in pursuit
queen margaret mount you my lord towards berwick post amain
edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands
are at our backs and therefore hence amain
exeter away for vengeance comes along with them
nay stay not to expostulate make speed
or else come after i'll away before
king henry nay take me with thee good sweet exeter
not that i fear to stay but love to go
whither the queen intends forward away exeunt
another part of the field
a loud alarum enter clifford wounded
clifford here burns my candle out ay here it dies
which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
o lancaster i fear thy overthrow
more than my body's parting with my soul
my love and fear glu'd many friends to thee
and now i fall thy tough commixture melts
impairing henry strength'ning misproud york
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
and who shines now but henry's enemies
o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
that phaethon should check thy fiery steeds
thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
or as thy father and his father did
giving no ground unto the house of york
they never then had sprung like summer flies
had left no mourning widows for our death
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
the foe is merciless and will not pity
for at their hands i have deserv'd no pity
the air hath got into my deadly wounds
come york and richard warwick and the rest
i stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breast
he faints
alarum and retreat enter edward george richard
montague warwick and soldiers
edward now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
some troops pursue the bloody minded queen
that led calm henry though he were a king
command an argosy to stern the waves
but think you lords that clifford fled with them
warwick no 'tis impossible he should escape
for though before his face i speak the words
your brother richard mark'd him for the grave
and whereso'er he is he's surely dead
clifford groans and dies
richard whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
a deadly groan like life and death's departing
edward and now the battle's ended
if friend or foe let him be gently used
richard revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis clifford
who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
but set his murd'ring knife unto the root
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
i mean our princely father duke of york
warwick from off the gates of york fetch down the head
instead whereof let this supply the room
measure for measure must be answered
edward bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house
that nothing sung but death to us and ours
now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound
and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak
warwick i think his understanding is bereft
speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
richard o would he did and so perhaps he doth
'tis but his policy to counterfeit
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which in the time of death he gave our father
george if so thou think'st vex him with eager words
richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
edward clifford repent in bootless penitence
warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults
george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
edward thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee
george where's captain margaret to fence you now
warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont
richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
i know by that he's dead and by my soul
if this right hand would buy two hours' life
that i in all despite might rail at him
this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
york and young rutland could not satisfy
warwick ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head
and rear it in the place your father's stands
and now to london with triumphant march
there to be crowned england's royal king
from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
and ask the lady bona for thy queen
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
first will i see the coronation
and then to brittany i'll cross the sea
to effect this marriage so it please my lord
edward even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
and never will i undertake the thing
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
and george of clarence warwick as ourself
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
richard let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous
warwick tut that's a foolish observation
richard be duke of gloucester now to london
to see these honours in possession exeunt
act iii scene i
a chase in the north of england
first keeper under this thick grown brake we'll shroud ourselves
for through this laund anon the deer will come
and in this covert will we make our stand
culling the principal of all the deer
second keeper i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot
first keeper that cannot be the noise of thy cross bow
will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
here stand we both and aim we at the best
and for the time shall not seem tedious
in this self place where now we mean to stand
second keeper here comes a man let's stay till he be past
enter king henry disguised with a prayer book
king henry from scotland am i stoln even of pure love
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
no harry harry 'tis no land of thine
thy place is filld thy sceptre wrung from thee
thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
no bending knee will call thee caesar now
no not a man comes for redress of thee
for how can i help them and not myself
first keeper ay here's a deer whose skins a keeper's fee
this is the quondam king let's seize upon him
king henry let me embrace thee sour adversity
for wise men say it is the wisest course
second keeper why linger we let us lay hands upon him
first keeper forbear awhile we'll hear a little more
king henry my queen and son are gone to france for aid
is thither gone to crave the french king's sister
to wife for edward if this news be true
poor queen and son your labour is but lost
for warwick is a subtle orator
and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
by this account then margaret may win him
for she's a woman to be pitied much
her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast
her tears will pierce into a marble heart
and nero will be tainted with remorse
to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
ay but she's come to beg warwick to give
she on his left side craving aid for henry
he on his right asking a wife for edward
she weeps and says her henry is depos'd
he smiles and says his edward is installd
that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
and in conclusion wins the king from her
with promise of his sister and what else
to strengthen and support king edward's place
o margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul
art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn
second keeper say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens
king henry more than i seem and less than i was born to
a man at least for less i should not be
and men may talk of kings and why not i
king henry why so i am in mind and that's enough
second keeper but if thou be a king where is thy crown
king henry my crown is in my heart not on my head
not deck'd with diamonds and indian stones
not to be seen my crown is calld content
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
second keeper well if you be a king crownd with content
your crown content and you must be contented
to go along with us for as we think
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
will apprehend you as his enemy
king henry but did you never swear and break an oath
second keeper no never such an oath nor will not now
king henry where did you dwell when i was king of england
second keeper here in this country where we now remain
king henry i was anointed king at nine months old
my father and my grandfather were kings
and you were sworn true subjects unto me
first keeper no
for we were subjects but while you were king
king henry why am i dead do i not breathe a man
ah simple men you know not what you swear
look as i blow this feather from my face
and as the air blows it to me again
obeying with my wind when i do blow
and yielding to another when it blows
commanded always by the greater gust
but do not break your oaths for of that sin
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
go where you will the king shall be commanded
and be you kings command and i'll obey
first keeper we are true subjects to the king king edward
king henry so would you be again to henry
if he were seated as king edward is
first keeper we charge you in god's name and the king's
to go with us unto the officers
and what god will that let your king perform
and what he will i humbly yield unto exeunt
scene ii
london the palace
enter king edward gloucester clarence and lady grey
king edward brother of gloucester at saint albans' field
this lady's husband sir richard grey was slain
his land then seiz'd on by the conqueror
her suit is now to repossess those lands
because in quarrel of the house of york
the worthy gentleman did lose his life
gloucester your highness shall do well to grant her suit
it were dishonour to deny it her
king edward it were no less but yet i'll make a pause
gloucester aside to clarence yea is it so
i see the lady hath a thing to grant
before the king will grant her humble suit
clarence aside to gloucester he knows the game how true he
gloucester aside to clarence silence
king edward widow we will consider of your suit
and come some other time to know our mind
lady grey right gracious lord i cannot brook delay
may it please your highness to resolve me now
and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
gloucester aside ay widow then i'll warrant you all your
empty

king edward 'twere pity they should lose their father's lands
lady grey be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
king edward lords give us leave i'll try this widow's wit
gloucester aside ay good leave have you for you will have
empty
till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
gloucester and clarence withdraw
king edward now tell me madam do you love your children
king edward and would you not do much to do them good
lady grey to do them good i would sustain some harm
king edward then get your husband's lands to do them good
lady grey therefore i came unto your majesty
king edward i'll tell you how these lands are to be got
lady grey so shall you bind me to your highness' service
king edward what service wilt thou do me if i give them
lady grey what you command that rests in me to do
king edward but you will take exceptions to my boon
king edward ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
lady grey why then i will do what your grace commands
gloucester he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble
clarence as red as fire nay then her wax must melt
lady grey why stops my lord shall i not hear my task
king edward an easy task 'tis but to love a king
lady grey that's soon perform'd because i am a subject
king edward why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee
lady grey i take my leave with many thousand thanks
king edward but stay thee 'tis the fruits of love i mean
lady grey the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
king edward ay but i fear me in another sense
what love thinkst thou i sue so much to get
lady grey my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
king edward no by my troth i did not mean such love
lady grey why then you mean not as i thought you did
king edward but now you partly may perceive my mind
your highness aims at if i aim aright
king edward to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
lady grey to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
king edward why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands
lady grey why then mine honesty shall be my dower
for by that loss i will not purchase them
king edward therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily
lady grey herein your highness wrongs both them and me
but mighty lord this merry inclination
please you dismiss me either with ay or no
king edward ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
no if thou dost say no to my demand
lady grey then no my lord my suit is at an end
gloucester the widow likes him not she knits her brows
clarence he is the bluntest wooer in christendom
king edward aside her looks doth argue her replete with modesty
her words doth show her wit incomparable
all her perfections challenge sovereignty
and she shall be my love or else my queen
say that king edward take thee for his queen
lady grey 'tis better said than done my gracious lord
i am a subject fit to jest withal
but far unfit to be a sovereign
king edward sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
i speak no more than what my soul intends
and that is to enjoy thee for my love
lady grey and that is more than i will yield unto
and yet too good to be your concubine
king edward you cavil widow i did mean my queen
lady grey 'twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
king edwardno more than when my daughters call thee mother
thou art a widow and thou hast some children
and by god's mother i being but a bachelor
have other some why 'tis a happy thing
to be the father unto many sons
answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
clarence when he was made a shriver 'twas for shrift
king edward brothers you muse what chat we two have had
gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
king edward you'd think it strange if i should marry her
clarence to who my lord
king edward why clarence to myself
gloucester that would be ten days' wonder at the least
clarence that's a day longer than a wonder lasts
gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes
her suit is granted for her husband's lands
enter a nobleman
nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
king edward see that he be convey'd unto the tower
and go we brothers to the man that took him
to question of his apprehension
widow go you along lords use her honourably
exeunt all but gloucester
would he were wasted marrow bones and all
that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
to cross me from the golden time i look for
and yet between my souls desire and me
the lustful edward's title buried
is clarence henry and his son young edward
and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
to take their rooms ere i can place myself
a cold premeditation for my purpose
like one that stands upon a promontory
and spies a far off shore where he would tread
wishing his foot were equal with his eye
and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
so do i wish the crown being so far off
and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
and so i say i'll cut the causes off
flattering me with impossibilities
unless my hand and strength could equal them
well say there is no kingdom then for richard
what other pleasure can the world afford
i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
and deck my body in gay ornaments
and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
o miserable thought and more unlikely
than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
why love forswore me in my mother's womb
she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
to make an envious mountain on my back
where sits deformity to mock my body
to shape my legs of an unequal size
to disproportion me in every part
like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear whelp
that carries no impression like the dam
and am i then a man to be belov'd
then since this earth affords no joy to me
but to command to check to o'erbear such
as are of better person than myself
i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
and whiles i live t' account this world but hell
until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head
be round impaled with a glorious crown
and yet i know not how to get the crown
for many lives stand between me and home
that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
seeking a way and straying from the way
not knowing how to find the open air
but toiling desperately to find it out
torment myself to catch the english crown
and from that torment i will free myself
or hew my way out with a bloody axe
why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
and cry 'content' to that which grieves my heart
and frame my face to all occasions
i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
i'll play the orator as well as nestor
deceive more slily than ulysses could
and like a sinon take another troy
i can add colours to the chameleon
change shapes with protheus for advantages
and set the murderous machiavel to school
tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down exit
scene iii
france the king's palace
flourish enter lewis the french king his sister bona
his admiral calld bourbon prince edward queen margaret
and the earl of oxford lewis sits and riseth up again
lewis fair queen of england worthy margaret
sit down with us it ill befits thy state
and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
where kings command i was i must confess
great albions queen in former golden days
but now mischance hath trod my title down
and with dishonour laid me on the ground
where i must take like seat unto my fortune
and to my humble seat conform myself
lewis why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
lewis whate'er it be be thou still like thyself
and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck
to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
still ride in triumph over all mischance
be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
it shall be eas'd if france can yield relief
queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak
now therefore be it known to noble lewis
is of a king become a banish'd man
and forc'd to live in scotland a forlorn
while proud ambitious edward duke of york
usurps the regal title and the seat
of england's true anointed lawful king
this is the cause that i poor margaret
with this my son prince edward henry's heir
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
and if thou fail us all our hope is done
our people and our peers are both misled
our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put to flight
and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
lewis renowned queen with patience calm the storm
while we bethink a means to break it off
queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
lewis the more i stay the more i'll succour thee
queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
lewis what's he approacheth boldly to our presence
queen margaret our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend
lewis welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
he descends she ariseth
queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise
for this is he that moves both wind and tide
warwick from worthy edward king of albion
my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
i come in kindness and unfeigned love
and then to crave a league of amity
and lastly to confirm that amity
with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
to england's king in lawful marriage
queen margaret aside if that go forward henry's hope is done
warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king's behalf
i am commanded with your leave and favour
humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears
hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue
queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
before you answer warwick his demand
springs not from edward's well meant honest love
but from deceit bred by necessity
for how can tyrants safely govern home
unless abroad they purchase great alliance
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
yet here prince edward stands king henry's son
look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
for though usurpers sway the rule a while
yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs
warwick injurious margaret
prince of wales and why not queen
warwick because thy father henry did usurp
and thou no more art prince than she is queen
which did subdue the greatest part of spain
and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
and after that wise prince henry the fifth
who by his prowess conquered all france
from these our henry lineally descends
warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
all that which henry the fifth had gotten
but for the rest you tell a pedigree
of threescore and two years a silly time
to make prescription for a kingdom's worth
oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years
and not betray thy treason with a blush
warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
for shame leave henry and call edward king
my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
was done to death and more than so my father
even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
when nature brought him to the door of death
no warwick no while life upholds this arm
this arm upholds the house of lancaster
warwick and i the house of york
lewis queen margaret prince edward and oxford
vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
they stand aloof
queen margaret heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not
lewis now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
is edward your true king for i were loath
to link with him that were not lawful chosen
warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
lewis but is he gracious in the people's eye
warwick the more that henry was unfortunate
lewis then further all dissembling set aside
unto our sister bona
warwick such it seems
as may beseem a monarch like himself
myself have often heard him say and swear
that this his love was an eternal plant
whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
the leaves and fruit maintaind with beauty's sun
exempt from envy but not from disdain
unless the lady bona quit his pain
bona your grant or your denial shall be mine
to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day
when i have heard your king's desert recounted
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
lewis then warwick thus our sister shall be edward's
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
touching the jointure that your king must make
which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd
draw near queen margaret and be a witness
prince of wales to edward but not to the english king
queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device
by this alliance to make void my suit
before thy coming lewis was henry's friend
lewis and still is friend to him and margaret
but if your title to the crown be weak
as may appear by edward's good success
then 'tis but reason that i be releas'd
from giving aid which late i promised
that your estate requires and mine can yield
warwick henry now lives in scotland at his case
where having nothing nothing can he lose
and as for you yourself our quondam queen
you have a father able to maintain you
and better 'twere you troubled him than france
queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick
proud setter up and puller down of kings
i will not hence till with my talk and tears

lewis warwick this is some post to us or thee
enter the post
post my lord ambassador these letters are for you
sent from your brother marquis montague
these from our king unto your majesty
and madam these for you from whom i know not
oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
prince of wales nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
i hope alls for the best
lewis warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys
warwick mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent
lewis what has your king married the lady grey
and now to soothe your forgery and his
is this th' alliance that he seeks with france
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
queen margaret i told your majesty as much before
this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty
warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's
no more my king for he dishonours me
but most himself if he could see his shame
my father came untimely to his death
did i let pass th' abuse done to my niece
did i impale him with the regal crown
did i put henry from his native right
and am i guerdond at the last with shame
shame on himself for my desert is honour
and to repair my honour lost for him
i here renounce him and return to henry
my noble queen let former grudges pass
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
and replant henry in his former state
queen margaret warwick these words have turnd my hate to love
and i forgive and quite forget old faults
and joy that thou becom'st king henry's friend
warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
with some few bands of chosen soldiers
i'll undertake to land them on our coast
'tis not his new made bride shall succour him
and as for clarence as my letters tell me
he's very likely now to fall from him
for matching more for wanton lust than honour
or than for strength and safety of our country
bona dear brother how shall bona be reveng'd
but by thy help to this distressed queen
queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live
unless thou rescue him from foul despair
warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
lewis and mine with hers and thine and margaret's
therefore at last i firmly am resolv'd
you shall have aid
queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once
lewis then england's messenger return in post
and tell false edward thy supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride
bona tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
i'll wear the willow garland for his sake
queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
and i am ready to put armour on
warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long
there's thy reward be gone exit post
lewis but warwick
thou and oxford with five thousand men
and as occasion serves this noble queen
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty
that if our queen and this young prince agree
i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion
therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
that only warwick's daughter shall be thine
prince of wales yes i accept her for she well deserves it
and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
he gives his hand to warwick
lewis stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
shall waft them over with our royal fleet
for mocking marriage with a dame of france
exeunt all but warwick
warwick i came from edward as ambassador
but i return his sworn and mortal foe
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
but dreadful war shall answer his demand
had he none else to make a stale but me
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
i was the chief that rais'd him to the crown
not that i pity henry's misery
but seek revenge on edward's mockery exit
act iv scene i
london the palace
enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague
gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you
of this new marriage with the lady grey
hath not our brother made a worthy choice
clarence alas you know 'tis far from hence to france
somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
flourish enter king edward attended lady
grey as queen pembroke stafford hastings
and others four stand on one side and four on the other
gloucester and his well chosen bride
clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think
king edward now brother of clarence how like you our choice
that you stand pensive as half malcontent
clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
that they'll take no offence at our abuse
king edward suppose they take offence without a cause
they are but lewis and warwick i am edward
your king and warwick's and must have my will
gloucester and shall have your will because our king
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
king edward yea brother richard are you offended too
gloucester not i
no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd
to sunder them that yoke so well together
king edward setting your scorns and your mislike aside
tell me some reason why the lady grey
should not become my wife and england's queen
and you too somerset and montague
speak freely what you think
clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis
becomes your enemy for mocking him
about the marriage of the lady bona
is now dishonoured by this new marriage
king edward what if both lewis and warwick be appeas'd
by such invention as i can devise
montague yet to have joind with france in such alliance
would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth
'gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage
hastings why knows not montague that of itself
england is safe if true within itself
montague but the safer when 'tis back'd with france
let us be back'd with god and with the seas
which he hath giv'n for fence impregnable
and with their helps only defend ourselves
in them and in ourselves our safety lies
clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
to have the heir of the lord hungerford
king edward ay what of that it was my will and grant
and for this once my will shall stand for law
gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
unto the brother of your loving bride
she better would have fitted me or clarence
but in your bride you bury brotherhood
clarence or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
of the lord bonville on your new wife's son
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
king edward alas poor clarence is it for a wife
that thou art malcontent i will provide thee
clarence in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
to play the broker in mine own behalf
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
king edward leave me or tarry edward will be king
and not be tied unto his brother's will
queen elizabeth my lords before it pleas'd his majesty
to raise my state to title of a queen
do me but right and you must all confess
that i was not ignoble of descent
and meaner than myself have had like fortune
so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing
doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
king edward my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
so long as edward is thy constant friend
and their true sovereign whom they must obey
nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
unless they seek for hatred at my hands
which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more
enter a post
king edward now messenger what letters or what news
from france
messenger my sovereign liege no letters and few words
but such as i without your special pardon
dare not relate
king edward go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
messenger at my depart these were his very words
'go tell false edward the supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride'
king edward is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
but what said lady bona to my marriage
messenger these were her words utt'red with mild disdain
'tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
i'll wear the willow garland for his sake'
she had the wrong but what said henry's queen
for i have heard that she was there in place
messenger 'tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done
and i am ready to put armour on'
king edward belike she minds to play the amazon
but what said warwick to these injuries
messenger he more incens'd against your majesty
than all the rest discharg'd me with these words
'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
king edward ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
well i will arm me being thus forewarnd
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
but say is warwick friends with margaret
messenger ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship
that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter
clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger
now brother king farewell and sit you fast
for i will hence to warwick's other daughter
i may not prove inferior to yourself
you that love me and warwick follow me
exit and somerset follows
gloucester aside not i
my thoughts aim at a further matter i
stay not for the love of edward but the crown
king edward clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen
and haste is needful in this desp'rate case
go levy men and make prepare for war
they are already or quickly will be landed
myself in person will straight follow you
exeunt pembroke and stafford
but ere i go hastings and montague
resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
tell me if you love warwick more than me
if it be so then both depart to him
but if you mind to hold your true obedience
give me assurance with some friendly vow
that i may never have you in suspect
montague so god help montague as he proves true
hastings and hastings as he favours edward's cause
king edward now brother richard will you stand by us
gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
king edward why so then am i sure of victory
now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
scene ii
a plain in warwickshire
enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers
warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
the common people by numbers swarm to us
enter clarence and somerset
but see where somerset and clarence comes
speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
clarence fear not that my lord
and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice
to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love
else might i think that clarence edward's brother
were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
and now what rests but in night's coverture
thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
his soldiers lurking in the towns about
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
our scouts have found the adventure very easy
that as ulysses and stout diomede
with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents
and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
at unawares may beat down edward's guard
and seize himself i say not 'slaughter him'
for i intend but only to surprise him
applaud the name of henry with your leader
they all cry 'henry'
why then let's on our way in silent sort
for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt
scene iii
edward's camp near warwick
enter three watchmen to guard the king's tent
first watchman come on my masters each man take his stand
the king by this is set him down to sleep
first watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow
never to lie and take his natural rest
till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd
second watchman to morrow then belike shall be the day
if warwick be so near as men report
third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that
that with the king here resteth in his tent
first watchman 'tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend
third watchman o is it so but why commands the king
while he himself keeps in the cold field
second watchman 'tis the more honour because more dangerous
third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness
i like it better than dangerous honour
if warwick knew in what estate he stands
'tis to be doubted he would waken him
first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage
second watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
but to defend his person from night foes
and french soldiers silent all
warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard
courage my masters honour now or never
but follow me and edward shall be ours
first watchman who goes there
second watchman stay or thou diest
warwick and the rest cry all 'warwick warwick' and
set upon the guard who fly crying 'arm arm' warwick
and the rest following them
and the rest bringing the king out in his gown
sitting in a chair gloucester and hastings fly over the stage
somerset what are they that fly there
warwick richard and hastings let them go here is the duke
king edward the duke why warwick when we parted
thou calldst me king
warwick ay but the case is alter'd
when you disgrac'd me in my embassade
then i degraded you from being king
alas how should you govern any kingdom
that know not how to use ambassadors
nor how to be contented with one wife
nor how to use your brothers brotherly
nor how to study for the people's welfare
nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
king edward yea brother of clarence art thou here too
nay then i see that edward needs must down
yet warwick in despite of all mischance
edward will always bear himself as king
though fortune's malice overthrow my state
my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
warwick then for his mind be edward england's king
takes off his crown
but henry now shall wear the english crown
and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
my lord of somerset at my request
see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows
i'll follow you and tell what answer
lewis and the lady bona send to him
now for a while farewell good duke of york
king edward what fates impose that men must needs abide
it boots not to resist both wind and tide
they lead him out forcibly

but march to london with our soldiers
to free king henry from imprisonment
and see him seated in the regal throne exeunt

enter queen elizabeth and rivers
rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change
queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn
what late misfortune is befalln king edward
rivers what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick
rivers then is my sovereign slain
queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
or by his foe surpris'd at unawares
and as i further have to understand
is new committed to the bishop of york
fell warwick's brother and by that our foe
rivers these news i must confess are full of grief
yet gracious madam bear it as you may
queen elizabeth till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
and i the rather wean me from despair
for love of edward's offspring in my womb
this is it that makes me bridle passion
and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
ay ay for this i draw in many a tear
and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs
lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
king edward's fruit true heir to th' english crown
queen elizabeth i am inform'd that he comes towards london
to set the crown once more on henry's head
guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down
but to prevent the tyrant's violence
for trust not him that hath once broken faith
i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
to save at least the heir of edward's right
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud
come therefore let us fly while we may fly
scene v
a park near middleham castle in yorkshire
enter gloucester lord hastings sir william stanley and others
gloucester now my lord hastings and sir william stanley
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither
into this chiefest thicket of the park
thus stands the case you know our king my brother
is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
he hath good usage and great liberty
comes hunting this way to disport himself
i have advertis'd him by secret means
that if about this hour he make this way
under the colour of his usual game
he shall here find his friends with horse and men
to set him free from his captivity
enter king edward and a huntsman with him
huntsman this way my lord for this way lies the game
king edward nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer
gloucester brother the time and case requireth haste
your horse stands ready at the park corner
king edward but whither shall we then
hastings to lynn my lord and shipt from thence to flanders
gloucester well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning
king edward stanley i will requite thy forwardness
gloucester but wherefore stay we 'tis no time to talk
king edward huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along
gloucester come then away let's ha' no more ado
king edward bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown

london the tower
flourish enter king henry clarence warwick somerset young henry
earl of richmond oxford montague lieutenant of the tower and attendants
king henry master lieutenant now that god and friends
have shaken edward from the regal seat
my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
at our enlargement what are thy due fees
lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns
but if an humble prayer may prevail
i then crave pardon of your majesty
king henry for what lieutenant for well using me
nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
at last by notes of household harmony
they quite forget their loss of liberty
but warwick after god thou set'st me free
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
he was the author thou the instrument
therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite
by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
i here resign my government to thee
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
warwick your grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous
and now may seem as wise as virtuous
by spying and avoiding fortune's malice
for few men rightly temper with the stars
yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
for choosing me when clarence is in place
clarence no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown
as likely to be blest in peace and war
and therefore i yield thee my free consent
warwick and i choose clarence only for protector
king henry warwick and clarence give me both your hands
now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
that no dissension hinder government
i make you both protectors of this land
while i myself will lead a private life
to sins rebuke and my creator's praise
warwick what answers clarence to his sovereigns will
clarence that he consents if warwick yield consent
for on thy fortune i repose myself
warwick why then though loath yet must i be content
we'll yoke together like a double shadow
to henry's body and supply his place
i mean in bearing weight of government
while he enjoys the honour and his ease
forthwith that edward be pronounc'd a traitor
and all his lands and goods confiscated
clarence what else and that succession be determind
warwick ay therein clarence shall not want his part
king henry but with the first of all your chief affairs
let me entreat for i command no more
that margaret your queen and my son edward
be sent for to return from france with speed
for till i see them here by doubtful fear
clarence it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
king henry my lord of somerset what youth is that
of whom you seem to have so tender care
somerset my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
king henry come hither england's hope
lays his hand on his head
if secret powers
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
his head by nature fram'd to wear a crown
his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
likely in time to bless a regal throne
make much of him my lords for this is he
must help you more than you are hurt by me
enter a post
warwick what news my friend
post that edward is escaped from your brother
and fled as he hears since to burgundy
post he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester
and the lord hastings who attended him
in secret ambush on the forest side
and from the bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him
for hunting was his daily exercise
warwick my brother was too careless of his charge
but let us hence my sovereign to provide
a salve for any sore that may betide
exeunt all but somerset richmond and oxford
for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
and we shall have more wars befor't be long
as henry's late presaging prophecy
did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
what may befall him to his harm and ours
therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany
till storms be past of civil enmity
'tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
somerset it shall be so he shall to brittany
come therefore let's about it speedily exeunt

before york
flourish enter king edward gloucester hastings and soldiers
king edward now brother richard lord hastings and the rest
yet thus far fortune maketh us amends
and says that once more i shall interchange
well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
and brought desired help from burgundy
what then remains we being thus arriv'd
from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
but that we enter as into our dukedom
gloucester the gates made fast brother i like not this
for many men that stumble at the threshold
are well foretold that danger lurks within
king edward tush man abodements must not now affright us
for hither will our friends repair to us
hastings my liege i'll knock once more to summon them
enter on the walls the mayor of york and
his brethren
mayor my lords we were forewarned of your coming
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
for now we owe allegiance unto henry
king edward but master mayor if henry be your king
yet edward at the least is duke of york
king edward why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
as being well content with that alone
gloucester aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose
he'll soon find means to make the body follow
hastings why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
open the gates we are king henry's friends
mayor ay say you so the gates shall then be opend
he descends
gloucester a wise stout captain and soon persuaded
so 'twere not long of him but being ent'red
i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade
both him and all his brothers unto reason
enter below the mayor and two aldermen
king edward so master mayor these gates must not be shut
but in the night or in the time of war
what fear not man but yield me up the keys
takes his keys
for edward will defend the town and thee
march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers
gloucester brother this is sir john montgomery
our trusty friend unless i be deceiv'd
king edward welcome sir john but why come you in arms
montgomery to help king edward in his time of storm
as every loyal subject ought to do
king edward thanks good montgomery but we now forget
our title to the crown and only claim
our dukedom till god please to send the rest
i came to serve a king and not a duke
drummer strike up and let us march away
the drum begins to march
king edward nay stay sir john a while and we'll debate
by what safe means the crown may be recover'd
montgomery what talk you of debating in few words
if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king
i'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
to keep them back that come to succour you
gloucester why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
king edward when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim
till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
hastings away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule
gloucester and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
brother we will proclaim you out of hand
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends
king edward then be it as you will for 'tis my right
and henry but usurps the diadem
and now will i be edward's champion
hastings sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaim'd
come fellow soldier make thou proclamation
gives him a paper flourish
soldier reads 'edward the fourth by the grace of god
king of england and france and lord of ireland c'
montgomery and whoso'er gainsays king edward's right
by this i challenge him to single fight
throws down gauntlet
king edward thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all
if fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness
now for this night let's harbour here in york
and when the morning sun shall raise his car
above the border of this horizon
we'll forward towards warwick and his mates
for well i wot that henry is no soldier
ah froward clarence how evil it beseems the
to flatter henry and forsake thy brother

king henry let's levy men and beat him back again
clarence a little fire is quickly trodden out
which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench
warwick in warwickshire i have true hearted friends
not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
those will i muster up and thou son clarence
shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent
the knights and gentlemen to come with thee
thou brother montague in buckingham
men well inclind to hear what thou command'st
and thou brave oxford wondrous well belov'd
in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends

fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
farewell my sovereign
clarence in sign of truth i kiss your highness' hand
king henry well minded clarence be thou fortunate
montague comfort my lord and so i take my leave

warwick farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry
exeunt all but the king and exeter
cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship
methinks the power that edward hath in field
should not be able to encounter mine
exeter the doubt is that he will seduce the rest
king henry that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame
i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
nor posted off their suits with slow delays
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
i have not been desirous of their wealth
nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies
nor forward of revenge though they much err'd
then why should they love edward more than me
no exeter these graces challenge grace
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb
the lamb will never cease to follow him
shout within 'a lancaster a lancaster'
exeter hark hark my lord what shouts are these
king edward seize on the shame fac'd henry bear him hence
and once again proclaim us king of england
you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
and swell so much the higher by their ebb
hence with him to the tower let him not speak
exeunt some with king henry

king edward now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
call edward king and at his hands beg mercy
and he shall pardon thee these outrages
warwick nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down
call warwick patron and be penitent
gloucester i thought at least he would have said the king
or did he make the jest against his will
warwick is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
gloucester ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
i'll do thee service for so good a gift
warwick 'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother
king edward why then 'tis mine if but by warwick's gift
warwick thou art no atlas for so great a weight
and weakling warwick takes his gift again
king edward but warwick's king is edward's prisoner
and gallant warwick do but answer this
what is the body when the head is off
gloucester alas that warwick had no more forecast
but whiles he thought to steal the single ten
the king was slily finger'd from the deck
you left poor henry at the bishop's palace
and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower
king edward 'tis even so yet you are warwick still
nay when strike now or else the iron cools
warwick i had rather chop this hand off at a blow
and with the other fling it at thy face
than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
king edward sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
this hand fast wound about thy coal black hair
shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
'wind changing warwick now can change no more'
warwick o cheerful colours see where oxford comes

a parley sirrah to george of clarence
sound a parley richard and clarence whisper
warwick come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call
clarence taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
it at warwick
father of warwick know you what this means
look here i throw my infamy at thee
i will not ruinate my father's house
who gave his blood to lime the stones together
that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
to bend the fatal instruments of war
against his brother and his lawful king
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
to keep that oath were more impiety
than jephtha when he sacrific'd his daughter
i am so sorry for my trespass made
that to deserve well at my brother's hands
i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad
to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
and so proud hearted warwick i defy thee
and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
pardon me edward i will make amends
and richard do not frown upon my faults
for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
king edward now welcome more and ten times more belov'd
than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate
warwick o passing traitor perjur'd and unjust
king edward what warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears

king edward so lie thou there die thou and die our fear
for warwick was a bug that fear'd us all
now montague sit fast i seek for thee
that warwick's bones may keep thine company exit
warwick ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
and tell me who is victor york or warwick
my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
that i must yield my body to the earth
and by my fall the conquest to my foe
thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
under whose shade the ramping lion slept
whose top branch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree
and kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind
these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
to search the secret treasons of the world
the wrinkles in my brows now filld with blood
were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres
for who liv'd king but i could dig his grave
and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow
lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
my parks my walks my manors that i had
even now forsake me and of all my lands
is nothing left me but my body's length
and live we how we can yet die we must
enter oxford and somerset
somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
we might recover all our loss again
the queen from france hath brought a puissant power
even now we heard the news ah couldst thou fly
warwick why then i would not fly ah montague
if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
and with thy lips keep in my soul a while
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
that glues my lips and will not let me speak
come quickly montague or i am dead
somerset ah warwick montague hath breath'd his last
and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
and said 'commend me to my valiant brother'
and more he would have said and more he spoke
which sounded like a clamour in a vault
that mought not be distinguish'd but at last
'o farewell warwick'
warwick sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves
for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven

i mean my lords those powers that the queen

clarence a little gale will soon disperse that cloud
thy very beams will dry those vapours up

and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood
yet lives our pilot still is't meet that he
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
with tearful eyes add water to the sea
and give more strength to that which hath too much
whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
which industry and courage might have sav'd

what clarence but a quicksand of deceit
and richard but a ragged fatal rock

say you can swim alas 'tis but a while
tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
bestride the rock the tide will wash you off

that there's no hop'd for mercy with the brothers
more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
why courage then what cannot be avoided
'twere childish weakness to lament or fear
prince of wales methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
should if a coward hear her speak these words
infuse his breast with magnanimity
i speak not this as doubting any here
for did i but suspect a fearful man
he should have leave to go away betimes
lest in our need he might infect another
and make him of the like spirit to himself
if any such be here as god forbid
let him depart before we need his help
oxford women and children of so high a courage
and warriors faint why 'twere perpetual shame

gloucester sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer

king henry so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
and next his throat unto the butcher's knife
what scene of death hath roscius now to act
gloucester suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
king henry the bird that hath been limed in a bush
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
and i the hapless male to one sweet bird
have now the fatal object in my eye
where my poor young was lim'd was caught and killd
gloucester why what a peevish fool was that of crete
that taught his son the office of a fowl
and yet for all his wings the fool was drownd
king henry i daedalus my poor boy icarus
the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
thy brother edward and thyself the sea
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
my breast can better brook thy dagger's point
than can my ears that tragic history
but wherefore dost thou come is't for my life
gloucester think'st thou i am an executioner
king henry a persecutor i am sure thou art
why then thou are an executioner
gloucester thy son i killd for his presumption
king henry hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume
thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine
and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
and many an old mans sigh and many a widow's
and many an orphans water standing eye
men for their sons wives for their husbands
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
the owl shriek'd at thy birth an evil sign
the night crow cried aboding luckless time
dogs howld and hideous tempest shook down trees
the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
and chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung
thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
to wit an indigest deformed lump
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
to signify thou cam'st to bite the world
and if the rest be true which i have heard
thou cam'st
gloucester i'll hear no more die prophet in thy speech
stabs him
for this amongst the rest was i ordaind
king henry ay and for much more slaughter after this
o god forgive my sins and pardon thee dies
sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death
o may such purple tears be always shed
from those that wish the downfall of our house
if any spark of life be yet remaining
down down to hell and say i sent thee thither
stabs him again
i that have neither pity love nor fear
indeed 'tis true that henry told me of
i came into the world with my legs forward
had i not reason think ye to make haste
and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
the midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'o jesus bless us he is born with teeth'
and so i was which plainly signified
that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
then since the heavens have shap'd my body so
let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
and this word 'love' which greybeards call divine
be resident in men like one another
and not in me i am myself alone
clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
for i will buzz abroad such prophecies
that edward shall be fearful of his life
and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death
king henry and the prince his son are gone
counting myself but bad till i be best
i'll throw thy body in another room
and triumph henry in thy day of doom
exit with the body

the prologue
i come no more to make you laugh things now
that bear a weighty and a serious brow
sad high and working full of state and woe
such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
we now present those that can pity here
may if they think it well let fall a tear
the subject will deserve it such as give
may here find truth too those that come to see
only a show or two and so agree
the play may pass if they be still and willing
i'll undertake may see away their shilling
richly in two short hours only they
that come to hear a merry bawdy play
a noise of targets or to see a fellow
in a long motley coat guarded with yellow
will be deceiv'd for gentle hearers know
as fool and fight is beside forfeiting
our own brains and the opinion that we bring
to make that only true we now intend
will leave us never an understanding friend
therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
the first and happiest hearers of the town
be sad as we would make ye think ye see
the very persons of our noble story
as they were living think you see them great
of thousand friends then in a moment see
how soon this mightiness meets misery
and if you can be merry then i'll say
a man may weep upon his wedding day

enter the duke of norfolk at one door at the other
the duke of buckingham and the lord abergavenny
buckingham good morrow and well met how have ye done
norfolk i thank your grace
healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
of what i saw there
buckingham an untimely ague
stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
those suns of glory those two lights of men
met in the vale of andren
norfolk 'twixt guynes and arde
i was then present saw them salute on horseback
in their embracement as they grew together
which had they what four thrond ones could have weigh'd
such a compounded one
buckingham all the whole time
i was my chamber's prisoner
norfolk then you lost
the view of earthly glory men might say
till this time pomp was single but now married
to one above itself each following day
made former wonders its to day the french
all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
shone down the english and to morrow they
made britain india every man that stood
show'd like a mine their dwarfish pages were
as cherubins an gilt the madams too
not us'd to toil did almost sweat to bear
the pride upon them that their very labour
was to them as a painting now this masque
made it a fool and beggar the two kings
equal in lustre were now best now worst
as presence did present them him in eye
still him in praise and being present both
'twas said they saw but one and no discerner
durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns
for so they phrase 'em by their heralds challeng'd
the noble spirits to arms they did perform
beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
that bevis was believ'd
buckingham o you go far
norfolk as i belong to worship and affect
in honour honesty the tract of ev'rything
would by a good discourser lose some life
which actions self was tongue to all was royal
to the disposing of it nought rebelld
order gave each thing view the office did
distinctly his full function
i mean who set the body and the limbs
of this great sport together as you guess
norfolk one certes that promises no element
in such a business
buckingham i pray you who my lord
norfolk all this was ord'red by the good discretion
of the right reverend cardinal of york
buckingham the devil speed him no mans pie is freed
from his ambitious finger what had he
that such a keech can with his very bulk
take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun
and keep it from the earth
norfolk surely sir
there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
chalks successors their way nor calld upon
for high feats done to th' crown neither allied
to eminent assistants but spider like
the force of his own merit makes his way
a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
a place next to the king
abergavenny i cannot tell
what heaven hath given him let some graver eye
pierce into that but i can see his pride
peep through each part of him whence has he that
if not from hell the devil is a niggard
or has given all before and he begins
buckingham why the devil
upon this french going out took he upon him
without the privity o' th' king t' appoint
who should attend on him he makes up the file
of all the gentry for the most part such
to whom as great a charge as little honour
he meant to lay upon and his own letter
the honourable board of council out
must fetch him in he papers
kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
by this so sickend their estates that never
they shall abound as formerly
buckingham o many
have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
for this great journey what did this vanity
but minister communication of
a most poor issue
norfolk grievingly i think
the cost that did conclude it
buckingham every man
after the hideous storm that follow'd was
a thing inspir'd and not consulting broke
into a general prophecy that this tempest
dashing the garment of this peace aboded
the sudden breach ont
norfolk which is budded out
for france hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
abergavenny is it therefore
th' ambassador is silenc'd
norfolk marry is't
abergavenny a proper tide of a peace and purchas'd
at a superfluous rate
buckingham why all this business
our reverend cardinal carried
norfolk like it your grace
the state takes notice of the private difference
and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
honour and plenteous safety that you read
the cardinals malice and his potency
together to consider further that
what his high hatred would effect wants not
a minister in his power you know his nature
that he's revengeful and i know his sword
hath a sharp edge it's long and't may be said
it reaches far and where 'twill not extend
you'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock
that i advise your shunning
enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before
him certain of the guard and two secretaries
with papers the cardinal in his passage fixeth his
eye on buckingham and buckingham on him
both full of disdain
wolsey the duke of buckingham's surveyor ha
where's his examination
wolsey is he in person ready
secretary ay please your grace
wolsey well we shall then know more and buckingham
shall lessen this big look
exeunt wolsey and his train
buckingham this butcher's cur is venom mouth'd and i
have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
not wake him in his slumber a beggar's book
outworths a noble's blood
ask god for temp'rance that's th' appliance only
which your disease requires
buckingham i read ins looks
matter against me and his eye revild
me as his abject object at this instant
he bores me with some trick he's gone to th' king
i'll follow and outstare him
norfolk stay my lord
and let your reason with your choler question
requires slow pace at first anger is like
a full hot horse who being allow'd his way
self mettle tires him not a man in england
can advise me like you be to yourself
as you would to your friend
buckingham i'll to the king
and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
this ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
there's difference in no persons
heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
that it do singe yourself we may outrun
by violent swiftness that which we run at
and lose by over running know you not
the fire that mounts the liquor tillt run o'er
in seeming to augment it wastes it be advis'd
i say again there is no english soul
more stronger to direct you than yourself
if with the sap of reason you would quench
buckingham sir
i am thankful to you and i'll go along
by your prescription but this top proud fellow
whom from the flow of gan i name not but
from sincere motions by intelligence
and proofs as clear as founts in july when
we see each grain of gravel i do know
to be corrupt and treasonous
norfolk say not treasonous
as shore of rock attend this holy fox
or wolf or both for he is equal rav'nous
as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
as able to perform't his mind and place
infecting one another yea reciprocally
only to show his pomp as well in france
as here at home suggests the king our master
to this last costly treaty th' interview
that swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
norfolk faith and so it did
buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
the articles o' th' combination drew
as himself pleas'd and they were ratified
as he cried 'thus let be' to as much end
as give a crutch to th' dead but our count cardinal
has done this and 'tis well for worthy wolsey
who cannot err he did it now this follows
which as i take it is a kind of puppy
under pretence to see the queen his aunt
for 'twas indeed his colour but he came
to whisper wolsey here makes visitation
his fears were that the interview betwixt
england and france might through their amity
breed him some prejudice for from this league
peep'd harms that menac'd him privily
deals with our cardinal and as i trow
which i do well for i am sure the emperor
ere it was ask'd but when the way was made
and pav'd with gold the emperor thus desir'd
that he would please to alter the king's course
and break the foresaid peace let the king know
as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
and for his own advantage
norfolk i am sorry
to hear this of him and could wish he were
buckingham no not a syllable
i do pronounce him in that very shape
he shall appear in proof
enter brandon a sergeant at arms before him

thanks you for this great care i stood i' th' level
of a full charg'd confederacy and give thanks
to you that chok'd it let be calld before us
that gentleman of buckingham's in person
i'll hear his confessions justify
and point by point the treasons of his master
he shall again relate
a noise within crying 'room for the queen'
and suffolk she kneels the king riseth
from his state takes her up kisses and placeth her
by him
queen katharine nay we must longer kneel i am suitor
king arise and take place by us half your suit
never name to us you have half our power
the other moiety ere you ask is given
repeat your will and take it
queen katharine thank your majesty
not unconsidered leave your honour nor
the dignity of your office is the point
of my petition
king lady mine proceed
queen katharine i am solicited not by a few
and those of true condition that your subjects
are in great grievance there have been commissions
sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart
of all their loyalties wherein although
most bitterly on you as putter on
of these exactions yet the king our master
whose honour heaven shield from soil even he escapes not
language unmannerly yea such which breaks
the sides of loyalty and almost appears
in loud rebellion
norfolk not almost appears
it doth appear for upon these taxations
the clothiers all not able to maintain
the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
unfit for other life compelld by hunger
and lack of other means in desperate manner
daring th' event to th' teeth are all in uproar
and danger serves among them
king taxation
wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal
you that are blam'd for it alike with us
know you of this taxation
i know but of a single part in aught
pertains to th' state and front but in that file
where others tell steps with me
queen katharine no my lord
you know no more than others but you frame
things that are known alike which are not wholesome
to those which would not know them and yet must
perforce be their acquaintance these exactions
whereof my sovereign would have note they are
the back is sacrifice to th' load they say
they are devis'd by you or else you suffer
too hard an exclamation
king still exaction
the nature of it in what kind let's know
is this exaction
queen katharine i am much too venturous
in tempting of your patience but am bold'ned
under your promis'd pardon the subjects' grief
the sixth part of his substance to be levied
without delay and the pretence for this
is nam'd your wars in france this makes bold mouths
tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
allegiance in them their curses now
live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
this tractable obedience is a slave
to each incensed will i would your highness
would give it quick consideration for
king by my life
this is against our pleasure
wolsey and for me
i have no further gone in this than by
a single voice and that not pass'd me but
by learned approbation of the judges if i am
traduc'd by ignorant tongues which neither know
my faculties nor person yet will be
the chronicles of my doing let me say
that virtue must go through we must not stint
our necessary actions in the fear
to cope malicious censurers which ever
as rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow
that is new trimm'd but benefit no further
than vainly longing what we oft do best
by sick interpreters once weak ones is
not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
hitting a grosser quality is cried up
in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at
we should take root here where we sit or sit
state statues only
king things done well
and with a care exempt themselves from fear
things done without example in their issue
are to be fear'd have you a precedent
of this commission i believe not any
we must not rend our subjects from our laws
a trembling contribution why we take
from every tree lop bark and part o' th' timber
and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
the air will drink the sap to every county
where this is questiond send our letters with
free pardon to each man that has denied
the force of this commission pray look tot
i put it to your care
wolsey aside to the secretary a word with you
of the king's grace and pardon the grieved commons
hardly conceive of me let it be nois'd
that through our intercession this revokement
and pardon comes i shall anon advise you
further in the proceeding exit secretary
enter surveyor
queen katharine i am sorry that the duke of buckingham
is run in your displeasure
king it grieves many
to nature none more bound his training such
that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
and never seek for aid out of himself yet see
when these so noble benefits shall prove
not well dispos'd the mind growing once corrupt
they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
than ever they were fair this man so complete
who was enrolld 'mongst wonders and when we
almost with ravish'd list'ning could not find
hath into monstrous habits put the graces
that once were his and is become as black
as if besmear'd in hell sit by us you shall hear
this was his gentleman in trust of him
things to strike honour sad bid him recount
the fore recited practices whereof
we cannot feel too little hear too much
wolsey stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
most like a careful subject have collected
king speak freely
surveyor first it was usual with him every day
it would infect his speech that if the king
should without issue die he'll carry it so
to make the sceptre his these very words
i've heard him utter to his son in law
lord aberga'ny to whom by oath he menac'd
revenge upon the cardinal
wolsey please your highness note
not friended by his wish to your high person
his will is most malignant and it stretches
beyond you to your friends
queen katharine my learnd lord cardinal
deliver all with charity
king speak on
how grounded he his title to the crown
upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
at any time speak aught
by a vain prophecy of nicholas henton
king what was that henton
surveyor sir a chartreux friar
his confessor who fed him every minute
with words of sovereignty
king how know'st thou this
surveyor not long before your highness sped to france
the duke being at the rose within the parish
saint lawrence poultney did of me demand
concerning the french journey i replied
men fear'd the french would prove perfidious
to the king's danger presently the duke
said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
'twould prove the verity of certain words
spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he
'hath sent to me wishing me to permit
john de la car my chaplain a choice hour
to hear from him a matter of some moment
he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
my chaplain to no creature living but
to me should utter with demure confidence
this pausingly ensu'd neither the king nor's heirs
tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
to gain the love o' th' commonalty the duke
shall govern england'
queen katharine if i know you well
you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
you charge not in your spleen a noble person
and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed
yes heartily beseech you
king let him on
go forward
surveyor on my soul i'll speak but truth
i told my lord the duke by th' devils illusions
the monk might be deceiv'd and that 'twas dangerous
for him
it forg'd him some design which being believ'd
it was much like to do he answer'd 'tush
it can do me no damage' adding further
that had the king in his last sickness faild
the cardinals and sir thomas lovells heads
should have gone off
king ha what so rank ah ha
there's mischief in this man canst thou say further
surveyor i can my liege
surveyor being at greenwich
after your highness had reprov'd the duke
about sir william bulmer
king i remember
of such a time being my sworn servant
the duke retaind him his but on what hence
surveyor 'if' quoth he 'i for this had been committed
as to the tower i thought i would have play'd
the part my father meant to act upon
made suit to come ins presence which if granted
as he made semblance of his duty would
have put his knife into him'
king a giant traitor
wolsey now madam may his highness live in freedom
and this man out of prison
queen katharine god mend all
king there's something more would out of thee what say'st
surveyor after 'the duke his father' with the 'knife'
another spread ons breast mounting his eyes
he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour
was were he evil us'd he would outgo
his father by as much as a performance
does an irresolute purpose
king there's his period
to sheath his knife in us he is attach'd
call him to present trial if he may
find mercy in the law 'tis his if none
he's traitor to th' height exeunt

act ii scene 1
enter two gentlemen at several doors
first gentleman whither away so fast
second gentleman o god save ye
ev'n to the hall to hear what shall become
of the great duke of buckingham
first gentleman i'll save you
that labour sir alls now done but the ceremony
of bringing back the prisoner
second gentleman were you there
second gentleman pray speak what has happend
first gentleman you may guess quickly what
second gentleman is he found guilty
first gentleman yes truly is he and condemnd upont
second gentleman i am sorry for't
first gentleman so are a number more
second gentleman but pray how pass'd it
first gentleman i'll tell you in a little the great duke
came to the bar where to his accusations
many sharp reasons to defeat the law
the king's attorney on the contrary
urg'd on the examinations proofs confessions
of divers witnesses which the duke desir'd
to have brought viva voce to his face
at which appear'd against him his surveyor
sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car
confessor to him with that devil monk
hopkins that made this mischief
that fed him with his prophecies
first gentleman the same
all these accus'd him strongly which he fain
would have flung from him but indeed he could not
and so his peers upon this evidence
have found him guilty of high treason much
he spoke and learnedly for life but all
was either pitied in him or forgotten
second gentleman after all this how did he bear him self
his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
with such an agony he sweat extremely
and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
but he fell to himself again and sweetly
in all the rest show'd a most noble patience
second gentleman i do not think he fears death
first gentleman sure he does not
he never was so womanish the cause
he may a little grieve at
the cardinal is the end of this
first gentleman 'tis likely
by all conjectures first kildare's attainder
then deputy of ireland who remov'd
earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too
lest he should help his father
second gentleman that trick of state
was a deep envious one
first gentleman at his return
and generally whoever the king favours
the cardinal instantly will find employment
and far enough from court too
second gentleman all the commons
hate him perniciously and o' my conscience
wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham
the mirror of all courtesy
enter buckingham from his arraignment tip staves
on each side accompanied with sir thomas
lovell sir nicholas vaux sir william sandys
and common people etc
first gentleman stay there sir
and see the noble ruind man you speak of
second gentleman let's stand close and behold him
buckingham all good people
you that thus far have come to pity me
hear what i say and then go home and lose me
and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
and if i have a conscience let it sink me
even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
the law i bear no malice for my death
't has done upon the premises but justice
but those that sought it i could wish more christians
be what they will i heartily forgive 'em
yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief
nor build their evils on the graves of great men
for further life in this world i ne'er hope
nor will i sue although the king have mercies
more than i dare make faults you few that lov'd me
and dare be bold to weep for buckingham
his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
is only bitter to him only dying
go with me like good angels to my end
and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
lovell i do beseech your grace for charity
if ever any malice in your heart
were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
buckingham sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you
as i would be forgiven i forgive all
there cannot be those numberless offences
'gainst me that i cannot take peace with no black envy
shall mark my grave commend me to his grace
and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him
yet are the king's and till my soul forsake
shall cry for blessings on him may he live
longer than i have time to tell his years
ever belov'd and loving may his rule be
and when old time shall lead him to his end
goodness and he fill up one monument
lovell to th' water side i must conduct your grace
then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux
who undertakes you to your end
the duke is coming see the barge be ready
and fit it with such furniture as suits
the greatness of his person
buckingham nay sir nicholas
let it alone my state now will but mock me
when i came hither i was lord high constable
and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
yet i am richer than my base accusers
that never knew what truth meant i now seal it
my noble father henry of buckingham
who first rais'd head against usurping richard
flying for succour to his servant banister
being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
and without trial fell god's peace be with him
henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying
my father's loss like a most royal prince
restor'd me to my honours and out of ruins
made my name once more noble now his son
that made me happy at one stroke has taken
for ever from the world i had my trial
and must needs say a noble one which makes me
a little happier than my wretched father
yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
fell by our servants by those men we lov'd most
a most unnatural and faithless service
heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
this from a dying man receive as certain
be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
and give your hearts to when they once perceive
the least rub in your fortunes fall away
like water from ye never found again
but where they mean to sink ye all good people
pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour
of my long weary life is come upon me
empty
and when you would say something that is sad
exeunt buckingham and train
first gentleman o this is full of pity sir it calls
i fear too many curses on their heads
that were the authors
second gentleman if the duke be guiltless
'tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling
of an ensuing evil if it fall
greater than this
first gentleman good angels keep it from us
second gentleman this secret is so weighty 'twill require
a strong faith to conceal it
first gentleman let me have it
i do not talk much
second gentleman i am confident
you shall sir did you not of late days hear
a buzzing of a separation
between the king and katharine
first gentleman yes but it held not
he sent command to the lord mayor straight
to stop the rumour and allay those tongues
that durst disperse it
second gentleman but that slander sir
is found a truth now for it grows again
fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
the king will venture at it either the cardinal
or some about him near have out of malice
to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple
cardinal campeius is arriv'd and lately
as all think for this business
first gentleman 'tis the cardinal
and merely to revenge him on the emperor
for not bestowing on him at his asking
the archbishopric of toledo this is purpos'd
second gentleman i think you have hit the mark but is't
not cruel
that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal
first gentleman 'tis woeful
we are too open here to argue this
let's think in private more exeunt

he counsels a divorce a loss of her
that like a jewel has hung twenty years
about his neck yet never lost her lustre
of her that loves him with that excellence
that angels love good men with even of her
that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
will bless the king and is not this course pious
chamberlain heaven keep me from such counsel 'tis most true

act ii scene 3
enter anne bullen and an old lady
anne not for that neither here's the pang that pinches
his highness having liv'd so long with her and she
so good a lady that no tongue could ever
pronounce dishonour of her by my life
she never knew harm doing o now after
so many courses of the sun enthroned
still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
to leave a thousand fold more bitter than
to give her the avaunt it is a pity
would move a monster
old lady hearts of most hard temper
melt and lament for her
anne o god's will much better
she ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal
yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
it from the bearer 'tis a sufferance panging
as soul and body's severing
she's a stranger now again
anne so much the more
must pity drop upon her verily
i swear 'tis better to be lowly born
and range with humble livers in content
than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief
and wear a golden sorrow
old lady our content
is our best having
i would not be a queen
old lady beshrew me i would
and venture maidenhead for 't and so would you
for all this spice of your hypocrisy
you that have so fair parts of woman on you

affected eminence wealth sovereignty
which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
saving your mincing the capacity
if you might please to stretch it
anne nay good troth
old lady yes troth and troth you would not be a queen
anne no not for all the riches under heaven
old lady 'tis strange a threepence bow'd would hire me
old as i am to queen it but i pray you
what think you of a duchess have you limbs
to bear that load of title
anne no in truth
i would not be a young count in your way
for more than blushing comes to if your back
cannot vouchsafe this burden 'tis too weak
ever to get a boy
anne how you do talk
i swear again i would not be a queen
for all the world
old lady in faith for little england
you'd venture an emballing i myself
no more to th' crown but that lo who comes here
enter the lord chamberlain
chamberlain good morrow ladies what were't worth to know
the secret of your conference

our mistress' sorrows we were pitying
chamberlain it was a gentle business and becoming
the action of good women there is hope
anne now i pray god amen
chamberlain you bear a gentle mind and heav'nly blessings
follow such creatures that you may fair lady
perceive i speak sincerely and high notes
ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty
commends his good opinion of you to you and
does purpose honour to you no less flowing
than marchioness of pembroke to which tide
a thousand pound a year annual support
anne i do not know
what kind of my obedience i should tender
more than my all is nothing nor my prayers
are not words duly hallowed nor my wishes
more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
are all i can return beseech your lordship
vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
as from a blushing handmaid to his highness
whose health and royalty i pray for
i shall not fail t' approve the fair conceit
the king hath of you aside i have perus'd her well
beauty and honour in her are so mingled
that they have caught the king and who knows yet
but from this lady may proceed a gem
to lighten all this isle i'll to the king
and say i spoke with you
anne my honour'd lord exit lord chamberlain
old lady why this it is see see
am yet a courtier beggarly nor could
come pat betwixt too early and too late
for any suit of pounds and you o fate

this compelld fortune have your mouth filld up
before you open it
anne this is strange to me
old lady how tastes it is it bitter forty pence no
there was a lady once 'tis an old story
for all the mud in egypt have you heard it
anne come you are pleasant
old lady with your theme i could
o'ermount the lark the marchioness of pembroke
a thousand pounds a year for pure respect
no other obligation by my life
that promises moe thousands honour's train
is longer than his foreskirt by this time
i know your back will bear a duchess say
anne good lady

and unmatch'd wit and judgment ferdinand
my father king of spain was reckond one
the wisest prince that there had reignd by many
that they had gather'd a wise council to them
of every realm that did debate this business

be by my friends in spain advis'd whose counsel
i will implore if not i' th' name of god
your pleasure be fulfilld
wolsey you have here lady
and of your choice these reverend fathers men
yea the elect o' th' land who are assembled
to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless

for your own quiet as to rectify
what is unsettled in the king
campeius his grace
hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
it's fit this royal session do proceed
and that without delay their arguments
queen katharine lord cardinal

or god will punish me i do believe
induc'd by potent circumstances that
you are mine enemy and make my challenge
you shall not be my judge for it is you
have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
which god's dew quench therefore i say again
i utterly abhor yea from my soul
refuse you for my judge whom yet once more

of disposition gentle and of wisdom
o'ertopping womans pow'r madam you do me wrong
i have no spleen against you nor injustice
for you or any how far i have proceeded
or how far further shall is warranted
by a commission from the consistory
that i have blown this coal i do deny it
the king is present if it be known to him
that i gainsay my deed how may he wound
and worthily my falsehood yea as much
as you have done my truth if he know
that i am free of your report he knows
i am not of your wrong therefore in him
it lies to cure me and the cure is to
remove these thoughts from you the which before
you gracious madam to unthink your speaking
and to say so no more
queen katharine my lord my lord
i am a simple woman much too weak
t' oppose your cunning y'are meek and humble mouth'd
you sign your place and calling in full seeming
with meekness and humility but your heart
is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride
you have by fortune and his highness' favours
where pow'rs are your retainers and your words
domestics to you serve your will as't please
yourself pronounce their office i must tell you
you tender more your persons honour than
your high profession spiritual that again
i do refuse you for my judge and here
before you all appeal unto the pope
to bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness
and to be judg'd by him
campeius the queen is obstinate
stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
disdainful to be tried by't 'tis not well
she's going away
king call her again
crier katharine queen of england come into the court
gentleman usher madam you are calld back
queen katharine what need you note it pray you keep your way

in any of their courts exeunt queen and her attendants
king go thy ways kate
that man i' th' world who shall report he has
a better wife let him in nought be trusted
for speaking false in that thou art alone
if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
thy meekness saint like wife like government
sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
the queen of earthly queens she's noble born
and like her true nobility she has
carried herself towards me
wolsey most gracious sir
in humblest manner i require your highness
that it shall please you to declare in hearing
of all these ears for where i am robb'd and bound
there must i be unloos'd although not there
did broach this business to your highness or
laid any scruple in your way which might
induce you to the question ont or ever
have to you but with thanks to god for such
a royal lady spake one the least word that might
be to the prejudice of her present state
or touch of her good person
king my lord cardinal
i do excuse you yea upon mine honour
that you have many enemies that know not
why they are so but like to village curs
bark when their fellows do by some of these
the queen is put in anger y'are excus'd
but will you be more justified you ever
have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desir'd
it to be stirr'd but oft have hind'red oft
the passages made toward it on my honour
i speak my good lord cardinal to this point
i will be bold with time and your attention
then mark th' inducement thus it came give heed to't
my conscience first receiv'd a tenderness
scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
by th' bishop of bayonne then french ambassador
who had been hither sent on the debating
a marriage 'twixt the duke of orleans and
our daughter mary i' th' progress of this business
ere a determinate resolution he
wherein he might the king his lord advertise
whether our daughter were legitimate
respecting this our marriage with the dowager
sometimes our brother's wife this respite shook
the bosom of my conscience enter'd me
yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
the region of my breast which forc'd such way
that many maz'd considerings did throng
and press'd in with this caution first methought
commanded nature that my lady's womb
if it conceiv'd a male child by me should
do no more offices of life to't than
the grave does to the dead for her male issue
or died where they were made or shortly after
this world had air'd them hence i took a thought
this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not
be gladded int by me then follows that
by this my issue's fail and that gave to me
many a groaning throe thus hulling in
the wild sea of my conscience i did steer
toward this remedy whereupon we are
now present here together that's to say
i meant to rectify my conscience which
i then did feel full sick and yet not well
by all the reverend fathers of the land
and doctors learnd first i began in private
how under my oppression i did reek
when i first mov'd you
lincoln very well my liege
king i have spoke long be pleas'd yourself to say
how far you satisfied me
lincoln so please your highness
the question did at first so stagger me
bearing a state of mighty moment int
and consequence of dread that i committed
and did entreat your highness to this course
which you are running here
king i then mov'd you
my lord of canterbury and got your leave
to make this present summons unsolicited
i left no reverend person in this court
but by particular consent proceeded
under your hands and seals therefore go on
for no dislike i' th' world against the person
of my alleged reasons drives this forward
prove but our marriage lawful by my life
and kingly dignity we are contented
to wear our moral state to come with her
katharine our queen before the primest creature
that's paragond o' th' world
campeius so please your highness
the queen being absent 'tis a needful fitness
that we adjourn this court till further day
made to the queen to call back her appeal
she intends unto his holiness
king aside i may perceive
these cardinals trifle with me i abhor
this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
my learnd and well beloved servant cranmer
prithee return with thy approach i know
my comfort comes along break up the court
i say set on exuent in manner as they entered
london the queens apartments
enter the queen and her women as at work
queen katharine take thy lute wench my soul grows
sad with troubles
sing and disperse 'em if thou canst leave working
empty
orpheus with his lute made trees
and the mountain tops that freeze
bow themselves when he did sing
ever sprung as sun and showers
there had made a lasting spring
every thing that heard him play
even the billows of the sea
hung their heads and then lay by
in sweet music is such art
killing care and grief of heart
fall asleep or hearing die
enter a gentleman
gentleman ant please your grace the two great cardinals
wait in the presence
queen katharine would they speak with me
gentleman they willd me say so madam
queen katharine pray their graces
to come near exit gentleman what can be their business
with me a poor weak woman falln from favour
i do not like their coming now i think ont
they should be good men their affairs as righteous
enter the two cardinals wolsey and campeius
wolsey peace to your highness
queen katharine your graces find me here part of housewife
i would be all against the worst may happen
what are your pleasures with me reverend lords
wolsey may it please you noble madam to withdraw
into your private chamber we shall give you
the full cause of our coming
queen katharine speak it here
deserves a corner would all other women
could speak this with as free a soul as i do
my lords i care not so much i am happy
above a number if my actions
were tried by ev'ry tongue ev'ry eye saw 'em
envy and base opinion set against 'em
i know my life so even if your business
seek me out and that way i am wife in
out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
queen katharine o good my lord no latin
i am not such a truant since my coming
as not to know the language i have liv'd in
a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious
pray speak in english here are some will thank you
if you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake
believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
the willing'st sin i ever yet committed
may be absolv'd in english
i am sorry my integrity should breed
and service to his majesty and you
so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
we come not by the way of accusation
to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
nor to betray you any way to sorrow
you have too much good lady but to know
how you stand minded in the weighty difference
between the king and you and to deliver
and comforts to your cause
campeius most honour'd madam
my lord of york out of his noble nature
zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
forgetting like a good man your late censure
both of his truth and him which was too far
offers as i do in a sign of peace
his service and his counsel
queen katharine aside to betray me
ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
but how to make ye suddenly an answer
in such a point of weight so near mine honour
more near my life i fear with my weak wit
and to such men of gravity and learning
in truth i know not i was set at work
among my maids full little god knows looking
either for such men or such business
for her sake that i have been for i feel
let me have time and counsel for my cause
alas i am a woman friendless hopeless
wolsey madam you wrong the king's love with these fears
your hopes and friends are infinite
queen katharine in england
but little for my profit can you think lords
that any englishman dare give me counsel
or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure
though he be grown so desperate to be honest
they that must weigh out my afflictions
they that my trust must grow to live not here
they are as all my other comforts far hence
in mine own country lords
campeius i would your grace
would leave your griefs and take my counsel
queen katharine how sir
campeius put your main cause into the king's protection
he's loving and most gracious 'twill be much
for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
you'll part away disgrac'd
wolsey he tells you rightly
queen katharine ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin
is this your christian counsel out upon ye
heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
that no king can corrupt
campeius your rage mistakes us
queen katharine the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye
but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
mend 'em for shame my lords is this your comfort
the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scornd
i will not wish ye half my miseries
i have more charity but say i warned ye
take heed for heavens sake take heed lest at once
the burden of my sorrows fall upon ye
wolsey madam this is a mere distraction
queen katharine ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
and all such false professors would you have me
if you have any justice any pity
if ye be any thing but churchmens habits
put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
alas has banish'd me his bed already
his love too long ago i am old my lords
and all the fellowship i hold now with him
is only my obedience what can happen
make me a curse like this
campeius your fears are worse
queen katharine have i liv'd thus long let me speak myself
since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one
a woman i dare say without vain glory
never yet branded with suspicion
have i with all my full affections
still met the king lov'd him next heav'n obey'd him
been out of fondness superstitious to him
and am i thus rewarded 'tis not well lords
bring me a constant woman to her husband
one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
and to that woman when she has done most
yet will i add an honour a great patience
wolsey madam you wander from the good we aim at
queen katharine my lord i dare not make myself so guilty
to give up willingly that noble title
your master wed me to nothing but death
wolsey pray hear me
queen katharine would i had never trod this english earth
or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
ye have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts
what will become of me now wretched lady
i am the most unhappy woman living
to her women alas poor wenches where are now
your fortunes
shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity
almost no grave allow'd me like the my
that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
i'll hang my head and perish
wolsey if your grace
could but be brought to know our ends are honest
you'd feel more comfort why should we good lady
upon what cause wrong you alas our places
the way of our profession is against it
we are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em
how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage
the hearts of princes kiss obedience
so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
they swell and grow as terrible as storms
i know you have a gentle noble temper
a soul as even as a calm pray think us
those we profess peace makers friends and servants
campeius madam you'll find it so you wrong your virtues
as yours was put into you ever casts
such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you
beware you lose it not for us if you please
to trust us in your business we are ready
to use our utmost studies in your service
queen katharine do what ye will my lords and pray
forgive me
if i have us'd myself unmannerly
you know i am a woman lacking wit
pray do my service to his majesty
he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
while i shall have my life come reverend fathers
bestow your counsels on me she now begs
that little thought when she set footing here
she should have bought her dignities so dear exeunt

and force them with a constancy the cardinal
cannot stand under them if you omit
the offer of this time i cannot promise
but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
with these you bear already
surrey i am joyful
to meet the least occasion that may give me
remembrance of my father in law the duke

strangely neglected when did he regard
the stamp of nobleness in any person
out of himself
chamberlain my lords you speak your pleasures

what we can do to him though now the time
gives way to us i much fear if you cannot
anything on him for he hath a witchcraft
over the king ins tongue

matter against him that for ever mars
the honey of his language no he's settled
not to come off in his displeasure
surrey sir

norfolk believe it this is true
in the divorce his contrary proceedings
are all unfolded wherein he appears
as i would wish mine enemy
surrey how came
his practices to light
suffolk most strangely
surrey o how how
suffolk the cardinals letters to the pope miscarried
how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
to stay the judgment o' th' divorce for if
it did take place 'i do' quoth he 'perceive
my king is tangled in affection to
a creature of the queens lady anne bullen'
surrey has the king this
suffolk believe it

in mind and feature i persuade me from her
will fall some blessing to this land which shall
in it be memoriz'd
surrey but will the king
digest this letter of the cardinals
norfolk marry amen
suffolk no no
there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
will make this sting the sooner cardinal campeius

to second all his plot i do assure you
the king cried 'ha' at this
and let him cry 'ha' louder
norfolk but my lord
when returns cranmer
suffolk he is returnd in his opinions which
have satisfied the king for his divorce

her coronation katharine no more
and widow to prince arthur
norfolk this same cranmer's
a worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain
in the king's business
suffolk he has and we shall see him

surrey sharp enough
lord for thy justice
wolsey aside the late queens gentlewoman a knight's
empty
to be her mistress' mistress the queens queen
this candle burns not clear 'tis i must snuff it
and well deserving yet i know her for
a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to
our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of
our hard ruld king again there is sprung up
an heretic an arch one cranmer one
hath crawld into the favour of the king
and is his oracle
norfolk he is vex'd at something
enter the king reading of a schedule and lovell
the master cord ons heart
suffolk the king the king
king what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
to his own portion and what expense by th' hour
seems to flow from him how i' th' name of thrift
does he rake this together now my lords
saw you the cardinal
norfolk my lord we have
stood here observing him some strange commotion
stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
then lays his finger on his temple straight
springs out into fast gait then stops again
strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
his eye against the moon in most strange postures
we have seen him set himself
king it may well be
there is a mutiny ins mind this morning
papers of state he sent me to peruse
there on my conscience put unwittingly
forsooth an inventory thus importing
the several parcels of his plate his treasure
rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
possession of a subject
norfolk it's heavens will
some spirit put this paper in the packet
to bless your eye withal
his contemplation were above the earth
and fix'd on spiritual object he should still
dwell in his musings but i am afraid
his thinkings are below the moon not worth
his serious considering
the king takes his seat and whispers lovell
who goes to the cardinal
wolsey heaven forgive me
ever god bless your highness
you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
of your best graces in your mind the which
you were now running o'er you have scarce time
to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
to keep your earthly audit sure in that
i deem you an ill husband and am glad
to have you therein my companion
wolsey sir
for holy offices i have a time a time
i bear i' th' state and nature does require
her times of preservation which perforce
i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
must give my tendance to
king you have said well
wolsey and ever may your highness yoke together
as i will lend you cause my doing well
with my well saying
king 'tis well said again
and yet words are no deeds my father lov'd you
he said he did and with his deed did crown
his word upon you since i had my office
i have kept you next my heart have not alone
employ'd you where high profits might come home
but par'd my present havings to bestow
my bounties upon you
wolsey aside what should this mean
surrey aside the lord increase this business
the prime man of the state i pray you tell me
if what i now pronounce you have found true
and if you may confess it say withal
if you are bound to us or no what say you
wolsey my sovereign i confess your royal graces
show'r'd on me daily have been more than could
my studied purposes requite which went
beyond all mans endeavours my endeavours
have ever come too short of my desires
have been mine so that evermore they pointed
to th' good of your most sacred person and
the profit of the state for your great graces
heap'd upon me poor undeserver i
can nothing render but allegiant thanks
my pray'rs to heaven for you my loyalty
which ever has and ever shall be growing
till death that winter kill it
king fairly answer'd
therein illustrated the honour of it
does pay the act of it as i' th' contrary
the foulness is the punishment i presume
that as my hand has opend bounty to you
my heart dropp'd love my pow'r raind honour more
on you than any so your hand and heart
your brain and every function of your power
should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
as 'twere in love's particular be more
wolsey i do profess
that for your highness' good i ever labour'd
more than mine own that am have and will be
though all the world should crack their duty to you
and throw it from their soul though perils did
abound as thick as thought could make 'em and
appear in forms more horrid yet my duty
as doth a rock against the chiding flood
should the approach of this wild river break
king 'tis nobly spoken
take notice lords he has a loyal breast
for you have seen him open 't read o'er this
giving him papers
and after this and then to breakfast with
what appetite you have
exit the king frowning upon the cardinal the nobles
throng after him smiling and whispering
wolsey what should this mean
he parted frowning from me as if ruin
leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
upon the daring huntsman that has galld him
then makes him nothing i must read this paper
i fear the story of his anger 'tis so
this paper has undone me 'tis th' account
of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
and fee my friends in rome o negligence
made me put this main secret in the packet
i sent the king is there no way to cure this
no new device to beat this from his brains
i know 'twill stir him strongly yet i know
a way if it take right in spite of fortune
will bring me off again what's this 'to th' pope'
the letter as i live with all the business
i writ to's holiness nay then farewell
i have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness
i haste now to my setting i shall fall
like a bright exhalation in the evening
and no man see me more
re enter to wolsey the dukes of norfolk and
suffolk the earl of surrey and the lord
empty
norfolk hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you
to render up the great seal presently
into our hands and to confine yourself
till you hear further from his highness
wolsey stay
where's your commission lords words cannot carry
authority so weighty
suffolk who dares cross 'em
bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly
wolsey till i find more than will or words to do it
i mean your malice know officious lords
i dare and must deny it now i feel
how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
follow your envious courses men of malice
you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt
in time will find their fit rewards that seal
you ask with such a violence the king
mine and your master with his own hand gave me
bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
tied it by letters patents now who'll take it
surrey the king that gave it
wolsey it must be himself then
surrey thou art a proud traitor priest
wolsey proud lord thou liest
within these forty hours surrey durst better
have burnt that tongue than said so
surrey thy ambition
thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
the heads of all thy brother cardinals
with thee and all thy best parts bound together
weigh'd not a hair of his plague of your policy
you sent me deputy for ireland
far from his succour from the king from all
that might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him
whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
absolv'd him with an axe
wolsey this and all else
i answer is most false the duke by law
found his deserts how innocent i was
from any private malice in his end
his noble jury and foul cause can witness
if i lov'd many words lord i should tell you
you have as little honesty as honour
that in the way of loyalty and truth
toward the king my ever royal master
dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be
surrey by my soul
your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel
my sword i' the life blood of thee else my lords
can ye endure to hear this arrogance
and from this fellow if we live thus tamely
to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
farewell nobility let his grace go forward
and dare us with his cap like larks
wolsey all goodness
surrey yes that goodness
of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
into your own hands cardinal by extortion
the goodness of your intercepted packets
you writ to th' pope against the king your goodness
since you provoke me shall be most notorious
my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble
as you respect the common good the state
of our despis'd nobility our issues
produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
collected from his life i'll startle you
worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
wolsey how much methinks i could despise this man
but that i am bound in charity against it
norfolk those articles my lord are in the king's hand
but thus much they are foul ones
wolsey so much fairer
when the king knows my truth
surrey this cannot save you
i thank my memory i yet remember
some of these articles and out they shall
now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
you'll show a little honesty
wolsey speak on sir
i dare your worst objections if i blush
it is to see a nobleman want manners
first that without the king's assent or knowledge
you wrought to be a legate by which power
you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops
norfolk then that in all you writ to rome or else
to foreign princes 'ego et rex meus'
was still inscrib'd in which you brought the king
to be your servant
suffolk then that without the knowledge
either of king or council when you went
to carry into flanders the great seal
surrey item you sent a large commission
to gregory de cassado to conclude
without the king's will or the state's allowance
a league between his highness and ferrara
suffolk that out of mere ambition you have caus'd
your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin
surrey then that you have sent innumerable substance
by what means got i leave to your own conscience
you have for dignities to the mere undoing
of all the kingdom many more there are
which since they are of you and odious
i will not taint my mouth with
chamberlain o my lord
press not a falling man too far 'tis virtue
his faults lie open to the laws let them
not you correct him my heart weeps to see him
so little of his great self
suffolk lord cardinal the king's further pleasure is
because all those things you have done of late
by your power legatine within this kingdom
fall into th' compass of a praemunire
that therefore such a writ be sued against you
to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
chattels and whatsoever and to be
out of the king's protection this is my charge
norfolk and so we'll leave you to your meditations
about the giving back the great seal to us
the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
exeunt all but wolsey
wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me
farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
this is the state of man to day he puts forth
the tender leaves of hopes to morrow blossoms
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
and when he thinks good easy man full surely
his greatness is a ripening nips his root
and then he falls as i do i have ventur'd
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
this many summers in a sea of glory
but far beyond my depth my high blown pride
at length broke under me and now has left me
weary and old with service to the mercy
of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
i feel my heart new opend o how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours
there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
more pangs and fears than wars or women have
and when he falls he falls like lucifer
never to hope again
enter cromwell standing amazed
why how now cromwell
wolsey what amaz'd
at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
a great man should decline nay an you weep
i am falln indeed
cromwell how does your grace
wolsey why well
never so truly happy my good cromwell
i know myself now and i feel within me
a peace above all earthly dignities
i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
these ruind pillars out of pity taken
a load would sink a navy too much honour
o 'tis a burden cromwell 'tis a burden
too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
cromwell i am glad your grace has made that right use of it
wolsey i hope i have i am able now methinks
out of a fortitude of soul i feel
to endure more miseries and greater far
what news abroad
cromwell the heaviest and the worst
is your displeasure with the king
wolsey god bless him
cromwell the next is that sir thomas more is chosen
lord chancellor in your place
wolsey that's somewhat sudden
but he's a learned man may he continue
long in his highness' favour and do justice
when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him
what more
cromwell that cranmer is returnd with welcome
installd lord archbishop of canterbury
wolsey that's news indeed
cromwell last that the lady anne
whom the king hath in secrecy long married
this day was view'd in open as his queen
only about her coronation
wolsey there was the weight that pulld me down
o cromwell
the king has gone beyond me all my glories
in that one woman i have lost for ever
no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
or gild again the noble troops that waited
upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell
i am a poor falln man unworthy now
that sun i pray may never set i have told him
what and how true thou art he will advance thee
some little memory of me will stir him
i know his noble nature not to let
thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell
neglect him not make use now and provide
for thine own future safety
cromwell o my lord
must i then leave you must i needs forgo
bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
the king shall have my service but my prayers
for ever and for ever shall be yours
wolsey cromwell i did not think to shed a tear
in all my miseries but thou hast forc'd me
out of thy honest truth to play the woman
let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell
and when i am forgotten as i shall be
of me more must be heard of say i taught thee
say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
mark but my fall and that that ruind me
cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition
by that sin fell the angels how can man then
the image of his maker hope to win by it
corruption wins not more than honesty
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
thy god's and truth's then if thou fallst o cromwell
thou fallst a blessed martyr
serve the king and prithee lead me in
there take an inventory of all i have
to the last penny 'tis the king's my robe
i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell
had i but serv'd my god with half the zeal
i serv'd my king he would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies
cromwell good sir have patience
wolsey so i have farewell
the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell exeunt

a street in westminster
first gentleman y'are well met once again
second gentleman so are you
first gentleman you come to take your stand here and
empty
the lady anne pass from her coronation
second gentleman 'tis all my business at our last encounter
the duke of buckingham came from his trial
first gentleman 'tis very true but that time offer'd
empty
second gentleman 'tis well the citizens
i am sure have shown at full their royal minds
as let 'em have their rights they are ever forward
in celebration of this day with shows
pageants and sights of honour
first gentleman never greater
nor i'll assure you better taken sir
second gentleman may i be bold to ask what that contains
that paper in your hand
of those that claim their offices this day
by custom of the coronation
the duke of suffolk is the first and claims
to be high steward next the duke of norfolk
he to be earl marshal you may read the rest
second gentleman i thank you sir had i not known
those customs
i should have been beholding to your paper
but i beseech you what's become of katharine
first gentleman that i can tell you too the archbishop
of canterbury accompanied with other
learned and reverend fathers of his order
held a late court at dunstable six miles of
from ampthill where the princess lay to which
she was often cited by them but appear'd not
and to be short for not appearance and
the king's late scruple by the main assent
of all these learned men she was divorc'd
since which she was removed to kimbolton
where she remains now sick
second gentleman alas good lady trumpets
the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming
empty
the order of the coronation
1 a lively flourish of trumpets
2 then two judges
3 lord chancellor with purse and mace before him
5 mayor of london bearing the mace then garter in
his coat of arms and on his head he wore a gilt copper
empty
6 marquis dorset bearing a sceptre of gold on his head a
demi coronal of gold with him the earl of surrey
bearing the rod of silver with the dove crowned with an
earls coronet collars of esses
7 duke of suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet on
his head bearing a long white wand as high steward
marshalship a coronet on his head collars of esses
8 a canopy borne by four of the cinque ports under it
the queen in her robe in her hair richly adorned with
pearl crowned on each side her the bishops of london
and winchester
9 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of gold
wrought with flowers bearing the queens train
10 certain ladies or countesses with plain circlets of gold
without flowers
and then a great flourish of trumpets
second gentleman a royal train believe me these know
who's that that bears the sceptre
first gentleman marquis dorset
and that the earl of surrey with the rod
second gentleman a bold brave gentleman that should be
the duke of suffolk
first gentleman 'tis the same high steward
second gentleman and that my lord of norfolk
second gentleman looking on the queen heaven
bless thee
thou hast the sweetest face i ever look'd on
sir as i have a soul she is an angel
our king has all the indies in his arms
and more and richer when he strains that lady
i cannot blame his conscience
first gentleman they that bear
the cloth of honour over her are four barons
second gentleman those men are happy and so are all
are near her
i take it she that carries up the train
is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk
first gentleman it is and all the rest are countesses
second gentleman their coronets say so these are stars indeed
and sometimes falling ones
first gentleman no more of that
exit procession with a great flourish of trumpets
god save you sir where have you been broiling
third gentleman among the crowds i' th' abbey where a finger
could not be wedg'd in more i am stifled
with the mere rankness of their joy
second gentleman you saw
the ceremony
third gentleman that i did
first gentleman how was it
third gentleman well worth the seeing
third gentleman as well as i am able the rich stream
of lords and ladies having brought the queen
to a prepar'd place in the choir fell of
a distance from her while her grace sat down
to rest awhile some half an hour or so
in a rich chair of state opposing freely
the beauty of her person to the people
believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
that ever lay by man which when the people
as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
doublets i think flew up and had their faces
been loose this day they had been lost such joy
i never saw before great bellied women
that had not half a week to go like rams
in the old time of war would shake the press
and make 'em reel before 'em no man living
could say 'this is my wife' there all were woven
second gentleman but what follow'd
third gentleman at length her grace rose and with
modest paces
came to the altar where she kneeld and saintlike
cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
then rose again and bow'd her to the people
when by the archbishop of canterbury
she had all the royal makings of a queen
as holy oil edward confessor's crown
laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
with all the choicest music of the kingdom
together sung 'te deum' so she parted
and with the same full state pac'd back again
to york place where the feast is held
first gentleman sir
you must no more call it york place that's past
for since the cardinal fell that title's lost
'tis now the king's and called whitehall
but 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name
is fresh about me
second gentleman what two reverend bishops
were those that went on each side of the queen
third gentleman stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester
newly preferr'd from the king's secretary
the other london
second gentleman he of winchester
is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
third gentleman all the land knows that
however yet there is no great breach when it comes
cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
second gentleman who may that be i pray you
third gentleman thomas cromwell
a man in much esteem with th' king and truly
a worthy friend the king has made him master
o' th' jewel house
and one already of the privy council
third gentleman yes without all doubt
come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
is to th' court and there ye shall be my guests
something i can command as i walk thither
i'll tell ye more
both you may command us sir exeunt

enter katharine dowager sick led between griffith her gentleman usher
griffith how does your grace
katharine o griffith sick to death
my legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth
willing to leave their burden reach a chair
so now methinks i feel a little ease
didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led'st me
that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey
was dead
griffith yes madam but i think your grace
katharine prithee good griffith tell me how he died
if well he stepp'd before me happily
for my example
griffith well the voice goes madam
for after the stout earl northumberland
arrested him at york and brought him forward
as a man sorely tainted to his answer
he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
he could not sit his mule
griffith at last with easy roads he came to leicester
lodg'd in the abbey where the reverend abbot
with all his covent honourably receiv'd him
to whom he gave these words 'o father abbot
an old man broken with the storms of state
is come to lay his weary bones among ye
give him a little earth for charity'
so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
pursu'd him still and three nights after this
foretold should be his last full of repentance
continual meditations tears and sorrows
he gave his honours to the world again
his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
katharine so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him
and yet with charity he was a man
of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
himself with princes one that by suggestion
his own opinion was his law i' th' presence
he would say untruths and be ever double
both in his words and meaning he was never
but where he meant to ruin pitiful
his promises were as he then was mighty
but his performance as he is now nothing
of his own body he was ill and gave
the clergy ill example
griffith noble madam
we write in water may it please your highness
to hear me speak his good now
katharine yes good griffith
i were malicious else
griffith this cardinal
though from an humble stock undoubtedly
was fashiond to much honour from his cradle
he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading
but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
and though he were unsatisfied in getting
which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
he was most princely ever witness for him
those twins of learning that he rais'd in you
ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
unwilling to outlive the good that did it
the other though unfinish'd yet so famous
so excellent in art and still so rising
his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
for then and not till then he felt himself
and found the blessedness of being little
and to add greater honours to his age
than man could give him he died fearing god
katharine after my death i wish no other herald
no other speaker of my living actions
to keep mine honour from corruption
but such an honest chronicler as griffith
with thy religious truth and modesty
now in his ashes honour peace be with him
patience be near me still and set me lower
i have not long to trouble thee good griffith
cause the musicians play me that sad note
i nam'd my knell whilst i sit meditating
on that celestial harmony i go to
sad and solemn music
griffith she is asleep good wench let's sit down quiet
the vision
enter solemnly tripping one after another six
personages clad in white robes wearing on their
heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their
faces branches of bays or palm in their hands they
first congee unto her then dance and at certain
changes the first two hold a spare garland over her
head at which the other four make reverent curtsies
then the two that held the garland deliver the
order in their changes and holding the garland over
her head which done they deliver the same garland
to the last two who likewise observe the same order
at which as it were by inspiration she makes
in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her
hands to heaven and so in their dancing vanish
carrying the garland with them the music continues
katharine spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone
and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
katharine it is not you i call for
saw ye none enter since i slept
griffith none madam
katharine no saw you not even now a blessed troop
invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
they promis'd me eternal happiness
and brought me garlands griffith which i feel
i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly
possess your fancy
katharine bid the music leave
they are harsh and heavy to me music ceases
patience do you note
how much her grace is alter'd on the sudden
how long her face is drawn how pale she looks
and of an earthly cold mark her eyes
griffith she is going wench pray pray
patience heaven comfort her
messenger ant like your grace
katharine you are a saucy fellow
deserve we no more reverence
griffith you are to blame
knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
to use so rude behaviour go to kneel
messenger i humbly do entreat your highness' pardon
my haste made me unmannerly there is staying
a gentleman sent from the king to see you
let me ne'er see again exit messenger
enter lord capucius
if my sight fail not
you should be lord ambassador from the emperor
my royal nephew and your name capucius

capucius noble lady
first mine own service to your grace the next
the king's request that i would visit you
who grieves much for your weakness and by me
sends you his princely commendations
and heartily entreats you take good comfort
katharine o my good lord that comfort comes too late
'tis like a pardon after execution
that gentle physic given in time had cur'd me
how does his highness
capucius madam in good health
katharine so may he ever do and ever flourish
when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name
banish'd the kingdom patience is that letter
i caus'd you write yet sent away
patience no madam giving it to katharine
katharine sir i most humbly pray you to deliver
this to my lord the king
katharine in which i have commended to his goodness
the model of our chaste loves his young daughter
the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
she is young and of a noble modest nature
i hope she will deserve well and a little
to love her for her mother's sake that lov'd him
heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition
is that his noble grace would have some pity
have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully
of which there is not one i dare avow
and now i should not lie but will deserve
for virtue and true beauty of the soul
for honesty and decent carriage
a right good husband let him be a noble
and sure those men are happy that shall have 'em
the last is for my men they are the poorest
but poverty could never draw 'em from me
and something over to remember me by
if heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life
and able means we had not parted thus
these are the whole contents and good my lord
by that you love the dearest in this world
as you wish christian peace to souls departed
stand these poor people's friend and urge the king
to do me this last right
capucius by heaven i will
katharine i thank you honest lord remember me
in all humility unto his highness
say his long trouble now is passing
out of this world tell him in death i bless'd him
for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell
my lord griffith farewell nay patience
you must not leave me yet i must to bed
call in more women when i am dead good wench
let me be us'd with honour strew me over
i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me
then lay me forth although unqueend yet like
a queen and daughter to a king inter me
i can no more exeunt leading katharine

pages and footboys
is this the honour they do one another
'tis well there's one above 'em yet i had thought

by holy mary butts there's knavery

a council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed
under the state enter lord chancellor places himself at the upper end
of the table on the left band a seat being left void above him
as for canterbury's seat duke of suffolk duke of norfolk surrey
lord chamberlain gardiner seat themselves in order on each side
cromwell at lower end as secretary keeper at the door
chancellor speak to the business master secretary
cromwell please your honours
the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury
gardiner has he had knowledge of it
cromwell yes
norfolk who waits there
keeper without my noble lords
gardiner yes
keeper my lord archbishop
and has done half an hour to know your pleasures
keeper your grace may enter now
cranmer approaches the council table
chancellor my good lord archbishop i am very sorry
to sit here at this present and behold
that chair stand empty but we all are men
in our own natures frail and capable
of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
have misdemeand yourself and not a little
the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
for so we are inform'd with new opinions
divers and dangerous which are heresies
and not reform'd may prove pernicious
gardiner which reformation must be sudden too
my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle
but stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em
till they obey the manage if we suffer
to one mans honour this contagious sickness
farewell all physic and what follows then
commotions uproars with a general taint
of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
the upper germany can dearly witness
yet freshly pitied in our memories
cranmer my good lords hitherto in all the progress
both of my life and office i have labour'd
and with no little study that my teaching
might go one way and safely and the end
was ever to do well nor is there living
i speak it with a single heart my lords
a man that more detests more stirs against
both in his private conscience and his place
defacers of a public peace than i do
pray heaven the king may never find a heart
with less allegiance in it men that make
envy and crooked malice nourishment
that in this case of justice my accusers
be what they will may stand forth face to face
and freely urge against me
suffolk nay my lord
that cannot be you are a councillor
and by that virtue no man dare accuse you
gardiner my lord because we have business of more moment
we will be short with you 'tis his highness' pleasure
and our consent for better trial of you
where being but a private man again
you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
more than i fear you are provided for
cranmer ah my good lord of winchester i thank you
you are always my good friend if your will pass
i shall both find your lordship judge and juror
you are so merciful i see your end
'tis my undoing love and meekness lord
become a churchman better than ambition
cast none away that i shall clear myself
lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
i make as little doubt as you do conscience
in doing daily wrongs i could say more
but reverence to your calling makes me modest
gardiner my lord my lord you are a sectary
that's the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
to men that understand you words and weakness
cromwell my lord of winchester y'are a little
however faulty yet should find respect
for what they have been 'tis a cruelty
to load a falling man
gardiner good master secretary
i cry your honour mercy you may worst
of all this table say so
cromwell why my lord
gardiner do not i know you for a favourer
of this new sect ye are not sound
gardiner not sound i say
cromwell would you were half so honest
mens prayers then would seek you not their fears
gardiner i shall remember this bold language
cromwell do
remember your bold life too
chancellor this is too much
forbear for shame my lords
gardiner i have done
chancellor then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
i take it by all voices that forthwith
you be convey'd to th' tower a prisoner
there to remain till the king's further pleasure
be known unto us are you all agreed lords
all we are
cranmer is there no other way of mercy
but i must needs to th' tower my lords
gardiner what other
let some o' th' guard be ready there
enter the guard
cranmer for me
must i go like a traitor thither
gardiner receive him
and see him safe i' th' tower
cranmer stay good my lords
i have a little yet to say look there my lords
by virtue of that ring i take my cause
to a most noble judge the king my master
chamberlain this is the king's ring
surrey 'tis no counterfeit
suffolk 'tis the right ring by heav'n i told ye all
when we first put this dangerous stone a rolling
'twould fall upon ourselves
norfolk do you think my lords
the king will suffer but the little finger
of this man to be vex'd
how much more is his life in value with him
would i were fairly out ont
cromwell my mind gave me
in seeking tales and informations
against this man whose honesty the devil
and his disciples only envy at
ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
enter the king frowning on them he takes his seat
gardiner dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
not only good and wise but most religious
one that in all obedience makes the church
the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
that holy duty out of dear respect
his royal self in judgment comes to hear
the cause betwixt her and this great offender
king you were ever good at sudden commendations
bishop of winchester but know i come not
to hear such flattery now and in my presence
to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
but whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for i'm sure
thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
to cranmer good man sit down now let me see the proudest
he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
by all that's holy he had better starve
than but once think this place becomes thee not
surrey may it please your grace
i had thought i had had men of some understanding
and wisdom of my council but i find none
was it discretion lords to let this man
this good man few of you deserve that title
this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
at chamber door and one as great as you are
why what a shame was this did my commission
bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye
power as he was a councillor to try him
more out of malice than integrity
would try him to the utmost had ye mean
which ye shall never have while i live
chancellor thus far
my most dread sovereign may it like your grace
to let my tongue excuse all what was purpos'd
concerning his imprisonment was rather
if there be faith in men meant for his trial
and fair purgation to the world than malice
king well well my lords respect him
take him and use him well he's worthy of it
i will say thus much for him if a prince
may be beholding to a subject
am for his love and service so to him
make me no more ado but all embrace him
be friends for shame my lords my lord of canterbury
i have a suit which you must not deny me
that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
cranmer the greatest monarch now alive may glory
in such an honour how may i deserve it
that am a poor and humble subject to you
king come come my lord you'd spare your spoons you
shall have
two noble partners with you the old duchess of norfolk
and lady marquis dorset will these please you
once more my lord of winchester i charge you
embrace and love this man
and brother love i do it
cranmer and let heaven
witness how dear i hold this confirmation
king good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
the common voice i see is verified
of thee which says thus 'do my lord of canterbury
a shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever'

empty
what men are you
bastard your faithful subject i a gentleman
born in northamptonshire and eldest son
as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
of coeur de lion knighted in the field
king john what art thou
robert the son and heir to that same faulconbridge
king john is that the elder and art thou the heir
you came not of one mother then it seems
bastard most certain of one mother mighty king
that is well known and as i think one father
but for the certain knowledge of that truth
i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
elinor out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
and wound her honour with this diffidence
bastard i madam no i have no reason for it
that is my brother's plea and none of mine
the which if he can prove 'a pops me out
at least from fair five hundred pound a year
heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
king john a good blunt fellow why being younger born
doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
but once he slander'd me with bastardy
but whe'er i be as true begot or no
that still i lay upon my mother's head
but that i am as well begot my liege
fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
compare our faces and be judge yourself
if old sir robert did beget us both
and were our father and this son like him
o old sir robert father on my knee
king john why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
elinor he hath a trick of coeur de lions face
the accent of his tongue affecteth him
do you not read some tokens of my son
in the large composition of this man
king john mine eye hath well examined his parts
and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak
what doth move you to claim your brother's land
bastard because he hath a half face like my father
a half fac'd groat five hundred pound a year
robert my gracious liege when that my father liv'd
your brother did employ my father much
bastard well sir by this you cannot get my land
your tale must be how he employ'd my mother
robert and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
to germany there with the emperor
to treat of high affairs touching that time
th' advantage of his absence took the king
where how he did prevail i shame to speak
but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
between my father and my mother lay
as i have heard my father speak himself
when this same lusty gentleman was got
upon his death bed he by will bequeath'd
his lands to me and took it on his death
that this my mother's son was none of his
and if he were he came into the world
then good my liege let me have what is mine
my father's land as was my father's will
king john sirrah your brother is legitimate
your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
and if she did play false the fault was hers
which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
that marry wives tell me how if my brother
who as you say took pains to get this son
had of your father claim'd this son for his
this calf bred from his cow from all the world
in sooth he might then if he were my brother's
my brother might not claim him nor your father
being none of his refuse him this concludes
my mother's son did get your father's heir
your father's heir must have your father's land
robert shall then my father's will be of no force
to dispossess that child which is not his
bastard of no more force to dispossess me sir
elinor whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
or the reputed son of coeur de lion
lord of thy presence and no land beside
bastard madam an if my brother had my shape
and i had his sir robert's his like him
and if my legs were two such riding rods
my arms such eel skins stuff'd my face so thin
that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
and to his shape were heir to all this land
would i might never stir from off this place
i would give it every foot to have this face
i would not be sir nob in any case
elinor i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
bequeath thy land to him and follow me
i am a soldier and now bound to france
bastard brother take you my land i'll take my chance
your face hath got five hundred pound a year
madam i'll follow you unto the death
elinor nay i would have you go before me thither
bastard our country manners give our betters way
king john what is thy name
bastard philip my liege so is my name begun
philip good old sir robert's wife's eldest son
king john from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest
kneel thou down philip but rise more great
arise sir richard and plantagenet
my father gave me honour yours gave land
now blessed be the hour by night or day
when i was got sir robert was away
elinor the very spirit of plantagenet
i am thy grandam richard call me so
bastard madam by chance but not by truth what though
something about a little from the right
in at the window or else o'er the hatch
who dares not stir by day must walk by night
near or far off well won is still well shot
and i am i howe'er i was begot
king john go faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
come madam and come richard we must speed
for france for france for it is more than need
bastard brother adieu good fortune come to thee
for thou wast got i' th' way of honesty
exeunt all but the bastard
but many a many foot of land the worse
well now can i make any joan a lady
'good den sir richard' 'god a mercy fellow'
and if his name be george i'll call him peter
for new made honour doth forget mens names
'tis too respective and too sociable
for your conversion now your traveller
he and his toothpick at my worship's mess
and when my knightly stomach is suffic'd
my picked man of countries 'my dear sir'
thus leaning on mine elbow i begin
'i shall beseech you' that is question now
and then comes answer like an absey book
'o sir' says answer 'at your best command
at your employment at your service sir'
'no sir' says question 'i sweet sir at yours'
and so ere answer knows what question would
saving in dialogue of compliment
the pyrenean and the river po
it draws toward supper in conclusion so
but this is worshipful society
and fits the mounting spirit like myself
for he is but a bastard to the time
that doth not smack of observation
and so am i whether i smack or no
and not alone in habit and device
exterior form outward accoutrement
sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
which though i will not practise to deceive
yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn
for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
but who comes in such haste in riding robes
what woman post is this hath she no husband
that will take pains to blow a horn before her
enter lady faulconbridge and james gurney

bastard philip sparrow james

upon good friday and ne'er broke his fast
sir robert could do well marry to confess
could he get me sir robert could not do it
to whom am i beholding for these limbs
sir robert never holp to make this leg
lady faulconbridge hast thou conspired with thy brother too
that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
what means this scorn thou most untoward knave
bastard knight knight good mother basilisco like
what i am dubb'd i have it on my shoulder
but mother i am not sir robert's son
i have disclaim'd sir robert and my land
then good my mother let me know my father
some proper man i hope who was it mother
lady faulconbridge hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge
bastard as faithfully as i deny the devil
lady faulconbridge king richard coeur de lion was thy father
by long and vehement suit i was seduc'd
to make room for him in my husband's bed
heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
thou art the issue of my dear offence
bastard now by this light were i to get again
madam i would not wish a better father
some sins do bear their privilege on earth
and so doth yours your fault was not your folly
needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
subjected tribute to commanding love
against whose fury and unmatched force

king philip before angiers well met brave austria
arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
richard that robb'd the lion of his heart
and fought the holy wars in palestine
by this brave duke came early to his grave
and for amends to his posterity
at our importance hither is he come
and to rebuke the usurpation
of thy unnatural uncle english john
embrace him love him give him welcome hither
arthur god shall forgive you coeur de lions death
the rather that you give his offspring life
shadowing their right under your wings of war
i give you welcome with a powerless hand
but with a heart full of unstained love
welcome before the gates of angiers duke
austria upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
as seal to this indenture of my love
that to my home i will no more return
till angiers and the right thou hast in france
together with that pale that white fac'd shore
whose foot spurns back the oceans roaring tides
and coops from other lands her islanders
even till that england hedg'd in with the main
that water walled bulwark still secure
even till that utmost corner of the west
salute thee for her king till then fair boy
will i not think of home but follow arms
constance o take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks
till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
to make a more requital to your love
austria the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
in such a just and charitable war
king philip well then to work our cannon shall be bent
call for our chiefest men of discipline
to cull the plots of best advantages
we'll lay before this town our royal bones
wade to the market place in frenchmens blood
but we will make it subject to this boy
constance stay for an answer to your embassy
lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood
my lord chatillon may from england bring
that right in peace which here we urge in war
that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
enter chatillon
king philip a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
our messenger chatillon is arriv'd
what england says say briefly gentle lord
we coldly pause for thee chatillon speak
chatillon then turn your forces from this paltry siege
and stir them up against a mightier task
england impatient of your just demands
whose leisure i have stay'd have given him time
to land his legions all as soon as i
his marches are expedient to this town
his forces strong his soldiers confident
with him along is come the mother queen
an ate stirring him to blood and strife
with her the lady blanch of spain
with them a bastard of the king's deceas'd
and all th' unsettled humours of the land
with ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens
have sold their fortunes at their native homes
bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
to make a hazard of new fortunes here
in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
than now the english bottoms have waft o'er
did never float upon the swelling tide
to do offence and scathe in christendom drum beats
the interruption of their churlish drums
to parley or to fight therefore prepare
king philip how much unlook'd for is this expedition
austria by how much unexpected by so much
we must awake endeavour for defence
for courage mounteth with occasion
let them be welcome then we are prepar'd
enter king john elinor blanch the bastard
pembroke and others
king john peace be to france if france in peace permit
if not bleed france and peace ascend to heaven
whiles we god's wrathful agent do correct
their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven
king philip peace be to england if that war return
from france to england there to live in peace
england we love and for that england's sake
with burden of our armour here we sweat
this toil of ours should be a work of thine
but thou from loving england art so far
cut off the sequence of posterity
outfaced infant state and done a rape
upon the maiden virtue of the crown
look here upon thy brother geffrey's face
these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
this little abstract doth contain that large
which died in geffrey and the hand of time
shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
that geffrey was thy elder brother born
and this is geffrey's in the name of god
how comes it then that thou art calld a king
when living blood doth in these temples beat
which owe the crown that thou o'er masterest
king john from whom hast thou this great commission france
to draw my answer from thy articles
king philip from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
in any breast of strong authority
to look into the blots and stains of right
under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
and by whose help i mean to chastise it
king john alack thou dost usurp authority
king philip excuse it is to beat usurping down
elinor who is it thou dost call usurper france
constance let me make answer thy usurping son
elinor out insolent thy bastard shall be king
that thou mayst be a queen and check the world
constance my bed was ever to thy son as true
liker in feature to his father geffrey
than thou and john in manners being as eke
as rain to water or devil to his dam
my boy a bastard by my soul i think
his father never was so true begot
it cannot be an if thou wert his mother
elinor there's a good mother boy that blots thy father
constance there's a good grandam boy that would blot thee
austria peace
austria what the devil art thou
bastard one that will play the devil sir with you
an 'a may catch your hide and you alone
you are the hare of whom the proverb goes
whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
i'll smoke your skin coat an i catch you right
sirrah look to 't i' faith i will i' faith
blanch o well did he become that lions robe
that did disrobe the lion of that robe
as great alcides' shows upon an ass
but ass i'll take that burden from your back
or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
austria what cracker is this same that deafs our ears
with this abundance of superfluous breath
king philip determine what we shall do straight
king philip women and fools break off your conference
king john this is the very sum of all
england and ireland anjou touraine maine
wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
king john my life as soon i do defy thee france
arthur of britaine yield thee to my hand
and out of my dear love i'll give thee more
than e'er the coward hand of france can win
submit thee boy
elinor come to thy grandam child
constance do child go to it grandam child
give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
there's a good grandam
arthur good my mother peace
i would that i were low laid in my grave
i am not worth this coil that's made for me
elinor his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
constance now shame upon you whe'er she does or no
his grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames
draws those heaven moving pearls from his poor eyes
which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
to do him justice and revenge on you
elinor thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
constance thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
the dominations royalties and rights
of this oppressed boy this is thy eldest sons son
infortunate in nothing but in thee
thy sins are visited in this poor child
the canon of the law is laid on him
removed from thy sin conceiving womb
king john bedlam have done
constance i have but this to say
that he is not only plagued for her sin
but god hath made her sin and her the plague
on this removed issue plagued for her
and with her plague her sin his injury
her injury the beadle to her sin
all punish'd in the person of this child
elinor thou unadvised scold i can produce
a will that bars the title of thy son
constance ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
a womans will a cank'red grandam's will
king philip peace lady pause or be more temperate
it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
to these ill tuned repetitions
some trumpet summon hither to the walls
these men of angiers let us hear them speak
trumpet sounds enter citizens upon the walls
citizen who is it that hath warnd us to the walls
king philip 'tis france for england
king john england for itself
you men of angiers and my loving subjects
king philip you loving men of angiers arthur's subjects
our trumpet calld you to this gentle parle
king john for our advantage therefore hear us first
these flags of france that are advanced here
have hither march'd to your endamagement
the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
and ready mounted are they to spit forth
their iron indignation 'gainst your walls
all preparation for a bloody siege
and merciless proceeding by these french
confront your city's eyes your winking gates
and but for our approach those sleeping stones
that as a waist doth girdle you about
by this time from their fixed beds of lime
had been dishabited and wide havoc made
for bloody power to rush upon your peace
but on the sight of us your lawful king
who painfully with much expedient march
have brought a countercheck before your gates
to save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned cheeks
behold the french amaz'd vouchsafe a parle
and now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
to make a faithless error in your cars
which trust accordingly kind citizens
and let us in your king whose labour'd spirits
forwearied in this action of swift speed
craves harbourage within your city walls
king philip when i have said make answer to us both
lo in this right hand whose protection
is most divinely vow'd upon the right
son to the elder brother of this man
and king o'er him and all that he enjoys
for this down trodden equity we tread
in warlike march these greens before your town
being no further enemy to you
than the constraint of hospitable zeal
in the relief of this oppressed child
religiously provokes be pleased then
to pay that duty which you truly owe
and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
save in aspect hath all offence seald up
our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven
and with a blessed and unvex'd retire
with unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd
we will bear home that lusty blood again
which here we came to spout against your town
and leave your children wives and you in peace
'tis not the roundure of your old fac'd walls
can hide you from our messengers of war
though all these english and their discipline
were harbour'd in their rude circumference
then tell us shall your city call us lord
in that behalf which we have challeng'd it
or shall we give the signal to our rage
and stalk in blood to our possession
citizen in brief we are the king of england's subjects
king john acknowledge then the king and let me in
citizen that can we not but he that proves the king
to him will we prove loyal till that time
have we ramm'd up our gates against the world
king john doth not the crown of england prove the king
and if not that i bring you witnesses
twice fifteen thousand hearts of england's breed
bastard bastards and else
king john to verify our title with their lives
bastard some bastards too
king philip stand in his face to contradict his claim
citizen till you compound whose right is worthiest
we for the worthiest hold the right from both
king john then god forgive the sin of all those souls
that to their everlasting residence
before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
in dreadful trial of our kingdom's king
king philip amen amen mount chevaliers to arms
sits ons horse back at mine hostess' door
teach us some fence to austria sirrah were i at home
at your den sirrah with your lioness
i would set an ox head to your lions hide
and make a monster of you
austria peace no more
bastard o tremble for you hear the lion roar
king john up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
in best appointment all our regiments
king philip it shall be so and at the other hill
command the rest to stand god and our right exeunt
here after excursions enter the herald of france
with trumpets to the gates
french herald you men of angiers open wide your gates
and let young arthur duke of britaine in
who by the hand of france this day hath made
much work for tears in many an english mother
whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
coldly embracing the discoloured earth
and victory with little loss doth play
upon the dancing banners of the french
who are at hand triumphantly displayed
to enter conquerors and to proclaim
arthur of britaine england's king and yours
enter english herald with trumpet
english herald rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
king john your king and england's doth approach
their armours that march'd hence so silver bright
hither return all gilt with frenchmens blood
there stuck no plume in any english crest
that is removed by a staff of france
our colours do return in those same hands
that did display them when we first march'd forth
and like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
our lusty english all with purpled hands
dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes
citizen heralds from off our tow'rs we might behold
from first to last the onset and retire
of both your armies whose equality
by our best eyes cannot be censured
blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows
strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
both are alike and both alike we like
one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
we hold our town for neither yet for both
king john france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
say shall the current of our right run on
whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
with course disturb'd even thy confining shores
unless thou let his silver water keep
a peaceful progress to the ocean
king philip england thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
in this hot trial more than we of france
that sways the earth this climate overlooks
before we will lay down our just borne arms
we'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms we bear
or add a royal number to the dead
gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
with slaughter coupled to the name of kings
bastard ha majesty how high thy glory tow'rs
when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
in undetermind differences of kings
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
cry 'havoc' kings back to the stained field
you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
then let confusion of one part confirm
the other's peace till then blows blood and death
king john whose party do the townsmen yet admit
king philip speak citizens for england who's your king
king philip know him in us that here hold up his right
king john in us that are our own great deputy
and bear possession of our person here
lord of our presence angiers and of you
citizen a greater pow'r than we denies all this
and till it be undoubted we do lock
our former scruple in our strong barr'd gates
king'd of our fears until our fears resolv'd
be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd
and stand securely on their battlements
as in a theatre whence they gape and point
at your industrious scenes and acts of death
your royal presences be ruld by me
do like the mutines of jerusalem
be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
by east and west let france and england mount
their battering cannon charged to the mouths
the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
i'd play incessantly upon these jades
even till unfenced desolation
leave them as naked as the vulgar air
that done dissever your united strengths
and part your mingled colours once again
turn face to face and bloody point to point
then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
out of one side her happy minion
and kiss him with a glorious victory
how like you this wild counsel mighty states
smacks it not something of the policy
king john now by the sky that hangs above our heads
i like it well france shall we knit our pow'rs
and lay this angiers even with the ground
then after fight who shall be king of it
bastard an if thou hast the mettle of a king
being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town
as we will ours against these saucy walls
and when that we have dash'd them to the ground
why then defy each other and pell mell
make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
king philip let it be so say where will you assault
king john we from the west will send destruction
into this city's bosom
austria i from the north
king philip our thunder from the south
bastard aside o prudent discipline from north to south
austria and france shoot in each other's mouth
i'll stir them to it come away away
citizen hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
and i shall show you peace and fair fac'd league
win you this city without stroke or wound
rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
that here come sacrifices for the field
persever not but hear me mighty kings
citizen that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
is niece to england look upon the years
of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
where should he find it fairer than in blanch
if zealous love should go in search of virtue
where should he find it purer than in blanch
if love ambitious sought a match of birth
whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
is the young dauphin every way complete
if not complete of say he is not she
and she again wants nothing to name want
if want it be not that she is not he
he is the half part of a blessed man
left to be finished by such as she
and she a fair divided excellence
whose fulness of perfection lies in him
o two such silver currents when they join
and two such shores to two such streams made one
two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
to these two princes if you marry them
this union shall do more than battery can
to our fast closed gates for at this match
with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
and give you entrance but without this match
the sea enraged is not half so deaf
more free from motion no not death himself
in mortal fury half so peremptory
as we to keep this city
bastard here's a stay
that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
out of his rags here's a large mouth indeed
that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
talks as familiarly of roaring lions
as maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs
he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
he gives the bastinado with his tongue
our ears are cudgelld not a word of his
but buffets better than a fist of france
zounds i was never so bethump'd with words
since i first calld my brother's father dad
elinor son list to this conjunction make this match
give with our niece a dowry large enough
for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
i see a yielding in the looks of france
mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
are capable of this ambition
lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
of soft petitions pity and remorse
cool and congeal again to what it was
citizen why answer not the double majesties
king philip speak england first that hath been forward first
to speak unto this city what say you
king john if that the dauphin there thy princely son
can in this book of beauty read 'i love'
her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
and all that we upon this side the sea
except this city now by us besieg'd
find liable to our crown and dignity
in titles honours and promotions
as she in beauty education blood
holds hand with any princess of the world
king philip what say'st thou boy look in the lady's face
lewis i do my lord and in her eye i find
a wonder or a wondrous miracle
the shadow of myself form'd in her eye
which being but the shadow of your son
becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
till now infixed i beheld myself
drawn in the flattering table of her eye
whispers with blanch
bastard aside drawn in the flattering table of her eye
hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
and quarter'd in her heart he doth espy
himself love's traitor this is pity now
that hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be
in such a love so vile a lout as he
if he see aught in you that makes him like
that anything he sees which moves his liking
i can with ease translate it to my will
or if you will to speak more properly
i will enforce it eas'ly to my love
further i will not flatter you my lord
that all i see in you is worthy love
than this that nothing do i see in you
though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
king john what say these young ones what say you my niece
blanch that she is bound in honour still to do
what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
king john speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
lewis nay ask me if i can refrain from love
for i do love her most unfeignedly
king john then do i give volquessen touraine maine
poictiers and anjou these five provinces
with her to thee and this addition more
philip of france if thou be pleas'd withal
command thy son and daughter to join hands
king philip it likes us well young princes close your hands
austria and your lips too for i am well assur'd
that i did so when i was first assur'd
king philip now citizens of angiers ope your gates
let in that amity which you have made
for at saint mary's chapel presently
the rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd
i know she is not for this match made up
her presence would have interrupted much
where is she and her son tell me who knows
lewis she is sad and passionate at your highness' tent
king philip and by my faith this league that we have made
will give her sadness very little cure
brother of england how may we content
this widow lady in her right we came
which we god knows have turnd another way
king john we will heal up all
for we'll create young arthur duke of britaine
and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
we make him lord of call the lady constance
some speedy messenger bid her repair
to our solemnity i trust we shall
if not fill up the measure of her will
yet in some measure satisfy her so
that we shall stop her exclamation
to this unlook'd for unprepared pomp
exeunt all but the bastard
bastard mad world mad kings mad composition
john to stop arthur's tide in the whole
hath willingly departed with a part
and france whose armour conscience buckled on
whom zeal and charity brought to the field
as god's own soldier rounded in the ear
with that same purpose changer that sly devil
that daily break vow he that wins of all
of kings of beggars old men young men maids
who having no external thing to lose
but the word 'maid' cheats the poor maid of that
that smooth fac'd gentleman tickling commodity
commodity the bias of the world
the world who of itself is peised well
made to run even upon even ground
till this advantage this vile drawing bias
makes it take head from all indifferency
from all direction purpose course intent
and this same bias this commodity
this bawd this broker this all changing word
clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle france
hath drawn him from his own determind aid
from a resolv'd and honourable war
to a most base and vile concluded peace
and why rail i on this commodity
not that i have the power to clutch my hand
when his fair angels would salute my palm
but for my hand as unattempted yet
like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
and say there is no sin but to be rich
and being rich my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary
since kings break faith upon commodity
act iii scene 1
france the french king's camp
enter constance arthur and salisbury
constance gone to be married gone to swear a peace
false blood to false blood joind gone to be friends
shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
be well advis'd tell o'er thy tale again
it cannot be thou dost but say 'tis so
is but the vain breath of a common man
believe me i do not believe thee man
i have a king's oath to the contrary
thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
for i am sick and capable of fears
oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
a widow husbandless subject to fears
a woman naturally born to fears
and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
but they will quake and tremble all this day
what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
why dost thou look so sadly on my son
what means that hand upon that breast of thine
why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
then speak again not all thy former tale
but this one word whether thy tale be true
that give you cause to prove my saying true
constance o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
and let belief and life encounter so
as doth the fury of two desperate men
which in the very meeting fall and die
lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
france friend with england what becomes of me
fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight
salisbury what other harm have i good lady done
but spoke the harm that is by others done
constance which harm within itself so heinous is
as it makes harmful all that speak of it
arthur i do beseech you madam be content
constance if thou that bid'st me be content wert grim
ugly and sland'rous to thy mother's womb
full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
i would not care i then would be content
for then i should not love thee no nor thou
become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
nature and fortune joind to make thee great
of nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
and with the half blown rose but fortune o
she is corrupted chang'd and won from thee
sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle john
to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
france is a bawd to fortune and king john
that strumpet fortune that usurping john
tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
envenom him with words or get thee gone
and leave those woes alone which i alone
am bound to under bear
salisbury pardon me madam
constance thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
to me and to the state of my great grief
let kings assemble for my grief's so great
that no supporter but the huge firm earth
can hold it up seats herself on the ground
here i and sorrows sit
here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
elinor the bastard austria and attendants
king philip 'tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
ever in france shall be kept festival
to solemnize this day the glorious sun
stays in his course and plays the alchemist
turning with splendour of his precious eye
the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
the yearly course that brings this day about
shall never see it but a holiday
what hath this day deserv'd what hath it done
that it in golden letters should be set
among the high tides in the calendar
nay rather turn this day out of the week
this day of shame oppression perjury
or if it must stand still let wives with child
pray that their burdens may not fall this day
lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
this day all things begun come to ill end
yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
king philip by heaven lady you shall have no cause
to curse the fair proceedings of this day
have i not pawnd to you my majesty
constance you have beguild me with a counterfeit
resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
you came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood
the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
is cold in amity and painted peace
and our oppression hath made up this league
arm arm you heavens against these perjur'd kings
a widow cries be husband to me heavens
let not the hours of this ungodly day
wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings
hear me o hear me
constance war war no peace peace is to me a war
o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
thou little valiant great in villainy
thou ever strong upon the stronger side
thou fortune's champion that dost never fight
but when her humorous ladyship is by
to teach thee safety thou art perjur'd too
and sooth'st up greatness what a fool art thou
upon my party thou cold blooded slave
hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
and dost thou now fall over to my foes
thou wear a lions hide doff it for shame
and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs
austria o that a man should speak those words to me
bastard and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs
bastard and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs
king john we like not this thou dost forget thyself
enter pandulph
king philip here comes the holy legate of the pope
pandulph hail you anointed deputies of heaven
to thee king john my holy errand is
i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
and from pope innocent the legate here
do in his name religiously demand
so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
of canterbury from that holy see
this in our foresaid holy father's name
pope innocent i do demand of thee
king john what earthly name to interrogatories
can task the free breath of a sacred king
thou canst not cardinal devise a name
so slight unworthy and ridiculous
tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
add thus much more that no italian priest
shall tithe or toll in our dominions
but as we under heaven are supreme head
so under him that great supremacy
where we do reign we will alone uphold
without th' assistance of a mortal hand
so tell the pope all reverence set apart
to him and his usurp'd authority
king john though you and all the kings of christendom
are led so grossly by this meddling priest
dreading the curse that money may buy out
and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
purchase corrupted pardon of a man
who in that sale sells pardon from himself
though you and all the rest so grossly led
this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
yet i alone alone do me oppose
pandulph then by the lawful power that i have
thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate
and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
from his allegiance to an heretic
and meritorious shall that hand be calld
canonized and worshipp'd as a saint
that takes away by any secret course
thy hateful life
constance o lawful let it be
good father cardinal cry thou 'amen
to my keen curses for without my wrong
there is no tongue hath power to curse him right
pandulph there's law and warrant lady for my curse
constance and for mine too when law can do no right
let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
law cannot give my child his kingdom here
for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
pandulph philip of france on peril of a curse
let go the hand of that arch heretic
and raise the power of france upon his head
unless he do submit himself to rome
elinor look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand
constance look to that devil lest that france repent
and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
austria king philip listen to the cardinal
bastard and hang a calf's skin on his recreant limbs
empty
bastard your breeches best may carry them
king john philip what say'st thou to the cardinal
constance what should he say but as the cardinal
lewis bethink you father for the difference
is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
or the light loss of england for a friend
forgo the easier
blanch that's the curse of rome
in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
blanch the lady constance speaks not from her faith
but from her need
constance o if thou grant my need
which only lives but by the death of faith
that need must needs infer this principle
that faith would live again by death of need
o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
keep my need up and faith is trodden down
constance o be remov'd from him and answer well
austria do so king philip hang no more in doubt
bastard hang nothing but a calf's skin most sweet lout
king philip i am perplex'd and know not what to say
pandulph what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
if thou stand excommunicate and curs'd
king philip good reverend father make my person yours
and tell me how you would bestow yourself
this royal hand and mine are newly knit
married in league coupled and link'd together
with all religious strength of sacred vows
the latest breath that gave the sound of words
was deep sworn faith peace amity true love
between our kingdoms and our royal selves
and even before this truce but new before
no longer than we well could wash our hands
to clap this royal bargain up of peace
heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstaind
the fearful difference of incensed kings
and shall these hands so lately purg'd of blood
so newly joind in love so strong in both
unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
make such unconstant children of ourselves
as now again to snatch our palm from palm
unswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed
of smiling peace to march a bloody host
of true sincerity o holy sir
my reverend father let it not be so
out of your grace devise ordain impose
some gentle order and then we shall be blest
to do your pleasure and continue friends
pandulph all form is formless order orderless
save what is opposite to england's love
therefore to arms be champion of our church
or let the church our mother breathe her curse
france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
a chafed lion by the mortal paw
a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith
pandulph so mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith
and like a civil war set'st oath to oath
thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
what since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
and may not be performed by thyself
for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
is not amiss when it is truly done
and being not done where doing tends to ill
the truth is then most done not doing it
the better act of purposes mistook
is to mistake again though indirect
yet indirection thereby grows direct
within the scorched veins of one new burnd
it is religion that doth make vows kept
but thou hast sworn against religion
by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
and mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
against an oath the truth thou art unsure
to swear swears only not to be forsworn
else what a mockery should it be to swear
but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
therefore thy later vows against thy first
is in thyself rebellion to thyself
and better conquest never canst thou make
than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
against these giddy loose suggestions
upon which better part our pray'rs come in
if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
the peril of our curses fight on thee
so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
austria rebellion flat rebellion
bastard willt not be
will not a calf's skin stop that mouth of thine
lewis father to arms
blanch upon thy wedding day
against the blood that thou hast married
what shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men
shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
is 'husband' in my mouth even for that name
which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce
upon my knee i beg go not to arms
against mine uncle
constance o upon my knee
made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee
thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom
forethought by heaven
blanch now shall i see thy love what motive may
constance that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour
lewis i muse your majesty doth seem so cold
when such profound respects do pull you on
pandulph i will denounce a curse upon his head
king philip thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee
constance o fair return of banish'd majesty
elinor o foul revolt of french inconstancy
king john france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
is it as he will well then france shall rue
blanch the suns o'ercast with blood fair day adieu
which is the side that i must go withal
i am with both each army hath a hand
and in their rage i having hold of both
they whirl asunder and dismember me
husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win
uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose
father i may not wish the fortune thine
whoever wins on that side shall i lose
assured loss before the match be play'd
lewis lady with me with me thy fortune lies
blanch there where my fortune lives there my life dies
king john cousin go draw our puissance together
exit bastard
france i am burnd up with inflaming wrath
a rage whose heat hath this condition
that nothing can allay nothing but blood
king philip thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn
to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
look to thyself thou art in jeopardy
king john no more than he that threats to arms let's hie
exeunt severally

and pours down mischief austria's head lie there

alarums excursions retreat enter king john elinor arthur
the bastard hubert and lords
king john to elinor so shall it be your grace shall stay
empty
so strongly guarded to arthur cousin look not sad
thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will
as dear be to thee as thy father was
king john to the bastard cousin away for england haste
empty
and ere our coming see thou shake the bags
of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels
set at liberty the fat ribs of peace
must by the hungry now be fed upon
use our commission in his utmost force
bastard bell book and candle shall not drive me back
when gold and silver becks me to come on
if ever i remember to be holy
for your fair safety so i kiss your hand
elinor farewell gentle cousin
king john coz farewell
exit bastard
elinor come hither little kinsman hark a word
king john come hither hubert o my gentle hubert
we owe thee much within this wall of flesh
there is a soul counts thee her creditor
and my good friend thy voluntary oath
lives in this bosom dearly cherished
give me thy hand i had a thing to say
but i will fit it with some better time
by heaven hubert i am almost asham'd
to say what good respect i have of thee
hubert i am much bounden to your majesty
king john good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow
i had a thing to say but let it go
the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
attended with the pleasures of the world
is all too wanton and too full of gawds
to give me audience if the midnight bell
did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
sound on into the drowsy race of night
if this same were a churchyard where we stand
and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy thick
which else runs tickling up and down the veins
making that idiot laughter keep mens eyes
and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
a passion hateful to my purposes
or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
hear me without thine cars and make reply
without a tongue using conceit alone
without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
but ah i will not yet i love thee well
and by my troth i think thou lov'st me well
hubert so well that what you bid me undertake
though that my death were adjunct to my act
by heaven i would do it
king john do not i know thou wouldst
good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye
on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend
and wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread
he lies before me dost thou understand me
thou art his keeper
hubert and i'll keep him so
that he shall not offend your majesty
king john death
hubert my lord
king john a grave
hubert he shall not live
i could be merry now hubert i love thee
well i'll not say what i intend for thee
remember madam fare you well
i'll send those powers o'er to your majesty
elinor my blessing go with thee
king john to arthur for england cousin go
hubert shall be your man attend on you
with all true duty on toward calais ho exeunt
scene 4
enter king philip lewis pandulph and attendants
king philip so by a roaring tempest on the flood
a whole armado of convicted sail
is scattered and disjoind from fellowship
pandulph courage and comfort all shall yet go well
king philip what can go well when we have run so ill
are we not beaten is not angiers lost
arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain
and bloody england into england gone
lewis he hath won that hath he fortified
so hot a speed with such advice dispos'd
such temperate order in so fierce a cause
doth want example who hath read or heard
of any kindred action like to this
king philip well could i bear that england had this praise
so we could find some pattern of our shame
enter constance
look who comes here a grave unto a soul
in the vile prison of afflicted breath
i prithee lady go away with me
constance lo now now see the issue of your peace
king philip patience good lady comfort gentle constance
constance no i defy all counsel all redress
but that which ends all counsel true redress
death death o amiable lovely death
thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness
arise forth from the couch of lasting night
and i will kiss thy detestable bones
and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
and ring these fingers with thy household worms
and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
and be a carrion monster like thyself
come grin on me and i will think thou smilst
and buss thee as thy wife misery's love
o come to me
king philip o fair affliction peace
o that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
then with a passion would i shake the world
and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
which scorns a modern invocation
pandulph lady you utter madness and not sorrow
constance thou art not holy to belie me so
i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
my name is constance i was geffrey's wife
i am not mad i would to heaven i were
for then 'tis like i should forget myself
o if i could what grief should i forget
preach some philosophy to make me mad
and thou shalt be canoniz'd cardinal
for being not mad but sensible of grief
my reasonable part produces reason
how i may be deliver'd of these woes
and teaches me to kill or hang myself
or madly think a babe of clouts were he
i am not mad too well too well i feel
the different plague of each calamity
king philip bind up those tresses o what love i note
in the fair multitude of those her hairs
where but by a chance a silver drop hath falln
even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
do glue themselves in sociable grief
like true inseparable faithful loves
constance to england if you will
king philip bind up your hairs
constance yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
'o that these hands could so redeem my son
as they have given these hairs their liberty'
but now i envy at their liberty
and will again commit them to their bonds
because my poor child is a prisoner
that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
if that be true i shall see my boy again
for since the birth of cain the first male child
to him that did but yesterday suspire
there was not such a gracious creature born
but now will canker sorrow eat my bud
and chase the native beauty from his cheek
and he will look as hollow as a ghost
as dim and meagre as an ague's fit
when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
i shall not know him therefore never never
must i behold my pretty arthur more
pandulph you hold too heinous a respect of grief
constance he talks to me that never had a son
king philip you are as fond of grief as of your child
constance grief fills the room up of my absent child
lies in his bed walks up and down with me
puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
then have i reason to be fond of grief
fare you well had you such a loss as i
i could give better comfort than you do
i will not keep this form upon my head
tearing her hair
when there is such disorder in my wit
o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
my life my joy my food my ail the world
king philip i fear some outrage and i'll follow her exit
lewis there's nothing in this world can make me joy
life is as tedious as a twice told tale
vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
and bitter shame hath spoild the sweet world's taste
that it yields nought but shame and bitterness
pandulph before the curing of a strong disease
even in the instant of repair and health
the fit is strongest evils that take leave
what have you lost by losing of this day
lewis all days of glory joy and happiness
pandulph if you had won it certainly you had
no no when fortune means to men most good
she looks upon them with a threat'ning eye
'tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
in this which he accounts so clearly won
are not you griev'd that arthur is his prisoner
lewis as heartily as he is glad he hath him
now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
for even the breath of what i mean to speak
shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
out of the path which shall directly lead
thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark
john hath seiz'd arthur and it cannot be
that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
the misplac'd john should entertain an hour
one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
must be boisterously maintaind as gaind
and he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
so be it for it cannot be but so
lewis but what shall i gain by young arthur's fall
pandulph you in the right of lady blanch your wife
may then make all the claim that arthur did
lewis and lose it life and all as arthur did
john lays you plots the times conspire with you
for he that steeps his safety in true blood
shall find but bloody safety and untrue
this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
of all his people and freeze up their zeal
that none so small advantage shall step forth
to check his reign but they will cherish it
no natural exhalation in the sky
no scope of nature no distemper'd day
but they will pluck away his natural cause
and call them meteors prodigies and signs
abortives presages and tongues of heaven
plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
lewis may be he will not touch young arthur's life
but hold himself safe in his prisonment
pandulph o sir when he shall hear of your approach
if that young arthur be not gone already
even at that news he dies and then the hearts
and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
out of the bloody fingers' ends of john
methinks i see this hurly all on foot
and o what better matter breeds for you
than i have nam'd the bastard faulconbridge
is now in england ransacking the church
offending charity if but a dozen french
were there in arms they would be as a can
or as a little snow tumbled about
anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin
go with me to the king 'tis wonderful
what may be wrought out of their discontent
now that their souls are topful of offence
for england go i will whet on the king
lewis strong reasons makes strong actions let us go
if you say ay the king will not say no exeunt
act iv scene 1
enter hubert and executioners
hubert heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
within the arras when i strike my foot
upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
and bind the boy which you shall find with me
fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch
executioner i hope your warrant will bear out the deed
hubert uncleanly scruples fear not you look to't
exeunt executioners
enter arthur
arthur good morrow hubert
hubert good morrow little prince
arthur as little prince having so great a tide
to be more prince as may be you are sad
hubert indeed i have been merrier
arthur mercy on me
methinks no body should be sad but i
yet i remember when i was in france
only for wantonness by my christendom
so i were out of prison and kept sheep
i should be as merry as the day is long
and so i would be here but that i doubt
my uncle practises more harm to me
he is afraid of me and i of him
is it my fault that i was geffrey's son
no indeed ist not and i would to heaven
i were your son so you would love me hubert
he will awake my mercy which lies dead
therefore i will be sudden and dispatch
arthur are you sick hubert you look pale to day
in sooth i would you were a little sick
that i might sit all night and watch with you
i warrant i love you more than you do me
hubert aside his words do take possession of my bosom
read here young arthur showing a paper
aside how now foolish rheum
i must be brief lest resolution drop
out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
can you not read it is it not fair writ
arthur too fairly hubert for so foul effect
must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
hubert young boy i must
arthur and will you
hubert and i will
arthur have you the heart when your head did but ache
the best i had a princess wrought it me
and i did never ask it you again
and with my hand at midnight held your head
and like the watchful minutes to the hour
still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
saying 'what lack you' and 'where lies your grief'
or 'what good love may i perform for you'
many a poor mans son would have lyen still
and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
nay you may think my love was crafty love
and call it cunning do an if you will
if heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill
why then you must will you put out mine eyes
these eyes that never did nor never shall
so much as frown on you
hubert i have sworn to do it
and with hot irons must i burn them out
arthur ah none but in this iron age would do it
approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
and quench his fiery indignation
even in the matter of mine innocence
nay after that consume away in rust
but for containing fire to harm mine eye
are you more stubborn hard than hammer'd iron
an if an angel should have come to me
and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
i would not have believ'd him no tongue but hubert's
re enter executioners with cord irons etc
do as i bid you do
arthur o save me hubert save me my eyes are out
even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
hubert give me the iron i say and bind him here
arthur alas what need you be so boist'rous rough
i will not struggle i will stand stone still
for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
nay hear me hubert drive these men away
i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
nor look upon the iron angrily
thrust but these men away and i'll forgive you
whatever torment you do put me to
hubert go stand within let me alone with him
executioner i am best pleas'd to be from such a deed
exeunt executioners
arthur alas i then have chid away my friend
he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
give life to yours
hubert come boy prepare yourself
arthur is there no remedy
hubert none but to lose your eyes
arthur o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
any annoyance in that precious sense
then feeling what small things are boisterous there
your vile intent must needs seem horrible
arthur hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert
or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
though to no use but still to look on you
lo by my troth the instrument is cold
and would not harm me
hubert i can heat it boy
being create for comfort to be us'd
in undeserved extremes see else yourself
there is no malice in this burning coal
the breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
and strew'd repentant ashes on his head
hubert but with my breath i can revive it boy
arthur an if you do you will but make it blush
and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
all things that you should use to do me wrong
deny their office only you do lack
that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
creatures of note for mercy lacking uses
hubert well see to live i will not touch thine eye
for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
yet i am sworn and i did purpose boy
with this same very iron to burn them out
you were disguis'd
hubert peace no more adieu
your uncle must not know but you are dead
i'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
that hubert for the wealth of all the world
will not offend thee
arthur o heaven i thank you hubert
hubert silence no more go closely in with me
scene 2
england king johns palace
enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords
king john here once again we sit once again crownd
and look'd upon i hope with cheerful eyes
pembroke this once again but that your highness pleas'd
was once superfluous you were crownd before
and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
with any long'd for change or better state
salisbury therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
to guard a title that was rich before
to gild refined gold to paint the lily
to throw a perfume on the violet
to smooth the ice or add another hue
unto the rainbow or with taper light
to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
is wasteful and ridiculous excess
this act is as an ancient tale new told
and in the last repeating troublesome
being urged at a time unseasonable
salisbury in this the antique and well noted face
of plain old form is much disfigured
and like a shifted wind unto a sail
it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
startles and frights consideration
makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well
they do confound their skill in covetousness
and oftentimes excusing of a fault
doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse
as patches set upon a little breach
discredit more in hiding of the fault
than did the fault before it was so patch'd
salisbury to this effect before you were new crownd
we breath'd our counsel but it pleas'd your highness
since all and every part of what we would
doth make a stand at what your highness will
king john some reasons of this double coronation
i have possess'd you with and think them strong
and more more strong when lesser is my fear
i shall indue you with meantime but ask
what you would have reform'd that is not well
and well shall you perceive how willingly
i will both hear and grant you your requests
to sound the purposes of all their hearts
both for myself and them but chief of all
your safety for the which myself and them
bend their best studies heartily request
th' enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
to break into this dangerous argument
if what in rest you have in right you hold
why then your fears which as they say attend
your tender kinsman and to choke his days
with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
the rich advantage of good exercise
that the time's enemies may not have this
to grace occasions let it be our suit
that you have bid us ask his liberty
which for our goods we do no further ask
than whereupon our weal on you depending
counts it your weal he have his liberty
to your direction
enter hubert
aside hubert what news with you
pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed
he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
the image of a wicked heinous fault
lives in his eye that close aspect of his
doth show the mood of a much troubled breast
and i do fearfully believe 'tis done
salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go
between his purpose and his conscience
like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set
his passion is so ripe it needs must break
pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
the foul corruption of a sweet child's death
king john we cannot hold mortality's strong hand
good lords although my will to give is living
the suit which you demand is gone and dead
salisbury indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure
pembroke indeed we heard how near his death he was
before the child himself felt he was sick
this must be answer'd either here or hence
king john why do you bend such solemn brows on me
think you i bear the shears of destiny
have i commandment on the pulse of life
salisbury it is apparent foul play and 'tis shame
that greatness should so grossly offer it
pembroke stay yet lord salisbury i'll go with thee
and find th' inheritance of this poor child
his little kingdom of a forced grave
that blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle
three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
this must not be thus borne this will break out
to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt exeunt lords
king john they burn in indignation i repent
there is no sure foundation set on blood
enter a messenger
a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
so foul a sky clears not without a storm
pour down thy weather how goes all in france
messenger from france to england never such a pow'r
for any foreign preparation
was levied in the body of a land
the copy of your speed is learnd by them
the tidings comes that they are all arriv'd
king john o where hath our intelligence been drunk
where hath it slept where is my mother's care
that such an army could be drawn in france
and she not hear of it
messenger my liege her ear
is stopp'd with dust the first of april died
your noble mother and as i hear my lord
the lady constance in a frenzy died
i idly heard if true or false i know not
king john withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
o make a league with me till i have pleas'd
my discontented peers what mother dead
how wildly then walks my estate in france
under whose conduct came those pow'rs of france
that thou for truth giv'st out are landed here
messenger under the dauphin
king john thou hast made me giddy
enter the bastard and peter of pomfret
now what says the world
to your proceedings do not seek to stuff
my head with more ill news for it is fun
bastard but if you be afear'd to hear the worst
then let the worst unheard fall on your head
king john bear with me cousin for i was amaz'd
under the tide but now i breathe again
aloft the flood and can give audience
bastard how i have sped among the clergymen
the sums i have collected shall express
but as i travelld hither through the land
i find the people strangely fantasied
possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
not knowing what they fear but full of fear
and here's a prophet that i brought with me
from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
with many hundreds treading on his heels
that ere the next ascension day at noon
your highness should deliver up your crown
king john thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
peter foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
king john hubert away with him imprison him
and on that day at noon whereon he says
i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
deliver him to safety and return
for i must use thee
o my gentle cousin
hear'st thou the news abroad who are arriv'd
bastard the french my lord mens mouths are full of it
besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
with eyes as red as new enkindled fire
and others more going to seek the grave
of arthur whom they say is killd to night
on your suggestion
king john gentle kinsman go
i have a way to will their loves again
bring them before me
bastard i will seek them out
king john nay but make haste the better foot before
o let me have no subject enemies
when adverse foreigners affright my towns
with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
be mercury set feathers to thy heels
and fly like thought from them to me again
king john spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
exit bastard
go after him for he perhaps shall need
some messenger betwixt me and the peers
and be thou he
messenger with all my heart my liege exit
king john my mother dead
re enter hubert
hubert my lord they say five moons were seen to night
the other four in wondrous motion
king john five moons
hubert old men and beldams in the streets
do prophesy upon it dangerously
young arthur's death is common in their mouths
and when they talk of him they shake their heads
and whisper one another in the ear
and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
whilst he that hears makes fearful action
i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
who with his shears and measure in his hand
standing on slippers which his nimble haste
had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
told of a many thousand warlike french
that were embattailed and rank'd in kent
another lean unwash'd artificer
king john why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death
thy hand hath murd'red him i had a mighty cause
to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
hubert no had my lord why did you not provoke me
king john it is the curse of kings to be attended
by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
to break within the bloody house of life
and on the winking of authority
of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
more upon humour than advis'd respect
hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did
king john o when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
is to be made then shall this hand and seal
witness against us to damnation
how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
this murder had not come into my mind
but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
finding thee fit for bloody villainy
apt liable to be employ'd in danger
i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death
and thou to be endeared to a king
made it no conscience to destroy a prince
hubert my lord
king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face
as bid me tell my tale in express words
deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
but thou didst understand me by my signs
and didst in signs again parley with sin
yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
and consequently thy rude hand to act
the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
my nobles leave me and my state is braved
even at my gates with ranks of foreign pow'rs
nay in the body of the fleshly land
this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
hostility and civil tumult reigns
between my conscience and my cousins death
hubert arm you against your other enemies
i'll make a peace between your soul and you
young arthur is alive this hand of mine
not painted with the crimson spots of blood
within this bosom never ent'red yet
the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
and you have slander'd nature in my form
which howsoever rude exteriorly
is yet the cover of a fairer mind
than to be butcher of an innocent child
king john doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
throw this report on their incensed rage
forgive the comment that my passion made
upon thy feature for my rage was blind
and foul imaginary eyes of blood
presented thee more hideous than thou art
o answer not but to my closet bring
the angry lords with all expedient haste
i conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt
scene 3
england before the castle
arthur the wall is high and yet will i leap down
good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
there's few or none do know me if they did
this ship boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite
i am afraid and yet i'll venture it
if i get down and do not break my limbs
i'll find a thousand shifts to get away
as good to die and go as die and stay leaps down
o me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
empty
enter pembroke salisbury and bigot
salisbury lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury
it is our safety and we must embrace
this gentle offer of the perilous time
pembroke who brought that letter from the cardinal
salisbury the count melun a noble lord of france
whose private with me of the dauphins love
is much more general than these lines import
salisbury or rather then set forward for 'twill be
two long days' journey lords or ere we meet
enter the bastard
bastard once more to day well met distemper'd lords
the king by me requests your presence straight
salisbury the king hath dispossess'd himself of us
we will not line his thin bestained cloak
with our pure honours nor attend the foot
that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
bastard whate'er you think good words i think were best
salisbury our griefs and not our manners reason now
bastard but there is little reason in your grief
therefore 'twere reason you had manners now
pembroke sir sir impatience hath his privilege
bastard 'tis true to hurt his master no man else
salisbury this is the prison what is he lies here
pembroke o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
the earth had not a hole to hide this deed
doth lay it open to urge on revenge
bigot or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
found it too precious princely for a grave
salisbury sir richard what think you have you beheld
or have you read or heard or could you think
or do you almost think although you see
that you do see could thought without this object
form such another this is the very top
the height the crest or crest unto the crest
the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
that ever wall ey'd wrath or staring rage
presented to the tears of soft remorse
pembroke all murders past do stand excus'd in this
and this so sole and so unmatchable
shall give a holiness a purity
to the yet unbegotten sin of times
and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
exampled by this heinous spectacle
the graceless action of a heavy hand
if that it be the work of any hand
salisbury if that it be the work of any hand
we had a kind of light what would ensue
it is the shameful work of hubert's hand
the practice and the purpose of the king
from whose obedience i forbid my soul
kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
and breathing to his breathless excellence
never to taste the pleasures of the world
never to be infected with delight
nor conversant with ease and idleness
till i have set a glory to this hand
by giving it the worship of revenge
pembroke and bigot our souls religiously confirm thy words
enter hubert
hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
hubert i am no villain
salisbury must i rob the law drawing his sword
bastard your sword is bright sir put it up again
salisbury not till i sheathe it in a murderer's skin
hubert stand back lord salisbury stand back i say
by heaven i think my sword's as sharp as yours
i would not have you lord forget yourself
nor tempt the danger of my true defence
your worth your greatness and nobility
bigot out dunghill dar'st thou brave a nobleman
hubert not for my life but yet i dare defend
my innocent life against an emperor
salisbury thou art a murderer
hubert do not prove me so
yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false
not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
pembroke cut him to pieces
salisbury stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge
bastard thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
i'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime
or i'll so maul you and your toasting iron
that you shall think the devil is come from hell
bigot what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
second a villain and a murderer
bigot who killd this prince
hubert 'tis not an hour since i left him well
i honour'd him i lov'd him and will weep
my date of life out for his sweet life's loss
salisbury trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
for villainy is not without such rheum
and he long traded in it makes it seem
like rivers of remorse and innocency
away with me all you whose souls abhor
for i am stifled with this smell of sin
bigot away toward bury to the dauphin there
pembroke there tell the king he may inquire us out
exeunt lords
bastard here's a good world knew you of this fair work
beyond the infinite and boundless reach
of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
art thou damnd hubert
hubert do but hear me sir
thou'rt damnd as black nay nothing is so black
thou art more deep damnd than prince lucifer
there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
hubert upon my soul
bastard if thou didst but consent
to this most cruel act do but despair
and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
that ever spider twisted from her womb
to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
put but a little water in a spoon
and it shall be as all the ocean
enough to stifle such a villain up
i do suspect thee very grievously
hubert if i in act consent or sin of thought
be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
which was embounded in this beauteous clay
let hell want pains enough to torture me
bastard go bear him in thine arms
i am amaz'd methinks and lose my way
among the thorns and dangers of this world
how easy dost thou take all england up
from forth this morsel of dead royalty
the life the right and truth of all this realm
is fled to heaven and england now is left
to tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth
the unowed interest of proud swelling state
doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
now powers from home and discontents at home
meet in one line and vast confusion waits
as doth a raven on a sick falln beast
the imminent decay of wrested pomp
now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
hold out this tempest bear away that child
and follow me with speed i'll to the king
and heaven itself doth frown upon the land exeunt
act v scene 1
england king johns palace
enter king john pandulph and attendants
king john thus have i yielded up into your hand
the circle of my glory
pandulph gives back the crown take again
from this my hand as holding of the pope
your sovereign greatness and authority
and from his holiness use all your power
to stop their marches fore we are inflam'd
our discontented counties do revolt
our people quarrel with obedience
swearing allegiance and the love of soul
to stranger blood to foreign royalty
this inundation of mistemp'red humour
rests by you only to be qualified
then pause not for the present time's so sick
or overthrow incurable ensues
pandulph it was my breath that blew this tempest up
upon your stubborn usage of the pope
but since you are a gentle convertite
my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
and make fair weather in your blust'ring land
on this ascension day remember well
upon your oath of service to the pope
go i to make the french lay down their arms exit
say that before ascension day at noon
my crown i should give off even so i have
i did suppose it should be on constraint
but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary
enter the bastard
bastard all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
but dover castle london hath receiv'd
like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
your nobles will not hear you but are gone
and wild amazement hurries up and down
the little number of your doubtful friends
king john would not my lords return to me again
after they heard young arthur was alive
bastard they found him dead and cast into the streets
an empty casket where the jewel of life
by some damnd hand was robbed and ta'en away
king john that villain hubert told me he did live
bastard so on my soul he did for aught he knew
be great in act as you have been in thought
let not the world see fear and sad distrust
govern the motion of a kingly eye
be stirring as the time be fire with fire
threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow
of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
that borrow their behaviours from the great
grow great by your example and put on
the dauntless spirit of resolution
when he intendeth to become the field
show boldness and aspiring confidence
what shall they seek the lion in his den
and fright him there and make him tremble there
o let it not be said forage and run
to meet displeasure farther from the doors
and grapple with him ere he come so nigh
king john the legate of the pope hath been with me
and i have made a happy peace with him
led by the dauphin
bastard o inglorious league
shall we upon the footing of our land
send fair play orders and make compromise
insinuation parley and base truce
to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
a cock'red silken wanton brave our fields
and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
mocking the air with colours idly spread
perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
or if he do let it at least be said
they saw we had a purpose of defence
king john have thou the ordering of this present time
bastard away then with good courage
yet i know
our party may well meet a prouder foe exeunt
scene 2
england the dauphins camp at saint edmundsbury
lewis my lord melun let this be copied out
and keep it safe for our remembrance
return the precedent to these lords again
that having our fair order written down
both they and we perusing o'er these notes
may know wherefore we took the sacrament
and keep our faiths firm and inviolable
salisbury upon our sides it never shall be broken
and noble dauphin albeit we swear
to your proceedings yet believe me prince
i am not glad that such a sore of time
should seek a plaster by contemnd revolt
and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
by making many o it grieves my soul
that i must draw this metal from my side
to be a widow maker o and there
where honourable rescue and defence
cries out upon the name of salisbury
that for the health and physic of our right
we cannot deal but with the very hand
of stern injustice and confused wrong
and is't not pity o my grieved friends
that we the sons and children of this isle
were born to see so sad an hour as this
wherein we step after a stranger march
upon her gentle bosom and fill up
her enemies' ranks i must withdraw and weep
to grace the gentry of a land remote
and follow unacquainted colours here
what here o nation that thou couldst remove
that neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
where these two christian armies might combine
the blood of malice in a vein of league
and not to spend it so unneighbourly
and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
doth make an earthquake of nobility
o what a noble combat hast thou fought
between compulsion and a brave respect
let me wipe off this honourable dew
that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
my heart hath melted at a lady's tears
being an ordinary inundation
but this effusion of such manly drops
startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors
lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
and with a great heart heave away this storm
commend these waters to those baby eyes
that never saw the giant world enrag'd
nor met with fortune other than at feasts
full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
into the purse of rich prosperity
as lewis himself so nobles shall you all
that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
enter pandulph
and even there methinks an angel spake
look where the holy legate comes apace
to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
and on our actions set the name of right
with holy breath
the next is this king john hath reconcild
himself to rome his spirit is come in
that so stood out against the holy church
the great metropolis and see of rome
therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up
and tame the savage spirit of wild war
that like a lion fostered up at hand
it may lie gently at the foot of peace
and be no further harmful than in show
i am too high born to be propertied
to be a secondary at control
or useful serving man and instrument
to any sovereign state throughout the world
your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
between this chastis'd kingdom and myself
and brought in matter that should feed this fire
and now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
with that same weak wind which enkindled it
acquainted me with interest to this land
yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
and come ye now to tell me john hath made
his peace with rome what is that peace to me
i by the honour of my marriage bed
after young arthur claim this land for mine
and now it is half conquer'd must i back
because that john hath made his peace with rome
am i rome's slave what penny hath rome borne
to underprop this action is 't not i
that undergo this charge who else but i
and such as to my claim are liable
sweat in this business and maintain this war
have i not heard these islanders shout out
'vive le roi' as i have bank'd their towns
have i not here the best cards for the game
to will this easy match play'd for a crown
and shall i now give o'er the yielded set
pandulph you look but on the outside of this work
lewis outside or inside i will not return
till my attempt so much be glorified
as to my ample hope was promised
before i drew this gallant head of war
and culld these fiery spirits from the world
to outlook conquest and to will renown
even in the jaws of danger and of death
trumpet sounds
enter the bastard attended
bastard according to the fair play of the world
let me have audience i am sent to speak
my holy lord of milan from the king
i come to learn how you have dealt for him
and as you answer i do know the scope
and warrant limited unto my tongue
pandulph the dauphin is too wilful opposite
and will not temporize with my entreaties
bastard by all the blood that ever fury breath'd
the youth says well now hear our english king
for thus his royalty doth speak in me
he is prepar'd and reason too he should
this apish and unmannerly approach
this harness'd masque and unadvised revel
this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
the king doth smile at and is well prepar'd
to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
that hand which had the strength even at your door
to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
to dive like buckets in concealed wells
to crouch in litter of your stable planks
to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
even at the crying of your nations crow
thinking this voice an armed englishman
that in your chambers gave you chastisement
no know the gallant monarch is in arms
and like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs
to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
of your dear mother england blush for shame
for your own ladies and pale visag'd maids
like amazons come tripping after drums
their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
to fierce and bloody inclination
lewis there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
we hold our time too precious to be spent
with such a brabbler
pandulph give me leave to speak
bastard no i will speak
lewis we will attend to neither
plead for our interest and our being here
bastard indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
and so shall you being beaten do but start
and echo with the clamour of thy drum
and even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
sound but another and another shall
as loud as thine rattle the welkins ear
and mock the deep mouth'd thunder for at hand
whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need
is warlike john and in his forehead sits
a bare ribb'd death whose office is this day
to feast upon whole thousands of the french
lewis strike up our drums to find this danger out
bastard and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt

salisbury i did not think the king so stor'd with friends
pembroke up once again put spirit in the french

salisbury that misbegotten devil faulconbridge
in spite of spite alone upholds the day
pembroke they say king john sore sick hath left the field
enter melun wounded
melun lead me to the revolts of england here
pembroke it is the count melun
salisbury wounded to death
melun fly noble english you are bought and sold
unthread the rude eye of rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith
seek out king john and fall before his feet
for if the french be lords of this loud day
he means to recompense the pains you take
by cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn
upon the altar at saint edmundsbury
even on that altar where we swore to you
dear amity and everlasting love
salisbury may this be possible may this be true
melun have i not hideous death within my view
retaining but a quantity of life
which bleeds away even as a form of wax
resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire
what in the world should make me now deceive
why should i then be false since it is true
that i must die here and live hence by truth
i say again if lewis do will the day
he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
behold another day break in the east
but even this night whose black contagious breath
already smokes about the burning crest
of the old feeble and day wearied sun
even this ill night your breathing shall expire
even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
if lewis by your assistance win the day
commend me to one hubert with your king
the love of him and this respect besides
for that my grandsire was an englishman
awakes my conscience to confess all this
in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
from forth the noise and rumour of the field
where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
with contemplation and devout desires
salisbury we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
but i do love the favour and the form
of this most fair occasion by the which
we will untread the steps of damned flight
and like a bated and retired flood
leaving our rankness and irregular course
stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
and calmly run on in obedience
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
for i do see the cruel pangs of death
right in thine eye away my friends new flight
and happy newness that intends old right

after such bloody toil we bid good night

last in the field and almost lords of it

messenger where is my prince the dauphin
lewis here what news
by his persuasion are again falln off

are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands
lewis ah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heart
i did not think to be so sad to night
as this hath made me who was he that said

than if you had at leisure known of this

pembroke his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
that being brought into the open air
it would allay the burning quality
of that fell poison which assaileth him
prince henry let him be brought into the orchard here
doth he still rage exit bigot
pembroke he is more patient
prince henry o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
in their continuance will not feel themselves
death having prey'd upon the outward parts
leaves them invisible and his siege is now
against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
with many legions of strange fantasies
which in their throng and press to that last hold
confound themselves 'tis strange that death should sing
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
and from the organ pipe of frailty sings
his soul and body to their lasting rest
salisbury be of good comfort prince for you are born
to set a form upon that indigest
which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
re enter bigot and attendants who bring in
king john in a chair
king john ay marry now my soul hath elbow room
it would not out at windows nor at doors
that all my bowels crumble up to dust
i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
upon a parchment and against this fire
do i shrink up
prince henry how fares your majesty
king john poisond ill fare dead forsook cast off
and none of you will bid the winter come
to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much
i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
and so ingrateful you deny me that
prince henry o that there were some virtue in my tears
that might relieve you
king john the salt in them is hot
within me is a hell and there the poison
is as a fiend confind to tyrannize
enter the bastard
bastard o i am scalded with my violent motion
and spleen of speed to see your majesty
king john o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
the tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt
and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
are turned to one thread one little hair
my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
which holds but till thy news be uttered
and module of confounded royalty
bastard the dauphin is preparing hitherward
where god he knows how we shall answer him
for in a night the best part of my pow'r
as i upon advantage did remove
were in the washes all unwarily
devoured by the unexpected flood the king dies
salisbury you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
my liege my lord but now a king now thus
what surety of the world what hope what stay
when this was now a king and now is clay
bastard art thou gone so i do but stay behind
to do the office for thee of revenge
and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
as it on earth hath been thy servant still
now now you stars that move in your right spheres
where be your pow'rs show now your mended faiths
and instantly return with me again
out of the weak door of our fainting land
straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
the dauphin rages at our very heels
salisbury it seems you know not then so much as we
the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
who half an hour since came from the dauphin
and brings from him such offers of our peace
as we with honour and respect may take
with purpose presently to leave this war
ourselves well sinewed to our defence
salisbury nay 'tis in a manner done already
for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
to the sea side and put his cause and quarrel
to the disposing of the cardinal
with whom yourself myself and other lords
if you think meet this afternoon will post
to consummate this business happily
bastard let it be so and you my noble prince
shall wait upon your father's funeral
prince henry at worcester must his body be interr'd
for so he willd it
bastard thither shall it then
and happily may your sweet self put on
the lineal state and glory of the land
to whom with all submission on my knee
i do bequeath my faithful services
and true subjection everlastingly
to rest without a spot for evermore
prince henry i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
and knows not how to do it but with tears
bastard o let us pay the time but needful woe
since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
this england never did nor never shall
lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
but when it first did help to wound itself
now these her princes are come home again
and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue

knew you not pompey many a time and oft
have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
to towers and windows yea to chimney tops
your infants in your arms and there have sat
the livelong day with patient expectation
and when you saw his chariot but appear
have you not made an universal shout
that tiber trembled underneath her banks
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way
that comes in triumph over pompey's blood
run to your houses fall upon your knees
pray to the gods to intermit the plague
that needs must light on this ingratitude
flavius go go good countrymen and for this fault
assemble all the poor men of your sort
draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears
into the channel till the lowest stream
do kiss the most exalted shores of all
exeunt all commoners
they vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the capitol
this way will i disrobe the images
if you do find them deck'd with ceremonies
marullus may we do so
you know it is the feast of lupercal
flavius it is no matter let no images
be hung with caesar's trophies i'll about
and drive away the vulgar from the streets
these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
will make him fly an ordinary pitch
who else would soar above the view of men
and keep us all in servile fearfulness exeunt
scene ii
a public place
flourish enter caesar antony for the course calpurnia portia
decius cicero brutus cassius and casca a great crowd follows
among them a soothsayer
casca peace ho caesar speaks
music ceases
caesar calpurnia
calpurnia here my lord
caesar stand you directly in antonio's way
when he doth run his course antonio
antony caesar my lord
caesar forget not in your speed antonio
to touch calpurnia for our elders say
shake off their sterile curse
antony i shall remember
when caesar says do this it is perform'd
caesar set on and leave no ceremony out flourish
soothsayer caesar
caesar ha who calls
casca bid every noise be still peace yet again
caesar who is it in the press that calls on me
i hear a tongue shriller than all the music
soothsayer beware the ides of march
caesar what man is that
brutus a soothsayer you beware the ides of march
caesar set him before me let me see his face
cassius fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
caesar what say'st thou to me now speak once again
soothsayer beware the ides of march
caesar he is a dreamer let us leave him pass
sennet exeunt all but brutus and cassius
brutus not i
cassius i pray you do
brutus i am not gamesome i do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in antony
let me not hinder cassius your desires
i'll leave you
cassius brutus i do observe you now of late
i have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as i was wont to have
over your friend that loves you
brutus cassius
be not deceived if i have veild my look
i turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself vexed i am
of late with passions of some difference
conceptions only proper to myself
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
but let not therefore my good friends be grieved
nor construe any further my neglect
than that poor brutus with himself at war
forgets the shows of love to other men
cassius then brutus i have much mistook your passion
by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good brutus can you see your face
brutus no cassius for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection by some other things
and it is very much lamented brutus
that you have no such mirrors as will turn
your hidden worthiness into your eye
that you might see your shadow i have heard
where many of the best respect in rome
except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
and groaning underneath this age's yoke
have wish'd that noble brutus had his eyes
brutus into what dangers would you lead me cassius
for that which is not in me
cassius therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
and since you know you cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection i your glass
will modestly discover to yourself
that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
were i a common laugher or did use
to stale with ordinary oaths my love
that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
and after scandal them or if you know
that i profess myself in banqueting
to all the rout then hold me dangerous
flourish and shout
brutus what means this shouting i do fear the people
choose caesar for their king
cassius ay do you fear it
then must i think you would not have it so
but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good
set honor in one eye and death i' the other
and i will look on both indifferently
for let the gods so speed me as i love
the name of honor more than i fear death
cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutus
as well as i do know your outward favor
i cannot tell what you and other men
think of this life but for my single self
i had as lief not be as live to be
in awe of such a thing as i myself
i was born free as caesar so were you
we both have fed as well and we can both
endure the winter's cold as well as he
for once upon a raw and gusty day
the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
leap in with me into this angry flood
and swim to yonder point upon the word
accoutred as i was i plunged in
and bade him follow so indeed he did
the torrent roar'd and we did buffet it
with lusty sinews throwing it aside
and stemming it with hearts of controversy
but ere we could arrive the point proposed
caesar cried help me cassius or i sink
did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
did i the tired caesar and this man
is now become a god and cassius is
a wretched creature and must bend his body
if caesar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in spain
and when the fit was on him i did mark
how he did shake 'tis true this god did shake
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
did lose his luster i did hear him groan
ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
mark him and write his speeches in their books
alas it cried give me some drink titinius
as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me
a man of such a feeble temper should
so get the start of the majestic world
and bear the palm alone shout flourish
i do believe that these applauses are
for some new honors that are heap'd on caesar
cassius why man he doth bestride the narrow world
like a colossus and we petty men
walk under his huge legs and peep about
to find ourselves dishonorable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
but in ourselves that we are underlings
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name
sound them it doth become the mouth as well
weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em
brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
now in the names of all the gods at once
upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
that he is grown so great age thou art shamed
rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
but it was famed with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talk'd of rome
that her wide walls encompass'd but one man
now is it rome indeed and room enough
when there is in it but one only man
o you and i have heard our fathers say
there was a brutus once that would have brook'd
the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
as easily as a king
what you would work me to i have some aim
how i have thought of this and of these times
i shall recount hereafter for this present
i would not so with love i might entreat you
be any further moved what you have said
i will consider what you have to say
i will with patience hear and find a time
both meet to hear and answer such high things
till then my noble friend chew upon this
than to repute himself a son of rome
under these hard conditions as this time
is like to lay upon us
cassius i am glad that my weak words
have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus
re enter caesar and his train
brutus the games are done and caesar is returning
cassius as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve
and he will after his sour fashion tell you
brutus i will do so but look you cassius
the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow
and all the rest look like a chidden train
calpurnia's cheek is pale and cicero
looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
as we have seen him in the capitol
being cross'd in conference by some senators
cassius casca will tell us what the matter is
caesar antonio
caesar let me have men about me that are fat
sleek headed men and such as sleep o' nights
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
he thinks too much such men are dangerous
antony fear him not caesar he's not dangerous
he is a noble roman and well given
caesar would he were fatter but i fear him not
yet if my name were liable to fear
i do not know the man i should avoid
he is a great observer and he looks
quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
as thou dost antony he hears no music
seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
as if he mock'd himself and scornd his spirit
that could be moved to smile at anything
such men as he be never at heart's ease
whiles they behold a greater than themselves
and therefore are they very dangerous
than what i fear for always i am caesar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
and tell me truly what thou think'st of him
sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca
casca you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
brutus ay casca tell us what hath chanced today
that caesar looks so sad
casca why you were with him were you not
brutus i should not then ask casca what had chanced
he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
people fell ashouting
brutus what was the second noise for
casca why for that too
cassius they shouted thrice what was the last cry for
casca why for that too
brutus was the crown offered him thrice
casca ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler
than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
cassius who offered him the crown
casca why antony
brutus tell us the manner of it gentle casca
casca i can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it it was
mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a
crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these
coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all
that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered
it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he
the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had
almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and
for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
and receiving the bad air
cassius but soft i pray you what did caesars wound
casca he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
brutus 'tis very like he hath the falling sickness
cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i
and honest casca we have the falling sickness
casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell
down if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do
the players in the theatre i am no true man
brutus what said he when he came unto himself
casca marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
and offered them his throat to cut an had been a man of any
occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i
might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came
to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss
he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or
four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave
him with all their hearts but there's no heed to be taken of
them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done
no less
casca ay
cassius did cicero say anything
casca ay he spoke greek
cassius to what effect
casca nay an i tell you that i'll ne'er look you i' the face
again but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i
could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling
scarfs off caesar's images are put to silence fare you well
cassius will you sup with me tonight casca
casca no i am promised forth
cassius will you dine with me tomorrow
casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth
the eating
cassius good i will expect you
casca do so farewell both exit
brutus what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
he was quick mettle when he went to school
of any bold or noble enterprise
however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
which gives men stomach to digest his words
with better appetite
brutus and so it is for this time i will leave you
tomorrow if you please to speak with me
i will come home to you or if you will
come home to me and i will wait for you
exit brutus
well brutus thou art noble yet i see
thy honorable mettle may be wrought
from that it is disposed therefore it is meet
that noble minds keep ever with their likes
for who so firm that cannot be seduced
caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
if i were brutus now and he were cassius
he should not humor me i will this night
as if they came from several citizens
writings all tending to the great opinion
that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
and after this let caesar seat him sure
for we will shake him or worse days endure exit
scene iii
a street thunder and lightning
enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero
why are you breathless and why stare you so
casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth
shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
to be exalted with the threatening clouds
but never till tonight never till now
did i go through a tempest dropping fire
or else the world too saucy with the gods
incenses them to send destruction
cicero why saw you anything more wonderful
casca a common slave you know him well by sight
held up his left hand which did flame and burn
like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
not sensible of fire remaind unscorch'd
besides i ha' not since put up my sword
against the capitol i met a lion
without annoying me and there were drawn
upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
transformed with their fear who swore they saw
men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noonday upon the marketplace
howling and shrieking when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
these are their reasons they are natural
unto the climate that they point upon
cicero indeed it is a strange disposed time
but men may construe things after their fashion
clean from the purpose of the things themselves
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow
casca he doth for he did bid antonio
send word to you he would be there tomorrow
cicero good then casca this disturbed sky
is not to walk in
enter cassius
cassius who's there
casca a roman
cassius casca by your voice
casca your ear is good cassius what night is this
cassius a very pleasing night to honest men
casca who ever knew the heavens menace so
cassius those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part i have walk'd about the streets
and thus unbraced casca as you see
have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
the breast of heaven i did present myself
even in the aim and very flash of it
casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble
when the most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds to astonish us
that should be in a roman you do want
or else you use not you look pale and gaze
and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
to see the strange impatience of the heavens
but if you would consider the true cause
why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
why birds and beasts from quality and kind
why old men fools and children calculate
why all these things change from their ordinance
to monstrous quality why you shall find
that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
to make them instruments of fear and warning
unto some monstrous state
now could i casca name to thee a man
most like this dreadful night
that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
as doth the lion in the capitol
a man no mightier than thyself or me
and fearful as these strange eruptions are
casca 'tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
cassius let it be who it is for romans now
have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
but woe the while our fathers' minds are dead
and we are governd with our mothers' spirits
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
casca indeed they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish caesar as a king
in every place save here in italy
cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
can be retentive to the strength of spirit
but life being weary of these worldly bars
if i know this know all the world besides
that part of tyranny that i do bear
i can shake off at pleasure thunder still
casca so can i
so every bondman in his own hand bears
the power to cancel his captivity
cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then
poor man i know he would not be a wolf
but that he sees the romans are but sheep
those that with haste will make a mighty fire
begin it with weak straws what trash is rome
what rubbish and what offal when it serves
for the base matter to illuminate
so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
before a willing bondman then i know
my answer must be made but i am arm'd
and dangers are to me indifferent
that is no fleering tell tale hold my hand
be factious for redress of all these griefs
and i will set this foot of mine as far
as who goes farthest
cassius there's a bargain made
now know you casca i have moved already
some certain of the noblest minded romans
to undergo with me an enterprise
of honorable dangerous consequence
in pompey's porch for now this fearful night
there is no stir or walking in the streets
and the complexion of the element
in favor's like the work we have in hand
most bloody fiery and most terrible
enter cinna
casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
cassius 'tis cinna i do know him by his gait
he is a friend cinna where haste you so
cassius no it is casca one incorporate
to our attempts am i not stay'd for cinna
cinna i am glad ont what a fearful night is this
there's two or three of us have seen strange sights
cassius am i not stay'd for tell me
cinna yes you are
o cassius if you could
but win the noble brutus to our party
cassius be you content good cinna take this paper
where brutus may but find it and throw this
in at his window set this up with wax
upon old brutus' statue all this done
repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us
is decius brutus and trebonius there
cinna all but metellus cimber and he's gone
to seek you at your house well i will hie
and so bestow these papers as you bade me
cassius that done repair to pompey's theatre
come casca you and i will yet ere day
see brutus at his house three parts of him
is ours already and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours
casca o he sits high in all the people's hearts
and that which would appear offense in us
his countenance like richest alchemy
will change to virtue and to worthiness
cassius him and his worth and our great need of him
for it is after midnight and ere day
we will awake him and be sure of him exeunt
act ii scene i
enter brutus in his orchard
brutus what lucius ho
i cannot by the progress of the stars
give guess how near to day lucius i say
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
when lucius when awake i say what lucius
lucius calld you my lord
brutus get me a taper in my study lucius
when it is lighted come and call me here
lucius i will my lord exit
brutus it must be by his death and for my part
i know no personal cause to spurn at him
but for the general he would be crownd
how that might change his nature there's the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
and then i grant we put a sting in him
that at his will he may do danger with
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
i have not known when his affections sway'd
more than his reason but 'tis a common proof
that lowliness is young ambitions ladder
whereto the climber upward turns his face
but when he once attains the upmost round
looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend so caesar may
then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel
will bear no color for the thing he is
fashion it thus that what he is augmented
would run to these and these extremities
and therefore think him as a serpent's egg
which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
and kill him in the shell
lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint i found
this paper thus seald up and i am sure
it did not lie there when i went to bed
gives him the letter
brutus get you to bed again it is not day
is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
lucius i know not sir
brutus look in the calendar and bring me word
brutus the exhalations whizzing in the air
give so much light that i may read by them
opens the letter and reads
brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
shall rome etc speak strike redress
brutus thou sleep'st awake
such instigations have been often dropp'd
where i have took them up
shall rome etc thus must i piece it out
my ancestors did from the streets of rome
the tarquin drive when he was calld a king
speak strike redress am i entreated
to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
if the redress will follow thou receivest
thy full petition at the hand of brutus
re enter lucius
lucius sir march is wasted fifteen days
knocking within
exit lucius
since cassius first did whet me against caesar
i have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion all the interim is
like a phantasma or a hideous dream
the genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council and the state of man
like to a little kingdom suffers then
re enter lucius
lucius sir 'tis your brother cassius at the door
who doth desire to see you
brutus is he alone
lucius no sir there are more with him
brutus do you know them
lucius no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
and half their faces buried in their cloaks
that by no means i may discover them
brutus let 'em enter exit lucius
they are the faction o conspiracy
shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
when evils are most free o then by day
where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
hide it in smiles and affability
for if thou path thy native semblance on
not erebus itself were dim enough
enter the conspirators cassius casca decius cinna
metellus cimber and trebonius
cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest
good morrow brutus do we trouble you
brutus i have been up this hour awake all night
know i these men that come along with you
cassius yes every man of them and no man here
but honors you and every one doth wish
you had but that opinion of yourself
this is trebonius
brutus he is welcome hither
cassius this decius brutus
brutus he is welcome too
cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
brutus they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves
betwixt your eyes and night
cassius shall i entreat a word they whisper
casca no
cinna o pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
that fret the clouds are messengers of day
casca you shall confess that you are both deceived
here as i point my sword the sun arises
which is a great way growing on the south
weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north
he first presents his fire and the high east
brutus give me your hands all over one by one
cassius and let us swear our resolution
brutus no not an oath if not the face of men
the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse
if these be motives weak break off betimes
and every man hence to his idle bed
so let high sighted tyranny range on
till each man drop by lottery but if these
as i am sure they do bear fire enough
the melting spirits of women then countrymen
what need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress what other bond
than secret romans that have spoke the word
and will not palter and what other oath
than honesty to honesty engaged
that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
the even virtue of our enterprise
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
to think that or our cause or our performance
did need an oath when every drop of blood
that every roman bears and nobly bears
is guilty of a several bastardy
if he do break the smallest particle
of any promise that hath pass'd from him
i think he will stand very strong with us
casca let us not leave him out
cinna no by no means
metellus o let us have him for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion
and buy mens voices to commend our deeds
it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
but all be buried in his gravity
for he will never follow anything
that other men begin
cassius then leave him out
casca indeed he is not fit
decius shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar
cassius decius well urged i think it is not meet
mark antony so well beloved of caesar
should outlive caesar we shall find of him
a shrewd contriver and you know his means
as to annoy us all which to prevent
let antony and caesar fall together
brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
like wrath in death and envy afterwards
for antony is but a limb of caesar
let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
and in the spirit of men there is no blood
and not dismember caesar but alas
caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends
let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
and let our hearts as subtle masters do
stir up their servants to an act of rage
and after seem to chide 'em this shall make
our purpose necessary and not envious
we shall be calld purgers not murderers
and for mark antony think not of him
for he can do no more than caesar's arm
when caesar's head is off
cassius yet i fear him
for in the ingrated love he bears to caesar
brutus alas good cassius do not think of him
if he love caesar all that he can do
is to himself take thought and die for caesar
to sports to wildness and much company
trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
clock strikes
brutus peace count the clock
cassius the clock hath stricken three
trebonius 'tis time to part
cassius but it is doubtful yet
whether caesar will come forth today or no
quite from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
it may be these apparent prodigies
the unaccustom'd terror of this night
and the persuasion of his augurers
may hold him from the capitol today
decius never fear that if he be so resolved
i can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
that unicorns may be betray'd with trees
lions with toils and men with flatterers
but when i tell him he hates flatterers
he says he does being then most flattered
let me work
for i can give his humor the true bent
and i will bring him to the capitol
cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
brutus by the eighth hour is that the utter most
cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then
who rated him for speaking well of pompey
i wonder none of you have thought of him
brutus now good metellus go along by him
he loves me well and i have given him reasons
send him but hither and i'll fashion him
cassius the morning comes upon 's we'll leave you brutus
and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
what you have said and show yourselves true romans
brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
but bear it as our roman actors do
with untired spirits and formal constancy
and so good morrow to you every one
exeunt all but brutus
boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter
enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
which busy care draws in the brains of men
therefore thou sleep'st so sound
portia brutus my lord
brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
it is not for your health thus to commit
your weak condition to the raw cold morning
portia nor for yours neither have ungently brutus
stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
you suddenly arose and walk'd about
musing and sighing with your arms across
and when i ask'd you what the matter was
i urged you further then you scratch'd your head
and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
yet i insisted yet you answer'd not
but with an angry waiter of your hand
gave sign for me to leave you so i did
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seem'd too much enkindled and withal
hoping it was but an effect of humor
which sometime hath his hour with every man
and could it work so much upon your shape
as it hath much prevaild on your condition
i should not know you brutus dear my lord
make me acquainted with your cause of grief
brutus i am not well in health and that is all
portia brutus is wise and were he not in health
he would embrace the means to come by it
brutus why so i do good portia go to bed
portia is brutus sick and is it physical
of the dank morning what is brutus sick
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
to dare the vile contagion of the night
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
to add unto his sickness no my brutus
you have some sick offense within your mind
which by the right and virtue of my place
i ought to know of and upon my knees
i charm you by my once commended beauty
which did incorporate and make us one
that you unfold to me yourself your half
why you are heavy and what men tonight
have had resort to you for here have been
some six or seven who did hide their faces
even from darkness
brutus kneel not gentle portia
portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
that appertain to you am i yourself
but as it were in sort or limitation
to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure if it be no more
portia is brutus' harlot not his wife
brutus you are my true and honorable wife
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart
i grant i am a woman but withal
a woman that lord brutus took to wife
i grant i am a woman but withal
a woman well reputed cato's daughter
think you i am no stronger than my sex
being so father'd and so husbanded
tell me your counsels i will not disclose 'em
i have made strong proof of my constancy
giving myself a voluntary wound
and not my husband's secrets
brutus o ye gods
render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within
hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile
and by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart
all my engagements i will construe to thee
all the charactery of my sad brows
leave me with haste exit portia lucius who's that knocks
lucius here is a sick man that would speak with you
brutus caius ligarius that metellus spake of
boy stand aside caius ligarius how
ligarius vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
brutus o what a time have you chose out brave caius
to wear a kerchief would you were not sick
ligarius i am not sick if brutus have in hand
any exploit worthy the name of honor
brutus such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
ligarius by all the gods that romans bow before
i here discard my sickness soul of rome
brave son derived from honorable loins
thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
my mortified spirit now bid me run
and i will strive with things impossible
yea get the better of them what's to do
brutus a piece of work that will make sick men whole
ligarius but are not some whole that we must make sick
i shall unfold to thee as we are going
to whom it must be done
ligarius set on your foot
and with a heart new fired i follow you
to do i know not what but it sufficeth
that brutus leads me on
brutus follow me then exeunt
scene ii
caesar's house thunder and lightning
caesar nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
help ho they murther caesar who's within
enter a servant
servant my lord
caesar go bid the priests do present sacrifice
and bring me their opinions of success
servant i will my lord exit
enter calpurnia
you shall not stir out of your house today
caesar caesar shall forth the things that threatend me
ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see
the face of caesar they are vanished
calpurnia caesar i i stood on ceremonies
yet now they fright me there is one within
besides the things that we have heard and seen
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets
fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
which drizzled blood upon the capitol
the noise of battle hurtled in the air
horses did neigh and dying men did groan
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
o caesar these things are beyond all use
and i do fear them
caesar what can be avoided
yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
are to the world in general as to caesar
calpurnia when beggars die there are no comets seen
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
caesar cowards die many times before their deaths
the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that i yet have heard
it seems to me most strange that men should fear
seeing that death a necessary end
re enter servant
what say the augurers
servant they would not have you to stir forth today
plucking the entrails of an offering forth
they could not find a heart within the beast
caesar the gods do this in shame of cowardice
caesar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at home today for fear
no caesar shall not danger knows full well
we are two lions litter'd in one day
and i the elder and more terrible
and caesar shall go forth
calpurnia alas my lord
your wisdom is consumed in confidence
do not go forth today call it my fear
that keeps you in the house and not your own
we'll send mark antony to the senate house
and he shall say you are not well today
caesar mark antony shall say i am not well
and for thy humor i will stay at home
enter decius
here's decius brutus he shall tell them so
decius caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
i come to fetch you to the senate house
caesar and you are come in very happy time
to bear my greeting to the senators
and tell them that i will not come today
i will not come today tell them so decius
calpurnia say he is sick
caesar shall caesar send a lie
have i in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
decius go tell them caesar will not come
decius most mighty caesar let me know some cause
lest i be laugh'd at when i tell them so
caesar the cause is in my will i will not come
but for your private satisfaction
because i love you i will let you know
calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
she dreamt tonight she saw my statue
which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
did run pure blood and many lusty romans
came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
and these does she apply for warnings and portents
and evils imminent and on her knee
decius this dream is all amiss interpreted
it was a vision fair and fortunate
your statue spouting blood in many pipes
in which so many smiling romans bathed
signifies that from you great rome shall suck
reviving blood and that great men shall press
for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by calpurnia's dream is signified
caesar and this way have you well expounded it
and know it now the senate have concluded
to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
if you shall send them word you will not come
their minds may change besides it were a mock
apt to be render'd for someone to say
break up the senate till another time
when caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams
if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
lo caesar is afraid
to your proceeding bids me tell you this
and reason to my love is liable
caesar how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
i am ashamed i did yield to them
give me my robe for i will go
enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca
trebonius and cinna
and look where publius is come to fetch me
publius good morrowcaesar
what brutus are you stirr'd so early too
good morrow casca caius ligarius

brutus caesar 'tis strucken eight
caesar i thank you for your pains and courtesy
enter antony
see antony that revels long o' nights
antony so to most noble caesar
caesar bid them prepare within

remember that you call on me today
be near me that i may remember you
trebonius caesar i will aside and so near will i be
that your best friends shall wish i had been further
and we like friends will straightway go together
brutus aside that every like is not the same o caesar
the heart of brutus yearns to think upon exeunt
scene iii
a street near the capitol
enter artemidorus reading paper
artemidorus caesar beware of brutus take heed of cassius come

scene iv
another part of the same street before the house of brutus
enter portia and lucius
portia i prithee boy run to the senate house

lucius to know my errand madam

soothsayer that i have lady if it will please caesar
to be so good to caesar as to hear me
i shall beseech him to befriend himself
soothsayer none that i know will be much that i fear may chance
good morrow to you here the street is narrow
the throng that follows caesar at the heels
of senators of praetors common suitors
will crowd a feeble man almost to death
i'll get me to a place more void and there
speak to great caesar as he comes along exit
portia i must go in ay me how weak a thing
the heart of woman is o brutus
sure the boy heard me brutus hath a suit
that caesar will not grant o i grow faint
run lucius and commend me to my lord
say i am merry come to me again
and bring me word what he doth say to thee
exeunt severally
act iii scene i
rome before the capitol the senate sitting above
a crowd of people among them artemidorus and the soothsayer
trebonius cinna antony lepidus popilius publius and others
caesar the ides of march are come
soothsayer ay caesar but not gone
a hail caesar read this schedule
decius trebonius doth desire you to o'er read
at your best leisure this his humble suit
artemidorus o caesar read mine first for mine's a suit
that touches caesar nearer read it great caesar
caesar what touches us ourself shall be last served
caesar what is the fellow mad
publius sirrah give place
cassius what urge you your petitions in the street
come to the capitol
caesar goes up to the senate house the rest follow
popilius i wish your enterprise today may thrive
cassius what enterprise popilius
popilius fare you well
advances to caesar
cassius he wish'd today our enterprise might thrive
i fear our purpose is discovered
brutus look how he makes to caesar mark him
cassius casca
be sudden for we fear prevention
brutus what shall be done if this be known
cassius or caesar never shall turn back
for i will slay myself
brutus cassius be constant
for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
cassius trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
he draws mark antony out of the way
exeunt antony and trebonius
decius where is metellus cimber let him
and presently prefer his suit to caesar
brutus he is address'd press near and second him
cinna casca you are the first that rears your hand
caesar are we all ready what is now amiss
metellus most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
metellus cimber throws before thy seat
an humble heart kneels
caesar i must prevent thee cimber
these couchings and these lowly courtesies
might fire the blood of ordinary men
and turn preordinance and first decree
into the law of children be not fond
to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
low crooked court'sies and base spaniel fawning
thy brother by decree is banished
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
will he be satisfied
metellus is there no voice more worthy than my own
to sound more sweetly in great caesar's ear
brutus i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
desiring thee that publius cimber may
have an immediate freedom of repeal
caesar what brutus
cassius pardon caesar caesar pardon
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
caesar i could be well moved if i were as you
if i could pray to move prayers would move me
of whose true fix'd and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
they are all fire and every one doth shine
but there's but one in all doth hold his place
so in the world 'tis furnish'd well with men
and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
yet in the number i do know but one
that unassailable holds on his rank
let me a little show it even in this
that i was constant cimber should be banish'd
and constant do remain to keep him so
cinna o caesar
caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus
decius great caesar
caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel
casca speak hands for me
casca first then the other conspirators
caesar et tu brute then fall caesar dies
cinna liberty freedom tyranny is dead
run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
cassius some to the common pulpits and cry out
liberty freedom and enfranchisement
brutus people and senators be not affrighted
fly not stand still ambitions debt is paid
casca go to the pulpit brutus
decius and cassius too
cinna here quite confounded with this mutiny
metellus stand fast together lest some friend of caesar's
should chance
brutus talk not of standing publius good cheer
there is no harm intended to your person
nor to no roman else so tell them publius
cassius and leave us publius lest that the people
rushing on us should do your age some mischief
brutus do so and let no man abide this deed
re enter trebonius
cassius where is antony
trebonius fled to his house amazed
men wives and children stare cry out and run
as it were doomsday
brutus fates we will know your pleasures
that we shall die we know 'tis but the time
and drawing days out that men stand upon
cassius why he that cuts off twenty years of life
brutus grant that and then is death a benefit
so are we caesar's friends that have abridged
his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop
and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood
up to the elbows and besmear our swords
then walk we forth even to the marketplace
and waving our red weapons o'er our heads
let's all cry peace freedom and liberty
cassius stoop then and wash how many ages hence
in states unborn and accents yet unknown
brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
that now on pompey's basis lies along
no worthier than the dust
cassius so oft as that shall be
so often shall the knot of us be calld
the men that gave their country liberty
decius what shall we forth
cassius ay every man away
with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
enter a servant
brutus soft who comes here a friend of antony's
servant thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
thus did mark antony bid me fall down
and being prostrate thus he bade me say
brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
say i love brutus and i honor him
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
may safely come to him and be resolved
how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
mark antony shall not love caesar dead
so well as brutus living but will follow
the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
thorough the hazards of this untrod state
with all true faith so says my master antony
brutus thy master is a wise and valiant roman
tell him so please him come unto this place
he shall be satisfied and by my honor
depart untouch'd
servant i'll fetch him presently exit
brutus i know that we shall have him well to friend
cassius i wish we may but yet have i a mind
that fears him much and my misgiving still
falls shrewdly to the purpose
re enter antony
antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
i know not gentlemen what you intend
who else must be let blood who else is rank
if i myself there is no hour so fit
as caesar's death's hour nor no instrument
of half that worth as those your swords made rich
with the most noble blood of all this world
now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years
i shall not find myself so apt to die
no place will please me so no means of death
as here by caesar and by you cut off
the choice and master spirits of this age
brutus o antony beg not your death of us
though now we must appear bloody and cruel
as by our hands and this our present act
and this the bleeding business they have done
our hearts you see not they are pitiful
and pity to the general wrong of rome
as fire drives out fire so pity pity
hath done this deed on caesar for your part
to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
of brothers' temper do receive you in
with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
in the disposing of new dignities
brutus only be patient till we have appeased
the multitude beside themselves with fear
and then we will deliver you the cause
why i that did love caesar when i struck him
have thus proceeded
antony i doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand
first marcus brutus will i shake with you
now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
though last not least in love yours good trebonius
gentlemen all alas what shall i say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
either a coward or a flatterer
that i did love thee caesar o 'tis true
if then thy spirit look upon us now
to see thy antony making his peace
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
most noble in the presence of thy corse
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
it would become me better than to close
in terms of friendship with thine enemies
pardon me julius here wast thou bay'd brave hart
here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
o world thou wast the forest to this hart
and this indeed o world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes
dost thou here lie
cassius mark antony
antony pardon me caius cassius
the enemies of caesar shall say this
then in a friend it is cold modesty
cassius i blame you not for praising caesar so
will you be prick'd in number of our friends
or shall we on and not depend on you
antony therefore i took your hands but was indeed
sway'd from the point by looking down on caesar
friends am i with you all and love you all
upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein caesar was dangerous
brutus or else were this a savage spectacle
our reasons are so full of good regard
you should be satisfied
antony that's all i seek
and am moreover suitor that i may
produce his body to the marketplace
and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
speak in the order of his funeral
brutus you shall mark antony
cassius brutus a word with you
aside to brutus you know not what you do do not consent
know you how much the people may be moved
by that which he will utter
brutus by your pardon
i will myself into the pulpit first
and show the reason of our caesar's death
what antony shall speak i will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission
and that we are contented caesar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
cassius i know not what may fall i like it not
brutus mark antony here take you caesar's body
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
but speak all good you can devise of caesar
and say you do't by our permission
else shall you not have any hand at all
about his funeral and you shall speak
in the same pulpit whereto i am going
after my speech is ended
i do desire no more
brutus prepare the body then and follow us
exeunt all but antony
antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
over thy wounds now do i prophesy
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
domestic fury and fierce civil strife
shall cumber all the parts of italy
blood and destruction shall be so in use
and dreadful objects so familiar
that mothers shall but smile when they behold
their infants quarter'd with the hands of war
all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
with ate by his side come hot from hell
shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
with carrion men groaning for burial
enter a servant
you serve octavius caesar do you not
servant i do mark antony
antony caesar did write for him to come to rome
and bid me say to you by word of mouth
o caesar sees the body
antony thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion i see is catching for mine eyes
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
began to water is thy master coming
servant he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
antony post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome
hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
into the marketplace there shall i try
in my oration how the people take
the cruel issue of these bloody men
according to the which thou shalt discourse
to young octavius of the state of things
lend me your hand exeunt with caesar's body
scene ii
enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens
citizens we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
brutus then follow me and give me audience friends
cassius go you into the other street
and part the numbers
those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here
those that will follow cassius go with him
and public reasons shall be rendered
of caesar's death
second citizen i will hear cassius and compare their reasons
when severally we hear them rendered
exit cassius with some citizens
brutus goes into the pulpit
third citizen the noble brutus is ascended silence
brutus be patient till the last
romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be
silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have
respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your
there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar's to
him i say that brutus' love to caesar was no less than his if
then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is
my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome
more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than
that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i
weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him there
is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor
bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so
rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i
offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if
any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply
all none brutus none
brutus then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar
than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is
enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was
worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death
here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had
no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a
place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i
depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i
have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country
to need my death
all live brutus live live
first citizen bring him with triumph home unto his house
second citizen give him a statue with his ancestors
fourth citizen caesar's better parts
shall be crownd in brutus
first citizen we'll bring him to his house with shouts and
empty
brutus my countrymen
second citizen peace silence brutus speaks
first citizen peace ho
brutus good countrymen let me depart alone
and for my sake stay here with antony
tending to caesar's glories which mark antony
by our permission is allow'd to make
i do entreat you not a man depart
save i alone till antony have spoke exit
first citizen stay ho and let us hear mark antony
third citizen let him go up into the public chair
we'll hear him noble antony go up
antony for brutus' sake i am beholding to you
goes into the pulpit
third citizen he says for brutus' sake
he finds himself beholding to us all
fourth citizen 'twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
first citizen this caesar was a tyrant
third citizen nay that's certain
we are blest that rome is rid of him
second citizen peace let us hear what antony can say
antony you gentle romans
all peace ho let us hear him
i come to bury caesar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them
the good is oft interred with their bones
so let it be with caesar the noble brutus
hath told you caesar was ambitious
if it were so it was a grievous fault
and grievously hath caesar answer'd it
here under leave of brutus and the rest
for brutus is an honorable man
come i to speak in caesar's funeral
he was my friend faithful and just to me
but brutus says he was ambitious
and brutus is an honorable man
he hath brought many captives home to rome
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
did this in caesar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
ambition should be made of sterner stuff
and brutus is an honorable man
you all did see that on the lupercal
i thrice presented him a kingly crown
which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
yet brutus says he was ambitious
and sure he is an honorable man
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
but here i am to speak what i do know
you all did love him once not without cause
o judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
and men have lost their reason bear with me
my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
and i must pause till it come back to me
first citizen methinks there is much reason in his sayings
second citizen if thou consider rightly of the matter
caesar has had great wrong
third citizen has he masters
i fear there will a worse come in his place
therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious
first citizen if it be found so some will dear abide it
second citizen poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
third citizen there's not a nobler man in rome than antony
fourth citizen now mark him he begins again to speak
antony but yesterday the word of caesar might
have stood against the world now lies he there
and none so poor to do him reverence
o masters if i were disposed to stir
i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
who you all know are honorable men
i will not do them wrong i rather choose
to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
than i will wrong such honorable men
but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar
i found it in his closet 'tis his will
let but the commons hear this testament
which pardon me i do not mean to read
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
yea beg a hair of him for memory
and dying mention it within their wills
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue
fourth citizen we'll hear the will read it mark antony
all the will the will we will hear caesar's will
antony have patience gentle friends i must not read it
it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
and being men hearing the will of caesar
it will inflame you it will make you mad
'tis good you know not that you are his heirs
for if you should o what would come of it
fourth citizen read the will we'll hear it antony
you shall read us the will caesar's will
antony will you be patient will you stay awhile
i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
i fear i wrong the honorable men
fourth citizen they were traitors honorable men
all the will the testament
second citizen they were villains murtherers the will
read the will
antony you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corse of caesar
and let me show you him that made the will
shall i descend and will you give me leave
all come down
he comes down from the pulpit
third citizen you shall have leave
fourth citizen a ring stand round
first citizen stand from the hearse stand from the body
second citizen room for antony most noble antony
antony nay press not so upon me stand far off
all stand back room bear back
antony if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle i remember
'twas on a summer's evening in his tent
that day he overcame the nervii
look in this place ran cassius' dagger through
see what a rent the envious casca made
through this the well beloved brutus stabb'd
and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
mark how the blood of caesar follow'd it
as rushing out of doors to be resolved
if brutus so unkindly knock'd or no
judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
this was the most unkindest cut of all
for when the noble caesar saw him stab
ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms
quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart
and in his mantle muffling up his face
even at the base of pompey's statue
which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
o what a fall was there my countrymen
whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us
o now you weep and i perceive you feel
the dint of pity these are gracious drops
kind souls what weep you when you but behold
our caesar's vesture wounded look you here
here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors
first citizen o piteous spectacle
second citizen o noble caesar
third citizen o woeful day
first citizen o most bloody sight
second citizen we will be revenged
all revenge about seek burn fire kill
slay let not a traitor live

act iv scene i
a house in rome antony octavius and lepidus seated at a table
antony these many then shall die their names are prick'd
octavius your brother too must die consent you lepidus
lepidus i do consent
octavius prick him down antony
who is your sister's son mark antony
antony he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
but lepidus go you to caesar's house
fetch the will hither and we shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies
lepidus what shall i find you here
octavius or here or at the capitol exit lepidus
antony this is a slight unmeritable man
meet to be sent on errands is it fit
one of the three to share it
octavius so you thought him
and took his voice who should be prick'd to die
in our black sentence and proscription
antony octavius i have seen more days than you
and though we lay these honors on this man
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
to groan and sweat under the business
and having brought our treasure where we will
then take we down his load and turn him off
like to the empty ass to shake his ears
and graze in commons
octavius you may do your will
but he's a tried and valiant soldier
antony so is my horse octavius and for that
i do appoint him store of provender
it is a creature that i teach to fight
his corporal motion governd by my spirit
and in some taste is lepidus but so
he must be taught and traind and bid go forth
a barren spirited fellow one that feeds
on objects arts and imitations
which out of use and staled by other men
begin his fashion do not talk of him
but as a property and now octavius
listen great things brutus and cassius
therefore let our alliance be combined
our best friends made our means stretch'd
and let us presently go sit in council
how covert matters may be best disclosed
and open perils surest answered
octavius let us do so for we are at the stake
and bay'd about with many enemies
and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
millions of mischiefs exeunt
camp near sardis before brutus' tent drum
enter brutus lucilius lucius and soldiers titinius and pindarus meet them
brutus stand ho
lucilius give the word ho and stand
brutus what now lucilius is cassius near
lucilius he is at hand and pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master
brutus he greets me well your master pindarus
in his own change or by ill officers
things done undone but if he be at hand
i shall be satisfied
pindarus i do not doubt
but that my noble master will appear
such as he is full of regard and honor
brutus he is not doubted a word lucilius
how he received you let me be resolved
lucilius with courtesy and with respect enough
but not with such familiar instances
as he hath used of old
brutus thou hast described
a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
when love begins to sicken and decay
it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
but hollow men like horses hot at hand
make gallant show and promise of their mettle
but when they should endure the bloody spur
sink in the trial comes his army on
lucilius they meant his night in sard is to be quarter'd
the greater part the horse in general
are come with cassius low march within
brutus hark he is arrived
march gently on to meet him
enter cassius and his powers
cassius stand ho
brutus stand ho speak the word along
second soldier stand
third soldier stand
cassius most noble brother you have done me wrong
brutus judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
and if not so how should i wrong a brother
cassius brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
and when you do them
brutus cassius be content
speak your griefs softly i do know you well
which should perceive nothing but love from us
let us not wrangle bid them move away
then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
and i will give you audience
cassius pindarus
bid our commanders lead their charges off
a little from this ground
brutus lucilius do you the like and let no man
come to our tent till we have done our conference
scene iii
brutus' tent
enter brutus and cassius
cassius that you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
you have condemnd and noted lucius pella
for taking bribes here of the sardians
wherein my letters praying on his side
because i knew the man were slighted off
brutus you wrong'd yourself to write in such a case
that every nice offense should bear his comment
brutus let me tell you cassius you yourself
are much condemnd to have an itching palm
to sell and mart your offices for gold
to undeservers
cassius i an itching palm
you know that you are brutus that speaks this
or by the gods this speech were else your last
brutus the name of cassius honors this corruption
cassius chastisement
brutus remember march the ides of march remember
did not great julius bleed for justice' sake
what villain touch'd his body that did stab
and not for justice what shall one of us
that struck the foremost man of all this world
but for supporting robbers shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes
and sell the mighty space of our large honors
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
than such a roman
cassius brutus bait not me
i'll not endure it you forget yourself
to hedge me in i am a soldier i
older in practice abler than yourself
to make conditions
brutus go to you are not cassius
cassius i am
cassius urge me no more i shall forget myself
have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
brutus away slight man
cassius is't possible
brutus hear me for i will speak
must i give way and room to your rash choler
shall i be frighted when a madman stares
cassius o gods ye gods must i endure all this
brutus all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
and make your bondmen tremble must i bouge
must i observe you must i stand and crouch
under your testy humor by the gods
you shall digest the venom of your spleen
though it do split you for from this day forth
i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
when you are waspish
cassius is it come to this
brutus you say you are a better soldier
and it shall please me well for mine own part
i shall be glad to learn of noble men
cassius you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
i said an elder soldier not a better
did i say better
brutus if you did i care not
cassius when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
brutus peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
cassius i durst not
cassius what durst not tempt him
brutus for your life you durst not
cassius do not presume too much upon my love
i may do that i shall be sorry for
brutus you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror cassius in your threats
for i am arm'd so strong in honesty
that they pass by me as the idle wind
which i respect not i did send to you
for i can raise no money by vile means
by heaven i had rather coin my heart
and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
by any indirection i did send
to you for gold to pay my legions
which you denied me was that done like cassius
should i have answer'd caius cassius so
when marcus brutus grows so covetous
be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
dash him to pieces
cassius i denied you not
brutus you did
cassius i did not he was but a fool
that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart
a friend should bear his friend's infirmities
but brutus makes mine greater than they are
brutus i do not till you practise them on me
brutus i do not like your faults
cassius a friendly eye could never see such faults
brutus a flatterer's would not though they do appear
as huge as high olympus
cassius come antony and young octavius come
revenge yourselves alone on cassius
for cassius is aweary of the world
hated by one he loves braved by his brother
check'd like a bondman all his faults observed
to cast into my teeth o i could weep
my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
and here my naked breast within a heart
dearer than pluto's mine richer than gold
if that thou best a roman take it forth
i that denied thee gold will give my heart
strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst cassius
be angry when you will it shall have scope
do what you will dishonor shall be humor
o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
that carries anger as the flint bears fire
who much enforced shows a hasty spark
and straight is cold again
cassius hath cassius lived
to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
when grief and blood ill temper'd vexeth him
cassius do you confess so much give me your hand
brutus and my heart too
cassius o brutus
brutus what's the matter
cassius have not you love enough to bear with me
when that rash humor which my mother gave me
makes me forgetful
brutus yes cassius and from henceforth
when you are overearnest with your brutus
poet within let me go in to see the generals
there is some grudge between 'em 'tis not meet
they be alone
lucilius within you shall not come to them
poet within nothing but death shall stay me
enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius
cassius how now what's the matter
poet for shame you generals what do you mean
love and be friends as two such men should be
cassius ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
brutus get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
cassius bear with him brutus 'tis his fashion
brutus i'll know his humor when he knows his time
what should the wars do with these jigging fools
companion hence
cassius away away be gone exit poet
brutus lucilius and titinius bid the commanders
prepare to lodge their companies tonight
immediately to us exeunt lucilius and titinius
brutus lucius a bowl of wine exit lucius
cassius i did not think you could have been so angry
brutus o cassius i am sick of many griefs
cassius of your philosophy you make no use
if you give place to accidental evils
brutus no man bears sorrow better portia is dead
cassius ha portia
brutus she is dead
o insupportable and touching loss
upon what sickness
brutus impatient of my absence
and grief that young octavius with mark antony
have made themselves so strong for with her death
that tidings came with this she fell distract
and her attendants absent swallow'd fire
cassius and died so
brutus even so
re enter lucius with wine and taper
brutus speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine
in this i bury all unkindness cassius drinks
cassius my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
i cannot drink too much of brutus' love drinks
brutus come in titinius exit lucius
re enter titinius with messala
welcome good messala
and call in question our necessities
cassius portia art thou gone
brutus no more i pray you
messala i have here received letters
that young octavius and mark antony
come down upon us with a mighty power
bending their expedition toward philippi
messala myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
brutus with what addition
octavius antony and lepidus
have put to death an hundred senators
brutus there in our letters do not well agree
mine speak of seventy senators that died
by their proscriptions cicero being one
cassius cicero one
messala cicero is dead
and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord
messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her
brutus nothing messala
messala that methinks is strange
brutus why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
messala no my lord
brutus now as you are a roman tell me true
messala then like a roman bear the truth i tell
for certain she is dead and by strange manner
brutus why farewell portia we must die messala
i have the patience to endure it now
messala even so great men great losses should endure
cassius i have as much of this in art as you
but yet my nature could not bear it so
brutus well to our work alive what do you think
of marching to philippi presently
cassius i do not think it good
brutus your reason
cassius this it is
so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
doing himself offense whilst we lying still
are full of rest defense and nimbleness
brutus good reasons must of force give place to better
the people 'twixt philippi and this ground
do stand but in a forced affection
for they have grudged us contribution
the enemy marching along by them
by them shall make a fuller number up
from which advantage shall we cut him off
if at philippi we do face him there
these people at our back
cassius hear me good brother
brutus under your pardon you must note beside
that we have tried the utmost of our friends
our legions are brim full our cause is ripe
the enemy increaseth every day
we at the height are ready to decline
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
omitted all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries
on such a full sea are we now afloat
and we must take the current when it serves
or lose our ventures
cassius then with your will go on
we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi
brutus the deep of night is crept upon our talk
which we will niggard with a little rest
there is no more to say
cassius no more good night
early tomorrow will we rise and hence
brutus lucius
re enter lucius

bid him set on his powers betimes before
and we will follow
act v scene i
the plains of philippi
enter octavius antony and their army
octavius now antony our hopes are answered
you said the enemy would not come down
but keep the hills and upper regions
it proves not so their battles are at hand
they mean to warn us at philippi here
answering before we do demand of them
wherefore they do it they could be content
to visit other places and come down
with fearful bravery thinking by this face
to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
but 'tis not so
enter a messenger
messenger prepare you generals
the enemy comes on in gallant show
their bloody sign of battle is hung out
antony octavius lead your battle softly on
upon the left hand of the even field
octavius upon the right hand i keep thou the left
antony why do you cross me in this exigent
octavius i do not cross you but i will do so
march drum enter brutus cassius and their army
lucilius titinius messala and others
brutus they stand and would have parley
cassius stand fast titinius we must out and talk
antony no caesar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words
octavius stir not until the signal not until the signal
brutus words before blows is it so countrymen
octavius not that we love words better as you do
brutus good words are better than bad strokes octavius
antony in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
witness the hole you made in caesar's heart
crying long live hail caesar
the posture of your blows are yet unknown
but for your words they rob the hybla bees
and leave them honeyless
antony not stingless too
brutus o yes and soundless too
for you have stoln their buzzing antony
and very wisely threat before you sting
antony villains you did not so when your vile daggers
hack'd one another in the sides of caesar
and bow'd like bondmen kissing caesar's feet
whilst damned casca like a cur behind
strooke caesar on the neck o you flatterers
cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself
this tongue had not offended so today
if cassius might have ruled
octavius come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
the proof of it will turn to redder drops
empty
when think you that the sword goes up again
never till caesar's three and thirty wounds
be well avenged or till another caesar
have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
brutus caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands
unless thou bring'st them with thee
octavius so i hope
i was not born to die on brutus' sword
brutus o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
cassius a peevish school boy worthless of such honor
joind with a masker and a reveler
antony old cassius still
octavius come antony away
defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
if you dare fight today come to the field
if not when you have stomachs
exeunt octavius antony and their army
cassius why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
brutus ho lucilius hark a word with you
lucilius stands forth my lord
brutus and lucilius converse apart
cassius messala
messala stands forth what says my general
cassius messala
this is my birthday as this very day
was cassius born give me thy hand messala
be thou my witness that against my will
upon one battle all our liberties
you know that i held epicurus strong
and his opinion now i change my mind
and partly credit things that do presage
coming from sardis on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd
gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands
who to philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away and gone
fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal under which
our army lies ready to give up the ghost
messala believe not so
cassius i but believe it partly
for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
to meet all perils very constantly
brutus even so lucilius
the gods today stand friendly that we may
lovers in peace lead on our days to age
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
let's reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this
the very last time we shall speak together
what are you then determined to do
brutus even by the rule of that philosophy
by which i did blame cato for the death
but i do find it cowardly and vile
for fear of what might fall so to prevent
the time of life arming myself with patience
to stay the providence of some high powers
that govern us below
cassius then if we lose this battle
you are contented to be led in triumph
thorough the streets of rome
brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman
he bears too great a mind but this same day
must end that work the ides of march begun
and whether we shall meet again i know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take
forever and forever farewell cassius
if we do meet again why we shall smile
if not why then this parting was well made
cassius forever and forever farewell brutus
if we do meet again we'll smile indeed
brutus why then lead on o that a man might know
the end of this day's business ere it come
but it sufficeth that the day will end
and then the end is known come ho away exeunt
scene ii
the field of battle
alarum enter brutus and messala
brutus ride ride messala ride and give these bills
unto the legions on the other side loud alarum
but cold demeanor in octavia's wing
and sudden push gives them the overthrow
ride ride messala let them all come down exeunt
scene iii
another part of the field
alarums enter cassius and titinius
cassius o look titinius look the villains fly
myself have to mine own turnd enemy
this ensign here of mine was turning back
titinius o cassius brutus gave the word too early
who having some advantage on octavius
took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
whilst we by antony are all enclosed
enter pindarus
pindarus fly further off my lord fly further off
mark antony is in your tents my lord
fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
cassius this hill is far enough look look titinius
titinius they are my lord
cassius titinius if thou lovest me
mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
and here again that i may rest assured
whether yond troops are friend or enemy
titinius i will be here again even with a thought exit
cassius go pindarus get higher on that hill
my sight was ever thick regard titinius
pindarus ascends the hill
this day i breathed first time is come round
and where i did begin there shall i end
my life is run his compass sirrah what news
pindarus above o my lord
cassius what news
pindarus above titinius is enclosed round about
with horsemen that make to him on the spur
yet he spurs on now they are almost on him
he's ta'en shout and hark they shout for joy
cassius come down behold no more
o coward that i am to live so long
to see my best friend ta'en before my face
pindarus descends
come hither sirrah
in parthia did i take thee prisoner
and then i swore thee saving of thy life
that whatsoever i did bid thee do
now be a freeman and with this good sword
that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom
stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
and when my face is cover'd as 'tis now
guide thou the sword pindarus stabs him caesar thou art
empty
even with the sword that killd thee dies
pindarus so i am free yet would not so have been
durst i have done my will o cassius
where never roman shall take note of him exit
re enter titinius with messala
messala it is but change titinius for octavius
is overthrown by noble brutus' power
as cassius' legions are by antony
titinius these tidings would well comfort cassius
messala where did you leave him
titinius all disconsolate
with pindarus his bondman on this hill
titinius he lies not like the living o my heart
messala is not that he
titinius no this was he messala
but cassius is no more o setting sun
as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
so in his red blood cassius' day is set
the sun of rome is set our day is gone
clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
mistrust of my success hath done this deed
o hateful error melancholy's child
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
the things that are not o error soon conceived
thou never comest unto a happy birth
but killst the mother that engender'd thee
titinius what pindarus where art thou pindarus
messala seek him titinius whilst i go to meet
the noble brutus thrusting this report
into his ears i may say thrusting it
shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
as tidings of this sight
titinius hie you messala
and i will seek for pindarus the while exit messala
why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
did i not meet thy friends and did not they
put on my brows this wreath of victory
and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts
alas thou hast misconstrued everything
thy brutus bid me give it thee and i
will do his bidding brutus come apace
and see how i regarded caius cassius
by your leave gods this is a romans part
come cassius' sword and find titinius' heart
kills himself
alarum re enter messala with brutus young cato
and others
brutus where where messala doth his body lie
brutus titinius' face is upward
cato he is slain
brutus o julius caesar thou art mighty yet
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
in our own proper entrails low alarums
cato brave titinius
look whe'er he have not crownd dead cassius
brutus are yet two romans living such as these
the last of all the romans fare thee well
should breed thy fellow friends i owe moe tears
to this dead man than you shall see me pay
i shall find time cassius i shall find time
come therefore and to thasos send his body
his funerals shall not be in our camp
lest it discomfort us lucilius come
and come young cato let us to the field
labio and flavio set our battles on
'tis three o'clock and romans yet ere night

messala octavius then take him to follow thee
that did the latest service to my master
all the conspirators save only he
did that they did in envy of great caesar
he only in a general honest thought
and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements
so mix'd in him that nature might stand up
and say to all the world this was a man
octavius according to his virtue let us use him
with all respect and rites of burial
most like a soldier ordered honorably
so call the field to rest and let's away

glou i shall my liege
exeunt gloucester and edmund
lear meantime we shall express our darker purpose
give me the map there know we have divided
in three our kingdom and 'tis our fast intent
to shake all cares and business from our age
conferring them on younger strengths while we
unburthend crawl toward death our son of cornwall
and you our no less loving son of albany
our daughters' several dowers that future strife
may be prevented now the princes france and burgundy
great rivals in our youngest daughter's love
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
and here are to be answer'd tell me my daughters
since now we will divest us both of rule
interest of territory cares of state
which of you shall we say doth love us most
that we our largest bounty may extend
our eldest born speak first
gon sir i love you more than words can wield the matter
dearer than eyesight space and liberty
beyond what can be valued rich or rare
no less than life with grace health beauty honour
as much as child e'er lov'd or father found
a love that makes breath poor and speech unable
beyond all manner of so much i love you
cor aside what shall cordelia speak love and be silent
with shadowy forests and with champains rich'd
with plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads
we make thee lady to thine and albany's issue
be this perpetual what says our second daughter
our dearest regan wife to cornwall speak
reg sir i am made
of the selfsame metal that my sister is
and prize me at her worth in my true heart
i find she names my very deed of love
myself an enemy to all other joys
which the most precious square of sense possesses
and find i am alone felicitate
in your dear highness' love
cor aside then poor cordelia
and yet not so since i am sure my love's
more richer than my tongue
lear to thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
than that conferr'd on goneril now our joy
although the last not least to whose young love
the vines of france and milk of burgundy
strive to be interest what can you say to draw
a third more opulent than your sisters speak
cor nothing my lord
lear nothing
cor nothing
lear nothing can come of nothing speak again
my heart into my mouth i love your majesty
according to my bond no more nor less
lear how how cordelia mend your speech a little
lest it may mar your fortunes
cor good my lord
you have begot me bred me lov'd me i
return those duties back as are right fit
obey you love you and most honour you
why have my sisters husbands if they say
that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
half my love with him half my care and duty
sure i shall never marry like my sisters
to love my father all
lear but goes thy heart with this
cor ay good my lord
lear so young and so untender
cor so young my lord and true
lear let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
the mysteries of hecate and the night
by all the operation of the orbs
from whom we do exist and cease to be
here i disclaim all my paternal care
propinquity and property of blood
and as a stranger to my heart and me
hold thee from this for ever the barbarous scythian
or he that makes his generation messes
to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
as thou my sometime daughter
kent good my liege
lear peace kent
come not between the dragon and his wrath
i lov'd her most and thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery hence and avoid my sight
so be my grave my peace as here i give
her father's heart from her call france who stirs
call burgundy cornwall and albany
let pride which she calls plainness marry her
i do invest you jointly in my power
preeminence and all the large effects
that troop with majesty ourself by monthly course
with reservation of an hundred knights
by you to be sustaind shall our abode
make with you by due turns only we still retain
the name and all th' additions to a king the sway
revenue execution of the rest
this coronet part betwixt you
kent royal lear
whom i have ever honour'd as my king
lov'd as my father as my master follow'd
as my great patron thought on in my prayers
lear the bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
kent let it fall rather though the fork invade
the region of my heart be kent unmannerly
when lear is mad what wouldst thou do old man
when power to flattery bows to plainness honour's bound
when majesty falls to folly reverse thy doom
and in thy best consideration check
this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
nor are those empty hearted whose low sound
reverbs no hollowness
lear kent on thy life no more
kent my life i never held but as a pawn
thy safety being the motive
lear out of my sight
kent see better lear and let me still remain
the true blank of thine eye
lear now by apollo
kent now by apollo king
thou swear'st thy gods in vain
lear o vassal miscreant
lays his hand on his sword
kent do
kill thy physician and the fee bestow
upon the foul disease revoke thy gift
or whilst i can vent clamour from my throat
i'll tell thee thou dost evil
lear hear me recreant
on thine allegiance hear me
since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
which we durst never yet and with straind pride
which nor our nature nor our place can bear
our potency made good take thy reward
five days we do allot thee for provision
to shield thee from diseases of the world
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back
upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following
thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions
the moment is thy death away by jupiter
this shall not be revok'd
freedom lives hence and banishment is here
to cordelia the gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
that justly think'st and hast most rightly said
to regan and goneril and your large speeches may your deeds
empty
that good effects may spring from words of love
thus kent o princes bids you all adieu

empty
glou here's france and burgundy my noble lord
lear my lord of burgundy
we first address toward you who with this king
hath rivalld for our daughter what in the least
will you require in present dower with her
or cease your quest of love
bur most royal majesty
i crave no more than hath your highness offer'd
nor will you tender less
when she was dear to us we did hold her so
but now her price is falln sir there she stands
if aught within that little seeming substance
or all of it with our displeasure piec'd
and nothing more may fitly like your grace
she's there and she is yours
bur i know no answer
lear will you with those infirmities she owes
unfriended new adopted to our hate
take her or leave her
bur pardon me royal sir
election makes not up on such conditions
lear then leave her sir for by the pow'r that made me
i tell you all her wealth to france for you great king
i would not from your love make such a stray
to match you where i hate therefore beseech you
t' avert your liking a more worthier way
than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
france this is most strange
that she that even but now was your best object
the argument of your praise balm of your age
most best most dearest should in this trice of time
commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
so many folds of favour sure her offence
must be of such unnatural degree
that monsters it or your fore vouch'd affection
falln into taint which to believe of her
should never plant in me
cor i yet beseech your majesty
if for i want that glib and oily art
to speak and purpose not since what i well intend
i'll do't before i speak that you make known
it is no vicious blot murther or foulness
no unchaste action or dishonoured step
that hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour
but even for want of that for which i am richer
as i am glad i have not though not to have it
hath lost me in your liking
lear better thou
hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better
france is it but this a tardiness in nature
which often leaves the history unspoke
that it intends to do my lord of burgundy
what say you to the lady love's not love
when it is mingled with regards that stands
she is herself a dowry
bur royal lear
give but that portion which yourself propos'd
and here i take cordelia by the hand
duchess of burgundy
lear nothing i have sworn i am firm
bur i am sorry then you have so lost a father
that you must lose a husband
cor peace be with burgundy
i shall not be his wife
france fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor
most choice forsaken and most lov'd despis'd
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon
be it lawful i take up what's cast away
gods gods 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
my love should kindle to inflam'd respect
thy dow'rless daughter king thrown to my chance
is queen of us of ours and our fair france
can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me
bid them farewell cordelia though unkind
thou losest here a better where to find
lear thou hast her france let her be thine for we
have no such daughter nor shall ever see
that face of hers again therefore be gone
without our grace our love our benison
come noble burgundy
flourish exeunt lear burgundy cornwall albany
france bid farewell to your sisters
cor the jewels of our father with wash'd eyes
cordelia leaves you i know you what you are
and like a sister am most loath to call
your faults as they are nam'd use well our father
to your professed bosoms i commit him
but yet alas stood i within his grace
i would prefer him to a better place
so farewell to you both
reg let your study
be to content your lord who hath receiv'd you
at fortune's alms you have obedience scanted
and well are worth the want that you have wanted
cor time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides
who cover faults at last shame them derides
well may you prosper
france come my fair cordelia
exeunt france and cordelia
appertains to us both i think our father will hence to night
reg that's most certain and with you next month with us
gon you see how full of changes his age is the observation we
have made of it hath not been little he always lov'd our
sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly
reg 'tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself
gon the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then
imperfections of long ingraffed condition but therewithal
the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with
empty
reg such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
of kent's banishment
gon there is further compliment of leave taking between france and
him pray you let's hit together if our father carry authority
with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his
will but offend us

my mind as generous and my shape as true
as honest madam's issue why brand they us

edm i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter from my brother
that i have not all o'er read and for so much as i have
perus'd i find it not fit for your o'erlooking
glou give me the letter sir
edm i shall offend either to detain or give it the contents as
in part i understand them are to blame
glou let's see let's see
an essay or taste of my virtue
glou reads 'this policy and reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them i begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways
not as it hath power but as it is suffer'd come to me that
of this i may speak more if our father would sleep till i
wak'd him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live

his revenue' my son edgar had he a hand to write this a heart
and brain to breed it in when came this to you who brought it
edm it was not brought me my lord there's the cunning of it i
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet

but in respect of that i would fain think it were not
glou it is his
empty
glou hath he never before sounded you in this business
edm never my lord but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father
should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue

villain unnatural detested brutish villain worse than
brutish go sirrah seek him i'll apprehend him abominable
villain where is he
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course
where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his
purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour and to no other pretence of danger
glou think you so
edm if your honour judge it meet i will place you where you shall
satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very
empty

you frame the business after your own wisdom i would unstate
myself to be in a due resolution
edm i will seek him sir presently convey the business as i
glou these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to
us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet
nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects love cools
friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in
countries discord in palaces treason and the bond crack'd
'twixt son and father this villain of mine comes under the
prediction there's son against father the king falls from bias
of nature there's father against child we have seen the best
of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all
this villain edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it
carefully and the noble and true hearted kent banish'd his
offence honesty 'tis strange exit

sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make
guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if
we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion
knaves thieves and treachers by spherical pre dominance
drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
thrusting on an admirable evasion of whore master man to lay
his goatish disposition to the charge of a star my father

rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay

which shall be needful for your entertainment

to wage against the enmity o' th' air
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl
necessity's sharp pinch return with her

to knee his throne and squire like pension beg
to keep base life afoot return with her
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
to this detested groom points at oswald
gon at your choice sir
lear i prithee daughter do not make me mad
i will not trouble thee my child farewell
we'll no more meet no more see one another
or rather a disease that's in my flesh
which i must needs call mine thou art a boil
a plague sore an embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted blood but i'll not chide thee
let shame come when it will i do not call it
i do not bid the thunder bearer shoot
nor tell tales of thee to high judging jove
mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
i can be patient i can stay with regan
reg not altogether so
i look'd not for you yet nor am provided
for your fit welcome give ear sir to my sister
for those that mingle reason with your passion
must be content to think you old and so
but she knows what she does
lear is this well spoken
reg i dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
is it not well what should you need of more

you heavens give me that patience patience i need

thrond and set high servants who seem no less
which are to france the spies and speculations
either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
or the hard rein which both of them have borne
against the old kind king or something deeper
whereof perchance these are but furnishings

prophecy ere i go

when every case in law is right
no squire in debt nor no poor knight
when slanders do not live in tongues
nor cutpurses come not to throngs
when usurers tell their gold i' th' field
and bawds and whores do churches build
come to great confusion

how have you known the miseries of your father
edg by nursing them my lord list a brief tale
and when 'tis told o that my heart would burst
the bloody proclamation to escape
that follow'd me so near o our lives' sweetness
that with the pain of death would hourly die
rather than die at once taught me to shift
that very dogs disdaind and in this habit
met i my father with his bleeding rings
their precious stones new lost became his guide
led him begg'd for him sav'd him from despair
never o fault reveald myself unto him
until some half hour past when i was arm'd
not sure though hoping of this good success
i ask'd his blessing and from first to last
told him my pilgrimage but his flaw'd heart
'twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
burst smilingly
edm this speech of yours hath mov'd me
and shall perchance do good but speak you on
you look as you had something more to say
alb if there be more more woful hold it in
for i am almost ready to dissolve
hearing of this
edg this would have seem'd a period
to amplify too much would make much more
and top extremity
whilst i was big in clamour came there a man
who having seen me in my worst estate
shunnd my abhorr'd society but then finding
who 'twas that so endur'd with his strong arms
he fastened on my neck and bellowed out
as he'd burst heaven threw him on my father
told the most piteous tale of lear and him
his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
and there i left him tranc'd
alb but who was this
edg kent sir the banish'd kent who in disguise
followed his enemy king and did him service
improper for a slave

act i scene i
navarre the king's park
enter the king berowne longaville and dumain
king let fame that all hunt after in their lives
live regist'red upon our brazen tombs
and then grace us in the disgrace of death
when spite of cormorant devouring time
th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
and make us heirs of all eternity
therefore brave conquerors for so you are
that war against your own affections
and the huge army of the world's desires
our late edict shall strongly stand in force
navarre shall be the wonder of the world
our court shall be a little academe
still and contemplative in living art
you three berowne dumain and longaville
my fellow scholars and to keep those statutes
that are recorded in this schedule here
your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names
that his own hand may strike his honour down
that violates the smallest branch herein
if you are arm'd to do as sworn to do
subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
longaville i am resolv'd 'tis but a three years' fast
the mind shall banquet though the body pine
make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
dumain my loving lord dumain is mortified
the grosser manner of these world's delights
he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
with all these living in philosophy
berowne i can but say their protestation over
so much dear liege i have already sworn
that is to live and study here three years
as not to see a woman in that term
which i hope well is not enrolled there
and one day in a week to touch no food
and but one meal on every day beside
the which i hope is not enrolled there
and then to sleep but three hours in the night
and not be seen to wink of all the day
when i was wont to think no harm all night
and make a dark night too of half the day
o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
not to see ladies study fast not sleep
king your oath is pass'd to pass away from these
berowne let me say no my liege an if you please
i only swore to study with your grace
and stay here in your court for three years' space
longaville you swore to that berowne and to the rest
berowne by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
what is the end of study let me know
berowne things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense
king ay that is study's god like recompense
berowne come on then i will swear to study so
to know the thing i am forbid to know
as thus to study where i well may dine
when i to feast expressly am forbid
or study where to meet some mistress fine
when mistresses from common sense are hid
or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
if study's gain be thus and this be so
study knows that which yet it doth not know
swear me to this and i will ne'er say no
king these be the stops that hinder study quite
and train our intellects to vain delight
berowne why all delights are vain but that most vain
which with pain purchas'd doth inherit pain
as painfully to pore upon a book
to seek the light of truth while truth the while
light seeking light doth light of light beguile
so ere you find where light in darkness lies
your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
study me how to please the eye indeed
by fixing it upon a fairer eye
who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
and give him light that it was blinded by
study is like the heavens glorious sun
that will not be deep search'd with saucy looks
save base authority from others' books
these earthly godfathers of heavens lights
that give a name to every fixed star
have no more profit of their shining nights
than those that walk and wot not what they are
too much to know is to know nought but fame
and every godfather can give a name
king how well he's read to reason against reading
dumain proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
berowne the spring is near when green geese are a breeding
dumain how follows that
berowne fit in his place and time
dumain in reason nothing
berowne something then in rhyme
longaville berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
that bites the first born infants of the spring
berowne well say i am why should proud summer boast
before the birds have any cause to sing
at christmas i no more desire a rose
than wish a snow in may's new fangled shows
but like of each thing that in season grows
so you to study now it is too late
climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate
king well sit out go home berowne adieu
berowne no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
and though i have for barbarism spoke more
than for that angel knowledge you can say
and bide the penance of each three years' day
give me the paper let me read the same
and to the strictest decrees i'll write my name
king how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
berowne reads 'item that no woman shall come within a mile of
my court' hath this been proclaimed
longaville four days ago
berowne let's see the penalty reads ' on pain of losing her
tongue' who devis'd this penalty
berowne sweet lord and why
longaville to fright them hence with that dread penalty
berowne a dangerous law against gentility
reads 'item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within
the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the
rest of the court can possibly devise'
this article my liege yourself must break
for well you know here comes in embassy
the french king's daughter with yourself to speak
about surrender up of aquitaine
to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
therefore this article is made in vain
or vainly comes th' admired princess hither
king what say you lords why this was quite forgot
berowne so study evermore is over shot
while it doth study to have what it would
it doth forget to do the thing it should
and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
king we must of force dispense with this decree
she must lie here on mere necessity
berowne necessity will make us all forsworn
three thousand times within this three years' space
for every man with his affects is born
not by might mast'red but by special grace
if i break faith this word shall speak for me
i am forsworn on mere necessity
so to the laws at large i write my name subscribes
stands in attainder of eternal shame
suggestions are to other as to me
but i believe although i seem so loath
i am the last that will last keep his oath
but is there no quick recreation granted
king ay that there is our court you know is haunted
with a refined traveller of spain
a man in all the world's new fashion planted
that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
doth ravish like enchanting harmony
a man of complements whom right and wrong
have chose as umpire of their mutiny
this child of fancy that armado hight
for interim to our studies shall relate
in high born words the worth of many a knight
from tawny spain lost in the world's debate
how you delight my lords i know not i
but i protest i love to hear him lie
berowne armado is a most illustrious wight
a man of fire new words fashions own knight
longaville costard the swain and he shall be our sport
and so to study three years is but short
enter dull a constable with a letter and costard
dull which is the duke's own person
berowne this fellow what wouldst
dull i myself reprehend his own person for i am his grace's
farborough but i would see his own person in flesh and blood
dull signior arme arme commends you there's villainy abroad
this letter will tell you more
costard sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
king a letter from the magnificent armado
berowne how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words
longaville a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience
berowne to hear or forbear hearing
longaville to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
forbear both
in the merriness
costard the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta
the manner of it is i was taken with the manner
berowne in what manner
costard in manner and form following sir all those three i was
seen with her in the manor house sitting with her upon the form
and taken following her into the park which put together is in
manner and form following now sir for the manner it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form in some form
costard as it shall follow in my correction and god defend the
empty
king will you hear this letter with attention
berowne as we would hear an oracle
costard such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
king reads 'great deputy the welkins vicegerent and sole
dominator of navarre my souls earth's god and body's fost'ring
empty
costard not a word of costard yet
costard it may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling
true but so
king peace
costard be to me and every man that dares not fight
king no words
costard of other mens secrets i beseech you
king reads 'so it is besieged with sable coloured melancholy i
did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome
physic of thy health giving air and as i am a gentleman betook
most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment
which is called supper so much for the time when now for the
ground which which i mean i upon it is ycleped thy park then
for the place where where i mean i did encounter that obscene
and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow white pen
the ebon coloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest
surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth
north north east and by east from the west corner of thy
curious knotted garden there did i see that low spirited swain
costard me
king 'that unlettered small knowing soul'
costard me
king 'that shallow vassal'
costard still me
king 'which as i remember hight costard'
costard o me
king 'sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed
edict and continent canon which with o with but with this i
costard with a wench

more sweet understanding a woman him i as my ever esteemed
duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of
punishment by thy sweet grace's officer antony dull a man of
good repute carriage bearing and estimation'
dull me ant shall please you i am antony dull
king 'for jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which i
apprehended with the aforesaid swain i keep her as a vessel of

heart burning heat of duty
don adriano de armado'
berowne this is not so well as i look'd for but the best that
ever i heard
king ay the best for the worst but sirrah what say you to
empty
costard sir i confess the wench
king did you hear the proclamation
marking of it
king it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
empty
costard i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel
king well it was proclaimed damsel
costard this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
king it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin
costard if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid
king this 'maid' not serve your turn sir
king sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week
with bran and water
costard i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
king and don armado shall be your keeper
my lord berowne see him delivered o'er
and go we lords to put in practice that
which each to other hath so strongly sworn
exeunt king longaville and dumain
berowne i'll lay my head to any good mans hat
sirrah come on
costard i suffer for the truth sir for true it is i was taken
with jaquenetta and jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore
welcome the sour cup of prosperity affliction may one day smile
again and till then sit thee down sorrow

moth a great sign sir that he will look sad
armado why sadness is one and the self same thing dear imp
moth no no o lord sir no
armado how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender
empty
moth by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough signior
armado why tough signior why tough signior
moth why tender juvenal why tender juvenal
appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender
moth and i tough signior as an appertinent title to your old
time which we may name tough
armado pretty and apt
moth how mean you sir i pretty and my saying apt or i apt and
my saying pretty
armado thou pretty because little
moth little pretty because little wherefore apt
armado and therefore apt because quick
armado in thy condign praise
moth i will praise an eel with the same praise
armado that an eel is ingenious
moth that an eel is quick
armado i do say thou art quick in answers thou heat'st my blood
moth i am answer'd sir
armado i love not to be cross'd
moth aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
armado i have promised to study three years with the duke
armado impossible
moth how many is one thrice told
armado i am ill at reck'ning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
moth you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
armado i confess both they are both the varnish of a complete
empty
moth then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce ace
amounts to
armado it doth amount to one more than two
armado true
moth why sir is this such a piece of study now here is three
studied ere ye'll thrice wink and how easy it is to put 'years'
to the word 'three' and study three years in two words the
dancing horse will tell you
armado a most fine figure
moth aside to prove you a cipher
armado i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is base for
a soldier to love so am i in love with a base wench if drawing
the reprobate thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
ransom him to any french courtier for a new devis'd curtsy i
think scorn to sigh methinks i should out swear cupid comfort
me boy what great men have been in love
moth hercules master
armado most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name more
and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriage
moth samson master he was a man of good carriage great
carriage for he carried the town gates on his back like a
armado o well knit samson strong jointed samson i do excel thee
in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates i am in
love too who was samsons love my dear moth
moth a woman master
armado of what complexion
moth of all the four or the three or the two or one of the
empty
armado tell me precisely of what complexion
moth of the sea water green sir
moth as i have read sir and the best of them too
armado green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love
of that colour methinks samson had small reason for it he
surely affected her for her wit
moth it was so sir for she had a green wit
armado my love is most immaculate white and red
moth most maculate thoughts master are mask'd under such
empty
armado define define well educated infant
armado sweet invocation of a child most pretty and pathetical
moth if she be made of white and red
her faults will ne'er be known
for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
and fears by pale white shown
then if she fear or be to blame
by this you shall not know
for still her cheeks possess the same
which native she doth owe
armado is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
moth the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
since but i think now 'tis not to be found or if it were it
would neither serve for the writing nor the tune
armado i will have that subject newly writ o'er that i may
example my digression by some mighty precedent boy i do love
that country girl that i took in the park with the rational hind
costard she deserves well
moth aside to be whipt and yet a better love than my master
moth and that's great marvel loving a light wench
armado i say sing
moth forbear till this company be past
enter dull costard and jaquenetta
dull sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep costard safe and
you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance but 'a
must fast three days a week for this damsel i must keep her at
the park she is allow'd for the day woman fare you well
armado i do betray myself with blushing maid
armado i will visit thee at the lodge
jaquenetta that's hereby
armado i know where it is situate
jaquenetta lord how wise you are
armado i will tell thee wonders
jaquenetta with that face
armado i love thee
jaquenetta so i heard you say
armado and so farewell
dull come jaquenetta away exit with jaquenetta
armado villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
empty
costard well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a full
empty
armado thou shalt be heavily punished
costard i am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but
lightly rewarded
armado take away this villain shut him up
costard let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose
moth no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison
costard well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation that i
have seen some shall see
moth what shall some see
costard nay nothing master moth but what they look upon it is
not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore
i will say nothing i thank god i have as little patience as
another man and therefore i can be quiet
armado i do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe
which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread
i shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if i
love and how can that be true love which is falsely attempted
love is a familiar love is a devil there is no evil angel but
love yet was samson so tempted and he had an excellent
strength yet was solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit

too much odds for a spaniard's rapier the first and second cause

the park
enter the princess of france with three attending ladies
boyet now madam summon up your dearest spirits
consider who the king your father sends
to whom he sends and what's his embassy
yourself held precious in the world's esteem
to parley with the sole inheritor
of all perfections that a man may owe
matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
be now as prodigal of all dear grace
when she did starve the general world beside
and prodigally gave them all to you
princess of france good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
needs not the painted flourish of your praise
beauty is bought by judgment of the eye
not utt'red by base sale of chapmens tongues
i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
than you much willing to be counted wise
in spending your wit in the praise of mine
you are not ignorant all telling fame
doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
till painful study shall outwear three years
no woman may approach his silent court
therefore to's seemeth it a needful course
before we enter his forbidden gates
to know his pleasure and in that behalf
bold of your worthiness we single you
as our best moving fair solicitor
on serious business craving quick dispatch
importunes personal conference with his grace
haste signify so much while we attend
like humble visag'd suitors his high will
boyet proud of employment willingly i go
princess of france all pride is willing pride and yours is so
exit boyet
who are the votaries my loving lords
that are vow fellows with this virtuous duke
princess of france know you the man
maria i know him madam at a marriage feast
between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
of jaques falconbridge solemnized
in normandy saw i this longaville
a man of sovereign parts peerless esteem'd
well fitted in arts glorious in arms
nothing becomes him ill that he would well
the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will
whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
it should none spare that come within his power
princess of france some merry mocking lord belike is't so
maria they say so most that most his humours know
princess of france such short liv'd wits do wither as they grow
who are the rest
katharine the young dumain a well accomplish'd youth
of all that virtue love for virtue loved
for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
and shape to win grace though he had no wit
i saw him at the duke alencons once
and much too little of that good i saw
is my report to his great worthiness
rosaline another of these students at that time
was there with him if i have heard a truth
berowne they call him but a merrier man
within the limit of becoming mirth
his eye begets occasion for his wit
for every object that the one doth catch
the other turns to a mirth moving jest
which his fair tongue conceit's expositor
delivers in such apt and gracious words
that aged ears play truant at his tales
and younger hearings are quite ravished
so sweet and voluble is his discourse
princess of france god bless my ladies are they all in love
with such bedecking ornaments of praise
first lord here comes boyet
re enter boyet
princess of france now what admittance lord
boyet navarre had notice of your fair approach
and he and his competitors in oath
were all address'd to meet you gentle lady
before i came marry thus much i have learnt
he rather means to lodge you in the field
than seek a dispensation for his oath
to let you enter his unpeopled house
the ladies in waiting mask
enter king longaville dumain berowne
and attendants
here comes navarre
king fair princess welcome to the court of navarre
princess of france 'fair' i give you back again and 'welcome' i
have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours and
king you shall be welcome madam to my court
princess of france i will be welcome then conduct me thither
king hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath
princess of france our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn
king not for the world fair madam by my will
princess of france why will shall break it will and nothing
empty
king your ladyship is ignorant what it is
princess of france were my lord so his ignorance were wise
i hear your grace hath sworn out house keeping
'tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
and sin to break it
but pardon me i am too sudden bold
to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
and suddenly resolve me in my suit giving a paper
king madam i will if suddenly i may
princess of france you will the sooner that i were away
berowne did not i dance with you in brabant once
katharine did not i dance with you in brabant once
berowne i know you did
katharine how needless was it then to ask the question
berowne you must not be so quick
katharine 'tis long of you that spur me with such questions
berowne your wit 's too hot it speeds too fast 'twill tire
katharine not till it leave the rider in the mire
berowne what time o' day
berowne now fair befall your mask
katharine fair fall the face it covers
berowne and send you many lovers
katharine amen so you be none
berowne nay then will i be gone
king madam your father here doth intimate
the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
being but the one half of an entire sum
disbursed by my father in his wars
receiv'd that sum yet there remains unpaid
a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
one part of aquitaine is bound to us
although not valued to the money's worth
if then the king your father will restore
but that one half which is unsatisfied
we will give up our right in aquitaine
and hold fair friendship with his majesty
but that it seems he little purposeth
a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
to have his title live in aquitaine
which we much rather had depart withal
and have the money by our father lent
than aquitaine so gelded as it is
dear princess were not his requests so far
from reasons yielding your fair self should make
a yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
princess of france you do the king my father too much wrong
and wrong the reputation of your name
in so unseeming to confess receipt
of that which hath so faithfully been paid
king i do protest i never heard of it
and if you prove it i'll repay it back
or yield up aquitaine
princess of france we arrest your word
boyet you can produce acquittances
of charles his father
king satisfy me so
boyet so please your grace the packet is not come
where that and other specialties are bound
to morrow you shall have a sight of them
king it shall suffice me at which interview
all liberal reason i will yield unto
meantime receive such welcome at my hand
as honour without breach of honour may
you may not come fair princess within my gates
but here without you shall be so receiv'd
as you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart
though so denied fair harbour in my house
your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
to morrow shall we visit you again
princess of france sweet health and fair desires consort your
empty
king thy own wish wish i thee in every place
berowne lady i will commend you to mine own heart
rosaline pray you do my commendations
i would be glad to see it
berowne i would you heard it groan
rosaline is the fool sick
berowne sick at the heart
rosaline alack let it blood
berowne would that do it good
rosaline my physic says 'ay'
rosaline no point with my knife
berowne now god save thy life
rosaline and yours from long living
berowne i cannot stay thanksgiving retiring

longaville i beseech you a word what is she in the white
boyet a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
boyet she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
longaville pray you sir whose daughter
boyet her mother's i have heard
longaville god's blessing on your beard
boyet good sir be not offended
she is an heir of falconbridge
longaville nay my choler is ended
she is a most sweet lady

boyet rosaline by good hap
berowne is she wedded or no
boyet to her will sir or so
berowne you are welcome sir adieu
boyet farewell to me sir and welcome to you
exit berowne ladies unmask
maria that last is berowne the merry mad cap lord
not a word with him but a jest
boyet and every jest but a word
empty
boyet i was as willing to grapple as he was to board
katharine two hot sheeps marry
boyet and wherefore not ships
no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
katharine you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest
boyet so you grant pasture for me offering to kiss her
katharine not so gentle beast
my lips are no common though several they be
katharine to my fortunes and me
princess of france good wits will be jangling but gentles
empty
this civil war of wits were much better used
on navarre and his book men for here 'tis abused
boyet if my observation which very seldom lies
by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
deceive me not now navarre is infected
princess of france with what
princess of france your reason
boyet why all his behaviours did make their retire
to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
his heart like an agate with your print impressed
proud with his form in his eye pride expressed
his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
all senses to that sense did make their repair
to feel only looking on fairest of fair
as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
who tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd
did point you to buy them along as you pass'd
his face's own margent did quote such amazes
that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
i'll give you aquitaine and all that is his
an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
princess of france come to our pavilion boyet is dispos'd
boyet but to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd
by adding a tongue which i know will not lie
maria thou art an old love monger and speakest skilfully
katharine he is cupid's grandfather and learns news of him
rosaline then was venus like her mother for her father is but
empty
boyet do you hear my mad wenches
maria no
boyet what then do you see
maria ay our way to be gone

moth no my complete master but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
end canary to it with your feet humour it with turning up your
eyelids sigh a note and sing a note sometime through the
throat as if you swallowed love with singing love sometime

with your hat penthouse like o'er the shop of your eyes with
your arms cross'd on your thin belly doublet like a rabbit on a
spit or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old
painting and keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away

berowne the king he is hunting the deer i am coursing myself
they have pitch'd a toil i am tolling in a pitch pitch that
defiles defile a foul word well 'set thee down sorrow' for
so they say the fool said and so say i and i am the fool well
proved wit by the lord this love is as mad as ajax it kills
sheep it kills me i a sheep well proved again o' my side i
will not love if i do hang me i' faith i will not o but her
eye by this light but for her eye i would not love her yes

rhyme and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme and
here my melancholy well she hath one o' my sonnets already the
clown bore it the fool sent it and the lady hath it sweet
clown sweeter fool sweetest lady by the world i would not
care a pin if the other three were in here comes one with a
paper god give him grace to groan
climbs into a tree
enter the king with a paper
berowne shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid thou hast thump'd
him with thy bird bolt under the left pap in faith secrets
king reads
'so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
as thy eye beams when their fresh rays have smote
the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
through the transparent bosom of the deep
thou shinst in every tear that i do weep
no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
do but behold the tears that swell in me
and they thy glory through my grief will show
but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
my tears for glasses and still make me weep
o queen of queens how far dost thou excel
no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell'
sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here
steps aside
enter longaville with a paper
what longaville and reading listen car
berowne now in thy likeness one more fool appear
longaville ay me i am forsworn
berowne why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
king in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame
berowne one drunkard loves another of the name
berowne i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
thou makest the triumviry the corner cap of society
the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity
longaville i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
o sweet maria empress of my love
these numbers will i tear and write in prose
berowne o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid's hose
disfigure not his slop
longaville this same shall go he reads the sonnet
'gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me
vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to lose an oath to win a paradise'
berowne this is the liver vein which makes flesh a deity
a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
god amend us god amend we are much out o' th' way
enter dumain with a paper
longaville by whom shall i send this company stay
steps aside
like a demigod here sit i in the sky
and wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er eye
more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish
dumain transformed four woodcocks in a dish
dumain o most divine kate
berowne o most profane coxcomb
dumain by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
berowne by earth she is not corporal there you lie
dumain her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted
dumain as upright as the cedar
berowne stoop i say
her shoulder is with child
dumain as fair as day
berowne ay as some days but then no sun must shine
dumain o that i had my wish
longaville and i had mine
king and i mine toogood lord
berowne amen so i had mine is not that a good word
reigns in my blood and will rememb'red be
berowne a fever in your blood why then incision
would let her out in saucers sweet misprision
dumain once more i'll read the ode that i have writ
berowne once more i'll mark how love can vary wit
dumain reads
'on a day alack the day
love whose month is ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen can passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heavens breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alack my hand is sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
do not call it sin in me
that i am forsworn for thee
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love'
this will i send and something else more plain
that shall express my true love's fasting pain
o would the king berowne and longaville
would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note
for none offend where all alike do dote
longaville advancing dumain thy love is far from charity
that in love's grief desir'st society
you may look pale but i should blush i know
to be o'erheard and taken napping so
king advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such
you chide at him offending twice as much
you do not love maria longaville
nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
his loving bosom to keep down his heart
i have been closely shrouded in this bush
and mark'd you both and for you both did blush
i heard your guilty rhymes observ'd your fashion
saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
'ay me' says one 'o jove' the other cries
one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes
to longaville you would for paradise break faith and troth
what will berowne say when that he shall hear
faith infringed which such zeal did swear
how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
for all the wealth that ever i did see
i would not have him know so much by me
berowne descending now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
there is no certain princess that appears
you'll not be perjur'd 'tis a hateful thing
tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
but are you not ashamed nay are you not
all three of you to be thus much o'ershot
you found his mote the king your mote did see
but i a beam do find in each of three
o what a scene of foolry have i seen
o me with what strict patience have i sat
to see a king transformed to a gnat
to see great hercules whipping a gig
and profound solomon to tune a jig
and nestor play at push pin with the boys
and critic timon laugh at idle toys
where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
and where my liege's all about the breast
king too bitter is thy jest
are we betrayed thus to thy over view
berowne not you by me but i betrayed to you
i that am honest i that hold it sin
to break the vow i am engaged in
i am betrayed by keeping company
with men like you men of inconstancy
when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
or groan for joan or spend a minute's time
will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
a gait a state a brow a breast a waist
a leg a limb
king soft whither away so fast
a true man or a thief that gallops so
berowne i post from love good lover let me go
enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god bless the king
king what present hast thou there
king what makes treason here
costard nay it makes nothing sir
king if it mar nothing neither
the treason and you go in peace away together
jaquenetta i beseech your grace let this letter be read
our person misdoubts it 'twas treason he said
king berowne read it over berowne reads the letter
where hadst thou it
jaquenetta of costard
costard of dun adramadio dun adramadio
berowne tears the letter
king how now what is in you why dost thou tear it
berowne a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it
longaville it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear
empty
dumain it is berowne's writing and here is his name
gathering up the pieces
berowne to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born
guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess
king what
berowne that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
he he and you and you my liege and i
are pick purses in love and we deserve to die
o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more
dumain now the number is even
berowne true true we are four
will these turtles be gone
costard walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
exeunt costard and jaquenetta
berowne sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
as true we are as flesh and blood can be
the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
young blood doth not obey an old decree
we cannot cross the cause why we were born
therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
king what did these rent lines show some love of thine
that like a rude and savage man of inde
at the first op'ning of the gorgeous east
bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
kisses the base ground with obedient breast
what peremptory eagle sighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow
that is not blinded by her majesty
king what zeal what fury hath inspir'd thee now
my love her mistress is a gracious moon
berowne my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne
o but for my love day would turn to night
of all complexions the culld sovereignty
do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
where several worthies make one dignity
where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
to things of sale a seller's praise belongs
a wither'd hermit five score winters worn
might shake off fifty looking in her eye
beauty doth varnish age as if new born
and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
o 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine
king by heaven thy love is black as ebony
berowne is ebony like her o wood divine
a wife of such wood were felicity
o who can give an oath where is a book
if that she learn not of her eye to look
no face is fair that is not full so black
king o paradox black is the badge of hell
the hue of dungeons and the school of night
and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well
berowne devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
o if in black my lady's brows be deckt
it mourns that painting and usurping hair
should ravish doters with a false aspect
her favour turns the fashion of the days
for native blood is counted painting now
and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
paints itself black to imitate her brow
dumain to look like her are chimney sweepers black
longaville and since her time are colliers counted bright
king and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
dumain dark needs no candles now for dark is light
berowne your mistresses dare never come in rain
king 'twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
i'll find a fairer face not wash'd to day
berowne i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
king no devil will fright thee then so much as she
dumain i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
longaville look here's thy love my foot and her face see
showing his shoe
berowne o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
her feet were much too dainty for such tread
the street should see as she walk'd overhead
king but what of this are we not all in love
berowne nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
king then leave this chat and good berowne now prove
our loving lawful and our faith not torn
dumain ay marry there some flattery for this evil
longaville o some authority how to proceed
some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
dumain some salve for perjury
have at you then affections men at arms
consider what you first did swear unto
to fast to study and to see no woman
flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth
say can you fast your stomachs are too young
and abstinence engenders maladies
and where that you you have vow'd to study lords
in that each of you have forsworn his book
can you still dream and pore and thereon look
have found the ground of study's excellence
without the beauty of a womans face
from womens eyes this doctrine i derive
they are the ground the books the academes
from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
why universal plodding poisons up
the nimble spirits in the arteries
as motion and long during action tires
the sinewy vigour of the traveller
you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
and study too the causer of your vow
for where is author in the world
teaches such beauty as a womans eye
learning is but an adjunct to ourself
and where we are our learning likewise is
then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes
with ourselves
do we not likewise see our learning there
and in that vow we have forsworn our books
for when would you my liege or you or you
in leaden contemplation have found out
such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with
other slow arts entirely keep the brain
and therefore finding barren practisers
scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
but love first learned in a lady's eyes
but with the motion of all elements
courses as swift as thought in every power
and gives to every power a double power
above their functions and their offices
it adds a precious seeing to the eye
a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
love's feeling is more soft and sensible
love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
for valour is not love a hercules
still climbing trees in the hesperides
subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair
and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
make heaven drowsy with the harmony
never durst poet touch a pen to write
until his ink were temp'red with love's sighs
and plant in tyrants mild humility
from womens eyes this doctrine i derive
they sparkle still the right promethean fire
they are the books the arts the academes
that show contain and nourish all the world
else none at all in aught proves excellent
then fools you were these women to forswear
or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
for wisdom's sake a word that all men love
or for mens sake the authors of these women
or womens sake by whom we men are men
let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
it is religion to be thus forsworn
for charity itself fulfils the law
and who can sever love from charity
king saint cupid then and soldiers to the field
berowne advance your standards and upon them lords
in conflict that you get the sun of them
longaville now to plain dealing lay these glozes by
shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
king and win them too therefore let us devise
some entertainment for them in their tents
berowne first from the park let us conduct them thither
then homeward every man attach the hand
of his fair mistress in the afternoon
we will with some strange pastime solace them
for revels dances masks and merry hours
forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
king away away no time shall be omitted
that will betime and may by us be fitted
berowne allons allons sow'd cockle reap'd no corn
and justice always whirls in equal measure
light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
if so our copper buys no better treasure exeunt
act v scene i
enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull
holofernes satis quod sufficit
nathaniel i praise god for you sir your reasons at dinner have
been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty
without affection audacious without impudency learned without
opinion and strange without heresy i did converse this quondam
day with a companion of the king's who is intituled nominated
or called don adriano de armado
holofernes novi hominem tanquam te his humour is lofty his
gait majestical and his general behaviour vain ridiculous and
thrasonical he is too picked too spruce too affected too odd
as it were too peregrinate as i may call it
nathaniel a most singular and choice epithet
draws out his table book
holofernes he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than
the staple of his argument i abhor such fanatical phantasimes
such insociable and point devise companions such rackers of
orthography as to speak 'dout' fine when he should say 'doubt'
he clepeth a calf 'cauf' half 'hauf' neighbour vocatur
'nebour' 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne' this is abhominable which he
would call 'abbominable' it insinuateth me of insanie ne
intelligis domine to make frantic lunatic

scratch'd 'twill serve

armado at your sweet pleasure for the mountain
holofernes i do sans question
armado sir it is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to
congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of
this day which the rude multitude call the afternoon
holofernes the posterior of the day most generous sir is liable
congruent and measurable for the afternoon the word is well
culld chose sweet and apt i do assure you sir i do assure
assure ye very good friend for what is inward between us let
it pass i do beseech thee remember thy courtesy i beseech
thee apparel thy head and among other importunate and most
serious designs and of great import indeed too but let that
pass for i must tell thee it will please his grace by the
world sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal
finger thus dally with my excrement with my mustachio but
sweet heart let that pass by the world i recount no fable
some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart
but let that pass the very all of all is but sweet heart i do
implore secrecy that the king would have me present the
princess sweet chuck with some delightful ostentation or show
or pageant or antic or firework now understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden
breaking out of mirth as it were i have acquainted you withal
to the end to crave your assistance
holofernes sir you shall present before her the nine worthies
sir nathaniel as concerning some entertainment of time some
assistance the king's command and this most gallant
illustrate and learned gentleman before the princess i say

scene ii
the park
enter the princess maria katharine and rosaline
princess of france sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
if fairings come thus plentifully in
a lady walld about with diamonds
look you what i have from the loving king
rosaline madam came nothing else along with that
as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
writ o' both sides the leaf margent and all
that he was fain to seal on cupid's name
rosaline that was the way to make his godhead wax
for he hath been five thousand year a boy
katharine ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
rosaline you'll ne'er be friends with him 'a killd your sister
katharine he made her melancholy sad and heavy
and so she died had she been light like you
she might 'a been a grandam ere she died
and so may you for a light heart lives long
rosaline what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word
katharine a light condition in a beauty dark
rosaline we need more light to find your meaning out
katharine you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff
therefore i'll darkly end the argument
rosaline look what you do you do it still i' th' dark
katharine so do not you for you are a light wench
katharine you weigh me not o that's you care not for me
rosaline great reason for 'past cure is still past care'
princess of france well bandied both a set of wit well play'd
but rosaline you have a favour too
who sent it and what is it
rosaline i would you knew
an if my face were but as fair as yours
my favour were as great be witness this
nay i have verses too i thank berowne
i were the fairest goddess on the ground
i am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs
o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
princess of france anything like
rosaline much in the letters nothing in the praise
princess of france beauteous as ink a good conclusion
katharine fair as a text b in a copy book
rosaline ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
my red dominical my golden letter
katharine a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows
princess of france but katharine what was sent to you from fair
empty
katharine madam this glove
princess of france did he not send you twain
katharine yes madam and moreover
some thousand verses of a faithful lover
a huge translation of hypocrisy
vilely compild profound simplicity
the letter is too long by half a mile
princess of france i think no less dost thou not wish in heart
the chain were longer and the letter short
maria ay or i would these hands might never part
princess of france we are wise girls to mock our lovers so
rosaline they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
that same berowne i'll torture ere i go
o that i knew he were but in by th' week
how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
and shape his service wholly to my hests
and make him proud to make me proud that jests
so pertaunt like would i o'ersway his state
that he should be my fool and i his fate
princess of france none are so surely caught when they are
empty
as wit turnd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd
hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
rosaline the blood of youth burns not with such excess
as gravity's revolt to wantonness
maria folly in fools bears not so strong a note
as foolry in the wise when wit doth dote
since all the power thereof it doth apply
to prove by wit worth in simplicity
enter boyet
princess of france here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
boyet o i am stabb'd with laughter where's her grace
boyet prepare madam prepare
arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
against your peace love doth approach disguis'd
armed in arguments you'll be surpris'd
muster your wits stand in your own defence
or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
princess of france saint dennis to saint cupid what are they
that charge their breath against us say scout say
boyet under the cool shade of a sycamore
when lo to interrupt my purpos'd rest
toward that shade i might behold addrest
the king and his companions warily
i stole into a neighbour thicket by
and overheard what you shall overhear
that by and by disguis'd they will be here
their herald is a pretty knavish page
that well by heart hath connd his embassage
action and accent did they teach him there
and ever and anon they made a doubt
presence majestical would put him out
'for' quoth the king 'an angel shalt thou see
yet fear not thou but speak audaciously'
the boy replied 'an angel is not evil
i should have fear'd her had she been a devil'
with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder
making the bold wag by their praises bolder
one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore
another with his finger and his thumb
cried 'via we will do't come what will come'
the third he caper'd and cried 'all goes well'
the fourth turnd on the toe and down he fell
with that they all did tumble on the ground
with such a zealous laughter so profound
that in this spleen ridiculous appears
to check their folly passions solemn tears
princess of france but what but what come they to visit us
like muscovites or russians as i guess
their purpose is to parley court and dance
and every one his love feat will advance
unto his several mistress which they'll know
by favours several which they did bestow
princess of france and will they so the gallants shall be task'd
for ladies we will every one be mask'd
and not a man of them shall have the grace
despite of suit to see a lady's face
and then the king will court thee for his dear
hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
so shall berowne take me for rosaline
and change you favours too so shall your loves
woo contrary deceiv'd by these removes
rosaline come on then wear the favours most in sight
katharine but in this changing what is your intent
princess of france the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
they do it but in mocking merriment
their several counsels they unbosom shall
to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
upon the next occasion that we meet
with visages display'd to talk and greet
rosaline but shall we dance if they desire us to't
princess of france no to the death we will not move a foot
nor to their pennd speech render we no grace
but while 'tis spoke each turn away her face
boyet why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart
princess of france therefore i do it and i make no doubt
the rest will ne'er come in if he be out
there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
so shall we stay mocking intended game
and they well mock'd depart away with shame
trumpet sounds within
boyet the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come
the ladies mask
king and his lords as maskers in the guise of russians
moth all hail the richest heauties on the earth
boyet beauties no richer than rich taffeta
moth a holy parcel of the fairest dames
the ladies turn their backs to him
that ever turnd their backs to mortal views
berowne their eyes villain their eyes
moth that ever turnd their eyes to mortal views
empty
moth out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
not to behold
berowne once to behold rogue
moth once to behold with your sun beamed eyes with your
sun beamed eyes
boyet they will not answer to that epithet
you were best call it 'daughter beamed eyes'
moth they do not mark me and that brings me out
berowne is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
rosaline what would these strangers know their minds boyet
if they do speak our language 'tis our will
that some plain man recount their purposes
know what they would
boyet what would you with the princess
berowne nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline what would they say they
boyet nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline why that they have and bid them so be gone
king say to her we have measur'd many miles
to tread a measure with her on this grass
boyet they say that they have measur'd many a mile
to tread a measure with you on this grass
rosaline it is not so ask them how many inches
is in one mile if they have measured many

vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
rosaline my face is but a moon and clouded too
king blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
those clouds removed upon our watery eyne

thou now requests but moonshine in the water
king then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange
rosaline play music then nay you must do it soon
king will you not dance how come you thus estranged
rosaline you took the moon at full but now she's changed
king yet still she is the moon and i the man
the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
rosaline our ears vouchsafe it
king but your legs should do it
rosaline since you are strangers and come here by chance
we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance
king why take we hands then
curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
king more measure of this measure be not nice
rosaline we can afford no more at such a price
king price you yourselves what buys your company
rosaline your absence only
king that can never be
rosaline then cannot we be bought and so adieu

longaville look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
will you give horns chaste lady do not so
katharine then die a calf before your horns do grow
longaville one word in private with you ere i die
katharine bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
they converse apart
boyet the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
above the sense of sense so sensible
seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
rosaline not one word more my maids break off break off
berowne by heaven all dry beaten with pure scoff
king farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
exeunt king lords and blackamoors
princess of france twenty adieus my frozen muscovits
boyet tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out
rosaline well liking wits they have gross gross fat fat
princess of france o poverty in wit kingly poor flout
will they not think you hang themselves to night
or ever but in vizards show their faces
this pert berowne was out of count'nance quite
rosaline they were all in lamentable cases
the king was weeping ripe for a good word
princess of france berowne did swear himself out of all suit
'no point' quoth i my servant straight was mute
katharine lord longaville said i came o'er his heart
and trow you what he calld me
princess of france qualm perhaps
katharine yes in good faith
princess of france go sickness as thou art
rosaline well better wits have worn plain statute caps

princess of france and quick berowne hath plighted faith to me
maria dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
boyet madam and pretty mistresses give ear
immediately they will again be here
in their own shapes for it can never be
they will digest this harsh indignity
princess of france will they return
boyet they will they will god knows
and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
therefore change favours and when they repair
princess of france how blow how blow speak to be understood
boyet fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud
dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown
are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
princess of france avaunt perplexity what shall we do
if they return in their own shapes to woo
rosaline good madam if by me you'll be advis'd
let's mock them still as well known as disguis'd
let us complain to them what fools were here
and wonder what they were and to what end
their shallow shows and prologue vilely pennd
and their rough carriage so ridiculous
should be presented at our tent to us
boyet ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
princess of france whip to our tents as roes run o'er land
exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria
re enter the king berowne longaville and dumain
in their proper habits
boyet gone to her tent please it your majesty
command me any service to her thither
king that she vouchsafe me audience for one word
boyet i will and so will she i know my lord exit
berowne this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
and utters it again when god doth please
he is wit's pedlar and retails his wares
at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
and we that sell by gross the lord doth know
this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
had he been adam he had tempted eve
'a can carve too and lisp why this is he
that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy
this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
that when he plays at tables chides the dice
in honourable terms nay he can sing
a mean most meanly and in ushering
mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
this is the flow'r that smiles on every one
to show his teeth as white as whales bone
and consciences that will not die in debt
pay him the due of 'honey tongued boyet'
king a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
that put armado's page out of his part
re enter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline
maria and katharine
berowne see where it comes behaviour what wert thou
king all hail sweet madam and fair time of day
princess of france 'fair' in 'all hail is foul as i conceive
king construe my speeches better if you may
princess of france then wish me better i will give you leave
king we came to visit you and purpose now
to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
princess of france this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
nor god nor i delights in perjur'd men
king rebuke me not for that which you provoke
princess of france you nickname virtue vice you should have
empty
for virtue's office never breaks mens troth
now by my maiden honour yet as pure
as the unsullied lily i protest
a world of torments though i should endure
i would not yield to be your house's guest
so much i hate a breaking cause to be
of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity
unseen unvisited much to our shame
princess of france not so my lord it is not so i swear
we have had pastimes here and pleasant game
a mess of russians left us but of late
king how madam russians
princess of france ay in truth my lord
trim gallants full of courtship and of state
rosaline madam speak true it is not so my lord
my lady to the manner of the days
we four indeed confronted were with four
in russian habit here they stayed an hour
and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord
they did not bless us with one happy word
i dare not call them fools but this i think
when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
berowne this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet
your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
with eyes best seeing heavens fiery eye
is of that nature that to your huge store
wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
rosaline this proves you wise and rich for in my eye
berowne i am a fool and full of poverty
rosaline but that you take what doth to you belong
it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
berowne o i am yours and all that i possess
rosaline all the fool mine
berowne i cannot give you less
berowne where when what vizard why demand you this
rosaline there then that vizard that superfluous case
that hid the worse and show'd the better face
king we were descried they'll mock us now downright
dumain let us confess and turn it to a jest
princess of france amaz'd my lord why looks your highness sad
rosaline help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale
sea sick i think coming from muscovy
berowne thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
here stand i lady dart thy skill at me
bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
and i will wish thee never more to dance
nor never more in russian habit wait
o never will i trust to speeches pennd
nor to the motion of a school boy's tongue
nor never come in vizard to my friend
taffeta phrases silken terms precise
three pild hyperboles spruce affectation
figures pedantical these summer flies
have blown me full of maggot ostentation
i do forswear them and i here protest
by this white glove how white the hand god knows
henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
and to begin wench so god help me law
rosaline sans 'sans' i pray you
berowne yet i have a trick
of the old rage bear with me i am sick
i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see
write 'lord have mercy on us' on those three
they are infected in their hearts it lies
they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
these lords are visited you are not free
for the lord's tokens on you do i see
berowne our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
rosaline it is not so for how can this be true
that you stand forfeit being those that sue
berowne peace for i will not have to do with you
rosaline nor shall not if i do as i intend
berowne speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
king teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
some fair excuse
princess of france the fairest is confession
king madam i was
princess of france and were you well advis'd
king i was fair madam
princess of france when you then were here
what did you whisper in your lady's ear
king that more than all the world i did respect her
princess of france when she shall challenge this you will reject
empty
king upon mine honour no
your oath once broke you force not to forswear
king despise me when i break this oath of mine
princess of france i will and therefore keep it rosaline
what did the russian whisper in your ear
rosaline madam he swore that he did hold me dear
as precious eyesight and did value me
above this world adding thereto moreover
that he would wed me or else die my lover
princess of france god give thee joy of him the noble lord
king what mean you madam by my life my troth
i never swore this lady such an oath
rosaline by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
you gave me this but take it sir again
king my faith and this the princess i did give
i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
princess of france pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
and lord berowne i thank him is my dear
what will you have me or your pearl again
i see the trick ont here was a consent
knowing aforehand of our merriment
to dash it like a christmas comedy
some carry tale some please man some slight zany
some mumble news some trencher knight some dick
that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
to make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd
told our intents before which once disclos'd
the ladies did change favours and then we
now to our perjury to add more terror
we are again forsworn in will and error
much upon this it is to boyet and might not you
forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier
and laugh upon the apple of her eye
and stand between her back sir and the fire
holding a trencher jesting merrily
you put our page out go you are allow'd
you leer upon me do you there's an eye
wounds like a leaden sword
boyet full merrily

enter as messenger monsieur marcade
princess of france welcome marcade
but that thou interruptest our merriment
marcade i am sorry madam for the news i bring
is heavy in my tongue the king your father
princess of france dead for my life
marcade even so my tale is told
berowne worthies away the scene begins to cloud
armado for mine own part i breathe free breath i have seen the
day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and i will
king how fares your majesty
princess of france boyet prepare i will away to night
king madam not so i do beseech you stay
princess of france prepare i say i thank you gracious lords
for all your fair endeavours and entreat
out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe
in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
the liberal opposition of our spirits
if over boldly we have borne ourselves
was guilty of it farewell worthy lord
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
excuse me so coming too short of thanks
for my great suit so easily obtaind
king the extreme parts of time extremely forms
all causes to the purpose of his speed
and often at his very loose decides
that which long process could not arbitrate
and though the mourning brow of progeny
the holy suit which fain it would convince
yet since love's argument was first on foot
let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
from what it purpos'd since to wail friends lost
is not by much so wholesome profitable
as to rejoice at friends but newly found
princess of france i understand you not my griefs are double
berowne honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
and by these badges understand the king
play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
hath much deformed us fashioning our humours
even to the opposed end of our intents
and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
as love is full of unbefitting strains
all wanton as a child skipping and vain
form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye
full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
which parti coated presence of loose love
put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities
those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
suggested us to make therefore ladies
our love being yours the error that love makes
is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
by being once false for ever to be true
to those that make us both fair ladies you
thus purifies itself and turns to grace
princess of france we have receiv'd your letters full of love
your favours the ambassadors of love
and in our maiden council rated them
at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
as bombast and as lining to the time
but more devout than this in our respects
have we not been and therefore met your loves
in their own fashion like a merriment
longaville so did our looks
rosaline we did not quote them so
king now at the latest minute of the hour
grant us your loves
princess of france a time methinks too short
to make a world without end bargain in
no no my lord your grace is perjur'd much
full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
if for my love as there is no such cause
your oath i will not trust but go with speed
to some forlorn and naked hermitage
remote from all the pleasures of the world
there stay until the twelve celestial signs
have brought about the annual reckoning
if this austere insociable life
change not your offer made in heat of blood
if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
then at the expiration of the year
come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
i will be thine and till that instant shut
my woeful self up in a mournful house
raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father's death
if this thou do deny let our hands part
neither intitled in the other's heart
to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast
berowne and what to me my love and what to me
rosaline you must he purged too your sins are rack'd
you are attaint with faults and perjury
therefore if you my favour mean to get
a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
but seek the weary beds of people sick
a wife
katharine a beard fair health and honesty
with threefold love i wish you all these three
dumain o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
katharine no so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
i'll mark no words that smooth fac'd wooers say
come when the king doth to my lady come
then if i have much love i'll give you some
dumain i'll serve thee true and faithfully till then
longaville what says maria
maria at the twelvemonth's end
i'll change my black gown for a faithful friend
longaville i'll stay with patience but the time is long
maria the liker you few taller are so young
berowne studies my lady mistress look on me
behold the window of my heart mine eye
what humble suit attends thy answer there
impose some service on me for thy love
before i saw you and the world's large tongue
proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
full of comparisons and wounding flouts
which you on all estates will execute
that lie within the mercy of your wit
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
and therewithal to win me if you please
without the which i am not to be won
you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
with groaning wretches and your task shall be
with all the fierce endeavour of your wit
to enforce the pained impotent to smile
berowne to move wild laughter in the throat of death
it cannot be it is impossible
mirth cannot move a soul in agony
rosaline why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit
whose influence is begot of that loose grace
which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
of him that hears it never in the tongue
of him that makes it then if sickly ears
deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans
will hear your idle scorns continue then
and i will have you and that fault withal
but if they will not throw away that spirit
and i shall find you empty of that fault
right joyful of your reformation
berowne a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
princess of france to the king ay sweet my lord and so i take
my leave
king no madam we will bring you on your way
berowne our wooing doth not end like an old play
jack hath not jill these ladies' courtesy
might well have made our sport a comedy
king come sir it wants a twelvemonth an a day
and then 'twill end
berowne that's too long for a play
armado sweet majesty vouchsafe me
princess of france was not that not hector

'gainst my captivity hail brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broil
as thou didst leave it
sergeant doubtful it stood
as two spent swimmers that do cling together
and choke their art the merciless macdonwald
the multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him from the western isles
of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
show'd like a rebels whore but alls too weak
for brave macbeth well he deserves that name
disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel
which smoked with bloody execution
like valor's minion carved out his passage
which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him
till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps
and fix'd his head upon our battlements
duncan o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
sergeant as whence the sun 'gins his reflection
shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark
no sooner justice had with valor arm'd
but the norweyan lord surveying vantage
with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
began a fresh assault
duncan dismay'd not this
our captains macbeth and banquo
sergeant yes
as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
if i say sooth i must report they were
as cannons overcharged with double cracks
doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
or memorize another golgotha
i cannot tell
but i am faint my gashes cry for help
duncan so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
they smack of honor both go get him surgeons

ross from fife great king
where the norweyan banners flout the sky

norway himself with terrible numbers
the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict
till that bellona's bridegroom lapp'd in proof
confronted him with self comparisons
point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm
curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
the victory fell on us
duncan great happiness
ross that now
sweno the norways' king craves composition
till he disbursed at saint colme's inch
ten thousand dollars to our general use

by each at once her choppy finger laying
upon her skinny lips you should be women
and yet your beards forbid me to interpret
that you are so
first witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis
second witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor
third witch all hail macbeth that shalt be king hereafter
banquo good sir why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair i' the name of truth
are ye fantastical or that indeed
which outwardly ye show my noble partner
you greet with present grace and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope
if you can look into the seeds of time
and say which grain will grow and which will not
speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
your favors nor your hate
first witch hail
second witch hail
third witch hail
first witch lesser than macbeth and greater
second witch not so happy yet much happier
so all hail macbeth and banquo
first witch banquo and macbeth all hail
macbeth stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by sinels death i know i am thane of glamis
but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
stands not within the prospect of belief
no more than to be cawdor say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you
witches vanish
banquo the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them whither are they vanish'd
macbeth into the air and what seem'd corporal melted
as breath into the wind would they had stay'd
banquo were such things here as we do speak about
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner
banquo you shall be king
macbeth and thane of cawdor too went it not so
banquo to the selfsame tune and words who's here
enter ross and angus
ross the king hath happily received macbeth
the news of thy success and when he reads
thy personal venture in the rebels' fight
his wonders and his praises do contend
which should be thine or his silenced with that
he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks
nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
strange images of death as thick as hail
came post with post and every one did bear
thy praises in his kingdom's great defense
and pour'd them down before him
angus we are sent
to give thee from our royal master thanks
only to herald thee into his sight
ross and for an earnest of a greater honor
he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor
in which addition hail most worthy thane
for it is thine
banquo what can the devil speak true
macbeth the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me
in borrow'd robes
angus who was the thane lives yet
but under heavy judgement bears that life
with those of norway or did line the rebel
with hidden help and vantage or that with both
he labor'd in his country's wreck i know not
but treasons capital confess'd and proved
have overthrown him
macbeth aside glamis and thane of cawdor
the greatest is behind to ross and angus thanks for your
empty
aside to banquo do you not hope your children shall be kings
promised no less to them
banquo aside to macbeth that trusted home
might yet enkindle you unto the crown
besides the thane of cawdor but 'tis strange
and oftentimes to win us to our harm
the instruments of darkness tell us truths
win us with honest trifles to betray's
in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you
as happy prologues to the swelling act
of the imperial theme i thank you gentlemen
aside this supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
why hath it given me earnest of success
commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
if good why do i yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
are less than horrible imaginings
my thought whose murther yet is but fantastical
shakes so my single state of man that function
is smother'd in surmise and nothing is
but what is not
banquo look how our partner's rapt
macbeth aside if chance will have me king why chance may
crown me
without my stir
like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
but with the aid of use
macbeth aside come what come may
time and the hour runs through the roughest day
banquo worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
macbeth give me your favor my dull brain was wrought
with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains
are register'd where every day i turn

king who all hailed me 'thane of cawdor' by which title
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
coming on of time with 'hail king that shalt be' this have i

to have thee crownd withal

which would be worn now in their newest gloss
not cast aside so soon
lady macbeth was the hope drunk
wherein you dress'd yourself hath it slept since
and wakes it now to look so green and pale
at what it did so freely from this time

to be the same in thine own act and valor
as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that
and live a coward in thine own esteem
letting i dare not wait upon i would

i dare do all that may become a man
who dares do more is none
lady macbeth what beast wast then
that made you break this enterprise to me
when you durst do it then you were a man
be so much more the man nor time nor place
did then adhere and yet you would make both
they have made themselves and that their fitness now
does unmake you i have given suck and know
how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me
i would while it was smiling in my face
have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums
and dash'd the brains out had i so sworn as you
have done to this
lady macbeth we fail
but screw your courage to the sticking place
and we'll not fail when duncan is asleep
whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
soundly invite him his two chamberlains
will i with wine and wassail so convince
that memory the warder of the brain
shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
a limbeck only when in swinish sleep
what cannot you and i perform upon
the unguarded duncan what not put upon
his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell
macbeth bring forth men children only
for thy undaunted mettle should compose

of his own chamber and used their very daggers

and such an instrument i was to use
mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses
or else worth all the rest i see thee still

whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design
moves like a ghost thou sure and firm set earth
hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
thy very stones prate of my whereabout
which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives

lady macbeth help me hence ho
macduff look to the lady
malcolm aside to donalbain why do we hold our tongues
that most may claim this argument for ours
donalbain aside to malcolm what should be spoken here where
our fate
hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
let's away
our tears are not yet brew'd
upon the foot of motion
banquo look to the lady
lady macbeth is carried out
and when we have our naked frailties hid
that suffer in exposure let us meet
and question this most bloody piece of work
to know it further fears and scruples shake us
in the great hand of god i stand and thence
against the undivulged pretense i fight
macduff and so do i
all so all
macbeth let's briefly put on manly readiness
and meet i' the hall together
all well contented
exeunt all but malcolm and donalbain
malcolm what will you do let's not consort with them
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office
which the false man does easy i'll to england
shall keep us both the safer where we are
there's daggers in mens smiles the near in blood
the nearer bloody
malcolm this murtherous shaft that's shot
hath not yet lighted and our safest way
is to avoid the aim therefore to horse
and let us not be dainty of leave taking
but shift away there's warrant in that theft
which steals itself when there's no mercy left
scene iv
outside macbeth's castle
enter ross with an old man
old man threescore and ten i can remember well
within the volume of which time i have seen
hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
hath trifled former knowings
ross ah good father
thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act
and yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp
is't night's predominance or the day's shame
that darkness does the face of earth entomb
when living light should kiss it
old man 'tis unnatural
even like the deed that's done on tuesday last
a falcon towering in her pride of place
was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and killd
ross and duncans horses a thing most strange and certain
turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
contending 'gainst obedience as they would make
war with mankind
old man 'tis said they eat each other
ross they did so to the amazement of mine eyes
that look'd upont
enter macduff
here comes the good macduff
how goes the world sir now
ross is't known who did this more than bloody deed
macduff those that macbeth hath slain
ross alas the day
what good could they pretend
macduff they were subornd
malcolm and donalbain the king's two sons
are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed
ross 'gainst nature still
thine own life's means then 'tis most like
the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth
macduff he is already named and gone to scone
to be invested
ross where is duncans body
macduff carried to colmekill
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
and guardian of their bones
ross will you to scone
ross well i will thither
macduff well may you see things well done there
empty
lest our old robes sit easier than our new
ross farewell father
old man god's benison go with you and with those
that would make good of bad and friends of foes
empty
act iii scene i
enter banquo
banquo thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all
as the weird women promised and i fear
thou play'dst most foully for't yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity
but that myself should be the root and father
of many kings if there come truth from them
as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine
why by the verities on thee made good
and set me up in hope but hush no more
sennet sounds enter macbeth as king lady macbeth
as queen lennox ross lords ladies and attendants
macbeth here's our chief guest
lady macbeth if he had been forgotten
it had been as a gap in our great feast
and all thing unbecoming
macbeth tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
and i'll request your presence
command upon me to the which my duties
are with a most indissoluble tie
forever knit
macbeth ride you this afternoon
banquo ay my good lord
macbeth we should have else desired your good advice
which still hath been both grave and prosperous
in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow
is't far you ride'
'twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
i must become a borrower of the night
for a dark hour or twain
macbeth fail not our feast
banquo my lord i will not
macbeth we hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
in england and in ireland not confessing
their cruel parricide filling their hearers
with strange invention but of that tomorrow
craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu
till you return at night goes fleance with you
banquo ay my good lord our time does call upon 's
macbeth i wish your horses swift and sure of foot
and so i do commend you to their backs
farewell exit banquo
let every man be master of his time
till seven at night to make society
the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
exeunt all but macbeth and an attendant
sirrah a word with you attend those men
our pleasure
attendant they are my lord without the palace gate
macbeth bring them before us exit attendant
to be thus is nothing
but to be safely thus our fears in banquo
stick deep and in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be fear'd 'tis much he dares
he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
to act in safety there is none but he
whose being i do fear and under him
my genius is rebuked as it is said
mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters
when first they put the name of king upon me
and bade them speak to him then prophet like
they haild him father to a line of kings
upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand
no son of mine succeeding if't be so
for banquo's issue have i filed my mind
for them the gracious duncan have i murther'd
put rancors in the vessel of my peace
only for them and mine eternal jewel
given to the common enemy of man
to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
rather than so come fate into the list
re enter attendant with two murtherers
now go to the door and stay there till we call
exit attendant
was it not yesterday we spoke together
first murtherer it was so please your highness
macbeth well then now
have you consider'd of my speeches know
that it was he in the times past which held you
so under fortune which you thought had been
in our last conference pass'd in probation with you
how you were borne in hand how cross'd the instruments
who wrought with them and all things else that might
to half a soul and to a notion crazed
say thus did banquo
first murtherer you made it known to us
macbeth i did so and went further which is now
our point of second meeting do you find
your patience so predominant in your nature
to pray for this good man and for his issue
whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
and beggar'd yours forever
first murtherer we are men my liege
macbeth ay in the catalogue ye go for men
as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
shoughs waterrugs and demi wolves are clept
all by the name of dogs the valued file
distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
according to the gift which bounteous nature
hath in him closed whereby he does receive
particular addition from the bill
that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you have a station in the file
not i' the worst rank of manhood say it
and i will put that business in your bosoms
whose execution takes your enemy off
grapples you to the heart and love of us
which in his death were perfect
second murtherer i am one my liege
whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
have so incensed that i am reckless what
i do to spite the world
first murtherer and i another
so weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune
that i would set my life on any chance
to mend it or be rid ont
know banquo was your enemy
both murtherers true my lord
macbeth so is he mine and in such bloody distance
that every minute of his being thrusts
against my near'st of life and though i could
with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
for certain friends that are both his and mine
whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall
that i to your assistance do make love
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons
second murtherer we shall my lord
perform what you command us
first murtherer though our lives
macbeth your spirits shine through you within this hour at most
i will advise you where to plant yourselves
acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time
and something from the palace always thought
that i require a clearness and with him
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work
fleance his son that keeps him company
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's must embrace the fate
of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart
i'll come to you anon
both murtherers we are resolved my lord
exeunt murtherers
it is concluded banquo thy souls flight
if it find heaven must find it out tonight exit
scene ii
the palace
enter lady macbeth and a servant
lady macbeth is banquo gone from court
servant ay madam but returns again tonight
lady macbeth say to the king i would attend his leisure
servant madam i will exit
lady macbeth nought's had alls spent
where our desire is got without content
'tis safer to be that which we destroy
than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
enter macbeth
how now my lord why do you keep alone
of sorriest fancies your companions making
using those thoughts which should indeed have died
should be without regard what's done is done
macbeth we have scotch'd the snake not killd it
she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
remains in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
in the affliction of these terrible dreams
that shake us nightly better be with the dead
whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave
after life's fitful fever he sleeps well
treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
malice domestic foreign levy nothing
can touch him further
lady macbeth come on
gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks
be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
macbeth so shall i love and so i pray be you
present him eminence both with eye and tongue
unsafe the while that we
must lave our honors in these flattering streams
and make our faces vizards to our hearts
disguising what they are
lady macbeth you must leave this
macbeth o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives
lady macbeth but in them nature's copy's not eterne
then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
his cloister'd flight ere to black hecate's summons
the shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums
hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done
a deed of dreadful note
lady macbeth what's to be done
macbeth be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow
makes wing to the rooky wood
good things of day begin to droop and drowse
whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse
thou marvelst at my words but hold thee still
things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
so prithee go with me exeunt
scene iii

lady macbeth o proper stuff
this is the very painting of your fear
this is the air drawn dagger which you said

only it spoils the pleasure of the time
macbeth what man dare i dare
the arm'd rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger
take any shape but that and my firm nerves
shall never tremble or be alive again
and dare me to the desert with thy sword
if trembling i inhabit then protest me
the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow
unreal mockery hence exit ghost
why so being gone
i am a man again pray you sit still
with most admired disorder
macbeth can such things be
and overcome us like a summer's cloud
without our special wonder you make me strange
even to the disposition that i owe

and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanch'd with fear
ross what sights my lord

enter the three witches meeting hecate
first witch why how now hecate you look angerly
hecate have i not reason beldams as you are
saucy and overbold how did you dare
to trade and traffic with macbeth
in riddles and affairs of death
the close contriver of all harms
was never calld to bear my part
or show the glory of our art
and which is worse all you have done
hath been but for a wayward son
spiteful and wrathful who as others do
loves for his own ends not for you
but make amends now get you gone
and at the pit of acheron
will come to know his destiny
your vessels and your spells provide
your charms and everything beside
i am for the air this night i'll spend
unto a dismal and a fatal end
great business must be wrought ere noon
upon the corner of the moon
there hangs a vaporous drop profound
i'll catch it ere it come to ground
shall raise such artificial sprites
as by the strength of their illusion
shall draw him on to his confusion
he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
his hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear
and you all know security
is mortals' chiefest enemy
music and a song within
come away come away
sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me exit
first witch come let's make haste she'll soon be back again
empty
scene vi
forres the palace
enter lennox and another lord
lennox my former speeches have but hit your thoughts
which can interpret farther only i say
thing's have been strangely borne the gracious duncan
and the right valiant banquo walk'd too late
whom you may say if't please you fleance killd
for fleance fled men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for malcolm and for donalbain
to kill their gracious father damned fact
how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents tear
that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
for 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
to hear the men deny't so that i say
he has borne all things well and i do think
that had he duncans sons under his key
as ant please heaven he shall not they should find
what 'twere to kill a father so should fleance
but peace for from broad words and 'cause he faild
his presence at the tyrant's feast i hear
macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell
lord the son of duncan
from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
lives in the english court and is received
of the most pious edward with such grace
that the malevolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect thither macduff
is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
to wake northumberland and warlike siward
that by the help of these with him above
give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
do faithful homage and receive free honors
all which we pine for now and this report
hath so exasperate the king that he
prepares for some attempt of war
lennox sent he to macduff
lord he did and with an absolute sir not i
the cloudy messenger turns me his back
that clogs me with this answer
lennox and that well might
advise him to a caution to hold what distance
his wisdom can provide some holy angel
fly to the court of england and unfold
his message ere he come that a swift blessing
may soon return to this our suffering country
under a hand accursed
lord i'll send my prayers with him
act iv scene i

ross you know not
whether it was his wisdom or his fear
his mansion and his titles in a place
from whence himself does fly he loves us not
he wants the natural touch for the poor wren
the most diminutive of birds will fight
her young ones in her nest against the owl
all is the fear and nothing is the love
as little is the wisdom where the flight
so runs against all reason
ross my dearest coz
he is noble wise judicious and best knows
the fits o' the season i dare not speak much further
but cruel are the times when we are traitors
and do not know ourselves when we hold rumor
from what we fear yet know not what we fear
but float upon a wild and violent sea
each way and move i take my leave of you
shall not be long but i'll be here again
things at the worst will cease or else climb upward

swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them
lady macduff now god help thee poor monkey but how wilt thou do

to do worse to you were fell cruelty
which is too nigh your person heaven preserve you
i dare abide no longer exit
lady macduff whither should i fly

is often laudable to do good sometime
accounted dangerous folly why then alas

to say i have done no harm what are these faces

lady macduff i hope in no place so unsanctified
where such as thou mayst find him

scene iii
enter malcolm and macduff
malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade and there
weep our sad bosoms empty
macduff let us rather
hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn
new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
strike heaven on the face that it resounds
as if it felt with scotland and yelld out
malcolm what i believe i'll wall
what know believe and what i can redress
as i shall find the time to friend i will
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
was once thought honest you have loved him well
he hath not touch'd you yet i am young but something
you may deserve of him through me and wisdom
to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
macduff i am not treacherous
malcolm but macbeth is
a good and virtuous nature may recoil
in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
yet grace must still look so
macduff i have lost my hopes
why in that rawness left you wife and child
those precious motives those strong knots of love
without leave taking i pray you
let not my jealousies be your dishonors
but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
whatever i shall think
macduff bleed bleed poor country
great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
for goodness dare not check thee wear thou thy wrongs
i would not be the villain that thou think'st
for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
and the rich east to boot
malcolm be not offended
i speak not as in absolute fear of you
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke
it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
is added to her wounds i think withal
there would be hands uplifted in my right
of goodly thousands but for all this
when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head
or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
shall have more vices than it had before
more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
by him that shall succeed
macduff what should he be
malcolm it is myself i mean in whom i know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
esteem him as a lamb being compared
with my confineless harms
macduff not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
in evils to top macbeth
malcolm i grant him bloody
luxurious avaricious false deceitful
sudden malicious smacking of every sin
in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
your matrons and your maids could not fill up
the cestern of my lust and my desire
all continent impediments would o'erbear
that did oppose my will better macbeth
than such an one to reign
macduff boundless intemperance
in nature is a tyranny it hath been
the untimely emptying of the happy throne
to take upon you what is yours you may
convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
we have willing dames enough there cannot be
that vulture in you to devour so many
as will to greatness dedicate themselves
finding it so inclined
malcolm with this there grows
in my most ill composed affection such
i should cut off the nobles for their lands
desire his jewels and this other's house
and my more having would be as a sauce
to make me hunger more that i should forge
quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
destroying them for wealth
macduff this avarice
sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
than summer seeming lust and it hath been
scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
of your mere own all these are portable
with other graces weigh'd
malcolm but i have none the king becoming graces
as justice verity temperance stableness
bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
devotion patience courage fortitude
i have no relish of them but abound
in the division of each several crime
pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
uproar the universal peace confound
all unity on earth
macduff o scotland scotland
malcolm if such a one be fit to govern speak
i am as i have spoken
macduff fit to govern
no not to live o nation miserable
with an untitled tyrant bloody scepter'd
since that the truest issue of thy throne
by his own interdiction stands accursed
and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
oftener upon her knees than on her feet
died every day she lived fare thee well
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
have banish'd me from scotland o my breast
thy hope ends here
child of integrity hath from my soul
wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
to thy good truth and honor devilish macbeth
by many of these trains hath sought to win me
into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
from over credulous haste but god above
deal between thee and me for even now
i put myself to thy direction and
unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
for strangers to my nature i am yet
unknown to woman never was forsworn
scarcely have coveted what was mine own
at no time broke my faith would not betray
the devil to his fellow and delight
no less in truth than life my first false speaking
was this upon myself what i am truly
is thine and my poor country's to command
whither indeed before thy here approach
already at a point was setting forth
now we'll together and the chance of goodness
be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent
macduff such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'tis hard to reconcile
enter a doctor
malcolm well more anon comes the king forth i pray you
doctor ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
that stay his cure their malady convinces
such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
they presently amend
malcolm i thank you doctor exit doctor
macduff what's the disease he means
malcolm 'tis calld the evil
a most miraculous work in this good king
which often since my here remain in england
i have seen him do how he solicits heaven
himself best knows but strangely visited people
the mere despair of surgery he cures
hanging a golden stamp about their necks
put on with holy prayers and 'tis spoken
to the succeeding royalty he leaves
the healing benediction with this strange virtue
he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
and sundry blessings hang about his throne
that speak him full of grace
enter ross
malcolm my countryman but yet i know him not
macduff my ever gentle cousin welcome hither
malcolm i know him now good god betimes remove
the means that makes us strangers
ross sir amen
macduff stands scotland where it did
ross alas poor country
almost afraid to know itself it cannot
be calld our mother but our grave where nothing
where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems
a modern ecstasy the dead mans knell
is there scarce ask'd for who and good mens lives
expire before the flowers in their caps
dying or ere they sicken
macduff o relation
too nice and yet too true
malcolm what's the newest grief
each minute teems a new one
macduff how does my wife
ross why well
macduff and all my children
ross well too
macduff the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace
ross no they were well at peace when i did leave 'em
macduff be not a niggard of your speech how goest
ross when i came hither to transport the tidings
of many worthy fellows that were out
which was to my belief witness'd the rather
for that i saw the tyrant's power afoot
now is the time of help your eye in scotland
would create soldiers make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses
malcolm be't their comfort
we are coming thither gracious england hath
lent us good siward and ten thousand men
that christendom gives out
ross would i could answer
this comfort with the like but i have words
that would be howld out in the desert air
where hearing should not latch them
macduff what concern they
the general cause or is it a fee grief
due to some single breast
ross no mind that's honest
pertains to you alone
macduff if it be mine
keep it not from me quickly let me have it
ross let not your ears despise my tongue forever
which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard
macduff humh i guess at it
ross your castle is surprised your wife and babes
savagely slaughter'd to relate the manner
to add the death of you
malcolm merciful heaven
what man neer pull your hat upon your brows
give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break
macduff my children too
ross wife children servants all
that could be found
macduff and i must be from thence
ross i have said
malcolm be comforted
let's make us medicines of our great revenge
to cure this deadly grief
macduff he has no children all my pretty ones
did you say all o hell kite all
what all my pretty chickens and their dam
at one fell swoop
malcolm dispute it like a man
but i must also feel it as a man
i cannot but remember such things were
that were most precious to me did heaven look on
and would not take their part sinful macduff
they were all struck for thee naught that i am
not for their own demerits but for mine
fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now
malcolm be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
and braggart with my tongue but gentle heavens
cut short all intermission front to front
bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself
within my sword's length set him if he 'scape
heaven forgive him too

our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth
is ripe for shaking and the powers above

siward we learn no other but the confident tyrant
keeps still in dunsinane and will endure
malcolm 'tis his main hope
for where there is advantage to be given
both more and less have given him the revolt

that struts and frets his hour upon the stage

told by an idiot full of sound and fury
enter a messenger
thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
messenger gracious my lord
i should report that which i say i saw
but know not how to do it
macbeth well say sir
messenger as i did stand my watch upon the hill
i look'd toward birnam and anon methought
the wood began to move
messenger let me endure your wrath if't be not so
within this three mile may you see it coming
i say a moving grove
macbeth if thou speak'st false
upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
i care not if thou dost for me as much
i pull in resolution and begin
to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
do come to dunsinane and now a wood
comes toward dunsinane arm arm and out

as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
i bear a charmed life which must not yield
to one of woman born
macduff despair thy charm
and let the angel whom thou still hast served
untimely ripp'd
macbeth accursed be that tongue that tells me so
for it hath cow'd my better part of man
and be these juggling fiends no more believed
that patter with us in a double sense
that keep the word of promise to our ear
and break it to our hope i'll not fight with thee
macduff then yield thee coward
and live to be the show and gaze o' the time
painted upon a pole and underwrit
here may you see the tyrant
macbeth i will not yield
to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet
and to be baited with the rabble's curse

malcolm macduff is missing and your noble son
ross your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt
the which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
in the unshrinking station where he fought
but like a man he died
siward then he is dead
ross ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
must not be measured by his worth for then
it hath no end
siward had he his hurts before
ross ay on the front
had i as many sons as i have hairs
i would not wish them to a fairer death
and so his knell is knolld
malcolm he's worth more sorrow
and that i'll spend for him
siward he's worth no more
they say he parted well and paid his score
and so god be with him here comes newer comfort
re enter macduff with macbeth's head
the usurper's cursed head the time is free
i see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
that speak my salutation in their minds
whose voices i desire aloud with mine
hail king of scotland
all hail king of scotland flourish
malcolm we shall not spend a large expense of time
before we reckon with your several loves
and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen
in such an honor named what's more to do
which would be planted newly with the time
as calling home our exiled friends abroad
that fled the snares of watchful tyranny
producing forth the cruel ministers
of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen
who as 'tis thought by self and violent hands
took off her life this and what needful else

duke angelo
there is a kind of character in thy life
that to th' observer doth thy history
fully unfold thyself and thy belongings
are not thine own so proper as to waste
thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
not light them for themselves for if our virtues
did not go forth of us 'twere all alike
as if we had them not spirits are not finely touch'd
but to fine issues nor nature never lends
the smallest scruple of her excellence
but like a thrifty goddess she determines
herself the glory of a creditor

of thee
first gentleman how now which of your hips has the most profound
mrs overdone well well there's one yonder arrested and carried

mrs overdone i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam
julietta with child
lucio believe me this may be he promis'd to meet me two hours
since and he was ever precise in promise keeping
second gentleman besides you know it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose
first gentleman but most of all agreeing with the proclamation
lucio away let's go learn the truth of it
exeunt lucio and gentlemen
with the gallows and what with poverty i am custom shrunk
enter pompey
how now what's the news with you
pompey yonder man is carried to prison
mrs overdone well what has he done
pompey a woman
mrs overdone but what's his offence
pompey groping for trouts in a peculiar river
mrs overdone what is there a maid with child by him
heard of the proclamation have you
mrs overdone what proclamation man
pompey all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be pluck'd down
mrs overdone and what shall become of those in the city
pompey they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that
a wise burgher put in for them
mrs overdone but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulld down
pompey to the ground mistress
what shall become of me
pompey come fear not you good counsellors lack no clients
though you change your place you need not change your trade i'll
be your tapster still courage there will be pity taken on you
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will
be considered
mrs overdone what's to do here thomas tapster let's withdraw
pompey here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison
and there's madam juliet exeunt
lucio following
claudio fellow why dost thou show me thus to th' world
bear me to prison where i am committed
provost i do it not in evil disposition
but from lord angelo by special charge
claudio thus can the demigod authority
make us pay down for our offence by weight
the words of heaven on whom it will it will
on whom it will not so yet still 'tis just
claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty
as surfeit is the father of much fast
so every scope by the immoderate use
turns to restraint our natures do pursue
like rats that ravin down their proper bane
a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
lucio if i could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for
certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment
claudio what but to speak of would offend again
lucio what is't murder
claudio no
lucio lechery
claudio call it so
provost away sir you must go
claudio one word good friend lucio a word with you
lucio a hundred if they'll do you any good is lechery so look'd
empty
i got possession of julietta's bed
you know the lady she is fast my wife
save that we do the denunciation lack
of outward order this we came not to
only for propagation of a dow'r
remaining in the coffer of her friends
from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
till time had made them for us but it chances
the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
lucio with child perhaps
claudio unhappily even so
and the new deputy now for the duke
whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
or whether that the body public be
a horse whereon the governor doth ride
who newly in the seat that it may know
he can command lets it straight feel the spur
whether the tyranny be in his place
i stagger in but this new governor
awakes me all the enrolled penalties
which have like unscour'd armour hung by th' wall
so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
and none of them been worn and for a name
now puts the drowsy and neglected act
freshly on me 'tis surely for a name
lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy
shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off
claudio i have done so but he's not to be found
i prithee lucio do me this kind service
this day my sister should the cloister enter
and there receive her approbation
acquaint her with the danger of my state
implore her in my voice that she make friends
to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
i have great hope in that for in her youth
there is a prone and speechless dialect
when she will play with reason and discourse
and well she can persuade
lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like
which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the
enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus
foolishly lost at a game of tick tack i'll to her
claudio i thank you good friend lucio
lucio within two hours
claudio come officer away exeunt
a monastery
enter duke and friar thomas
duke no holy father throw away that thought
believe not that the dribbling dart of love
can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee
to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
of burning youth
friar may your grace speak of it
how i have ever lov'd the life removed
and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps
i have deliver'd to lord angelo
a man of stricture and firm abstinence
my absolute power and place here in vienna
and he supposes me travelld to poland
for so i have strew'd it in the common ear
and so it is received now pious sir
friar gladly my lord
duke we have strict statutes and most biting laws
the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds
which for this fourteen years we have let slip
even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers
having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch
only to stick it in their childrens sight
for terror not to use in time the rod
dead to infliction to themselves are dead
and liberty plucks justice by the nose
the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
goes all decorum
friar it rested in your grace
to unloose this tied up justice when you pleas'd
and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
than in lord angelo
duke i do fear too dreadful
'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
for what i bid them do for we bid this be done
when evil deeds have their permissive pass
and not the punishment therefore indeed my father
i have on angelo impos'd the office
who may in th' ambush of my name strike home
and yet my nature never in the fight
to do in slander and to behold his sway
i will as 'twere a brother of your order
supply me with the habit and instruct me
how i may formally in person bear me
like a true friar moe reasons for this action
at our more leisure shall i render you
only this one lord angelo is precise
stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
that his blood flows or that his appetite
is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
if power change purpose what our seemers be exeunt
a nunnery
enter isabella and francisca
isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges
francisca are not these large enough
isabella yes truly i speak not as desiring more
but rather wishing a more strict restraint
upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
lucio within ho peace be in this place
isabella who's that which calls
turn you the key and know his business of him
you may i may not you are yet unsworn
when you have vow'd you must not speak with men
but in the presence of the prioress
then if you speak you must not show your face
or if you show your face you must not speak
he calls again i pray you answer him exit francisca
isabella peace and prosperity who is't that calls
enter lucio
proclaim you are no less can you so stead me
as bring me to the sight of isabella
a novice of this place and the fair sister
to her unhappy brother claudio
isabella why her 'unhappy brother' let me ask
the rather for i now must make you know
i am that isabella and his sister
lucio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
not to be weary with you he's in prison
lucio for that which if myself might be his judge
he should receive his punishment in thanks
he hath got his friend with child
isabella sir make me not your story
lucio it is true
i would not though 'tis my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
tongue far from heart play with all virgins so
i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted
and to be talk'd with in sincerity
as with a saint
isabella you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
lucio do not believe it fewness and truth 'tis thus
your brother and his lover have embrac'd
as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
lucio is she your cousin
isabella adoptedly as school maids change their names
by vain though apt affection
lucio she it is
isabella o let him marry her
lucio this is the point
the duke is very strangely gone from hence
bore many gentlemen myself being one
in hand and hope of action but we do learn
his givings out were of an infinite distance
from his true meant design upon his place
and with full line of his authority
governs lord angelo a man whose blood
is very snow broth one who never feels
the wanton stings and motions of the sense
but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
with profits of the mind study and fast
he to give fear to use and liberty
as mice by lions hath pick'd out an act
under whose heavy sense your brother's life
falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
and follows close the rigour of the statute
to make him an example all hope is gone
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
to soften angelo and that's my pith of business
'twixt you and your poor brother
isabella doth he so seek his life
already and as i hear the provost hath
a warrant for his execution
isabella alas what poor ability's in me
to do him good
lucio assay the pow'r you have
isabella my power alas i doubt
lucio our doubts are traitors
and make us lose the good we oft might win
by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo
men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
all their petitions are as freely theirs
as they themselves would owe them
isabella i'll see what i can do
lucio but speedily
isabella i will about it straight
no longer staying but to give the mother
notice of my affair i humbly thank you
commend me to my brother soon at night
lucio i take my leave of you
isabella good sir adieu exeunt
act ii scene i
a hall in angelo's house
enter angelo escalus a justice provost officers and other attendants
angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law
setting it up to fear the birds of prey
and let it keep one shape till custom make it
their perch and not their terror
let us be keen and rather cut a little
than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman
whom i would save had a most noble father
let but your honour know
whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
that in the working of your own affections
had time coher'd with place or place with wishing
or that the resolute acting of our blood
could have attaind th' effect of your own purpose
err'd in this point which now you censure him
and pulld the law upon you
angelo 'tis one thing to be tempted escalus
another thing to fall i not deny
the jury passing on the prisoner's life
may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice
that justice seizes what knows the laws
that thieves do pass on thieves 'tis very pregnant
because we see it but what we do not see
we tread upon and never think of it
you may not so extenuate his offence
for i have had such faults but rather tell me
when i that censure him do so offend
let mine own judgment pattern out my death
and nothing come in partial sir he must die
escalus be it as your wisdom will
angelo where is the provost

scene ii
another room in angelo's house
enter provost and a servant
servant he's hearing of a cause he will come straight
i'll tell him of you
provost pray you do exit servant i'll know
his pleasure may be he will relent alas
he hath but as offended in a dream
all sects all ages smack of this vice and he
enter angelo
angelo now what's the matter provost
provost is it your will claudio shall die to morrow
angelo did not i tell thee yea hadst thou not order
why dost thou ask again
provost lest i might be too rash
under your good correction i have seen
when after execution judgment hath
repented o'er his doom
do you your office or give up your place
and you shall well be spar'd
provost i crave your honour's pardon
what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet
she's very near her hour
angelo dispose of her
to some more fitter place and that with speed
re enter servant
servant here is the sister of the man condemnd
angelo hath he a sister
provost ay my good lord a very virtuous maid
and to be shortly of a sisterhood
if not already
angelo well let her be admitted exit servant
see you the fornicatress be remov'd
let her have needful but not lavish means
there shall be order for't
enter lucio and isabella
angelo stay a little while to isabella y'are welcome what's
your will
isabella i am a woeful suitor to your honour
please but your honour hear me
angelo well what's your suit
isabella there is a vice that most i do abhor
and most desire should meet the blow of justice
for which i would not plead but that i must
for which i must not plead but that i am
angelo well the matter
isabella i have a brother is condemnd to die
i do beseech you let it be his fault
and not my brother
provost aside heaven give thee moving graces
angelo condemn the fault and not the actor of it
why every fault's condemnd ere it be done
mine were the very cipher of a function
to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
isabella o just but severe law
i had a brother then heaven keep your honour
lucio to isabella give't not o'er so to him again entreat him
kneel down before him hang upon his gown
you are too cold if you should need a pin
you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
to him i say
isabella must he needs die
angelo maiden no remedy
and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
angelo i will not do't
isabella but can you if you would
angelo look what i will not that i cannot do
isabella but might you do't and do the world no wrong
if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
as mine is to him
angelo he's sentenc'd 'tis too late
lucio to isabella you are too cold
may call it back again well believe this
no ceremony that to great ones longs
not the king's crown nor the deputed sword
the marshals truncheon nor the judge's robe
become them with one half so good a grace
as mercy does
if he had been as you and you as he
you would have slipp'd like him but he like you
would not have been so stern
isabella i would to heaven i had your potency
and you were isabel should it then be thus
no i would tell what 'twere to be a judge
and what a prisoner
lucio to isabella ay touch him there's the vein
angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law
and you but waste your words
isabella alas alas
why all the souls that were were forfeit once
found out the remedy how would you be
if he which is the top of judgment should
but judge you as you are o think on that
and mercy then will breathe within your lips
like man new made
angelo be you content fair maid
it is the law not i condemn your brother
were he my kinsman brother or my son
it should be thus with him he must die to morrow
he's not prepar'd for death even for our kitchens
we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
with less respect than we do minister
to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you
who is it that hath died for this offence
there's many have committed it
lucio aside ay well said
angelo the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
those many had not dar'd to do that evil
had answer'd for his deed now 'tis awake
takes note of what is done and like a prophet
looks in a glass that shows what future evils
either now or by remissness new conceiv'd
and so in progress to be hatch'd and born
are now to have no successive degrees
but here they live to end
isabella yet show some pity
angelo i show it most of all when i show justice
which a dismiss'd offence would after gall
and do him right that answering one foul wrong
lives not to act another be satisfied
your brother dies to morrow be content
isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence
and he that suffers o it is excellent
to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous
to use it like a giant
lucio to isabella that's well said
as jove himself does jove would never be quiet
for every pelting petty officer
would use his heaven for thunder
nothing but thunder merciful heaven
thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
than the soft myrtle but man proud man
dress'd in a little brief authority
most ignorant of what he's most assur'd
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
as makes the angels weep who with our speens
would all themselves laugh mortal
lucio to isabella o to him to him wench he will relent
he's coming i perceive 't
provost aside pray heaven she win him
isabella we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them
but in the less foul profanation
isabella that in the captains but a choleric word
which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
lucio to isabella art avis'd o' that more ont
angelo why do you put these sayings upon me
isabella because authority though it err like others
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
that skins the vice o' th' top go to your bosom
knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
that's like my brother's fault if it confess
let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
against my brother's life
angelo aside she speaks and 'tis
such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well
isabella gentle my lord turn back
angelo i will bethink me come again to morrow
isabella hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back
angelo how bribe me
isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
isabella not with fond sicles of the tested gold
or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
as fancy values them but with true prayers
that shall be up at heaven and enter there
ere sun rise prayers from preserved souls
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
to nothing temporal
angelo well come to me to morrow
lucio to isabella go to 'tis well away
angelo aside amen for i
am that way going to temptation
where prayers cross
isabella at what hour to morrow
shall i attend your lordship
angelo at any time 'fore noon
isabella save your honour exeunt all but angelo
angelo from thee even from thy virtue
what's this what's this is this her fault or mine
empty
not she nor doth she tempt but it is i
that lying by the violet in the sun
do as the carrion does not as the flow'r
corrupt with virtuous season can it be
that modesty may more betray our sense
than womans lightness having waste ground enough
shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
dost thou desire her foully for those things
that make her good o let her brother live
thieves for their robbery have authority
when judges steal themselves what do i love her
that i desire to hear her speak again
and feast upon her eyes what is't i dream on
o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
is that temptation that doth goad us on
with all her double vigour art and nature
once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
subdues me quite ever till now
when men were fond i smild and wond'red how exit
scene iii
a prison
enter severally duke disguised as a friar and provost
duke hail to you provost so i think you are
provost i am the provost what's your will good friar
i come to visit the afflicted spirits
here in the prison do me the common right
to let me see them and to make me know
the nature of their crimes that i may minister
to them accordingly
provost i would do more than that if more were needful
enter juliet
look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
who falling in the flaws of her own youth
and he that got it sentenc'd a young man
more fit to do another such offence
than die for this
duke when must he die
provost as i do think to morrow
to juliet i have provided for you stay awhile
and you shall be conducted
duke repent you fair one of the sin you carry
juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently
and try your penitence if it be sound
or hollowly put on
juliet i'll gladly learn
duke love you the man that wrong'd you
juliet yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him
duke so then it seems your most offenceful act
was mutually committed
juliet mutually
duke then was your sin of heavier kind than his
duke 'tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven
showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
but as we stand in fear
juliet i do repent me as it is an evil
and take the shame with joy
duke there rest
your partner as i hear must die to morrow
grace go with you benedicite exit
juliet must die to morrow o injurious law
that respites me a life whose very comfort
is still a dying horror
provost 'tis pity of him exeunt
scene iv
angelo's house
enter angelo
angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray
whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth
as if i did but only chew his name
and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
of my conception the state whereon i studied
is like a good thing being often read
grown sere and tedious yea my gravity
wherein let no man hear me i take pride
could i with boot change for an idle plume
how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
to thy false seeming blood thou art blood
let's write 'good angel on the devils horn
'tis not the devils crest
enter servant
how now who's there
servant one isabel a sister desires access to you
angelo teach her the way exit servant o heavens
making both it unable for itself
and dispossessing all my other parts
of necessary fitness
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
come all to help him and so stop the air
by which he should revive and even so
the general subject to a well wish'd king
quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
crowd to his presence where their untaught love
enter isabella
how now fair maid
isabella i am come to know your pleasure
angelo that you might know it would much better please me
than to demand what 'tis your brother cannot live
isabella even so heaven keep your honour
angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be
as long as you or i yet he must die
isabella under your sentence
isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve
longer or shorter he may be so fitted
that his soul sicken not
angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
to pardon him that hath from nature stoln
a man already made as to remit
their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image
in stamps that are forbid 'tis all as easy
falsely to take away a life true made
to make a false one
isabella 'tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly
which had you rather that the most just law
now took your brother's life or to redeem him
give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
as she that he hath staind
isabella sir believe this
i had rather give my body than my soul
stand more for number than for accompt
isabella how say you
angelo nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak
against the thing i say answer to this
i now the voice of the recorded law
pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
might there not be a charity in sin
to save this brother's life
isabella please you to do't
it is no sin at all but charity
angelo pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul
were equal poise of sin and charity
isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin
heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer
to have it added to the faults of mine
and nothing of your answer
angelo nay but hear me
or seem so craftily and that's not good
isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good
but graciously to know i am no better
angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
when it doth tax itself as these black masks
proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
than beauty could display'd but mark me
to be received plain i'll speak more gross
your brother is to die
angelo and his offence is so as it appears
accountant to the law upon that pain
isabella true
angelo admit no other way to save his life
as i subscribe not that nor any other
but in the loss of question that you his sister
finding yourself desir'd of such a person
whose credit with the judge or own great place
could fetch your brother from the manacles
no earthly mean to save him but that either
you must lay down the treasures of your body
to this supposed or else to let him suffer
what would you do
isabella as much for my poor brother as myself
that is were i under the terms of death
th' impression of keen whips i'd wear as rubies
and strip myself to death as to a bed
that longing have been sick for ere i'd yield
angelo then must your brother die
isabella and 'twere the cheaper way
better it were a brother died at once
than that a sister by redeeming him
should die for ever
angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence
that you have slander'd so
isabella ignominy in ransom and free pardon
are of two houses lawful mercy
angelo you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant
and rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
a merriment than a vice
isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
i something do excuse the thing i hate
for his advantage that i dearly love
angelo we are all frail
isabella else let my brother die
owe and succeed thy weakness
angelo nay women are frail too
isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves
which are as easy broke as they make forms
women help heaven men their creation mar
in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
for we are soft as our complexions are
and credulous to false prints
angelo i think it well
since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
than faults may shake our frames let me be bold
i do arrest your words be that you are
that is a woman if you be more you're none
if you be one as you are well express'd
by all external warrants show it now
by putting on the destind livery
isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord
let me intreat you speak the former language
isabella my brother did love juliet
and you tell me that he shall die for't
angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love
isabella i know your virtue hath a license int
which seems a little fouler than it is
to pluck on others
angelo believe me on mine honour
my words express my purpose
isabella ha little honour to be much believ'd
i will proclaim thee angelo look for't
sign me a present pardon for my brother
or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud
what man thou art
angelo who will believe thee isabel
my unsoild name th' austereness of my life
my vouch against you and my place i' th' state
will so your accusation overweigh
that you shall stifle in your own report
and now i give my sensual race the rein
fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
by yielding up thy body to my will
or else he must not only die the death
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
to ling'ring sufferance answer me to morrow
or by the affection that now guides me most
say what you can my false o'erweighs your true exit
isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this
who would believe me o perilous mouths
that bear in them one and the self same tongue
either of condemnation or approof
bidding the law make curtsy to their will
hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite
to follow as it draws i'll to my brother
though he hath falln by prompture of the blood
that had he twenty heads to tender down
on twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up
before his sister should her body stoop
to such abhorr'd pollution
then isabel live chaste and brother die
more than our brother is our chastity
i'll tell him yet of angelo's request
and fit his mind to death for his souls rest exit
act iii scene i
enter duke disguised as before claudio and provost
duke so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
claudio the miserable have no other medicine
but only hope
i have hope to eve and am prepar'd to die
duke be absolute for death either death or life
shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life
if i do lose thee i do lose a thing
that none but fools would keep a breath thou art
that dost this habitation where thou keep'st
hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool
for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
and yet runst toward him still thou art not noble
for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
are nurs'd by baseness thou 'rt by no means valiant
for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep
and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st
for thou exists on many a thousand grains
that issue out of dust happy thou art not
for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get
and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain
for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
after the moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor
for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey
and death unloads thee friend hast thou none
the mere effusion of thy proper loins
do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
but as it were an after dinner's sleep
dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this
lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
that makes these odds all even
claudio i humbly thank you
to sue to live i find i seek to die
and seeking death find life let it come on
isabella within what ho peace here grace and good company
provost who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome
duke dear sir ere long i'll visit you again
claudio most holy sir i thank you
isabella my business is a word or two with claudio
provost and very welcome look signior here's your sister
duke provost a word with you
provost as many as you please
duke bring me to hear them speak where i may be conceald
exeunt duke and provost
claudio now sister what's the comfort
isabella why
as all comforts are most good most good indeed
intends you for his swift ambassador
where you shall be an everlasting leiger
therefore your best appointment make with speed
to morrow you set on
claudio is there no remedy
isabella none but such remedy as to save a head
to cleave a heart in twain
claudio but is there any
isabella yes brother you may live
if you'll implore it that will free your life
but fetter you till death
claudio perpetual durance
isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint
though all the world's vastidity you had
to a determind scope
claudio but in what nature
isabella in such a one as you consenting to't
would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
claudio let me know the point
isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
and six or seven winters more respect
than a perpetual honour dar'st thou die
the sense of death is most in apprehension
and the poor beetle that we tread upon
in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
as when a giant dies
think you i can a resolution fetch
from flow'ry tenderness if i must die
i will encounter darkness as a bride
and hug it in mine arms
isabella there spake my brother there my father's grave
did utter forth a voice yes thou must die
thou art too noble to conserve a life
in base appliances this outward sainted deputy
whose settled visage and deliberate word
as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
his filth within being cast he would appear
a pond as deep as hell
claudio the precise angelo
isabella o 'tis the cunning livery of hell
the damned'st body to invest and cover
in precise guards dost thou think claudio
if i would yield him my virginity
thou mightst be freed
isabella yes he would give't thee from this rank offence
so to offend him still this night's the time
that i should do what i abhor to name
or else thou diest to morrow
claudio thou shalt not do't
isabella o were it but my life
i'd throw it down for your deliverance
as frankly as a pin
claudio thanks dear isabel
claudio yes has he affections in him
that thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
when he would force it sure it is no sin
or of the deadly seven it is the least
isabella which is the least
claudio if it were damnable he being so wise
why would he for the momentary trick
be perdurably find o isabel
isabella what says my brother
isabella and shamed life a hateful
claudio ay but to die and go we know not where
to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
this sensible warm motion to become
a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice
to be imprisond in the viewless winds
and blown with restless violence round about
of those that lawless and incertain thought
imagine howling 'tis too horrible
the weariest and most loathed worldly life
that age ache penury and imprisonment
can lay on nature is a paradise
to what we fear of death
isabella alas alas
claudio sweet sister let me live
what sin you do to save a brother's life
that it becomes a virtue
isabella o you beast
o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
is't not a kind of incest to take life
from thine own sister's shame what should i think
heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair
for such a warped slip of wilderness
ne'er issu'd from his blood take my defiance
reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
no word to save thee
claudio nay hear me isabel
isabella o fie fie fie
thy sins not accidental but a trade
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
'tis best that thou diest quickly
claudio o hear me isabella
duke vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
isabella what is your will
duke might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have
some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is
likewise your own benefit
isabella i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out
of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
walks apart
duke son i have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true
therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your
resolution with hopes that are fallible to morrow you must die
go to your knees and make ready
claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life
that i will sue to be rid of it
empty
re enter provost
provost what's your will father
duke that now you are come you will be gone leave me a while
with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
her by my company
provost in good time exit provost
duke the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the
goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness
of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you
fortune hath convey'd to my understanding and but that frailty
hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how
will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother
isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how
much is the good duke deceiv'd in angelo if ever he return and
i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his
empty
he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only
therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in
doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to
your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
empty
isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
duke virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not
heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great
soldier who miscarried at sea
isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her
empty
duke she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by
oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was
wreck'd at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate
husband this well seeming angelo
isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her
duke left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his
comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries
of dishonour in few bestow'd her on her own lamentation which
she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is
isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man
live but how out of this can she avail
duke it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it
not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in
doing it
isabella show me how good father
duke this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should
made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to
the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that
your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all
shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience
this being granted in course and now follows all we shall
advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your
place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may
compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother
the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for
his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the
doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what
think you of it
isabella the image of it gives me content already and i trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection
duke it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to
angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him
promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke's there
place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be
empty
isabella i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father

what news friar of the duke
duke i know none can you tell me of any
lucio some say he is with the emperor of russia other some he is
in rome but where is he think you
lucio it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo
dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to't
duke he does well int
lucio a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him
something too crabbed that way friar
duke it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
lucio yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is
well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it
true think you
duke how should he be made then
lucio some report a sea maid spawnd him some that he was begot
between two stock fishes but it is certain that when he makes
water his urine is congeald ice that i know to be true and he
is a motion generative that's infallible
duke you are pleasant sir and speak apace
lucio why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion
is absent have done this ere he would have hang'd a man for the
getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service
and that instructed him to mercy
duke i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was
not inclind that way
lucio o sir you are deceiv'd
duke 'tis not possible
lucio who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use
him he would be drunk too that let me inform you
duke you do him wrong surely
lucio sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and
i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing
duke what i prithee might be the cause
lucio no pardon 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file
of the subject held the duke to be wise
duke wise why no question but he was
duke either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very
stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a
warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but
testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you
speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much
dark'ned in your malice
lucio sir i know him and i love him
duke love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer
lucio come sir i know what i know
duke i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak
but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me
desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you
have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call
upon you and i pray you your name
lucio sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
duke he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you
lucio i fear you not
too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm
you'll forswear this again
lucio i'll be hang'd first thou art deceiv'd in me friar but no
more of this canst thou tell if claudio die to morrow or no
duke why should he die sir
lucio why for filling a bottle with a tun dish i would the duke
we talk of were returnd again this ungenitur'd agent will
unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in
his house eaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would
light would he were returnd marry this claudio is condemned
for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the
duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays he's not
past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar

dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and
as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing there is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough
to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the
wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every
day's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
know himself
duke what pleasure was he given to
escalus rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
anything which profess'd to make him rejoice a gentleman of all
temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they
may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find
claudio prepar'd i am made to understand that you have lent him
empty
duke he professes to have received no sinister measure from his
justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his
frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good
leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolv'd to die
escalus you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner
the very debt of your calling i have labour'd for the poor
gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother
justice have i found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him
he is indeed justice
duke if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it
sentenc'd himself
escalus i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well
duke peace be with you exeunt escalus and provost

provost none since the curfew rung
provost no

provost what comfort is for claudio
duke there's some in hope
provost it is a bitter deputy
duke not so not so his life is paralleld
even with the stroke and line of his great justice
he doth with holy abstinence subdue
that in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
which he corrects then were he tyrannous
but this being so he's just knocking within now are they
come exit provost
this is a gentle provost seldom when
the steeled gaoler is the friend of men knocking within
how now what noise that spirit's possess'd with haste
that wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes
re enter provost

duke have you no countermand for claudio yet
but he must die to morrow
provost none sir none
duke as near the dawning provost as it is
you shall hear more ere morning
provost happily
you something know yet i believe there comes
no countermand no such example have we
besides upon the very siege of justice
profess'd the contrary
enter a messenger
this is his lordship's man
duke and here comes claudio's pardon
messenger my lord hath sent you this note and by me this further
charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it
neither in time matter or other circumstance good morrow for
as i take it it is almost day
provost i shall obey him exit messenger
for which the pardoner himself is in
hence hath offence his quick celerity
when it is borne in high authority
when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended
that for the fault's love is th' offender friended
now sir what news
provost i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine
office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks
strangely for he hath not us'd it before
provost reads 'whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon
barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudio's
head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought
that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not
to do your office as you will answer it at your peril'
what say you to this sir
duke what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th'
empty
one that is a prisoner nine years old
duke how came it that the absent duke had not either deliver'd him
to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his
manner to do so
provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed
his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to
an undoubted proof
duke it is now apparent
provost most manifest and not denied by himself
be touch'd
provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past
present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately
empty
duke he wants advice
provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many
times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft
seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
duke more of him anon there is written in your brow provost
honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill
beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself
in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no
greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenc'd him to
make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four
days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and
a dangerous courtesy
duke in the delaying death
provost alack how may i do it having the hour limited and an
express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view
of angelo i may make my case as claudio's to cross this in the
empty
duke by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions
may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed
and his head borne to angelo
provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the
penitent to be so bar'd before his death you know the course is
common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against
it with my life
provost pardon me good father it is against my oath
duke were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
provost to him and to his substitutes
duke you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch
provost but what likelihood is in that
duke not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you
fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can
with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck
all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of
the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is
not strange to you
provost i know them both
duke the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall
these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows
not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour
perchance of the duke's death perchance entering into some
monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look th'
unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into
amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but
easy when they are known call your executioner and off with
barnardine's head i will give him a present shrift and advise
him for a better place yet you are amaz'd but this shall
empty

injurious world most damned angelo
duke this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot

scene iv
angelo's house
enter angelo and escalus
escalus every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other
like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why
meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there
escalus i guess not
angelo and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
ent'ring that if any crave redress of injustice they should
exhibit their petitions in the street
escalus he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which
shall then have no power to stand against us
betimes i' th' morn i'll call you at your house
give notice to such men of sort and suit
as are to meet him
escalus i shall sir fare you well
angelo good night exit escalus
this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
and dull to all proceedings a deflow'red maid
and by an eminent body that enforc'd
the law against it but that her tender shame
how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no
for my authority bears a so credent bulk
that no particular scandal once can touch
but it confounds the breather he should have liv'd
save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
might in the times to come have ta'en revenge
by so receiving a dishonour'd life
with ransom of such shame would yet he had liv'd
alack when once our grace we have forgot
scene v
fields without the town
enter duke in his own habit and friar peter
duke these letters at fit time deliver me giving letters
the provost knows our purpose and our plot
the matter being afoot keep your instruction
and hold you ever to our special drift
though sometimes you do blench from this to that
as cause doth minister go call at flavius' house
to valentinus rowland and to crassus
and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
but send me flavius first
peter it shall be speeded well exit friar

scene vi
enter isabella and mariana
isabella to speak so indirectly i am loath
i would say the truth but to accuse him so
that is your part yet i am advis'd to do it
he says to veil full purpose
mariana be ruld by him
isabella besides he tells me that if peradventure
he speak against me on the adverse side
i should not think it strange for 'tis a physic
mariana i would friar peter
enter friar peter
isabella o peace the friar is come
peter come i have found you out a stand most fit
where you may have such vantage on the duke
he shall not pass you twice have the trumpets sounded
the generous and gravest citizens
have hent the gates and very near upon
the duke is ent'ring therefore hence away exeunt
the city gate
enter at several doors duke varrius lords angelo escalus lucio
provost officers and citizens
duke my very worthy cousin fairly met
our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
angelo escalus happy return be to your royal grace
duke many and hearty thankings to you both
we have made inquiry of you and we hear
such goodness of your justice that our soul
forerunning more requital
angelo you make my bonds still greater
duke o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it
to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
when it deserves with characters of brass
a forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
and razure of oblivion give me your hand
and let the subject see to make them know
that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
you must walk by us on our other hand
and good supporters are you
enter friar peter and isabella
peter now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
isabella justice o royal duke vail your regard
upon a wrong'd i would fain have said a maid
o worthy prince dishonour not your eye
by throwing it on any other object
till you have heard me in my true complaint
duke relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief
here is lord angelo shall give you justice
reveal yourself to him
isabella o worthy duke
you bid me seek redemption of the devil
hear me yourself for that which i must speak
must either punish me not being believ'd
or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here
angelo my lord her wits i fear me are not firm
cut off by course of justice
isabella by course of justice
angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange
isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak
that angelo's forsworn is it not strange
that angelo's a murderer is't not strange
that angelo is an adulterous thief
an hypocrite a virgin violator
is it not strange and strange
isabella it is not truer he is angelo
than this is all as true as it is strange
nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
to th' end of reck'ning
duke away with her poor soul
she speaks this in th' infirmity of sense
isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believ'st
there is another comfort than this world
that thou neglect me not with that opinion
that which but seems unlike 'tis not impossible
but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground
may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
as angelo even so may angelo
in all his dressings characts titles forms
be an arch villain believe it royal prince
if he be less he's nothing but he's more
had i more name for badness
duke by mine honesty
her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
such a dependency of thing on thing
as e'er i heard in madness
isabella o gracious duke
harp not on that nor do not banish reason
for inequality but let your reason serve
to make the truth appear where it seems hid
and hide the false seems true
duke many that are not mad
isabella i am the sister of one claudio
condemnd upon the act of fornication
to lose his head condemnd by angelo
i in probation of a sisterhood
was sent to by my brother one lucio
as then the messenger
lucio that's i ant like your grace
i came to her from claudio and desir'd her
to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
isabella that's he indeed
duke you were not bid to speak
lucio no my good lord
nor wish'd to hold my peace
duke i wish you now then
pray you take note of it and when you have
a business for yourself pray heaven you then
be perfect
lucio i warrant your honour
isabella this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
lucio right
duke it may be right but you are i' the wrong
to speak before your time proceed
isabella i went
to this pernicious caitiff deputy
duke that's somewhat madly spoken
isabella pardon it
the phrase is to the matter
isabella in brief to set the needless process by
how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneeld
how he refelld me and how i replied
for this was of much length the vile conclusion
i now begin with grief and shame to utter
he would not but by gift of my chaste body
to his concupiscible intemperate lust
release my brother and after much debatement
my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
for my poor brother's head
duke this is most likely
isabella o that it were as like as it is true
duke by heaven fond wretch thou know'st not what thou speak'st
or else thou art subornd against his honour
in hateful practice first his integrity
stands without blemish next it imports no reason
that with such vehemency he should pursue
he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
and not have cut him off some one hath set you on
confess the truth and say by whose advice
thou cam'st here to complain
isabella and is this all
then o you blessed ministers above
keep me in patience and with ripened time
unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
duke i know you'd fain be gone an officer
to prison with her shall we thus permit
a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
on him so near us this needs must be a practice
who knew of your intent and coming hither
isabella one that i would were here friar lodowick
duke a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick
lucio my lord i know him 'tis a meddling friar
i do not like the man had he been lay my lord
in your retirement i had swing'd him soundly
duke words against me this's a good friar belike
and to set on this wretched woman here
against our substitute let this friar be found
lucio but yesternight my lord she and that friar
i saw them at the prison a saucy friar
a very scurvy fellow
peter blessed be your royal grace
i have stood by my lord and i have heard
most wrongfully accus'd your substitute
who is as free from touch or soil with her
as she from one ungot
duke we did believe no less
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
peter i know him for a man divine and holy
not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
as he's reported by this gentleman
and on my trust a man that never yet
lucio my lord most villainously believe it
peter well he in time may come to clear himself
but at this instant he is sick my lord
of a strange fever upon his mere request
being come to knowledge that there was complaint
intended 'gainst lord angelo came i hither
to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
is true and false and what he with his oath
and all probation will make up full clear
to justify this worthy nobleman
so vulgarly and personally accus'd
her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
till she herself confess it
duke good friar let's hear it exit isabella guarded
do you not smile at this lord angelo
o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
give us some seats come cousin angelo
in this i'll be impartial be you judge
enter mariana veiled
is this the witness friar
first let her show her face and after speak
mariana pardon my lord i will not show my face
until my husband bid me
duke what are you married
mariana no my lord
duke are you a maid
mariana no my lord
mariana neither my lord
duke why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
lucio my lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither
maid widow nor wife
duke silence that fellow i would he had some cause
to prattle for himself
lucio well my lord
mariana my lord i do confess i ne'er was married
and i confess besides i am no maid
knows not that ever he knew me
lucio he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
duke for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
lucio well my lord
duke this is no witness for lord angelo
mariana now i come to't my lord
she that accuses him of fornication
in self same manner doth accuse my husband
and charges him my lord with such a time
with all th' effect of love
angelo charges she moe than me
mariana not that i know
duke no you say your husband
mariana why just my lord and that is angelo
who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
but knows he thinks that he knows isabels
angelo this is a strange abuse let's see thy face
mariana my husband bids me now i will unmask
this is that face thou cruel angelo
which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on
this is the hand which with a vow'd contract
was fast belock'd in thine this is the body
that took away the match from isabel
and did supply thee at thy garden house
in her imagind person
duke know you this woman
lucio carnally she says
lucio enough my lord
angelo my lord i must confess i know this woman
and five years since there was some speech of marriage
betwixt myself and her which was broke off
partly for that her promised proportions
came short of composition but in chief
for that her reputation was disvalued
in levity since which time of five years
i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
mariana noble prince
as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
i am affianc'd this mans wife as strongly
as words could make up vows and my good lord
but tuesday night last gone ins garden house
he knew me as a wife as this is true
let me in safety raise me from my knees
or else for ever be confixed here
angelo i did but smile till now
now good my lord give me the scope of justice
my patience here is touch'd i do perceive
these poor informal women are no more
but instruments of some more mightier member
that sets them on let me have way my lord
to find this practice out
duke ay with my heart
and punish them to your height of pleasure
compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths
though they would swear down each particular saint
were testimonies against his worth and credit
that's seald in approbation you lord escalus
sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
to find out this abuse whence 'tis deriv'd
there is another friar that set them on
let him be sent for
peter would lie were here my lord for he indeed
your provost knows the place where he abides
and he may fetch him
duke go do it instantly exit provost
and you my noble and well warranted cousin
whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
do with your injuries as seems you best
in any chastisement i for a while will leave you
but stir not you till you have well determind
upon these slanderers
signior lucio did not you say you knew that friar lodowick to be
a dishonest person
lucio 'cucullus non facit monachum' honest in nothing but in his
clothes and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
empty
escalus we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him we shall find this friar a notable
empty
lucio as any in vienna on my word
her exit an attendant pray you my lord give me leave to
question you shall see how i'll handle her
lucio not better than he by her own report
escalus say you

angelo o my dread lord

duke come hither isabel
your friar is now your prince as i was then
advertising and holy to your business
not changing heart with habit i am still
attorney'd at your service
isabella o give me pardon
that i your vassal have employ'd and paind
duke you are pardond isabel
and now dear maid be you as free to us
your brother's death i know sits at your heart
and you may marvel why i obscur'd myself
labouring to save his life and would not rather
make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
than let him so be lost o most kind maid
it was the swift celerity of his death
which i did think with slower foot came on
that life is better life past fearing death
than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
so happy is your brother
isabella i do my lord
re enter angelo mariana friar peter and provost
duke for this new married man approaching here
whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
your well defended honour you must pardon
for mariana's sake but as he adjudg'd your brother
of sacred chastity and of promise breach
thereon dependent for your brother's life
the very mercy of the law cries out
most audible even from his proper tongue
'an angelo for claudio death for death'
haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
like doth quit like and measure still for measure
then angelo thy fault's thus manifested
which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste
away with him
mariana o my most gracious lord
i hope you will not mock me with a husband
duke it is your husband mock'd you with a husband
consenting to the safeguard of your honour
i thought your marriage fit else imputation
for that he knew you might reproach your life
and choke your good to come for his possessions
we do instate and widow you withal
to buy you a better husband
mariana o my dear lord
i crave no other nor no better man
duke never crave him we are definitive
mariana gentle my liege kneeling
duke you do but lose your labour
away with him to death to lucio now sir to you
mariana o my good lord sweet isabel take my part
i'll lend you all my life to do you service
duke against all sense you do importune her
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
and take her hence in horror
mariana isabel
sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me
hold up your hands say nothing i'll speak all
they say best men moulded out of faults
for being a little bad so may my husband
o isabel will you not lend a knee
duke he dies for claudio's death
isabella kneeling most bounteous sir
look if it please you on this man condemnd
as if my brother liv'd i partly think
a due sincerity governd his deeds
till he did look on me since it is so
let him not die my brother had but justice
for angelo
his act did not o'ertake his bad intent
and must be buried but as an intent
that perish'd by the way thoughts are no subjects
intents but merely thoughts
mariana merely my lord
duke your suit's unprofitable stand up i say
i have bethought me of another fault
provost how came it claudio was beheaded
provost it was commanded so
duke had you a special warrant for the deed
provost no my good lord it was by private message
duke for which i do discharge you of your office
give up your keys
provost pardon me noble lord
i thought it was a fault but knew it not
yet did repent me after more advice
for testimony whereof one in the prison
i have reserv'd alive
duke what's he
provost his name is barnardine
duke i would thou hadst done so by claudio
go fetch him hither let me look upon him exit provost
escalus i am sorry one so learned and so wise
as you lord angelo have still appear'd
should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
and lack of temper'd judgment afterward
and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
that i crave death more willingly than mercy
'tis my deserving and i do entreat it
re enter provost with barnardine claudio muffled
and juliet
duke which is that barnardine
provost this my lord
duke there was a friar told me of this man
sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
and squar'st thy life according thou'rt condemnd
but for those earthly faults i quit them all
and pray thee take this mercy to provide
for better times to come friar advise him
i leave him to your hand what muffld fellow's that
provost this is another prisoner that i sav'd
who should have died when claudio lost his head
as like almost to claudio as himself unmuffles claudio
duke to isabella if he be like your brother for his sake
give me your hand and say you will be mine
he is my brother too but fitter time for that
by this lord angelo perceives he's safe
methinks i see a quick'ning in his eye
well angelo your evil quits you well
look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
i find an apt remission in myself
and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon
to lucio you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
wherein have i so deserv'd of you
that you extol me thus
lucio faith my lord i spoke it but according to the trick
if you will hang me for it you may but i had rather it would
please you i might be whipt
duke whipt first sir and hang'd after
proclaim it provost round about the city
if any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
as i have heard him swear himself there's one
and he shall marry her the nuptial finish'd
let him be whipt and hang'd
lucio i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore your
highness said even now i made you a duke good my lord do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold
duke upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
thy slanders i forgive and therewithal
remit thy other forfeits take him to prison
and see our pleasure herein executed
and hanging
duke slandering a prince deserves it
exeunt officers with lucio
she claudio that you wrong'd look you restore
joy to you mariana love her angelo
i have confess'd her and i know her virtue
thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness
there's more behind that is more gratulate
thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
forgive him angelo that brought you home
the head of ragozine for claudio's
th' offence pardons itself dear isabel
i have a motion much imports your good
whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine
so bring us to our palace where we'll show
what's yet behind that's meet you all should know

venice and portia's house at belmont
act i scene i
venice a street
antonio in sooth i know not why i am so sad
it wearies me you say it wearies you
but how i caught it found it or came by it
what stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born
i am to learn
and such a want wit sadness makes of me
that i have much ado to know myself
salerio your mind is tossing on the ocean
there where your argosies with portly sail
or as it were the pageants of the sea
do overpeer the petty traffickers
that curtsy to them do them reverence
as they fly by them with their woven wings
solanio believe me sir had i such venture forth
the better part of my affections would
be with my hopes abroad i should be still
plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
would make me sad
salerio my wind cooling my broth
would blow me to an ague when i thought
what harm a wind too great might do at sea
i should not see the sandy hour glass run
but i should think of shallows and of flats
and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand
vailing her high top lower than her ribs
and see the holy edifice of stone
and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
which touching but my gentle vessels side
would scatter all her spices on the stream
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
and in a word but even now worth this
and now worth nothing shall i have the thought
to think on this and shall i lack the thought
that such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad
is sad to think upon his merchandise
antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it
my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
nor to one place nor is my whole estate
upon the fortune of this present year
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
solanio why then you are in love
antonio fie fie
solanio not in love neither then let us say you are sad
for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
because you are not sad now by two headed janus
nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time
some that will evermore peep through their eyes
and laugh like parrots at a bag piper
and other of such vinegar aspect
that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
though nestor swear the jest be laughable
enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano
gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well
we leave you now with better company
salerio i would have stay'd till i had made you merry
if worthier friends had not prevented me
antonio your worth is very dear in my regard
i take it your own business calls on you
and you embrace th' occasion to depart
salerio good morrow my good lords
bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
salerio we'll make our leisures to attend on yours
exeunt salerio and solanio
lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio
we two will leave you but at dinner time
i pray you have in mind where we must meet
bassanio i will not fail you
gratiano you look not well signior antonio
you have too much respect upon the world
they lose it that do buy it with much care
antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano
a stage where every man must play a part
and mine a sad one
gratiano let me play the fool
with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
and let my liver rather heat with wine
than my heart cool with mortifying groans
why should a man whose blood is warm within
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
by being peevish i tell thee what antonio
i love thee and 'tis my love that speaks
there are a sort of men whose visages
do cream and mantle like a standing pond
and do a wilful stillness entertain
with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
of wisdom gravity profound conceit
as who should say 'i am sir oracle
and when i ope my lips let no dog bark'
that therefore only are reputed wise
for saying nothing when i am very sure
if they should speak would almost damn those ears
which hearing them would call their brothers fools
i'll tell thee more of this another time
but fish not with this melancholy bait
for this fool gudgeon this opinion
come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile
i'll end my exhortation after dinner
i must be one of these same dumb wise men
for gratiano never lets me speak
gratiano well keep me company but two years moe
thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
antonio fare you well i'll grow a talker for this gear
gratiano thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable
in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
exeunt gratiano and lorenzo
antonio is that anything now
any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find
them and when you have them they are not worth the search
antonio well tell me now what lady is the same
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
that you to day promis'd to tell me of
bassanio 'tis not unknown to you antonio
how much i have disabled mine estate
by something showing a more swelling port
nor do i now make moan to be abridg'd
from such a noble rate but my chief care
is to come fairly off from the great debts
wherein my time something too prodigal
hath left me gag'd to you antonio
i owe the most in money and in love
and from your love i have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes
how to get clear of all the debts i owe
and if it stand as you yourself still do
within the eye of honour be assur'd
my purse my person my extremest means
lie all unlock'd to your occasions
bassanio in my school days when i had lost one shaft
i shot his fellow of the self same flight
the self same way with more advised watch
to find the other forth and by adventuring both
i oft found both i urge this childhood proof
i owe you much and like a wilful youth
that which i owe is lost but if you please
to shoot another arrow that self way
which you did shoot the first i do not doubt
as i will watch the aim or to find both
or bring your latter hazard back again
and thankfully rest debtor for the first
antonio you know me well and herein spend but time
to wind about my love with circumstance
in making question of my uttermost
than if you had made waste of all i have
then do but say to me what i should do
that in your knowledge may by me be done
and i am prest unto it therefore speak
bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left
and she is fair and fairer than that word
of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
i did receive fair speechless messages
to cato's daughter brutus' portia
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors and her sunny locks
hang on her temples like a golden fleece
which makes her seat of belmont colchos' strond
and many jasons come in quest of her
o my antonio had i but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them
that i should questionless be fortunate
antonio thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
neither have i money nor commodity
to raise a present sum therefore go forth
try what my credit can in venice do
that shall be rack'd even to the uttermost
to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia
go presently inquire and so will i
where money is and i no question make
scene ii
belmont portia's house
enter portia with her waiting woman nerissa
portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this
great world
nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the
same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i
see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be
competency lives longer
portia good sentences and well pronounc'd
nerissa they would be better if well followed
portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do
chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes'
palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i
can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one
of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise
laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree
counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband o me the word 'choose' i may neither
choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a
living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father is it not
hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death
have good inspirations therefore the lott'ry that he hath
devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof
who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be
what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these
princely suitors that are already come
portia i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will
describe them and according to my description level at my
empty
nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince
portia ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of
his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good
parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afear'd my lady his
nerissa then is there the county palatine
portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say 'an you will
not have me choose' he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear
he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so
full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married
to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of
these god defend me from these two
nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in
horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of
frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a
throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with
his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty
husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he
love me to madness i shall never requite him
nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of
empty
portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me
will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth
in the english he is a proper mans picture but alas who can
converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he
bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet
in germany and his behaviour everywhere
nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed
a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him
again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety
nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony's
empty
portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most
vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is
a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little
better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i
shall make shift to go without him
nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket
you should refuse to perform your father's will if you should
portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep
glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be
within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i
will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge
nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these lords
they have acquainted me with their determinations which is
indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more
suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets
diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father's will i
am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not
one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god
grant them a fair departure
nerissa do you not remember lady in your father's time a
venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of
the marquis of montferrat
portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he calld
nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy
empty
enter a servingman
how now what news
servingman the four strangers seek for you madam to take their
leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of
morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here
empty
portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i
approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion
of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me
come nerissa sirrah go before
whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the
door exeunt
scene iii
venice a public place
enter bassanio with shylock the jew
shylock three thousand ducats well
shylock for three months well
bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
shylock antonio shall become bound well
bassanio may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your
empty
shylock three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
bassanio your answer to that
shylock antonio is a good man
bassanio have you heard any imputation to the contrary
is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means
are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another
to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a
third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he
hath squand'red abroad but ships are but boards sailors but
men there be land rats and water rats water thieves and
land thieves i mean pirates and then there is the peril of
waters winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding
sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may take his bond
shylock i will be assur'd i may and that i may be assured i
will bethink me may i speak with antonio
bassanio if it please you to dine with us
shylock yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your
prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i will buy with
you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so
following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray
with you what news on the rialto who is he comes here
enter antonio
shylock aside how like a fawning publican he looks
i hate him for he is a christian
but more for that in low simplicity
he lends out money gratis and brings down
the rate of usance here with us in venice
if i can catch him once upon the hip
i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
he hates our sacred nation and he rails
even there where merchants most do congregate
which he calls interest cursed be my tribe
if i forgive him
bassanio shylock do you hear
shylock i am debating of my present store
and by the near guess of my memory
i cannot instantly raise up the gross
of full three thousand ducats what of that
tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe
will furnish me but soft how many months
your worship was the last man in our mouths
antonio shylock albeit i neither lend nor borrow
by taking nor by giving of excess
yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
i'll break a custom to bassanio is he yet possess'd
how much ye would
shylock ay ay three thousand ducats
antonio and for three months
shylock i had forgot three months you told me so
methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
upon advantage
antonio i do never use it
shylock when jacob graz'd his uncle labans sheep
this jacob from our holy abram was
as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
the third possessor ay he was the third
antonio and what of him did he take interest
shylock no not take interest not as you would say
when laban and himself were compromis'd
that all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
should fall as jacob's hire the ewes being rank
in end of autumn turned to the rams
and when the work of generation was
between these woolly breeders in the act
the skilful shepherd pilld me certain wands
and in the doing of the deed of kind
he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
fall parti colour'd lambs and those were jacob's
this was a way to thrive and he was blest
and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
antonio this was a venture sir that jacob serv'd for
a thing not in his power to bring to pass
but sway'd and fashiond by the hand of heaven
was this inserted to make interest good
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
shylock i cannot tell i make it breed as fast
antonio aside mark you this bassanio
the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
an evil soul producing holy witness
is like a villain with a smiling cheek
a goodly apple rotten at the heart
o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
shylock three thousand ducats 'tis a good round sum
three months from twelve then let me see the rate
antonio well shylock shall we be beholding to you
in the rialto you have rated me
about my moneys and my usances
still have i borne it with a patient shrug
for suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe
you call me misbeliever cut throat dog
and spit upon my jewish gaberdine
and all for use of that which is mine own
well then it now appears you need my help
go to then you come to me and you say
you that did void your rheum upon my beard
and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold moneys is your suit
what should i say to you should i not say
'hath a dog money is it possible
a cur can lend three thousand ducats' or
shall i bend low and in a bondmans key
with bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness
say this
you spurnd me such a day another time
you calld me dog and for these courtesies
i'll lend you thus much moneys'
antonio i am as like to call thee so again
to spit on thee again to spurn thee too
if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
as to thy friends for when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal of his friend
but lend it rather to thine enemy
exact the penalty
shylock why look you how you storm
i would be friends with you and have your love
forget the shames that you have staind me with
supply your present wants and take no doit
of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me
this is kind i offer
bassanio this were kindness
shylock this kindness will i show
your single bond and in a merry sport
if you repay me not on such a day
in such a place such sum or sums as are
express'd in the condition let the forfeit
be nominated for an equal pound
of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
in what part of your body pleaseth me
antonio content in faith i'll seal to such a bond
and say there is much kindness in the jew
i'll rather dwell in my necessity
antonio why fear not man i will not forfeit it
within these two months that's a month before
this bond expires i do expect return
of thrice three times the value of this bond
shylock o father abram what these christians are
whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
the thoughts of others pray you tell me this
if he should break his day what should i gain
a pound of mans flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable profitable neither
as flesh of muttons beefs or goats i say
to buy his favour i extend this friendship
if he will take it so if not adieu
and for my love i pray you wrong me not
antonio yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
shylock then meet me forthwith at the notary's
give him direction for this merry bond
see to my house left in the fearful guard
of an unthrifty knave and presently
i'll be with you
antonio hie thee gentle jew exit shylock
the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
bassanio i like not fair terms and a villains mind
antonio come on in this there can be no dismay
my ships come home a month before the day exeunt
act ii scene i
flourish of cornets enter the prince of morocco a tawny moor all in white
and three or four followers accordingly with portia nerissa and train
prince of morocco mislike me not for my complexion
the shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun
to whom i am a neighbour and near bred

where phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles
and let us make incision for your love
to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
hath fear'd the valiant by my love i swear
the best regarded virgins of our clime
have lov'd it too i would not change this hue
except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
portia in terms of choice i am not solely led
by nice direction of a maidens eyes
besides the lott'ry of my destiny
bars me the right of voluntary choosing
but if my father had not scanted me
his wife who wins me by that means i told you
yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
as any comer i have look'd on yet
for my affection
prince of morocco even for that i thank you
therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets
to try my fortune by this scimitar
that slew the sophy and a persian prince
that won three fields of sultan solyman
outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear
yea mock the lion when 'a roars for prey
to win thee lady but alas the while
if hercules and lichas play at dice
which is the better man the greater throw
may turn by fortune from the weaker band
so is alcides beaten by his page
and so may i blind fortune leading me
and die with grieving
portia you must take your chance
and either not attempt to choose at all
or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
never to speak to lady afterward
in way of marriage therefore be advis'd
prince of morocco nor will not come bring me unto my chance
portia first forward to the temple after dinner
your hazard shall be made
to make me blest or cursed'st among men

enter launcelot gobbo
launcelot certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
jew my master the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying
to me 'gobbo launcelot gobbo good launcelot' or 'good gobbo' or
'good launcelot gobbo use your legs take the start run away'
honest gobbo' or as aforesaid 'honest launcelot gobbo do not
run scorn running with thy heels' well the most courageous
fiend bids me pack 'via' says the fiend 'away' says the
fiend 'for the heavens rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
'and run' well my conscience hanging about the neck of my
heart says very wisely to me 'my honest friend launcelot being
an honest mans son or rather 'an honest womans son for
indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a
kind of taste well my conscience says 'launcelot budge not'
'conscience' say i you counsel well' 'fiend' say i 'you
counsel well' to be ruld by my conscience i should stay with
the jew my master who god bless the mark is a kind of devil
and to run away from the jew i should be ruled by the fiend
who saving your reverence is the devil himself certainly the
jew is the very devil incarnation and in my conscience my
conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
me to stay with the jew the fiend gives the more friendly
counsel i will run fiend my heels are at your commandment i
enter old gobbo with a basket
gobbo master young man you i pray you which is the way to
master jew's

scene vi
venice before shylock's house
enter the maskers gratiano and salerio
gratiano this is the pent house under which lorenzo
desired us to make stand
gratiano and it is marvel he out dwells his hour
for lovers ever run before the clock
salerio o ten times faster venus' pigeons fly
to seal love's bonds new made than they are wont
to keep obliged faith unforfeited
gratiano that ever holds who riseth from a feast
with that keen appetite that he sits down
where is the horse that doth untread again
his tedious measures with the unbated fire
are with more spirit chased than enjoyed
how like a younker or a prodigal
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay
hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
how like the prodigal doth she return
with over weather'd ribs and ragged sails
lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind
enter lorenzo
salerio here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter
not i but my affairs have made you wait
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives
i'll watch as long for you then approach
here dwells my father jew ho who's within
enter jessica above in boy's clothes
jessica who are you tell me for more certainty
albeit i'll swear that i do know your tongue
lorenzo lorenzo and thy love
jessica lorenzo certain and my love indeed
but you lorenzo whether i am yours
lorenzo heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
jessica here catch this casket it is worth the pains
i am glad 'tis night you do not look on me
for i am much asham'd of my exchange
but love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit
for if they could cupid himself would blush
to see me thus transformed to a boy
jessica what must i hold a candle to my shames
they in themselves good sooth are too too light
why 'tis an office of discovery love
and i should be obscur'd
lorenzo so are you sweet
even in the lovely garnish of a boy
but come at once
for the close night doth play the runaway
and we are stay'd for at bassanio's feast
with some moe ducats and be with you straight
exit above
gratiano now by my hood a gentle and no jew
lorenzo beshrew me but i love her heartily
for she is wise if i can judge of her
and fair she is if that mine eyes be true

and therefore like herself wise fair and true
shall she be placed in my constant soul

scene vii
belmont portia's house
flourish of cornets enter portia with the prince of morocco
and their trains
portia go draw aside the curtains and discover
the several caskets to this noble prince
prince of morocco the first of gold who this inscription bears
'who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
the second silver which this promise carries
'who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
this third dull lead with warning all as blunt
'who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
how shall i know if i do choose the right
portia the one of them contains my picture prince
if you choose that then i am yours withal
i will survey th' inscriptions back again
what says this leaden casket
'who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
must give for what for lead hazard for lead
this casket threatens men that hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
i'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
what says the silver with her virgin hue
as much as he deserves pause there morocco
and weigh thy value with an even hand
if thou beest rated by thy estimation
thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
may not extend so far as to the lady
and yet to be afeard of my deserving
were but a weak disabling of myself
as much as i deserve why that's the lady
i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
but more than these in love i do deserve
what if i stray'd no farther but chose here
let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold
'who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
why that's the lady all the world desires her
from the four corners of the earth they come
to kiss this shrine this mortal breathing saint
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
of wide arabia are as throughfares now
the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
spits in the face of heaven is no bar
to stop the foreign spirits but they come
as o'er a brook to see fair portia
one of these three contains her heavenly picture
is't like that lead contains her 'twere damnation
to think so base a thought it were too gross
to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
or shall i think in silver she's immur'd
o sinful thought never so rich a gem
was set in worse than gold they have in england
a coin that bears the figure of an angel
stamp'd in gold but that's insculp'd upon
but here an angel in a golden bed
lies all within deliver me the key
here do i choose and thrive i as i may
portia there take it prince and if my form lie there
then i am yours he opens the golden casket
a carrion death within whose empty eye
there is a written scroll i'll read the writing
'all that glisters is not gold
often have you heard that told
many a man his life hath sold
but my outside to behold
gilded tombs do worms infold
had you been as wise as bold
young in limbs in judgment old
fare you well your suit is cold'
cold indeed and labour lost
then farewell heat and welcome frost
portia adieu i have too griev'd a heart
to take a tedious leave thus losers part
exit with his train flourish of cornets
portia a gentle riddance draw the curtains go
let all of his complexion choose me so exeunt
scene viii
enter salerio and solanio
salerio why man i saw bassanio under sail
with him is gratiano gone along
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
solanio the villain jew with outcries rais'd the duke
who went with him to search bassanio's ship
salerio he came too late the ship was under sail
but there the duke was given to understand
that in a gondola were seen together
besides antonio certified the duke
they were not with bassanio in his ship
solanio i never heard a passion so confus'd
so strange outrageous and so variable
as the dog jew did utter in the streets
'my daughter o my ducats o my daughter
fled with a christian o my christian ducats
justice the law my ducats and my daughter
a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
stoln by my daughter justice find the girl
she hath the stones upon her and the ducats'
salerio why all the boys in venice follow him
crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
solanio let good antonio look he keep his day
or he shall pay for this
salerio marry well rememb'red
i reasond with a frenchman yesterday
the french and english there miscarried
a vessel of our country richly fraught
i thought upon antonio when he told me
and wish'd in silence that it were not his
solanio you were best to tell antonio what you hear
yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
salerio a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
i saw bassanio and antonio part
bassanio told him he would make some speed
slubber not business for my sake bassanio
but stay the very riping of the time
and for the jew's bond which he hath of me
let it not enter in your mind of love
be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
to courtship and such fair ostents of love
as shall conveniently become you there'
and even there his eye being big with tears
turning his face he put his hand behind him
he wrung bassanio's hand and so they parted
solanio i think he only loves the world for him
i pray thee let us go and find him out
and quicken his embraced heaviness
with some delight or other
salerio do we so exeunt
scene ix
belmont portia's house
enter nerissa and a servitor
the prince of arragon hath ta'en his oath
and comes to his election presently
flourish of cornets enter the prince of arragon
portia and their trains
portia behold there stand the caskets noble prince
if you choose that wherein i am containd
straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd
but if you fail without more speech my lord
you must be gone from hence immediately
first never to unfold to any one
which casket 'twas i chose next if i fail
of the right casket never in my life
to woo a maid in way of marriage
empty
if i do fail in fortune of my choice
immediately to leave you and be gone
portia to these injunctions every one doth swear
that comes to hazard for my worthless self
to my heart's hope gold silver and base lead
'who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
what says the golden chest ha let me see
'who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
what many men desire that 'many' may be meant
by the fool multitude that choose by show
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
which pries not to th' interior but like the martlet
even in the force and road of casualty
i will not choose what many men desire
because i will not jump with common spirits
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
why then to thee thou silver treasure house
tell me once more what title thou dost bear
'who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
and well said too for who shall go about
to cozen fortune and be honourable
to wear an undeserved dignity
o that estates degrees and offices
were not deriv'd corruptly and that clear honour
were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer
how many then should cover that stand bare
how many be commanded that command
how much low peasantry would then be gleaned
from the true seed of honour and how much honour
pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
'who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
i will assume desert give me a key for this
and instantly unlock my fortunes here
he opens the silver casket
portia aside too long a pause for that which you find there
arragon what's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule i will read it
how much unlike art thou to portia
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
did i deserve no more than a fools head
is that my prize are my deserts no better
portia to offend and judge are distinct offices
and of opposed natures
arragon what is here reads
'the fire seven times tried this
seven times tried that judgment is
that did never choose amiss
some there be that shadows kiss
there be fools alive iwis
silver'd o'er and so was this
take what wife you will to bed
i will ever be your head
so be gone you are sped'
still more fool i shall appear
by the time i linger here
with one fools head i came to woo
but i go away with two
patiently to bear my wroth exit with his train
portia thus hath the candle sing'd the moth
o these deliberate fools when they do choose
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose
nerissa the ancient saying is no heresy
hanging and wiving goes by destiny
portia come draw the curtain nerissa
enter a servant
servant where is my lady
servant madam there is alighted at your gate
a young venetian one that comes before
to signify th' approaching of his lord
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets
to wit besides commends and courteous breath
gifts of rich value yet i have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love
a day in april never came so sweet
to show how costly summer was at hand
portia no more i pray thee i am half afeard
thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him
come come nerissa for i long to see
quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly
nerissa bassanio lord love if thy will it be exeunt
act iii scene i
venice a street
enter solanio and salerio
salerio why yet it lives there uncheck'd that antonio hath a ship
of rich lading wreck'd on the narrow seas the goodwins i think
they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the
carcases of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my
gossip report be an honest woman of her word
solanio i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a
third husband but it is true without any slips of prolixity or
crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the
empty
salerio come the full stop
solanio ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath lost a
empty
salerio i would it might prove the end of his losses
solanio let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer
for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
enter shylock
how now shylock what news among the merchants
daughter's flight
salerio that's certain i for my part knew the tailor that made
the wings she flew withal
solanio and shylock for his own part knew the bird was flidge
and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam
shylock she is damnd for it
salerio that's certain if the devil may be her judge
shylock my own flesh and blood to rebel
solanio out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
salerio there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is
between red wine and rhenish but tell us do you hear whether
antonio have had any loss at sea or no
shylock there i have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal
who dare scarce show his head on the rialto a beggar that was
us'd to come so smug upon the mart let him look to his bond he
was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond he was wont
to lend money for a christian courtesy let him look to his bond
flesh what's that good for
shylock to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it will
feed my revenge he hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a
million laugh'd at my losses mock'd at my gains scorned my
nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine
enemies and what's his reason i am a jew hath not a jew eyes
hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections
passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons
subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed
you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we
not revenge if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you
in that if a jew wrong a christian what is his humility
revenge if a christian wrong a jew what should his sufferance
be by christian example why revenge the villainy you teach me
i will execute and itshall go hard but i will better the
empty
enter a man from antonio

scene ii
belmont portia's house
portia i pray you tarry pause a day or two
before you hazard for in choosing wrong
i lose your company therefore forbear a while
there's something tells me but it is not love
i would not lose you and you know yourself
hate counsels not in such a quality
but lest you should not understand me well
and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
i would detain you here some month or two
how to choose right but then i am forsworn
so will i never be so may you miss me
but if you do you'll make me wish a sin
that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes
they have o'erlook'd me and divided me
one half of me is yours the other half yours
mine own i would say but if mine then yours
and so all yours o these naughty times
puts bars between the owners and their rights
let fortune go to hell for it not i
i speak too long but 'tis to peize the time
to eke it and to draw it out in length
to stay you from election
bassanio let me choose
for as i am i live upon the rack
portia upon the rack bassanio then confess
what treason there is mingled with your love
bassanio none but that ugly treason of mistrust
there may as well be amity and life
'tween snow and fire as treason and my love
portia ay but i fear you speak upon the rack
where men enforced do speak anything
bassanio promise me life and i'll confess the truth
portia well then confess and live
bassanio 'confess' and 'love'
had been the very sum of my confession
o happy torment when my torturer
but let me to my fortune and the caskets
portia away then i am lock'd in one of them
if you do love me you will find me out
nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice
then if he lose he makes a swan like end
fading in music that the comparison
may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
and wat'ry death bed for him he may win
even as the flourish when true subjects bow
to a new crowned monarch such it is
as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
and summon him to marriage now he goes
with no less presence but with much more love
than young alcides when he did redeem
the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice
with bleared visages come forth to view
the issue of th' exploit go hercules
live thou i live with much much more dismay
i view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray
a song
the whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself
tell me where is fancy bred
or in the heart or in the head
how begot how nourished
it is engend'red in the eyes
with gazing fed and fancy dies
in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancy's knell
i'll begin it ding dong bell
all ding dong bell
bassanio so may the outward shows be least themselves
the world is still deceiv'd with ornament
in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
obscures the show of evil in religion
what damned error but some sober brow
will bless it and approve it with a text
hiding the grossness with fair ornament
there is no vice so simple but assumes
some mark of virtue on his outward parts
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
the beards of hercules and frowning mars
and these assume but valour's excrement
to render them redoubted look on beauty
and you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight
which therein works a miracle in nature
making them lightest that wear most of it
so are those crisped snaky golden locks
which make such wanton gambols with the wind
upon supposed fairness often known
to be the dowry of a second head
thus ornament is but the guiled shore
to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
veiling an indian beauty in a word
the seeming truth which cunning times put on
to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold
hard food for midas i will none of thee
nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
'tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
which rather threatenst than dost promise aught
and here choose i joy be the consequence
portia aside how all the other passions fleet to air
as doubtful thoughts and rash embrac'd despair
and shudd'ring fear and green ey'd jealousy
o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy
in measure rain thy joy scant this excess
i feel too much thy blessing make it less
for fear i surfeit
bassanio opening the leaden casket what find i here
hath come so near creation move these eyes
or whether riding on the balls of mine
seem they in motion here are sever'd lips
parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs
the painter plays the spider and hath woven
a golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
how could he see to do them having made one
and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
in underprizing it so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance here's the scroll
the continent and summary of my fortune
'you that choose not by the view
chance as fair and choose as true
since this fortune falls to you
be content and seek no new
and hold your fortune for your bliss
turn to where your lady is
and claim her with a loving kiss'
a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave
i come by note to give and to receive
like one of two contending in a prize
that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes
hearing applause and universal shout
giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
so thrice fair lady stand i even so
as doubtful whether what i see be true
until confirm'd signd ratified by you
portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand
such as i am though for myself alone
i would not be ambitious in my wish
to wish myself much better yet for you
i would be trebled twenty times myself
a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
i might in virtues beauties livings friends
exceed account but the full sum of me
is sum of something which to term in gross
is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractis'd
happy in this she is not yet so old
but she may learn happier than this
she is not bred so dull but she can learn
happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed
myself and what is mine to you and yours
is now converted but now i was the lord
of this fair mansion master of my servants
queen o'er myself and even now but now
this house these servants and this same myself
are yours my lord's i give them with this ring
which when you part from lose or give away
let it presage the ruin of your love
and be my vantage to exclaim on you
only my blood speaks to you in my veins
and there is such confusion in my powers
as after some oration fairly spoke
by a beloved prince there doth appear
among the buzzing pleased multitude
where every something being blent together
turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
express'd and not express'd but when this ring
parts from this finger then parts life from hence
nerissa my lord and lady it is now our time
that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
to cry 'good joy' good joy my lord and lady
gratiano my lord bassanio and my gentle lady
i wish you all the joy that you can wish
for i am sure you can wish none from me
and when your honours mean to solemnize
the bargain of your faith i do beseech you
even at that time i may be married too
gratiano i thank your lordship you have got me one
my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
you lov'd i lov'd for intermission
no more pertains to me my lord than you
your fortune stood upon the caskets there
and so did mine too as the matter falls
for wooing here until i sweat again
and swearing till my very roof was dry
i got a promise of this fair one here
to have her love provided that your fortune
achiev'd her mistress
portia is this true nerissa
nerissa madam it is so you stand pleas'd withal
bassanio and do you gratiano mean good faith
gratiano yes faith my lord
bassanio our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage
gratiano we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand
nerissa what and stake down
gratiano no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel
what and my old venetian friend salerio
enter lorenzo jessica and salerio a messenger
from venice
bassanio lorenzo and salerio welcome hither
if that the youth of my new int'rest here
have power to bid you welcome by your leave
sweet portia welcome
portia so do i my lord
they are entirely welcome
lorenzo i thank your honour for my part my lord
my purpose was not to have seen you here
but meeting with salerio by the way
he did entreat me past all saying nay
to come with him along
salerio i did my lord
commends him to you gives bassanio a letter
bassanio ere i ope his letter
i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
salerio not sick my lord unless it be in mind
nor well unless in mind his letter there
will show you his estate bassanio opens the letter
gratiano nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome
your hand salerio what's the news from venice
how doth that royal merchant good antonio
we are the jasons we have won the fleece
salerio i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
portia there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
that steals the colour from bassanio's cheek
some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
could turn so much the constitution
of any constant man what worse and worse
with leave bassanio i am half yourself
and i must freely have the half of anything
bassanio o sweet portia
here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
that ever blotted paper gentle lady
when i did first impart my love to you
i freely told you all the wealth i had
ran in my veins i was a gentleman
and then i told you true and yet dear lady
rating myself at nothing you shall see
how much i was a braggart when i told you
that i was worse than nothing for indeed
i have engag'd myself to a dear friend
engag'd my friend to his mere enemy
to feed my means here is a letter lady
the paper as the body of my friend
and every word in it a gaping wound
issuing life blood but is it true salerio
hath all his ventures faild what not one hit
from tripolis from mexico and england
and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
of merchant marring rocks
salerio not one my lord
besides it should appear that if he had
the present money to discharge the jew
he would not take it never did i know
a creature that did bear the shape of man
so keen and greedy to confound a man
he plies the duke at morning and at night
if they deny him justice twenty merchants
the duke himself and the magnificoes
of greatest port have all persuaded with him
but none can drive him from the envious plea
of forfeiture of justice and his bond
jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear
to tubal and to chus his countrymen
that he would rather have antonio's flesh
than twenty times the value of the sum
if law authority and power deny not
it will go hard with poor antonio
portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man
the best conditiond and unwearied spirit
in doing courtesies and one in whom
the ancient roman honour more appears
than any that draws breath in italy
portia what sum owes he the jew
portia what no more
pay him six thousand and deface the bond
double six thousand and then treble that
before a friend of this description
shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault
first go with me to church and call me wife
and then away to venice to your friend
for never shall you lie by portia's side
with an unquiet soul you shall have gold
when it is paid bring your true friend along
my maid nerissa and myself meantime
will live as maids and widows come away
for you shall hence upon your wedding day
bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
since you are dear bought i will love you dear
but let me hear the letter of your friend
bassanio reads 'sweet bassanio my ships have all miscarried
my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the
should live all debts are clear'd between you and i if i might
but see you at my death notwithstanding use your pleasure if
your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter'
portia o love dispatch all business and be gone
bassanio since i have your good leave to go away
i will make haste but till i come again
no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay
nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain exeunt

enter shylock solanio antonio and gaoler
shylock gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
this is the fool that lent out money gratis
gaoler look to him
antonio hear me yet good shylock
shylock i'll have my bond speak not against my bond
i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
thou calldst me dog before thou hadst a cause
but since i am a dog beware my fangs
thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
to come abroad with him at his request
antonio i pray thee hear me speak
shylock i'll have my bond i will not hear thee speak
i'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
i'll not be made a soft and dull ey'd fool
to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
to christian intercessors follow not
i'll have no speaking i will have my bond exit
that ever kept with men
antonio let him alone
i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
he seeks my life his reason well i know
i oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
many that have at times made moan to me
therefore he hates me
solanio i am sure the duke
will never grant this forfeiture to hold
for the commodity that strangers have
with us in venice if it be denied
will much impeach the justice of the state
since that the trade and profit of the city
consisteth of all nations therefore go
these griefs and losses have so bated me
that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
to morrow to my bloody creditor
well gaoler on pray god bassanio come

belmont portia's house
enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and balthasar
lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence
you have a noble and a true conceit
of godlike amity which appears most strongly
in bearing thus the absence of your lord
but if you knew to whom you show this honour
how true a gentleman you send relief
i know you would be prouder of the work
than customary bounty can enforce you
portia i never did repent for doing good
nor shall not now for in companions
that do converse and waste the time together
whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
there must be needs a like proportion
of lineaments of manners and of spirit
which makes me think that this antonio
must needs be like my lord if it be so
how little is the cost i have bestowed
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out the state of hellish cruelty
this comes too near the praising of myself
therefore no more of it hear other things
lorenzo i commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house
until my lord's return for mine own part
to live in prayer and contemplation
only attended by nerissa here
until her husband and my lord's return
there is a monastery two miles off
and there we will abide i do desire you
not to deny this imposition
the which my love and some necessity
now lays upon you
lorenzo madam with all my heart
portia my people do already know my mind
and will acknowledge you and jessica
in place of lord bassanio and myself
so fare you well till we shall meet again
lorenzo fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
jessica i wish your ladyship all heart's content
portia i thank you for your wish and am well pleas'd
to wish it back on you fare you well jessica
exeunt jessica and lorenzo
as i have ever found thee honest true
so let me find thee still take this same letter
and use thou all th' endeavour of a man
in speed to padua see thou render this
into my cousins hands doctor bellario
and look what notes and garments he doth give thee
bring them i pray thee with imagind speed
unto the traject to the common ferry
which trades to venice waste no time in words
balthasar madam i go with all convenient speed exit
portia come on nerissa i have work in hand
that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands
before they think of us
nerissa shall they see us
portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit
that they shall think we are accomplished
with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager
when we are both accoutred like young men
and wear my dagger with the braver grace
and speak between the change of man and boy
with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
into a manly stride and speak of frays
like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
how honourable ladies sought my love
which i denying they fell sick and died
i could not do withal then i'll repent
and wish for all that that i had not killd them
that men shall swear i have discontinued school
about a twelvemonth i have within my mind
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks
which i will practise
nerissa why shall we turn to men
portia fie what a questions that
if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
but come i'll tell thee all my whole device
when i am in my coach which stays for us
for we must measure twenty miles to day exeunt

the matter therefore be o' good cheer for truly i think you are
damnd there is but one hope in it that can do you any good and
jessica and what hope is that i pray thee
launcelot marry you may partly hope that your father got you not
that you are not the jew's daughter
jessica that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my
mother should be visited upon me
launcelot truly then i fear you are damnd both by father and
mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into
charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways
jessica i shall be sav'd by my husband he hath made me a
launcelot truly the more to blame he we were christians enow
before e'en as many as could well live one by another this
making of christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all

coals for money
enter lorenzo
jessica i'll tell my husband launcelot what you say here he
empty
lorenzo i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if you
jessica nay you need nor fear us lorenzo launcelot and i are
out he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven
because i am a jew's daughter and he says you are no good member
of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you
raise the price of pork
lorenzo i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
can the getting up of the negro's belly the moor is with child
by you launcelot
launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason but
took her for
lorenzo how every fool can play upon the word i think the best
grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow
commendable in none only but parrots go in sirrah bid them
prepare for dinner
launcelot that is done sir they have all stomachs
lorenzo goodly lord what a wit snapper are you then bid them
prepare dinner
launcelot that is done too sir only 'cover' is the word
launcelot not so sir neither i know my duty
lorenzo yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show the
whole wealth of thy wit in an instant i pray thee understand a
plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover
the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner
launcelot for the table sir it shall be serv'd in for the meat
sir it shall be cover'd for your coming in to dinner sir why
let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
empty
the fool hath planted in his memory
an army of good words and i do know
a many fools that stand in better place
garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word
defy the matter how cheer'st thou jessica
and now good sweet say thy opinion
how dost thou like the lord bassanio's wife
jessica past all expressing it is very meet
the lord bassanio live an upright life
he finds the joys of heaven here on earth
and if on earth he do not merit it
in reason he should never come to heaven
why if two gods should play some heavenly match
and on the wager lay two earthly women
and portia one there must be something else
pawnd with the other for the poor rude world
hath not her fellow
lorenzo even such a husband
jessica nay but ask my opinion too of that
lorenzo i will anon first let us go to dinner
jessica nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
lorenzo no pray thee let it serve for table talk
then howsome'er thou speak'st 'mong other things
i shall digest it
jessica well i'll set you forth exeunt
act iv scene i
venice the court of justice
and others
duke of venice what is antonio here
antonio ready so please your grace
duke of venice i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity void and empty
from any dram of mercy
antonio i have heard
your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
and that no lawful means can carry me
out of his envy's reach i do oppose
my patience to his fury and am arm'd
to suffer with a quietness of spirit
the very tyranny and rage of his
duke of venice go one and call the jew into the court
salerio he is ready at the door he comes my lord
enter shylock
duke of venice make room and let him stand before our face
that thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice
to the last hour of act and then 'tis thought
thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
than is thy strange apparent cruelty
and where thou now exacts the penalty
which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
but touch'd with human gentleness and love
forgive a moiety of the principal
that have of late so huddled on his back
enow to press a royal merchant down
and pluck commiseration of his state
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
from stubborn turks and tartars never traind
to offices of tender courtesy
we all expect a gentle answer jew
shylock i have possess'd your grace of what i purpose
and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
if you deny it let the danger light
upon your charter and your city's freedom
you'll ask me why i rather choose to have
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
three thousand ducats i'll not answer that
but say it is my humour is it answer'd
what if my house be troubled with a rat
and i be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
to have it band what are you answer'd yet
some that are mad if they behold a cat
and others when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose
cannot contain their urine for affection
mistress of passion sways it to the mood
of what it likes or loathes now for your answer
as there is no firm reason to be rend'red
why he cannot abide a gaping pig
why he a harmless necessary cat
why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
as to offend himself being offended
so can i give no reason nor i will not
more than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing
i bear antonio that i follow thus
a losing suit against him are you answered
bassanio this is no answer thou unfeeling man
to excuse the current of thy cruelty
shylock i am not bound to please thee with my answers
bassanio do all men kill the things they do not love
bassanio every offence is not a hate at first
shylock what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
antonio i pray you think you question with the jew
you may as well go stand upon the beach
and bid the main flood bate his usual height
you may as well use question with the wolf
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
you may as well forbid the mountain pines
to wag their high tops and to make no noise
you may as well do anything most hard
as seek to soften that than which what's harder
his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you
make no moe offers use no farther means
but with all brief and plain conveniency
let me have judgment and the jew his will
bassanio for thy three thousand ducats here is six
shylock if every ducat in six thousand ducats
were in six parts and every part a ducat
duke of venice how shalt thou hope for mercy rend'ring none
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
you have among you many a purchas'd slave
which fike your asses and your dogs and mules
you use in abject and in slavish parts
because you bought them shall i say to you
'let them be free marry them to your heirs
why sweat they under burdens let their beds
be made as soft as yours and let their palates
'the slaves are ours' so do i answer you
the pound of flesh which i demand of him
is dearly bought 'tis mine and i will have it
if you deny me fie upon your law
there is no force in the decrees of venice
i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
duke of venice upon my power i may dismiss this court
unless bellario a learned doctor
whom i have sent for to determine this
salerio my lord here stays without
a messenger with letters from the doctor
new come from padua
duke of venice bring us the letters call the messenger
bassanio good cheer antonio what man courage yet
the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
antonio i am a tainted wether of the flock
meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
you cannot better be employ'd bassanio
than to live still and write mine epitaph
enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer's clerk
duke of venice came you from padua from bellario
nerissa from both my lord bellario greets your grace
presents a letter
bassanio why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
shylock to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
gratiano not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew
no not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness
of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee
shylock no none that thou hast wit enough to make
gratiano o be thou damnd inexecrable dog
and for thy life let justice be accus'd
thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith
to hold opinion with pythagoras
that souls of animals infuse themselves
into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam
infus'd itself in thee for thy desires
are wolfish bloody starv'd and ravenous
shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
to cureless ruin i stand here for law
duke of venice this letter from bellario doth commend
where is he
nerissa he attendeth here hard by
to know your answer whether you'll admit him
duke of venice with all my heart some three or four of you
go give him courteous conduct to this place
meantime the court shall hear bellario's letter
clerk reads 'your grace shall understand that at the receipt
of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your
messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor
in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we
turnd o'er many books together he is furnished with my opinion
which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i
cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill
up your grace's request in my stead i beseech you let his lack
of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation
for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him
to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
empty
duke of venice you hear the learnd bellario what he writes
and here i take it is the doctor come
give me your hand come you from old bellario
portia i did my lord
duke of venice you are welcome take your place
are you acquainted with the difference
that holds this present question in the court
portia i am informed throughly of the cause
which is the merchant here and which the jew
portia is your name shylock
shylock shylock is my name
portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow
yet in such rule that the venetian law
cannot impugn you as you do proceed
you stand within his danger do you not
antonio ay so he says
portia do you confess the bond
antonio i do
shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that
portia the quality of mercy is not straind
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath it is twice blest
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
'tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
but mercy is above this sceptred sway
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to god himself
and earthly power doth then show likest god's
when mercy seasons justice therefore jew
though justice be thy plea consider this
that in the course of justice none of us
should see salvation we do pray for mercy
and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
to mitigate the justice of thy plea
which if thou follow this strict court of venice
must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there
shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law
the penalty and forfeit of my bond
bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court
yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
that malice bears down truth and i beseech you
wrest once the law to your authority
to do a great right do a little wrong
and curb this cruel devil of his will
portia it must not be there is no power in venice
can alter a decree established
'twill be recorded for a precedent
and many an error by the same example
will rush into the state it cannot be
o wise young judge how i do honour thee
portia i pray you let me look upon the bond
shylock here 'tis most reverend doctor here it is
portia shylock there's thrice thy money off'red thee
shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven
shall i lay perjury upon my soul
no not for venice
portia why this bond is forfeit
and lawfully by this the jew may claim
nearest the merchant's heart be merciful
take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
shylock when it is paid according to the tenour
it doth appear you are a worthy judge
you know the law your exposition
hath been most sound i charge you by the law
whereof you are a well deserving pillar
proceed to judgment by my soul i swear
there is no power in the tongue of man
antonio most heartily i do beseech the court
to give the judgment
portia why then thus it is
you must prepare your bosom for his knife
shylock o noble judge o excellent young man
portia for the intent and purpose of the law
hath full relation to the penalty
which here appeareth due upon the bond
shylock 'tis very true o wise and upright judge
portia therefore lay bare your bosom
shylock ay his breast
so says the bond doth it not noble judge
'nearest his heart' those are the very words
portia it is so are there balance here to weigh
the flesh
shylock i have them ready
portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge
to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
portia it is not so express'd but what of that
'twere good you do so much for charity
shylock i cannot find it 'tis not in the bond
portia you merchant have you anything to say
antonio but little i am arm'd and well prepar'd
give me your hand bassanio fare you well
grieve not that i am falln to this for you
for herein fortune shows herself more kind
than is her custom it is still her use
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
an age of poverty from which ling'ring penance
of such misery doth she cut me off
commend me to your honourable wife
tell her the process of antonio's end
say how i lov'd you speak me fair in death
and when the tale is told bid her be judge
whether bassanio had not once a love
repent but you that you shall lose your friend
for if the jew do cut but deep enough
i'll pay it instantly with all my heart
bassanio antonio i am married to a wife
which is as dear to me as life itself
but life itself my wife and all the world
are not with me esteem'd above thy life
i would lose all ay sacrifice them all
here to this devil to deliver you
portia your wife would give you little thanks for that
gratiano i have a wife who i protest i love
i would she were in heaven so she could
entreat some power to change this currish jew
nerissa 'tis well you offer it behind her back
the wish would make else an unquiet house
shylock aside these be the christian husbands i have a
empty
would any of the stock of barrabas
had been her husband rather than a christian
portia a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
the court awards it and the law doth give it
shylock most rightful judge
portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
the law allows it and the court awards it
shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare
portia tarry a little there is something else
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
the words expressly are 'a pound of flesh'
but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods
are by the laws of venice confiscate
unto the state of venice
gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned judge
shylock is that the law
portia thyself shalt see the act
for as thou urgest justice be assur'd
thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st
shylock i take this offer then pay the bond thrice
and let the christian go
bassanio here is the money
portia soft
the jew shall have all justice soft no haste
he shall have nothing but the penalty
gratiano o jew an upright judge a learned judge
portia therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
or less than a just pound be it but so much
as makes it light or heavy in the substance
or the division of the twentieth part
of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair
thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
gratiano a second daniel a daniel jew
now infidel i have you on the hip
portia why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture
bassanio i have it ready for thee here it is
portia he hath refus'd it in the open court
he shall have merely justice and his bond
gratiano a daniel still say i a second daniel
i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shylock shall i not have barely my principal
portia thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
to be so taken at thy peril jew
shylock why then the devil give him good of it
portia tarry jew
the law hath yet another hold on you
it is enacted in the laws of venice
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts
he seek the life of any citizen
the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
shall seize one half his goods the other half
comes to the privy coffer of the state
of the duke only 'gainst all other voice
in which predicament i say thou stand'st
for it appears by manifest proceeding
that indirectly and directly too
thou hast contrived against the very life
of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd
the danger formerly by me rehears'd
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
gratiano beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
thou hast not left the value of a cord
therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
duke of venice that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit
i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
for half thy wealth it is antonio's
the other half comes to the general state
which humbleness may drive unto a fine
portia ay for the state not for antonio
shylock nay take my life and all pardon not that
that doth sustain my house you take my life
when you do take the means whereby i live
portia what mercy can you render him antonio
gratiano a halter gratis nothing else for god's sake
antonio so please my lord the duke and all the court
to quit the fine for one half of his goods
i am content so he will let me have
the other half in use to render it
upon his death unto the gentleman
two things provided more that for this favour
he presently become a christian
the other that he do record a gift
here in the court of all he dies possess'd
unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
duke of venice he shall do this or else i do recant
the pardon that i late pronounced here
portia art thou contented jew what dost thou say
shylock i am content
shylock i pray you give me leave to go from hence
i am not well send the deed after me
and i will sign it
duke of venice get thee gone but do it
gratiano in christ'ning shalt thou have two god fathers
had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
to bring thee to the gallows not to the font
exit shylock
duke of venice sir i entreat you home with me to dinner
i must away this night toward padua
and it is meet i presently set forth
duke of venice i am sorry that your leisure serves you not
antonio gratify this gentleman
for in my mind you are much bound to him
exeunt duke magnificoes and train
bassanio most worthy gentleman i and my friend
have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
we freely cope your courteous pains withal
antonio and stand indebted over and above
in love and service to you evermore
portia he is well paid that is well satisfied
and i delivering you am satisfied
and therein do account myself well paid
my mind was never yet more mercenary
i pray you know me when we meet again
i wish you well and so i take my leave
take some remembrance of us as a tribute
not as fee grant me two things i pray you
not to deny me and to pardon me
portia you press me far and therefore i will yield
to antonio give me your gloves i'll wear them for your sake
to bassanio and for your love i'll take this ring from you
do not draw back your hand i'll take no more
and you in love shall not deny me this
bassanio this ring good sir alas it is a trifle
portia i will have nothing else but only this
and now methinks i have a mind to it
bassanio there's more depends on this than on the value
the dearest ring in venice will i give you
and find it out by proclamation
only for this i pray you pardon me
portia i see sir you are liberal in offers
you taught me first to beg and now methinks
you teach me how a beggar should be answer'd
and when she put it on she made me vow
that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it
portia that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts
and if your wife be not a mad woman
and know how well i have deserv'd this ring
she would not hold out enemy for ever
for giving it to me well peace be with you
exeunt portia and nerissa
antonio my lord bassanio let him have the ring
be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment
bassanio go gratiano run and overtake him

act v scene i
belmont the garden before portia's house
enter lorenzo and jessica
lorenzo the moon shines bright in such a night as this
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents
where cressid lay that night
jessica in such a night
did thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew
and saw the lions shadow ere himself
and ran dismayed away
lorenzo in such a night
stood dido with a willow in her hand
to come again to carthage
jessica in such a night
medea gathered the enchanted herbs
that did renew old aeson
lorenzo in such a night
did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
and with an unthrift love did run from venice
as far as belmont
jessica in such a night
stealing her soul with many vows of faith
and ne'er a true one
lorenzo in such a night
did pretty jessica like a little shrew
slander her love and he forgave it her
jessica i would out night you did no body come
but hark i hear the footing of a man
enter stephano
lorenzo who comes so fast in silence of the night
lorenzo a friend what friend your name i pray you friend
stephano stephano is my name and i bring word
my mistress will before the break of day
be here at belmont she doth stray about
by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
for happy wedlock hours
lorenzo who comes with her
stephano none but a holy hermit and her maid
i pray you is my master yet returnd
but go we in i pray thee jessica
and ceremoniously let us prepare
some welcome for the mistress of the house
enter launcelot
launcelot sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
lorenzo who calls
launcelot sola did you see master lorenzo master lorenzo sola
empty
lorenzo leave holloaing man here
lorenzo here
launcelot tell him there's a post come from my master with his
horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning
empty
lorenzo sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming
and yet no matter why should we go in
my friend stephano signify i pray you
within the house your mistress is at hand
and bring your music forth into the air exit stephano
here will we sit and let the sounds of music
creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
become the touches of sweet harmony
sit jessica look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
but in his motion like an angel sings
still quiring to the young ey'd cherubins
such harmony is in immortal souls
doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
enter musicians
come ho and wake diana with a hymn
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear
and draw her home with music music
jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music
lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive
for do but note a wild and wanton herd
or race of youthful and unhandled colts
which is the hot condition of their blood
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
or any air of music touch their ears
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze
by the sweet power of music therefore the poet
did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods
since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
but music for the time doth change his nature
nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds
is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
the motions of his spirit are dullas night
and his affections dark as erebus
let no such man be trusted mark the music
enter portia and nerissa
portia that light we see is burning in my hall
how far that little candle throws his beams
so shines a good deed in a naughty world
portia so doth the greater glory dim the less
a substitute shines brightly as a king
until a king be by and then his state
empties itself as doth an inland brook
into the main of waters music hark
nerissa it is your music madam of the house
portia nothing is good i see without respect
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam
when neither is attended and i think
ne nightingale if she should sing by day
when every goose is cackling would be thought
no better a musician than the wren
how many things by season seasond are
to their right praise and true perfection
peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
and would not be awak'd music ceases
lorenzo that is the voice
portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
by the bad voice
lorenzo dear lady welcome home
portia we have been praying for our husbands' welfare
which speed we hope the better for our words
are they returnd
lorenzo madam they are not yet
but there is come a messenger before
to signify their coming
give order to my servants that they take
no note at all of our being absent hence
nor you lorenzo jessica nor you a tucket sounds
lorenzo your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet
we are no tell tales madam fear you not
portia this night methinks is but the daylight sick
it looks a little paler 'tis a day
such as the day is when the sun is hid
enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers
if you would walk in absence of the sun
portia let me give light but let me not be light
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
and never be bassanio so for me
but god sort all you are welcome home my lord
bassanio i thank you madam give welcome to my friend
this is the man this is antonio
to whom i am so infinitely bound
portia you should in all sense be much bound to him
antonio no more than i am well acquitted of
portia sir you are very welcome to our house
it must appear in other ways than words
therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
gratiano to nerissa by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong
in faith i gave it to the judge's clerk
would he were gelt that had it for my part
since you do take it love so much at heart
portia a quarrel ho already what's the matter
that she did give me whose posy was
for all the world like cutler's poetry
upon a knife 'love me and leave me not'
nerissa what talk you of the posy or the value
you swore to me when i did give it you
that you would wear it till your hour of death
and that it should lie with you in your grave
though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
you should have been respective and have kept it
the clerk will ne'er wear hair ons face that had it
gratiano he will an if he live to be a man
nerissa ay if a woman live to be a man
gratiano now by this hand i gave it to a youth
a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
no higher than thyself the judge's clerk
a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee
i could not for my heart deny it him
portia you were to blame i must be plain with you
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
i gave my love a ring and made him swear
never to part with it and here he stands
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
that the world masters now in faith gratiano
you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
an 'twere to me i should be mad at it
and swear i lost the ring defending it
gratiano my lord bassanio gave his ring away
unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
deserv'd it too and then the boy his clerk
that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine
and neither man nor master would take aught
but the two rings
portia what ring gave you my lord
not that i hope which you receiv'd of me
i would deny it but you see my finger
hath not the ring upon it it is gone
portia even so void is your false heart of truth
by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed
until i see the ring
nerissa nor i in yours
till i again see mine
bassanio sweet portia
if you did know to whom i gave the ring
and would conceive for what i gave the ring
and how unwillingly i left the ring
when nought would be accepted but the ring
you would abate the strength of your displeasure
portia if you had known the virtue of the ring
or half her worthiness that gave the ring
or your own honour to contain the ring
you would not then have parted with the ring
what man is there so much unreasonable
with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
to urge the thing held as a ceremony
nerissa teaches me what to believe
i'll die for't but some woman had the ring
bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul
no woman had it but a civil doctor
which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
and begg'd the ring the which i did deny him
and suffer'd him to go displeas'd away
of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady
i was enforc'd to send it after him
i was beset with shame and courtesy
my honour would not let ingratitude
so much besmear it pardon me good lady
for by these blessed candles of the night
had you been there i think you would have begg'd
the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
portia let not that doctor e'er come near my house
and that which you did swear to keep for me
i will become as liberal as you
i'll not deny him anything i have
no not my body nor my husband's bed
know him i shall i am well sure of it
lie not a night from home watch me like argus
if you do not if i be left alone
now by mine honour which is yet mine own
i'll have that doctor for mine bedfellow
how you do leave me to mine own protection
gratiano well do you so let not me take him then
for if i do i'll mar the young clerk's pen
antonio i am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels
portia sir grieve not you you are welcome not withstanding
bassanio portia forgive me this enforced wrong
and in the hearing of these many friends
i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
wherein i see myself
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
in each eye one swear by your double self
and there's an oath of credit
bassanio nay but hear me
pardon this fault and by my soul i swear
i never more will break an oath with thee
antonio i once did lend my body for his wealth
which but for him that had your husband's ring
had quite miscarried i dare be bound again
will never more break faith advisedly
portia then you shall be his surety give him this
and bid him keep it better than the other
antonio here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
bassanio by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
portia i had it of him pardon me bassanio
for by this ring the doctor lay with me
nerissa and pardon me my gentle gratiano
for that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk
gratiano why this is like the mending of highways
in summer where the ways are fair enough
what are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it
portia speak not so grossly you are all amaz'd
here is a letter read it at your leisure
it comes from padua from bellario
there you shall find that portia was the doctor
nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here
shall witness i set forth as soon as you
enter'd my house antonio you are welcome
and i have better news in store for you
than you expect unseal this letter soon
there you shall find three of your argosies
are richly come to harbour suddenly
you shall not know by what strange accident
i chanced on this letter
antonio i am dumb
bassanio were you the doctor and i knew you not
nerissa ay but the clerk that never means to do it
unless he live until he be a man
bassanio sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
when i am absent then lie with my wife
antonio sweet lady you have given me life and living
for here i read for certain that my ships
are safely come to road
portia how now lorenzo
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
there do i give to you and jessica
from the rich jew a special deed of gift
after his death of all he dies possess'd of
lorenzo fair ladies you drop manna in the way
of starved people
portia it is almost morning
and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
of these events at full let us go in
and charge us there upon inter'gatories
gratiano let it be so the first inter'gatory
that my nerissa shall be sworn on is
whether till the next night she had rather stay
or go to bed now being two hours to day
but were the day come i should wish it dark
till i were couching with the doctor's clerk
well while i live i'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe nerissa's ring exeunt

modesty and gave such orderly and well behaved reproof

more adhere and keep place together than the hundredth
psalm to the tune of 'greensleeves' what tempest i trow
threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly
ashore at windsor how shall i be revenged on him i
think the best way were to entertain him with hope till
did you ever hear the like
mrs page letter for letter but that the name of page and
ford differs to thy great comfort in this mystery of ill
opinions here's the twin brother of thy letter but let thine
inherit first for i protest mine never shall i warrant he

different names sure more and these are of the second
edition he will print them out of doubt for he cares not

horses to mine host of the garter

him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty o
that my husband saw this letter it would give eternal food
mrs page why look where he comes and my good man

foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound
of villainous smell that ever offended nostril
ford and how long lay you there
suffer'd to bring this woman to evil for your good being
thus cramm'd in the basket a couple of ford's knaves his
hinds were calld forth by their mistress to carry me in
the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on
their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the

basket i quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have
search'd it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold
held his hand well on went he for a search and away

an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell wether next to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the
circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and
then to be stopp'd in like a strong distillation with
stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that

a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and coold

but stay i smell a man of middle earth
transform me to a piece of cheese
puck vile worm thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth
fairy queen with trial fire touch me his finger end
if he be chaste the flame will back descend
and turn him to no pain but if he start
it is the flesh of a corrupted heart
puck a trial come
evans come will this wood take fire
they put the tapers to his fingers and he starts
fairy queen corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
about him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
and as you trip still pinch him to your time
the song
fie on sinful fantasy
fie on lust and luxury
lust is but a bloody fire
kindled with unchaste desire
fed in heart whose flames aspire
pinch him fairies mutually
pinch him for his villainy
pinch him and burn him and turn him about
till candles and star light and moonshine be out

empty
athens and a wood near it
act i scene i
athens the palace of theseus
enter theseus hippolyta philostrate and attendants
draws on apace four happy days bring in
another moon but o methinks how slow
this old moon wanes she lingers my desires
like to a step dame or a dowager
long withering out a young mans revenue
hippolyta four days will quickly steep themselves in night
four nights will quickly dream away the time
and then the moon like to a silver bow
new bent in heaven shall behold the night
theseus go philostrate
stir up the athenian youth to merriments
awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
turn melancholy forth to funerals
the pale companion is not for our pomp exit philostrate
hippolyta i woo'd thee with my sword
and won thy love doing thee injuries
but i will wed thee in another key
with pomp with triumph and with revelling
and demetrius
egeus happy be theseus our renowned duke
theseus thanks good egeus what's the news with thee
egeus full of vexation come i with complaint
against my child my daughter hermia
stand forth demetrius my noble lord
this man hath my consent to marry her
stand forth lysander and my gracious duke
this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child
and interchang'd love tokens with my child
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
with feigning voice verses of feigning love
and stoln the impression of her fantasy
with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
of strong prevailment in unhardened youth
with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
turnd her obedience which is due to me
be it so she will not here before your grace
consent to marry with demetrius
i beg the ancient privilege of athens
as she is mine i may dispose of her
which shall be either to this gentleman
or to her death according to our law
immediately provided in that case
theseus what say you hermia be advis'd fair maid
to you your father should be as a god
to whom you are but as a form in wax
by him imprinted and within his power
to leave the figure or disfigure it
demetrius is a worthy gentleman
hermia so is lysander
theseus in himself he is
but in this kind wanting your father's voice
the other must be held the worthier
hermia i would my father look'd but with my eyes
hermia i do entreat your grace to pardon me
i know not by what power i am made bold
nor how it may concern my modesty
in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
but i beseech your grace that i may know
the worst that may befall me in this case
if i refuse to wed demetrius
theseus either to die the death or to abjure
for ever the society of men
know of your youth examine well your blood
whether if you yield not to your father's choice
you can endure the livery of a nun
for aye to be shady cloister mew'd
to live a barren sister all your life
chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
thrice blessed they that master so their blood
to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
but earthlier happy is the rose distilld
grows lives and dies in single blessedness
hermia so will i grow so live so die my lord
ere i will yield my virgin patent up
unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
my soul consents not to give sovereignty
theseus take time to pause and by the next new moon
the sealing day betwixt my love and me
for everlasting bond of fellowship
upon that day either prepare to die
or else to wed demetrius as he would
or on diana's altar to protest
for aye austerity and single life
demetrius relent sweet hermia and lysander yield
thy crazed title to my certain right
lysander you have her father's love demetrius
let me have hermia's do you marry him
egeus scornful lysander true he hath my love
and what is mine my love shall render him
i do estate unto demetrius
lysander i am my lord as well deriv'd as he
as well possess'd my love is more than his
my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
if not with vantage as demetrius'
and which is more than all these boasts can be
i am belov'd of beauteous hermia
why should not i then prosecute my right
demetrius i'll avouch it to his head
and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
upon this spotted and inconstant man
theseus i must confess that i have heard so much
and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
but being over full of self affairs
my mind did lose it but demetrius come
and come egeus you shall go with me
i have some private schooling for you both
to fit your fancies to your father's will
or else the law of athens yields you up
which by no means we may extenuate
to death or to a vow of single life
come my hippolyta what cheer my love
demetrius and egeus go along
i must employ you in some business
against our nuptial and confer with you
of something nearly that concerns yourselves
exeunt all but lysander and hermia
lysander how now my love why is your cheek so pale
how chance the roses there do fade so fast
hermia belike for want of rain which i could well
beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read
could ever hear by tale or history
the course of true love never did run smooth
but either it was different in blood
lysander or else misgraffed in respect of years
hermia o spite too old to be engag'd to young
lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends
hermia o hell to choose love by another's eyes
lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice
war death or sickness did lay siege to it
making it momentary as a sound
swift as a shadow short as any dream
brief as the lightning in the collied night
and ere a man hath power to say 'behold'
the jaws of darkness do devour it up
so quick bright things come to confusion
hermia if then true lovers have ever cross'd
it stands as an edict in destiny
then let us teach our trial patience
because it is a customary cross
as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
wishes and tears poor fancy's followers
i have a widow aunt a dowager
of great revenue and she hath no child
from athens is her house remote seven leagues
and she respects me as her only son
there gentle hermia may i marry thee
and to that place the sharp athenian law
cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then
steal forth thy father's house to morrow night
and in the wood a league without the town
to do observance to a morn of may
there will i stay for thee
hermia my good lysander
i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow
by his best arrow with the golden head
by the simplicity of venus' doves
by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen
when the false troyan under sail was seen
in number more than ever women spoke
in that same place thou hast appointed me
to morrow truly will i meet with thee
lysander keep promise love look here comes helena
enter helena
hermia god speed fair helena whither away
helena call you me fair that fair again unsay
demetrius loves your fair o happy fair
your eyes are lode stars and your tongue's sweet air
when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
sickness is catching o were favour so
yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody
were the world mine demetrius being bated
the rest i'd give to be to you translated
o teach me how you look and with what art
you sway the motion of demetrius' heart
helena o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
hermia i give him curses yet he gives me love
helena o that my prayers could such affection move
hermia the more i hate the more he follows me
helena the more i love the more he hateth me
hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine
helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine
hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face
lysander and myself will fly this place
seem'd athens as a paradise to me
o then what graces in my love do dwell
that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell
lysander helen to you our minds we will unfold
to morrow night when phoebe doth behold
her silver visage in the wat'ry glass
decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal
through athens' gates have we devis'd to steal
upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie
emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
there my lysander and myself shall meet
and thence from athens turn away our eyes
to seek new friends and stranger companies
farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
keep word lysander we must starve our sight
from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight
as you on him demetrius dote on you exit
helena how happy some o'er other some can be
through athens i am thought as fair as she
but what of that demetrius thinks not so
he will not know what all but he do know
and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes
so i admiring of his qualities
things base and vile holding no quantity
love can transpose to form and dignity
and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind
nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste
wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
and therefore is love said to be a child
because in choice he is so oft beguild
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
so the boy love is perjur'd everywhere
for ere demetrius look'd on hermia's eyne
he haild down oaths that he was only mine
so he dissolv'd and show'rs of oaths did melt
i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight
then to the wood will he to morrow night
pursue her and for this intelligence
if i have thanks it is a dear expense
but herein mean i to enrich my pain
to have his sight thither and back again exit
scene ii
athens quince's house
quince is all our company here
bottom you were best to call them generally man by man according
to the scrip

will condole in some measure to the rest yet my chief humour is
for a tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat
in to make all split
'the raging rocks
and shivering shocks
shall break the locks
of prison gates
and phibbus' car
shall shine from far
the foolish fates'
this was lofty now name the rest of the players this is

of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us

play wants i pray you fail me not
bottom we will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and
courageously take pains be perfect adieu
quince at the duke's oak we meet
act ii scene i
a wood near athens
enter a fairy at one door and puck at another
puck how now spirit whither wander you
fairy over hill over dale
thorough bush thorough brier
over park over pale
thorough flood thorough fire
i do wander every where
and i serve the fairy queen
to dew her orbs upon the green
the cowslips tall her pensioners be
in their gold coats spots you see
those be rubies fairy favours
in those freckles live their savours
i must go seek some dewdrops here
and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
farewell thou lob of spirits i'll be gone
puck the king doth keep his revels here to night
take heed the queen come not within his sight
for oberon is passing fell and wrath
because that she as her attendant hath
a lovely boy stolen from an indian king
she never had so sweet a changeling
and jealous oberon would have the child
knight of his train to trace the forests wild
but she perforce withholds the loved boy
and now they never meet in grove or green
by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
but they do square that all their elves for fear
creep into acorn cups and hide them there
fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite
or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
calld robin goodfellow are not you he
that frights the maidens of the villagery
skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm
those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck
you do their work and they shall have good luck
are not you he
puck thou speakest aright
i am that merry wanderer of the night
i jest to oberon and make him smile
when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile
and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl
in very likeness of a roasted crab
and when she drinks against her lips i bob
and on her withered dewlap pour the ale
the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me
then slip i from her bum down topples she
and 'tailor' cries and falls into a cough
and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
a merrier hour was never wasted there
but room fairy here comes oberon
fairy and here my mistress would that he were gone
enter oberon at one door with his train and titania
at another with hers
oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania
titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
i have forsworn his bed and company
oberon tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
and in the shape of corin sat all day
playing on pipes of corn and versing love
to amorous phillida why art thou here
come from the farthest steep of india
but that forsooth the bouncing amazon
your buskind mistress and your warrior love
to theseus must be wedded and you come
to give their bed joy and prosperity
glance at my credit with hippolyta
knowing i know thy love to theseus
didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
from perigouna whom he ravished
and make him with fair aegles break his faith
with ariadne and antiopa
titania these are the forgeries of jealousy
and never since the middle summer's spring
met we on hill in dale forest or mead
or in the beached margent of the sea
to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
therefore the winds piping to us in vain
as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea
contagious fogs which falling in the land
hath every pelting river made so proud
that they have overborne their continents
the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard
the fold stands empty in the drowned field
and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
the nine mens morris is filld up with mud
and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
for lack of tread are undistinguishable
the human mortals want their winter here
no night is now with hymn or carol blest
therefore the moon the governess of floods
that rheumatic diseases do abound
and thorough this distemperature we see
the seasons alter hoary headed frosts
fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
and on old hiems' thin and icy crown
an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
is as in mockery set the spring the summer
the childing autumn angry winter change
their wonted liveries and the mazed world
and this same progeny of evils comes
from our debate from our dissension
we are their parents and original
oberon do you amend it then it lies in you
why should titania cross her oberon
i do but beg a little changeling boy
to be my henchman
titania set your heart at rest
the fairy land buys not the child of me
and in the spiced indian air by night
full often hath she gossip'd by my side
and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands
marking th' embarked traders on the flood
when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
and grow big bellied with the wanton wind
which she with pretty and with swimming gait
following her womb then rich with my young squire
would imitate and sail upon the land
as from a voyage rich with merchandise
but she being mortal of that boy did die
and for her sake do i rear up her boy
and for her sake i will not part with him
oberon how long within this wood intend you stay
titania perchance till after theseus' wedding day
if you will patiently dance in our round
and see our moonlight revels go with us
if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
titania not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away
we shall chide downright if i longer stay
exit titania with her train
oberon well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
till i torment thee for this injury
my gentle puck come hither thou rememb'rest
since once i sat upon a promontory
and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back
uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
to hear the sea maid's music
puck i remember
oberon that very time i saw but thou couldst not
flying between the cold moon and the earth
cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took
at a fair vestal throned by the west
and loos'd his love shaft smartly from his bow
as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon
and the imperial vot'ress passed on
in maiden meditation fancy free
yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell
it fell upon a little western flower
before milk white now purple with love's wound
and maidens call it love in idleness
fetch me that flow'r the herb i showed thee once
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
upon the next live creature that it sees
fetch me this herb and be thou here again
ere the leviathan can swim a league
puck i'll put a girdle round about the earth
in forty minutes exit puck
oberon having once this juice
i'll watch titania when she is asleep
and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
the next thing then she waking looks upon
on meddling monkey or on busy ape
she shall pursue it with the soul of love
and ere i take this charm from off her sight
as i can take it with another herb
i'll make her render up her page to me
but who comes here i am invisible
and i will overhear their conference
enter demetrius helena following him
demetrius i love thee not therefore pursue me not
the one i'll slay the other slayeth me
thou told'st me they were stoln unto this wood
and here am i and wood within this wood
because i cannot meet my hermia
hence get thee gone and follow me no more
helena you draw me you hard hearted adamant
but yet you draw not iron for my heart
is true as steel leave you your power to draw
and i shall have no power to follow you
or rather do i not in plainest truth
tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
helena and even for that do i love you the more
i am your spaniel and demetrius
the more you beat me i will fawn on you
use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
neglect me lose me only give me leave
unworthy as i am to follow you
what worser place can i beg in your love
than to be used as you use your dog
demetrius tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
for i am sick when i do look on thee
helena and i am sick when i look not on you
demetrius you do impeach your modesty too much
to leave the city and commit yourself
into the hands of one that loves you not
to trust the opportunity of night
and the ill counsel of a desert place
helena your virtue is my privilege for that
it is not night when i do see your face
therefore i think i am not in the night
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
for you in my respect are all the world
then how can it be said i am alone
when all the world is here to look on me
demetrius i'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
run when you will the story shall be chang'd
apollo flies and daphne holds the chase
the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
when cowardice pursues and valour flies
demetrius i will not stay thy questions let me go
or if thou follow me do not believe
but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
helena ay in the temple in the town the field
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
we cannot fight for love as men may do
we should be woo'd and were not made to woo
exit demetrius
i'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
to die upon the hand i love so well exit helena
oberon fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
re enter puck
puck ay there it is
oberon i pray thee give it me
i know a bank where the wild thyme blows
where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
quite over canopied with luscious woodbine
with sweet musk roses and with eglantine
there sleeps titania sometime of the night
lulld in these flowers with dances and delight
and there the snake throws her enamelld skin
and with the juice of this i'll streak her eyes
and make her full of hateful fantasies
take thou some of it and seek through this grove
a sweet athenian lady is in love
with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
but do it when the next thing he espies
may be the lady thou shalt know the man
by the athenian garments he hath on
effect it with some care that he may prove
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
puck fear not my lord your servant shall do so exeunt
scene ii
another part of the wood
enter titania with her train
titania come now a roundel and a fairy song
then for the third part of a minute hence
some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds
some war with rere mice for their leathern wings
the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep
then to your offices and let me rest
the fairies sing
first fairy you spotted snakes with double tongue
thorny hedgehogs be not seen
newts and blind worms do no wrong
come not near our fairy queen
chorus philomel with melody
lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
never harm
nor spell nor charm
come our lovely lady nigh
so good night with lullaby
second fairy weaving spiders come not here
hence you long legg'd spinners hence
beetles black approach not near
worm nor snail do no offence
first fairy hence away now all is well
one aloof stand sentinel exeunt fairies
enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania's eyelids
oberon what thou seest when thou dost wake
do it for thy true love take
love and languish for his sake
be it ounce or cat or bear
pard or boar with bristled hair
in thy eye that shall appear
wake when some vile thing is near exit
enter lysander and hermia
lysander fair love you faint with wand'ring in the wood
and to speak troth i have forgot our way
we'll rest us hermia if you think it good
and tarry for the comfort of the day
hermia be it so lysander find you out a bed
for i upon this bank will rest my head
lysander one turf shall serve as pillow for us both
hermia nay good lysander for my sake my dear
lie further off yet do not lie so near
lysander o take the sense sweet of my innocence
love takes the meaning in love's conference
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit
so that but one heart we can make of it
two bosoms interchained with an oath
so then two bosoms and a single troth
then by your side no bed room me deny
hermia lysander riddles very prettily
now much beshrew my manners and my pride
if hermia meant to say lysander lied
but gentle friend for love and courtesy
lie further off in human modesty
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
so far be distant and good night sweet friend
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
and then end life when i end loyalty
here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
hermia with half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd
they sleep
enter puck
puck through the forest have i gone
but athenian found i none
on whose eyes i might approve
this flower's force in stirring love
weeds of athens he doth wear
this is he my master said
despised the athenian maid
and here the maiden sleeping sound
on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul she durst not lie
near this lack love this kill courtesy
churl upon thy eyes i throw
all the power this charm doth owe
sleep his seat on thy eyelid
so awake when i am gone
for i must now to oberon exit
enter demetrius and helena running
helena stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
demetrius i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
helena o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
demetrius stay on thy peril i alone will go exit
helena o i am out of breath in this fond chase
happy is hermia wheresoe'er she lies
for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears
if so my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers
no no i am as ugly as a bear
for beasts that meet me run away for fear
therefore no marvel though demetrius
do as a monster fly my presence thus
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
but who is here lysander on the ground
dead or asleep i see no blood no wound
lysander if you live good sir awake
lysander waking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake
transparent helena nature shows art
that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
where is demetrius o how fit a word
is that vile name to perish on my sword
helena do not say so lysander say not so
yet hermia still loves you then be content
lysander content with hermia no i do repent
the tedious minutes i with her have spent
not hermia but helena i love
who will not change a raven for a dove
the will of man is by his reason sway'd
and reason says you are the worthier maid
things growing are not ripe until their season
so i being young till now ripe not to reason
reason becomes the marshal to my will
and leads me to your eyes where i o'erlook
love's stories written in love's richest book
helena wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
is't not enough is't not enough young man
that i did never no nor never can
deserve a sweet look from demetrius' eye
but you must flout my insufficiency
in such disdainful manner me to woo
but fare you well perforce i must confess
i thought you lord of more true gentleness
o that a lady of one man refus'd
should of another therefore be abus'd exit
lysander she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there
and never mayst thou come lysander near
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
the deepest loathing to the stomach brings
are hated most of those they did deceive
so thou my surfeit and my heresy
of all be hated but the most of me
and all my powers address your love and might
to honour helen and to be her knight exit
hermia starting help me lysander help me do thy best
to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
ay me for pity what a dream was here
lysander look how i do quake with fear
and you sat smiling at his cruel prey
lysander what remov'd lysander lord
what out of hearing gone no sound no word
alack where are you speak an if you hear
speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear
no then i well perceive you are not nigh
either death or you i'll find immediately exit

prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
with our swords and that pyramus is not killd indeed and for
the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not
pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear
quince well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written
bottom no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
snout will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
starveling i fear it i promise you
bottom masters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in
god shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for
there is not a more fearful wild fowl than your lion living and
we ought to look to't
snout therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
bottom nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen
saying thus or to the same defect 'ladies' or 'fair ladies i
would wish you' or 'i would request you' or 'i would entreat you
not to fear not to tremble my life for yours if you think i
come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no i am no such
thing i am a man as other men are' and there indeed let him
name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner
quince well it shall be so but there is two hard things that
is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus

moonshine find out moonshine
quince yes it doth shine that night
bottom why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the
empty
quince ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person
of moonshine then there is another thing we must have a wall in
talk through the chink of a wall
snout you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom
bottom some man or other must present wall and let him have some
plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify
wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny
shall pyramus and thisby whisper

the ousel cock so black of hue
with orange tawny bill
the throstle with his note so true
the wren with little quill
titania what angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed
bottom sings
the finch the sparrow and the lark
the plain song cuckoo grey
whose note full many a man doth mark
for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
who would give a bird the he though he cry 'cuckoo' never so
titania i pray thee gentle mortal sing again
mine ear is much enamoured of thy note
so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
on the first view to say to swear i love thee
bottom methinks mistress you should have little reason for that
and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company
neighbours will not make them friends nay i can gleek upon
empty
titania thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
bottom not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this
wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
titania out of this wood do not desire to go
thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
i am a spirit of no common rate
the summer still doth tend upon my state
i'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
and i will purge thy mortal grossness so
that thou shalt like an airy spirit go
peaseblossom cobweb moth and mustardseed
enter peaseblossom cobweb moth and mustardseed
peaseblossom ready
cobweb and i
mustardseed and i
all where shall we go
titania be kind and courteous to this gentleman
hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
feed him with apricocks and dewberries
with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
the honey bags steal from the humble bees
and for night tapers crop their waxen thighs
and light them at the fiery glow worm's eyes
and pluck the wings from painted butterflies
to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
nod to him elves and do him courtesies
peaseblossom hail mortal
cobweb hail

mustardseed hail
bottom i cry your worships mercy heartily i beseech your
worship's name

empty
titania come wait upon him lead him to my bower
the moon methinks looks with a wat'ry eye
and when she weeps weeps every little flower
lamenting some enforced chastity
tie up my love's tongue bring him silently exeunt
another part of the wood
enter oberon
oberon i wonder if titania be awak'd
then what it was that next came in her eye
which she must dote on in extremity
enter puck
here comes my messenger how now mad spirit
what night rule now about this haunted grove
puck my mistress with a monster is in love
while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
a crew of patches rude mechanicals
that work for bread upon athenian stalls
were met together to rehearse a play
intended for great theseus' nuptial day
the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
who pyramus presented in their sport
forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake
when i did him at this advantage take
anon his thisby must be answered
and forth my mimic comes when they him spy
as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
or russet pated choughs many in sort
rising and cawing at the guns report
sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
so at his sight away his fellows fly
and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
he murder cries and help from athens calls
made senseless things begin to do them wrong
for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
i led them on in this distracted fear
and left sweet pyramus translated there
when in that moment so it came to pass
titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an ass
oberon this falls out better than i could devise
but hast thou yet latch'd the athenians eyes
puck i took him sleeping that is finish'd too
and the athenian woman by his side
that when he wak'd of force she must be ey'd
enter demetrius and hermia
oberon stand close this is the same athenian
puck this is the woman but not this the man
demetrius o why rebuke you him that loves you so
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
hermia now i but chide but i should use thee worse
if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep
being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
and kill me too
the sun was not so true unto the day
as he to me would he have stolen away
from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon
this whole earth may be bor'd and that the moon
may through the centre creep and so displease
her brother's noontide with th' antipodes
so should a murderer look so dead so grim
demetrius so should the murdered look and so should i
pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty
yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
hermia what's this to my lysander where is he
ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
demetrius i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
hermia out dog out cur thou driv'st me past the bounds
henceforth be never numb'red among men
o once tell true tell true even for my sake
durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
and hast thou killd him sleeping o brave touch
could not a worm an adder do so much
an adder did it for with doubler tongue
than thine thou serpent never adder stung
demetrius you spend your passion on a mispris'd mood
i am not guilty of lysander's blood
hermia i pray thee tell me then that he is well
demetrius an if i could what should i get therefore
hermia a privilege never to see me more
and from thy hated presence part i so
see me no more whether he be dead or no exit
demetrius there is no following her in this fierce vein
here therefore for a while i will remain
so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
if for his tender here i make some stay lies down
oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
and laid the love juice on some true love's sight
of thy misprision must perforce ensue
some true love turnd and not a false turnd true
puck then fate o'er rules that one man holding troth
a million fail confounding oath on oath
oberon about the wood go swifter than the wind
and helena of athens look thou find
with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
by some illusion see thou bring her here
i'll charm his eyes against she do appear
puck i go i go look how i go
swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow exit
oberon flower of this purple dye
hit with cupid's archery
sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy
as the venus of the sky
when thou wak'st if she be by
beg of her for remedy
re enter puck
puck captain of our fairy band
helena is here at hand
and the youth mistook by me
pleading for a lover's fee
shall we their fond pageant see
oberon stand aside the noise they make
will cause demetrius to awake
puck then will two at once woo one
that must needs be sport alone
and those things do best please me
that befall prepost'rously
enter lysander and helena
lysander why should you think that i should woo in scorn
scorn and derision never come in tears
in their nativity all truth appears
how can these things in me seem scorn to you
bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
helena you do advance your cunning more and more
when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray
these vows are hermia's will you give her o'er
weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
your vows to her and me put in two scales
will even weigh and both as light as tales
helena nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
lysander demetrius loves her and he loves not you
demetrius awaking o helen goddess nymph perfect divine
to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
crystal is muddy o how ripe in show
thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
that pure congealed white high taurus' snow
fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
when thou hold'st up thy hand o let me kiss
helena o spite o hell i see you all are bent
to set against me for your merriment
if you were civil and knew courtesy
you would not do me thus much injury
can you not hate me as i know you do
but you must join in souls to mock me too
if you were men as men you are in show
you would not use a gentle lady so
to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
you both are rivals and love hermia
and now both rivals to mock helena
a trim exploit a manly enterprise
to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
with your derision none of noble sort
would so offend a virgin and extort
a poor souls patience all to make you sport
lysander you are unkind demetrius be not so
for you love hermia this you know i know
in hermia's love i yield you up my part
and yours of helena to me bequeath
whom i do love and will do till my death
helena never did mockers waste more idle breath
demetrius lysander keep thy hermia i will none
if e'er i lov'd her all that love is gone
my heart to her but as guest wise sojournd
and now to helen is it home returnd
there to remain
demetrius disparage not the faith thou dost not know
lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
enter hermia
hermia dark night that from the eye his function takes
the ear more quick of apprehension makes
wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
it pays the hearing double recompense
thou art not by mine eye lysander found
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
lysander why should he stay whom love doth press to go
hermia what love could press lysander from my side
lysander lysander's love that would not let him bide
fair helena who more engilds the night
than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so
hermia you speak not as you think it cannot be
now i perceive they have conjoind all three
to fashion this false sport in spite of me
injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
have you conspir'd have you with these contriv'd
to bait me with this foul derision
is all the counsel that we two have shar'd
the sisters' vows the hours that we have spent
when we have chid the hasty footed time
for parting us o is all forgot
we hermia like two artificial gods
have with our needles created both one flower
both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
both warbling of one song both in one key
as if our hands our sides voices and minds
had been incorporate so we grew together
like to a double cherry seeming parted
but yet an union in partition
two lovely berries moulded on one stern
two of the first like coats in heraldry
due but to one and crowned with one crest
and will you rent our ancient love asunder
to join with men in scorning your poor friend
it is not friendly 'tis not maidenly
our sex as well as i may chide you for it
though i alone do feel the injury
hermia i am amazed at your passionate words
i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
to follow me and praise my eyes and face
and made your other love demetrius
who even but now did spurn me with his foot
to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander
deny your love so rich within his soul
and tender me forsooth affection
but by your setting on by your consent
so hung upon with love so fortunate
but miserable most to love unlov'd
this you should pity rather than despise
hermia i understand not what you mean by this
helena ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
make mouths upon me when i turn my back
wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
this sport well carried shall be chronicled
if you have any pity grace or manners
but fare ye well 'tis partly my own fault
which death or absence soon shall remedy
lysander stay gentle helena hear my excuse
my love my life my soul fair helena
helena o excellent
hermia sweet do not scorn her so
demetrius if she cannot entreat i can compel
lysander thou canst compel no more than she entreat
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
i swear by that which i will lose for thee
to prove him false that says i love thee not
demetrius i say i love thee more than he can do
lysander if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
demetrius quick come
hermia lysander whereto tends all this
lysander away you ethiope
demetrius no no he will
seem to break loose take on as you would follow
lysander hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
hermia why are you grown so rude what change is this
sweet love
lysander thy love out tawny tartar out
out loathed med'cine o hated potion hence
hermia do you not jest
helena yes sooth and so do you
lysander demetrius i will keep my word with thee
a weak bond holds you i'll not trust your word
lysander what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
although i hate her i'll not harm her so
hermia what can you do me greater harm than hate
hate me wherefore o me what news my love
am not i hermia are not you lysander
i am as fair now as i was erewhile
since night you lov'd me yet since night you left me
why then you left me o the gods forbid
lysander ay by my life
and never did desire to see thee more
therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
be certain nothing truer 'tis no jest
that i do hate thee and love helena
hermia o me you juggler you cankerblossom
you thief of love what have you come by night
and stoln my love's heart from him
helena fine i' faith
no touch of bashfulness what will you tear
impatient answers from my gentle tongue
fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
hermia 'puppet' why so ay that way goes the game
now i perceive that she hath made compare
between our statures she hath urg'd her height
and with her personage her tall personage
her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him
and are you grown so high in his esteem
how low am i thou painted maypole speak
how low am i i am not yet so low
but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
helena i pray you though you mock me gentlemen
let her not hurt me i was never curst
i have no gift at all in shrewishness
i am a right maid for my cowardice
let her not strike me you perhaps may think
because she is something lower than myself
hermia 'lower' hark again
helena good hermia do not be so bitter with me
i evermore did love you hermia
did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you
save that in love unto demetrius
i told him of your stealth unto this wood
he followed you for love i followed him
but he hath chid me hence and threat'ned me
to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
to athens will i bear my folly back
and follow you no further let me go
you see how simple and how fond i am
hermia why get you gone who is't that hinders you
helena a foolish heart that i leave here behind
hermia what with lysander
helena with demetrius
lysander be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
demetrius no sir she shall not though you take her part
she was a vixen when she went to school
and though she be but little she is fierce
hermia 'little' again nothing but 'low' and 'little'
why will you suffer her to flout me thus
let me come to her
lysander get you gone you dwarf
you minimus of hind'ring knot grass made
you bead you acorn
demetrius you are too officious
let her alone speak not of helena
take not her part for if thou dost intend
never so little show of love to her
thou shalt aby it
lysander now she holds me not
now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right
of thine or mine is most in helena
demetrius follow nay i'll go with thee cheek by jowl
exeunt lysander and demetrius
nay go not back
helena i will not trust you i
nor longer stay in your curst company
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
my legs are longer though to run away exit
hermia i am amaz'd and know not what to say exit
oberon this is thy negligence still thou mistak'st
or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
puck believe me king of shadows i mistook
by the athenian garments he had on
and so far blameless proves my enterprise
that i have 'nointed an athenians eyes
and so far am i glad it so did sort
as this their jangling i esteem a sport
oberon thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
hie therefore robin overcast the night
the starry welkin cover thou anon
with drooping fog as black as acheron
as one come not within another's way
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue
then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong
and sometime rail thou like demetrius
and from each other look thou lead them thus
till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep
with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
then crush this herb into lysander's eye
whose liquor hath this virtuous property
and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
when they next wake all this derision
shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
and back to athens shall the lovers wend
with league whose date till death shall never end
whiles i in this affair do thee employ
i'll to my queen and beg her indian boy
and then i will her charmed eye release
from monster's view and all things shall be peace
for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
and yonder shines aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wand'ring here and there
troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
that in cross ways and floods have burial
already to their wormy beds are gone
for fear lest day should look their shames upon
they wilfully themselves exild from light
and must for aye consort with black brow'd night
i with the morning's love have oft made sport
and like a forester the groves may tread
even till the eastern gate all fiery red
opening on neptune with fair blessed beams
turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
but notwithstanding haste make no delay
we may effect this business yet ere day exit oberon
puck up and down up and down
i will lead them up and down
goblin lead them up and down
here comes one
enter lysander
lysander where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now
puck here villain drawn and ready where art thou
lysander i will be with thee straight
puck follow me then
to plainer ground exit lysander as following the voice
enter demetrius
thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
speak in some bush where dost thou hide thy head
puck thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
and wilt not come come recreant come thou child
i'll whip thee with a rod he is defild
that draws a sword on thee
demetrius yea art thou there
puck follow my voice we'll try no manhood here exeunt
lysander he goes before me and still dares me on
when i come where he calls then he is gone
the villain is much lighter heeld than i
i followed fast but faster he did fly
that fallen am i in dark uneven way
and here will rest me lies down come thou gentle day
for if but once thou show me thy grey light

fairies be gone and be all ways away exeunt fairies
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
gently entwist the female ivy so
enrings the barky fingers of the elm
o how i love thee how i dote on thee they sleep
enter puck
oberon advancing welcome good robin seest thou this sweet
empty
for meeting her of late behind the wood
seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool
i did upbraid her and fall out with her
for she his hairy temples then had rounded
with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
and that same dew which sometime on the buds
was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
and she in mild terms begg'd my patience
i then did ask of her her changeling child
which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
to bear him to my bower in fairy land
and now i have the boy i will undo
this hateful imperfection of her eyes
and gentle puck take this transformed scalp
from off the head of this athenian swain
that he awaking when the other do
and think no more of this night's accidents
but as the fierce vexation of a dream
but first i will release the fairy queen
touching her eyes
be as thou wast wont to be
see as thou was wont to see
dians bud o'er cupid's flower
hath such force and blessed power
now my titania wake you my sweet queen
methought i was enamour'd of an ass
oberon there lies your love
titania how came these things to pass
o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
oberon silence awhile robin take off this head
titania music call and strike more dead
than common sleep of all these five the sense
titania music ho music such as charmeth sleep
puck now when thou wak'st with thine own fools eyes peep
empty
and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
now thou and i are new in amity
and will to morrow midnight solemnly
dance in duke theseus' house triumphantly
and bless it to all fair prosperity
there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
wedded with theseus an in jollity
puck fairy king attend and mark
oberon then my queen in silence sad
trip we after night's shade
we the globe can compass soon
swifter than the wand'ring moon
titania come my lord and in our flight
tell me how it came this night
that i sleeping here was found
with these mortals on the ground exeunt
to the winding of horns enter theseus hippolyta
theseus go one of you find out the forester
for now our observation is perform'd
and since we have the vaward of the day
my love shall hear the music of my hounds
uncouple in the western valley let them go
dispatch i say and find the forester exit an attendant
we will fair queen up to the mountains top
and mark the musical confusion
of hounds and echo in conjunction
when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear
with hounds of sparta never did i hear
such gallant chiding for besides the groves
the skies the fountains every region near
seem'd all one mutual cry i never heard
so musical a discord such sweet thunder
theseus my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind
so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung
with ears that sweep away the morning dew
slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells
each under each a cry more tuneable
was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn
in crete in sparta nor in thessaly
judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these
egeus my lord this is my daughter here asleep
and this lysander this demetrius is
this helena old nedar's helena
i wonder of their being here together
the rite of may and hearing our intent
came here in grace of our solemnity
but speak egeus is not this the day
that hermia should give answer of her choice
egeus it is my lord
theseus go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
horns and shout within the sleepers
awake and kneel to theseus
good morrow friends saint valentine is past
lysander pardon my lord
theseus i pray you all stand up
i know you two are rival enemies
how comes this gentle concord in the world
that hatred is so far from jealousy
to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
lysander my lord i shall reply amazedly
half sleep half waking but as yet i swear
i cannot truly say how i came here
and now i do bethink me so it is
i came with hermia hither our intent
was to be gone from athens where we might
without the peril of the athenian law
egeus enough enough my lord you have enough
i beg the law the law upon his head
they would have stoln away they would demetrius
thereby to have defeated you and me
you of your wife and me of my consent
demetrius my lord fair helen told me of their stealth
of this their purpose hither to this wood
and i in fury hither followed them
fair helena in fancy following me
but my good lord i wot not by what power
but by some power it is my love to hermia
melted as the snow seems to me now
as the remembrance of an idle gaud
which in my childhood i did dote upon
the object and the pleasure of mine eye
is only helena to her my lord
was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia
but like a sickness did i loathe this food
but as in health come to my natural taste
now i do wish it love it long for it
and will for evermore be true to it
theseus fair lovers you are fortunately met
of this discourse we more will hear anon
for in the temple by and by with us
these couples shall eternally be knit
and for the morning now is something worn
our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside
away with us to athens three and three
we'll hold a feast in great solemnity
come hippolyta
exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train
demetrius these things seem small and undistinguishable
hermia methinks i see these things with parted eye
when every thing seems double
helena so methinks
and i have found demetrius like a jewel
mine own and not mine own
demetrius are you sure
that we are awake it seems to me
that yet we sleep we dream do not you think
the duke was here and bid us follow him
helena and hippolyta
lysander and he did bid us follow to the temple
demetrius why then we are awake let's follow him
and by the way let us recount our dreams exeunt
bottom awaking when my cue comes call me and i will answer my
next is 'most fair pyramus' heigh ho peter quince flute the
bellows mender snout the tinker starveling god's my life
stoln hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare vision
i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was
i was there is no man can tell what methought i was and
methought i had but man is but a patch'd fool if he will offer
to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the
ear of man hath not seen mans hand is not able to taste his
tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i
will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall
be calld 'bottom's dream' because it hath no bottom and i will
sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke
peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at
scene ii
athens quince's house
enter quince flute snout and starveling
quince have you sent to bottom's house is he come home yet
starveling he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is transported
flute if he come not then the play is marr'd it goes not
forward doth it
quince it is not possible you have not a man in all athens able
to discharge pyramus but he
empty
quince yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for
a sweet voice
flute you must say 'paragon' a paramour is god bless us a
thing of naught
enter snug
snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two
or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone
forward we had all been made men
during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the
duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus i'll
be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus
or nothing
enter bottom
bottom where are these lads where are these hearts
quince bottom o most courageous day o most happy hour
bottom masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what
for if i tell you i am not true athenian i will tell you
quince let us hear sweet bottom
bottom not a word of me all that i will tell you is that the
duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your
beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace
every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our
play is preferr'd in any case let thisby have clean linen and
let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall
hang out for the lions claws and most dear actors eat no
onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not
away go away exeunt
act v scene i
athens the palace of theseus
enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants
hippolyta 'tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of
theseus more strange than true i never may believe
these antique fables nor these fairy toys
lovers and madmen have such seething brains
such shaping fantasies that apprehend
the lunatic the lover and the poet
are of imagination all compact
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
that is the madman the lover all as frantic
sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt
the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling
doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
and as imagination bodies forth
the forms of things unknown the poet's pen
a local habitation and a name
such tricks hath strong imagination
that if it would but apprehend some joy
it comprehends some bringer of that joy
or in the night imagining some fear
how easy is a bush suppos'd a bear
hippolyta but all the story of the night told over
and all their minds transfigur'd so together
more witnesseth than fancy's images
but howsoever strange and admirable
enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena
theseus here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
accompany your hearts
lysander more than to us
wait in your royal walks your board your bed
theseus come now what masques what dances shall we have
to wear away this long age of three hours
where is our usual manager of mirth
what revels are in hand is there no play
to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
call philostrate
philostrate here mighty theseus
theseus say what abridgment have you for this evening
what masque what music how shall we beguile
the lazy time if not with some delight
philostrate there is a brief how many sports are ripe
giving a paper
theseus 'the battle with the centaurs to be sung
by an athenian eunuch to the harp'
we'll none of that that have i told my love
in glory of my kinsman hercules
'the riot of the tipsy bacchanals
tearing the thracian singer in their rage'
that is an old device and it was play'd
when i from thebes came last a conqueror
of learning late deceas'd in beggary'
that is some satire keen and critical
not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
'a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
and his love thisby very tragical mirth'
merry and tragical tedious and brief
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
how shall we find the concord of this discord
philostrate a play there is my lord some ten words long
but by ten words my lord it is too long
which makes it tedious for in all the play
there is not one word apt one player fitted
and tragical my noble lord it is
for pyramus therein doth kill himself
which when i saw rehears'd i must confess
made mine eyes water but more merry tears
the passion of loud laughter never shed
theseus what are they that do play it
which never labour'd in their minds till now
and now have toild their unbreathed memories
with this same play against your nuptial
theseus and we will hear it
philostrate no my noble lord
it is not for you i have heard it over
and it is nothing nothing in the world
unless you can find sport in their intents
extremely stretch'd and connd with cruel pain
theseus i will hear that play
for never anything can be amiss
when simpleness and duty tender it
go bring them in and take your places ladies
exit philostrate
hippolyta i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
and duty in his service perishing
theseus why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
hippolyta he says they can do nothing in this kind
our sport shall be to take what they mistake
and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
takes it in might not merit
where i have come great clerks have purposed
to greet me with premeditated welcomes
where i have seen them shiver and look pale
make periods in the midst of sentences
throttle their practis'd accent in their fears
and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome
and in the modesty of fearful duty
i read as much as from the rattling tongue
of saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tongue tied simplicity
in least speak most to my capacity
re enter philostrate
philostrate so please your grace the prologue is address'd
theseus let him approach flourish of trumpets
prologue if we offend it is with our good will
that you should think we come not to offend
but with good will to show our simple skill
that is the true beginning of our end
consider then we come but in despite
we do not come as minding to content you
our true intent is all for your delight
we are not here that you should here repent you
the actors are at band and by their show
theseus this fellow doth not stand upon points
lysander he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not
the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but
to speak true
hippolyta indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
recorder a sound but not in government
theseus his speech was like a tangled chain nothing im paired
but all disordered who is next
enter with a trumpet before them as in dumb show
prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show
but wonder on till truth make all things plain
this man is pyramus if you would know
this beauteous lady thisby is certain
this man with lime and rough cast doth present
wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
and through walls chink poor souls they are content
to whisper at the which let no man wonder
this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
to meet at ninus' tomb there there to woo
this grisly beast which lion hight by name
the trusty thisby coming first by night
did scare away or rather did affright
and as she fled her mantle she did fall
which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall
and finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain
he bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast
and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
his dagger drew and died for all the rest
let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain
at large discourse while here they do remain
exeunt prologue pyramus thisby
lion and moonshine
theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak
demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
that i one snout by name present a wall
and such a wall as i would have you think
that had in it a crannied hole or chink
through which the lovers pyramus and thisby
did whisper often very secretly
this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show
that i am that same wall the truth is so
and this the cranny is right and sinister
through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
discourse my lord
enter pyramus
theseus pyramus draws near the wall silence
pyramus o grim look'd night o night with hue so black
o night which ever art when day is not
o night o night alack alack alack
i fear my thisby's promise is forgot
and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall
thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall
show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
wall holds up his fingers
thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
but what see what see i no thisby do i see
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me
theseus the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
pyramus no in truth sir he should not deceiving me is thisby's
you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes
enter thisby
thisby o wall full often hast thou beard my moans
for parting my fair pyramus and me
my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink
to spy an i can hear my thisby's face
empty
pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover's grace
and like limander am i trusty still
thisby and i like helen till the fates me kill
pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true
thisby as shafalus to procrus i to you
pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
thisby i kiss the walls hole not your lips at all
pyramus wilt thou at ninny's tomb meet me straightway
thisby tide life tide death i come without delay
wall thus have i wall my part discharged so
and being done thus wall away doth go exit wall
theseus now is the moon used between the two neighbours
demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning
hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are
no worse if imagination amend them
hippolyta it must be your imagination then and not theirs
they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a
man and a lion
enter lion and moonshine
lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
may now perchance both quake and tremble here
when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
then know that i as snug the joiner am
a lion fell nor else no lions dam
into this place 'twere pity on my life
theseus a very gentle beast and of a good conscience
demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw
lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour
theseus true and a goose for his discretion
demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
discretion and the fox carries the goose
theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for
the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head
theseus he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the
empty
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be
theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should
be put into the lantern how is it else the man i' th' moon
demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you see it
hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change
theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that he is
in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay
the time
lysander proceed moon
moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is
the moon i the man i' th' moon this thorn bush my thorn bush
and this dog my dog
demetrius why all these should be in the lantern for all these
re enter thisby
thisby this is old ninny's tomb where is my love
lion roaring o thisby runs off
demetrius well roar'd lion
theseus well run thisby
hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good
grace the lion tears thisby's mantle and exit
theseus well mous'd lion
re enter pyramus
lysander and so the lion vanish'd
pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams
i thank thee moon for shining now so bright
for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
i trust to take of truest thisby sight
but stay o spite
but mark poor knight
what dreadful dole is here
eyes do you see
o dainty duck o dear
thy mantle good
what staind with blood
approach ye furies fell
o fates come come
cut thread and thrum
quail crush conclude and quell
theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would go
near to make a man look sad
pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
which is no no which was the fairest dame
that liv'd that lov'd that lik'd that look'd with cheer
come tears confound
out sword and wound
the pap of pyramus
ay that left pap
where heart doth hop stabs himself
now am i dead
now am i fled
my soul is in the sky
tongue lose thy light
moon take thy flight exit moonshine
now die die die die die dies
demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one
lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet
hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisby comes back
and finds her lover
re enter thisby
theseus she will find him by starlight here she comes and her
passion ends the play
hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a
pyramus i hope she will be brief
demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which
thisby is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a
lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
demetrius and thus she moans videlicet
thisby asleep my love
what dead my dove
o pyramus arise
speak speak quite dumb
dead dead a tomb
must cover thy sweet eyes
these lily lips
these yellow cowslip cheeks
are gone are gone
lovers make moan
his eyes were green as leeks
o sisters three
come come to me
with hands as pale as milk
lay them in gore
since you have shore
tongue not a word
come trusty sword
come blade my breast imbrue stabs herself
and farewell friends
thus thisby ends
adieu adieu adieu dies
theseus moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
demetrius ay and wall too
bottom starting up no i assure you the wall is down that
to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company
theseus no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse
never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none
to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and
hang'd himself in thisby's garter it would have been a fine
tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharg'd but
come your bergomask let your epilogue alone a dance
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
lovers to bed 'tis almost fairy time
as much as we this night have overwatch'd
this palpable gross play hath well beguild
the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed
a fortnight hold we this solemnity
in nightly revels and new jollity exeunt
enter puck with a broom
puck now the hungry lion roars
and the wolf behowls the moon
whilst the heavy ploughman snores
now the wasted brands do glow
whilst the screech owl screeching loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance of a shroud
now it is the time of night
that the graves all gaping wide
every one lets forth his sprite
in the church way paths to glide
and we fairies that do run
from the presence of the sun
following darkness like a dream
now are frolic not a mouse
shall disturb this hallowed house
i am sent with broom before
to sweep the dust behind the door
enter oberon and titania with all their train
oberon through the house give glimmering light
by the dead and drowsy fire
hop as light as bird from brier
and this ditty after me
sing and dance it trippingly
titania first rehearse your song by rote
to each word a warbling note
hand in hand with fairy grace
will we sing and bless this place
oberon leading the fairies sing and dance
oberon now until the break of day
to the best bride bed will we
which by us shall blessed be
and the issue there create
ever shall be fortunate
so shall all the couples three
ever true in loving be
and the blots of nature's hand
shall not in their issue stand
never mole hare lip nor scar
despised in nativity
shall upon their children be
with this field dew consecrate
every fairy take his gait
and each several chamber bless
through this palace with sweet peace
and the owner of it blest
ever shall in safety rest
trip away make no stay
puck if we shadows have offended
think but this and all is mended
that you have but slumb'red here
while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme
no more yielding but a dream
gentles do not reprehend
if you pardon we will mend
and as i am an honest puck
now to scape the serpent's tongue
we will make amends ere long
else the puck a liar call
so good night unto you all
give me your hands if we be friends
and robin shall restore amends exit
the end

and beatrice his niece with a messenger
leon i learn in this letter that don pedro of arragon comes this
night to messina
mess he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i
left him
mess but few of any sort and none of name
leon a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young florentine called claudio
mess much deserv'd on his part and equally rememb'red by don
pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed
better bett'red expectation than you must expect of me to tell
you how
mess i have already delivered him letters and there appears much
joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness
leon did he break out into tears
mess in great measure
leon a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than
those that are so wash'd how much better is it to weep at joy
than to joy at weeping
beat i pray you is signior mountanto returnd from the wars or no
army of any sort
leon what is he that you ask for niece
hero my cousin means signior benedick of padua
mess o he's returnd and as pleasant as ever he was

the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge
subscrib'd for cupid and challeng'd him at the burbolt i pray
you how many hath he killd and eaten in these wars but how
many hath he killd for indeed i promised to eat all of his
leon faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he'll
be meet with you i doubt it not

beat you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a
very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach

war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there's
a skirmish of wit between them
beat alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of
his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governd
with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
sworn brother

his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil

fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it
leon never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace
for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart
from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave
pedro you embrace your charge too willingly i think this is your
empty
leon her mother hath many times told me so
bene were you in doubt sir that you ask'd her
leon signior benedick no for then were you a child
are being a man truly the lady fathers herself be happy lady
for you are like an honourable father
bene if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is
beat i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick
nobody marks you
bene what my dear lady disdain are you yet living
beat is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert
bene then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of
all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my
heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none
beat a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of
your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me
bene god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman
or other shall scape a predestinate scratch'd face
yours were
bene well you are a rare parrot teacher
beat a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
bene i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a
continuer but keep your way a god's name i have done

pedro that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio and signior
benedick my dear friend leonato hath invited you all i tell him
we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly prays
hypocrite but prays from his heart
leon if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn to don
john let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the
prince your brother i owe you all duty
john i thank you i am not of many words but i thank you
leon please it your grace lead on
pedro your hand leonato we will go together
exeunt manent benedick and claudio
claud benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato
claud is she not a modest young lady
bene do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple
true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as
being a professed tyrant to their sex
claud no i pray thee speak in sober judgment
bene why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high praise
too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise
only this commendation i can afford her that were she other
than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she
claud thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how
thou lik'st her
bene would you buy her that you enquire after her
claud can the world buy such a jewel
bene yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad
brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a
good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key
shall a man take you to go in the song
claud in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i look'd on
there's her cousin an she were not possess'd with a furyexceeds
her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of
december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have
empty
claud i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the
contrary if hero would be my wife
bene is't come to this in faith hath not the world one man but
he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a
bachelor of threescore again go to i' faith an thou wilt needs
empty
enter don pedro
look don pedro is returned to seek you
pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed not to
empty
bene i would your grace would constrain me to tell
pedro i charge thee on thy allegiance
bene you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i
would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on
part mark how short his answer is with hero leonato's short
empty
claud if this were so so were it utt'red
bene like the old tale my lord 'it is not so nor 'twas not so
but indeed god forbid it should be so'
claud if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be
empty
pedro amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
claud you speak this to fetch me in my lord
claud and in faith my lord i spoke mine
bene and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine
claud that i love her i feel
pedro that she is worthy i know
bene that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she
should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me
i will die in it at the stake
pedro thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of
empty
empty
bene that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me
up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have
a rechate winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible
baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them
the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust
none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will
live a bachelor
pedro i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love
love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get
again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker's pen
and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of
blind cupid
pedro well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt
prove a notable argument
bene if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and
he that hits me let him be clapp'd on the shoulder and calld
empty
'in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke'
bene the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear
it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and
let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write
'here is good horse to hire' let them signify under my sign
'here you may see benedick the married man'
claud if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad
pedro nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou
wilt quake for this shortly
pedro well you will temporize with the hours in the meantime
good signior benedick repair to leonato's commend me to him and
tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
great preparation
bene i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and
so i commit you
claud to the tuition of god from my house if i had it
pedro the sixth of july your loving friend benedick
bene nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is
basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine
your conscience and so i leave you exit
claud my liege your highness now may do me good
pedro my love is thine to teach teach it but how
and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
any hard lesson that may do thee good
claud hath leonato any son my lord
pedro no child but hero she's his only heir
dost thou affect her claudio
when you went onward on this ended action
i look'd upon her with a soldier's eye
that lik'd but had a rougher task in hand
than to drive liking to the name of love
but now i am returnd and that war thoughts
have left their places vacant in their rooms
come thronging soft and delicate desires
all prompting me how fair young hero is
saying i lik'd her ere i went to wars
and tire the hearer with a book of words
if thou dost love fair hero cherish it
and i will break with her and with her father
and thou shalt have her wast not to this end
that thou beganst to twist so fine a story
claud how sweetly you do minister to love
that know love's grief by his complexion
but lest my liking might too sudden seem
i would have salv'd it with a longer treatise
the fairest grant is the necessity
look what will serve is fit 'tis once thou lovest
and i will fit thee with the remedy
i know we shall have revelling to night
i will assume thy part in some disguise
and tell fair hero i am claudio
and in her bosom i'll unclasp my heart
and take her hearing prisoner with the force
and strong encounter of my amorous tale
and the conclusion is she shall be thine
in practice let us put it presently exeunt

john i wonder that thou being as thou say'st thou art born
under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when
i have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when i have
stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when i am drowsy
and tend on no mans business laugh when i am merry and claw no
man in his humour
con yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment you have of late stood out against
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest
john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace
and it better fits my blood to be disdaind of all than to
fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but
i am a plain dealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and
enfranchis'd with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in
would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek
not to alter me
con can you make no use of your discontent
john i make all use of it for i use it only

act ii scene i
a hall in leonato's house
enter leonato antonio his brother hero his daughter
and beatrice his niece and a kinsman also margaret and ursula
leon was not count john here at supper
ant i saw him not
beat how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am
hero he is of a very melancholy disposition
beat he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says
nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore
empty
leon then half signior benedick's tongue in count johns mouth
and half count johns melancholy in signior benedick's face
beat with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in
his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if 'a
leon by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
ant in faith she's too curst
beat too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's sending
that way for it is said 'god sends a curst cow short horns'
but to a cow too curst he sends none
leon so by being too curst god will send you no horns
beat just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am
at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not
the woollen
leon you may light on a husband that hath no beard
beat what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make
him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a
youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that
is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in
earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell
leon well then go you into hell
old cuckold with horns on his head and say 'get you to heaven
beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids' so
deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens
he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry
as the day is long
ant to hero well niece i trust you will be ruld by your
empty
beat yes faith it is my cousins duty to make cursy and say
'father as it please you' but yet for all that cousin let him
'father as it please me'
leon well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
beat not till god make men of some other metal than earth would
it not grieve a woman to be overmaster'd with a piece of valiant
dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren and truly i
hold it a sin to match in my kinred
leon daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit
you in that kind you know your answer
in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is
measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me
hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a
measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like
a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly
modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace
faster and faster till he sink into his grave
leon cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
leon the revellers are ent'ring brother make good room

beat that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the
'hundred merry tales' well this was signior benedick that said
empty
bene what's he
beat i am sure you know him well enough
bene not i believe me
bene i pray you what is he
beat why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his
gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines
delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in
his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then
they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet
i would he had boarded me
bene when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say
beat do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which
melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool
will eat no supper that night
empty

john are you not signior benedick
claud you know me well i am he
john signior you are very near my brother in his love he is
enamour'd on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no
equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it
claud how know you he loves her
john i heard him swear his affection
john come let us to the banquet
exeunt manet claudio
claud thus answer i in name of benedick
but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio
empty
'tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
friendship is constant in all other things
save in the office and affairs of love
therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
and trust no agent for beauty is a witch
against whose charms faith melteth into blood
this is an accident of hourly proof
which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero
enter benedick unmasked
bene count claudio
claud yea the same
bene come will you go with me
claud whither
fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an
usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you
must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero
claud i wish him joy of her
bene why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they sell
bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you
empty
claud i pray you leave me
bene ho now you strike like the blind man 'twas the boy that
claud if it will not be i'll leave you exit
bene alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but
that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the
prince's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am
merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so
reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well
i'll be revenged as i may
enter don pedro
bene troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found
him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i
think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of
this young lady and i off'red him my company to a willow tree
either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him
up a rod as being worthy to be whipt
pedro to be whipt what's his fault
bene the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed
with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals
pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is
in the stealer
bene yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the
garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the
rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stoln
his bird's nest
pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner
bene if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say
empty
danc'd with her told her she is much wrong'd by you
bene o she misus'd me past the endurance of a block an oak but
with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor
began to assume life and scold with her she told me not
thinking i had been myself that i was the prince's jester that
i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark
with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every
word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that
adam had left him before he transgress'd she would have made
hercules have turnd spit yea and have cleft his club to make
the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the
infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would
conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as
quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose
because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
and perturbation follows her
pedro look here she comes
bene will your grace command me any service to the world's end i
will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can
devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester johns
foot fetch you a hair off the great cham's beard do you any
embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words'
conference with this harpy you have no employment for me
pedro none but to desire your good company
tongue exit
pedro come lady come you have lost the heart of signior
empty
beat indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for
it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won
it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i
have lost it
pedro you have put him down lady you have put him down
beat so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove
me to seek
pedro why how now count wherefore are you sad
claud not sad my lord
pedro how then sick
claud neither my lord
beat the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but
civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous
empty
pedro i' faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i'll
have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with
her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage
and god give thee joy
leon count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his
grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it
beat speak count 'tis your cue
claud silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little
happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours
i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange
and let not him speak neither
pedro in faith lady you have a merry heart
beat yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy
side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her
empty
claud and so she doth cousin
beat good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but
i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry 'heigh ho for
a husband'
beat i would rather have one of your father's getting hath your
grace ne'er a brother like you your father got excellent
husbands if a maid could come by them
pedro will you have me lady
beat no my lord unless i might have another for working days
your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your
grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter
pedro your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes
you for out o' question you were born in a merry hour
danc'd and under that was i born cousins god give you joy
leon niece will you look to those things i told you of
beat i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon exit
pedro by my troth a pleasant spirited lady
leon there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she
is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i
have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness
and wak'd herself with laughing
pedro she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
pedro she were an excellent wife for benedick
leon o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would
talk themselves mad
pedro county claudio when mean you to go to church
claud to morrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all
his rites
leon not till monday my dear son which is hence a just
sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer
my mind
but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us
i will in the interim undertake one of hercules' labours which
is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a
mountain of affection th' one with th' other i would fain have
it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will
but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction
leon my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights'
empty
claud and i my lord
hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a
good husband
pedro and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know
thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved
valour and confirm'd honesty i will teach you how to humour
your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i
to leonato and claudio with your two helps will so practise on
benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this
the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift
empty
scene ii
a hall in leonato's house
enter don john and borachio
john it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of
empty
bora yea my lord but i can cross it
john any bar any cross any impediment will be med'cinable to me
affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this
empty
bora not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me
john show me briefly how
bora i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in
the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero
john i remember
bora i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her
john what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
bora the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the
prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do
you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as
empty
john what proof shall i make of that
bora proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo
hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue
bora go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count
claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend
a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as in love of
your brother's honour who hath made this match and his friend's
reputation who is thus like to be cozend with the semblance of
a maid that you have discover'd thus they will scarcely believe
this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no
less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me
call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them
the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be
absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero's
disloyalty that jealousy shall be calld assurance and all the
preparation overthrown
john grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in
practice be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a
thousand ducats
bora be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not
shame me
empty
scene iii
leonato's orchard
enter benedick alone
bene boy
enter boy
boy signior
bene in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in
the orchard
bene i know that but i would have thee hence and here again
exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love
will after he hath laugh'd at such shallow follies in others
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such
a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him
but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor
and the pipe i have known when he would have walk'd ten mile
afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is
he turnd orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet
just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with
these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but
love may transform me to an oyster but i'll take my oath on it
till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a
fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am
well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in
one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall
cheapen her fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not
near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an
excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it
please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in
the arbour hides
enter don pedro leonato claudio
music within
pedro come shall we hear this music
claud yea my good lord how still the evening is
pedro see you where benedick hath hid himself
claud o very well my lord the music ended
we'll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth
enter balthasar with music
pedro come balthasar we'll hear that song again
balth o good my lord tax not so bad a voice
to slander music any more than once
pedro it is the witness still of excellency
to put a strange face on his own perfection
balth because you talk of wooing i will sing
since many a wooer doth commence his suit
to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
yet will he swear he loves
pedro nay pray thee come
or if thou wilt hold longer argument
do it in notes
balth note this before my notes
there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting
note notes forsooth and nothing music
bene aside now divine air now is his soul ravish'd is it not
strange that sheep's guts should hale souls out of mens bodies
well a horn for my money when alls done
balthasar sings
the song
sigh no more ladies sigh no more
men were deceivers ever
one foot in sea and one on shore
then sigh not so
but let them go
and be you blithe and bonny
converting all your sounds of woe
into hey nonny nonny
sing no more ditties sing no moe
of dumps so dull and heavy
the fraud of men was ever so
since summer first was leavy
pedro by my troth a good song
balth and an ill singer my lord
pedro ha no no faith thou sing'st well enough for a shift
bene aside an he had been a dog that should have howld thus
they would have hang'd him and i pray god his bad voice bode no
mischief i had as live have heard the night raven come what
plague could have come after it
pedro yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us
some excellent music for to morrow night we would have it at the
balth the best i can my lord
pedro do so farewell
exit balthasar with musicians
come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that
your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick
claud o ay aside to pedro stalk on stalk on the fowl sits
i did never think that lady would have loved any man
leon no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote
on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours
bene aside is't possible sits the wind in that corner
leon by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but
that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the
infinite of thought
pedro may be she doth but counterfeit
claud faith like enough
leon o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion as she discovers it
pedro why what effects of passion shows she
leon what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my
daughter tell you how
claud she did indeed
pedro how how i pray you you amaze me i would have thought her
spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection
leon i would have sworn it had my lord especially against
empty
bene aside i should think this a gull but that the white bearded
fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such
claud aside he hath ta'en th' infection hold it up
pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick
leon no and swears she never will that's her torment
claud 'tis true indeed so your daughter says 'shall i' says
she 'that have so oft encount'red him with scorn write to him
that i love him'
leon this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for
she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her
smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us
claud now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of
leon o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found
'benedick' and 'beatrice' between the sheet
claud that
leon o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at
herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
knew would flout her 'i measure him' says she 'by my own
spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i
claud then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her
heart tears her hair prays curses 'o sweet benedick god give
me patience'
leon she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so
much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true
pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she
will not discover it
claud to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the
pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an
excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous
claud and she is exceeding wise
pedro in everything but in loving benedick
leon o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry
for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian
pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have
daff'd all other respects and made her half myself i pray you
leon were it good think you
claud hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die
if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known
and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one
breath of her accustomed crossness
pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love 'tis
very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath
a contemptible spirit
claud he is a very proper man
claud before god and in my mind very wise
pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
claud and i take him to be valiant
pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you
may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great
discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear
leon if he do fear god 'a must necessarily keep peace if he
break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
empty
seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am
sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of
her love
claud never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good
empty
leon nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first
pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it
cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would
modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
leon my lord will you walk dinner is ready
they walk away
claud if he dote on her upon this i will never trust my
empty
pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that must your
daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they
hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter
that's the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb
show let us send her to call him in to dinner
benedick advances from the arbour
bene this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they
have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady
it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it
must be requited i hear how i am censur'd they say i will bear
myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too
that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did
never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that
hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the
'tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by
my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of
her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance
have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i
have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite
alters a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world
must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not
enter beatrice
here comes beatrice by this day she's a fair lady i do spy
some marks of love in her
beat against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner
bene fair beatrice i thank you for your pains
beat i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
thank me if it had been painful i would not have come
bene you take pleasure then in the message
beat yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and
empty
bene ha 'against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner'
there's a double meaning in that 'i took no more pains for those
thanks than you took pains to thank me' that's as much as to
say 'any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks' if i
do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i
am a jew i will go get her picture exit
act iii scene i
leonato's orchard
hero good margaret run thee to the parlour
there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice
proposing with the prince and claudio
whisper her ear and tell her i and ursley
walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
is all of her say that thou overheard'st us
and bid her steal into the pleached bower
where honeysuckles ripened by the sun
forbid the sun to enter like favourites
against that power that bred it there will she hide her
to listen our propose this is thy office
bear thee well in it and leave us alone
marg i'll make her come i warrant you presently exit
hero now ursula when beatrice doth come
as we do trace this alley up and down
our talk must only be of benedick
when i do name him let it be thy part
to praise him more than ever man did merit
is sick in love with beatrice of this matter
is little cupid's crafty arrow made
that only wounds by hearsay
enter beatrice
now begin
for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
close by the ground to hear our conference
beatrice hides in the arbour
urs the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
and greedily devour the treacherous bait
so angle we for beatrice who even now
is couched in the woodbine coverture
fear you not my part of the dialogue
hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
they approach the arbour
no truly ursula she is too disdainful
i know her spirits are as coy and wild
urs but are you sure
that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
hero so says the prince and my new trothed lord
urs and did they bid you tell her of it madam
hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
but i persuaded them if they lov'd benedick
to wish him wrestle with affection
and never to let beatrice know of it
urs why did you so doth not the gentleman
as ever beatrice shall couch upon
hero o god of love i know he doth deserve
as much as may be yielded to a man
but nature never fram'd a womans heart
of prouder stuff than that of beatrice
disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
misprizing what they look on and her wit
values itself so highly that to her
all matter else seems weak she cannot love
she is so self endeared
urs sure i think so
and therefore certainly it were not good
she knew his love lest she'll make sport at it
hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man
how wise how noble young how rarely featur'd
but she would spell him backward if fair fac'd
she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
if black why nature drawing of an antic
if low an agate very vilely cut
if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
if silent why a block moved with none
so turns she every man the wrong side out
and never gives to truth and virtue that
which simpleness and merit purchaseth
urs sure sure such carping is not commendable
hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions
as beatrice is cannot be commendable
she would mock me into air o she would laugh me
out of myself press me to death with wit
therefore let benedick like cover'd fire
consume away in sighs waste inwardly
it were a better death than die with mocks
which is as bad as die with tickling
urs yet tell her of it hear what she will say
hero no rather i will go to benedick
and counsel him to fight against his passion
to stain my cousin with one doth not know
how much an ill word may empoison liking
urs o do not do your cousin such a wrong
she cannot be so much without true judgment
having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is priz'd to have as to refuse
so rare a gentleman as signior benedick
hero he is the only man of italy
always excepted my dear claudio
speaking my fancy signior benedick
for shape for bearing argument and valour
goes foremost in report through italy
hero indeed he hath an excellent good name
urs his excellence did earn it ere he had it
when are you married madam
hero why every day to morrow come go in
i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel
which is the best to furnish me to morrow
urs she's lim'd i warrant you we have caught her madam
hero if it prove so then loving goes by haps
some cupid kills with arrows some with traps
exeunt hero and ursula
beatrice advances from the arbour
beat what fire is in mine ears can this be true
stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much
contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
no glory lives behind the back of such
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
to bind our loves up in a holy band
for others say thou dost deserve and i
believe it better than reportingly exit
scene ii
a room in leonato's house
enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato
pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go
claud i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll vouchsafe me
pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear
it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth
he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's bowstring and the little
hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a
bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks
his tongue speaks
leon so say i methinks you are sadder
claud i hope he be in love
pedro hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in him to be
truly touch'd with love if he be sad he wants money
bene i have the toothache
pedro draw it
bene hang it
claud you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
pedro what sigh for the toothache
bene well every one can master a grief but he that has it
claud yet say i he is in love
pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy
that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman to day a
frenchman to morrow or in the shape of two countries at once as
a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from
the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this
foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you
would have it appear he is
old signs 'a brushes his hat o' mornings what should that bode
pedro hath any man seen him at the barber's
claud no but the barber's man hath been seen with him and the
old ornament of his cheek hath already stuff'd tennis balls
leon indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
pedro nay 'a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by
empty
claud that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love
pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy
pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say
of him
claud nay but his jesting spirit which is new crept into a
lutestring and now governd by stops
pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude
he is in love
claud nay but i know who loves him
pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not
claud yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for
pedro she shall be buried with her face upwards
bene yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk
aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak
to you which these hobby horses must not hear
exeunt benedick and leonato
pedro for my life to break with him about beatrice
claud 'tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their
parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one
another when they meet
john my lord and brother god save you
pedro good den brother
john if your leisure serv'd i would speak with you
pedro in private
john if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i
would speak of concerns him
pedro what's the matter
john to claudio means your lordship to be married tomorrow
pedro you know he does
claud if there be any impediment i pray you discover it
john you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and
aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i
think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to
effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labour
ill bestowed
pedro why what's the matter
john i came hither to tell you and circumstances short'ned for
she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal
john even she leonato's hero your hero every mans hero
claud disloyal
john the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say
she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to
it wonder not till further warrant go but with me to night you
shall see her chamber window ent'red even the night before her
wedding day if you love her then to morrow wed her but it
would better fit your honour to change your mind
claud may this be so
john if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you
know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you
have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly
claud if i see anything to night why i should not marry her
to morrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i
shame her
pedro and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with
thee to disgrace her
john i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses
pedro o day untowardly turned
claud o mischief strangely thwarting
john o plague right well prevented
so will you say when you have seen the sequel

a street
enter dogberry and his compartner verges with the watch
dog are you good men and true
body and soul
dog nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should
have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince's watch
verg well give them their charge neighbour dogberry
dog first who think you the most desartless man to be constable
1 watch hugh oatcake sir or george seacoal for they can write
and read
dog come hither neighbour seacoal god hath bless'd you with a
good name to be a well favoured man is the gift of fortune but
2 watch both which master constable
dog you have i knew it would be your answer well for your
favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and
for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no
need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore
bear you the lanthorn this is your charge you shall comprehend
all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince's
empty
dog why then take no note of him but let him go and presently
call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of
a knave
verg if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the
prince's subjects
dog true and they are to meddle with none but the prince's
subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for
the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be
empty
a watch
dog why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i
cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your
bills be not stoln well you are to call at all the alehouses
and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
2 watch how if they will not
dog why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you
not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you
took them for
dog if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your
office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you
meddle or make with them why the more your honesty
2 watch if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on
empty
dog truly by your office you may but i think they that touch
pitch will be defild the most peaceable way for you if you do
take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal
out of your company
dog truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who
hath any honesty in him
verg if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the
nurse and bid her still it
2 watch how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
dog why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with
crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will
never answer a calf when he bleats
verg 'tis very true
the prince's own person if you meet the prince in the night
you may stay him
verg nay by'r lady that i think 'a cannot
dog five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the
statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be
willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is
an offence to stay a man against his will
verg by'r lady i think it be so

your own and good night come neighbour
2 watch well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here

rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee
2 watch aside some treason masters yet stand close
con is it possible that any villany should be so dear
bora thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany
should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones
poor ones may make what price they will
con i wonder at it
bora that shows thou art unconfirm'd thou knowest that the
fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man
con yes it is apparel
bora i mean the fashion
bora tush i may as well say the fools the fool but seest thou
not what a deformed thief this fashion is
2 watch aside i know that deformed 'a bas been a vile thief
this seven year 'a goes up and down like a gentleman i remember
his name
bora didst thou not hear somebody
con no 'twas the vane on the house
bora seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is
how giddily 'a turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen
soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god bels priests
in the old church window sometime like the shaven hercules in
the smirch'd worm eaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as
massy as his club
con all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more
apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the
fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling
me of the fashion
bora not so neither but know that i have to night wooed margaret
out at her mistress' chamber window bids me a thousand times
good night i tell this tale vilely i should first tell thee how
the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and
possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this
amiable encounter
con and thought they margaret was hero
bora two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my
master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which
first possess'd them partly by the dark night which did deceive
that don john had made away went claudio enrag'd swore he would
meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and
there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw
o'ernight and send her home again without a husband

there leonato take her back again
give not this rotten orange to your friend
she's but the sign and semblance of her honour
behold how like a maid she blushes here
o what authority and show of truth
can cunning sin cover itself withal
comes not that blood as modest evidence
all you that see her that she were a maid
by these exterior shows but she is none
she knows the heat of a luxurious bed
her blush is guiltiness not modesty
leon what do you mean my lord
claud not to be married
not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
leon dear my lord if you in your own proof
have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth
claud i know what you would say if i have known her
you will say she did embrace me as a husband
and so extenuate the forehand sin
no leonato
i never tempted her with word too large
but as a brother to his sister show'd
bashful sincerity and comely love
hero and seem'd i ever otherwise to you
claud out on the seeming i will write against it
as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
but you are more intemperate in your blood
than venus or those pamp'red animals
that rage in savage sensuality
hero is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
leon sweet prince why speak not you
pedro what should i speak
i stand dishonour'd that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale
john sir they are spoken and these things are true
bene this looks not like a nuptial
hero 'true' o god
claud leonato stand i here
is this the prince is this the prince's brother
is this face hero's are our eyes our own
leon all this is so but what of this my lord
claud let me but move one question to your daughter
and by that fatherly and kindly power
leon i charge thee do so as thou art my child
hero o god defend me how am i beset
what kind of catechising call you this
claud to make you answer truly to your name
hero is it not hero who can blot that name
with any just reproach
claud marry that can hero
hero itself can blot out hero's virtue
what man was he talk'd with you yesternight
now if you are a maid answer to this
hero i talk'd with no man at that hour my lord
pedro why then are you no maiden leonato
i am sorry you must hear upon my honour
myself my brother and this grieved count
did see her hear her at that hour last night
talk with a ruffian at her chamber window
who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
confess'd the vile encounters they have had
john fie fie they are not to be nam'd my lord
not to be spoke of
there is not chastity enough in language
without offence to utter them thus pretty lady
i am sorry for thy much misgovernment
claud o hero what a hero hadst thou been
if half thy outward graces had been plac'd
about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love
and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
and never shall it more be gracious
leon hath no mans dagger here a point for me
hero swoons
beat why how now cousin wherefore sink you down
john come let us go these things come thus to light
smother her spirits up
bene how doth the lady
beat dead i think help uncle
hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar
leon o fate take not away thy heavy hand
death is the fairest cover for her shame
that may be wish'd for
beat how now cousin hero
friar have comfort lady
leon dost thou look up
leon wherefore why doth not every earthly thing
cry shame upon her could she here deny
the story that is printed in her blood
do not live hero do not ope thine eyes
for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die
thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
myself would on the rearward of reproaches
strike at thy life griev'd i i had but one
child i for that at frugal nature's frame
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
why had i not with charitable hand
took up a beggar's issue at my gates
who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy
i might have said 'no part of it is mine
this shame derives itself from unknown loins'
but mine and mine i lov'd and mine i prais'd
and mine that i was proud on mine so much
that i myself was to myself not mine
into a pit of ink that the wide sea
hath drops too few to wash her clean again
and salt too little which may season give
to her foul tainted flesh
bene sir sir be patient
for my part i am so attir'd in wonder
i know not what to say
beat o on my soul my cousin is belied
bene lady were you her bedfellow last night
i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
leon confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made
which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron
would the two princes lie and claudio lie
who lov'd her so that speaking of her foulness
wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die
friar hear me a little
for i have only been silent so long
and given way unto this course of fortune
a thousand blushing apparitions
to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
in angel whiteness beat away those blushes
and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
to burn the errors that these princes hold
against her maiden truth call me a fool
trust not my reading nor my observation
which with experimental seal doth warrant
the tenure of my book trust not my age
if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
under some biting error
leon friar it cannot be
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
is that she will not add to her damnation
a sin of perjury she not denies it
why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
that which appears in proper nakedness
friar lady what man is he you are accus'd of
if i know more of any man alive
than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
let all my sins lack mercy o my father
prove you that any man with me convers'd
at hours unmeet or that i yesternight
maintaind the change of words with any creature
refuse me hate me torture me to death
friar there is some strange misprision in the princes
bene two of them have the very bent of honour
the practice of it lives in john the bastard
whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
leon i know not if they speak but truth of her
these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
the proudest of them shall well hear of it
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
nor age so eat up my invention
nor fortune made such havoc of my means
nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
both strength of limb and policy of mind
ability in means and choice of friends
to quit me of them throughly
friar pause awhile
and let my counsel sway you in this case
your daughter here the princes left for dead
let her awhile be secretly kept in
and publish it that she is dead indeed
maintain a mourning ostentation
hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
that appertain unto a burial
leon what shall become of this what will this do
friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf
change slander to remorse that is some good
but not for that dream i on this strange course
but on this travail look for greater birth
she dying as it must be so maintaind
upon the instant that she was accus'd
of every hearer for it so falls out
that what we have we prize not to the worth
whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost
why then we rack the value then we find
the virtue that possession would not show us
whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio
when he shall hear she died upon his words
th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep
into his study of imagination
shall come apparelld in more precious habit
more moving delicate and full of life
into the eye and prospect of his soul
than when she liv'd indeed then shall he mourn
if ever love had interest in his liver
and wish he had not so accused her
no though be thought his accusation true
let this be so and doubt not but success
will fashion the event in better shape
but if all aim but this be levelld false
the supposition of the lady's death
will quench the wonder of her infamy
and if it sort not well you may conceal her
as best befits her wounded reputation
in some reclusive and religious life
out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
bene signior leonato let the friar advise you
and though you know my inwardness and love
yet by mine honour i will deal in this
as secretly and justly as your soul
should with your body
leon being that i flow in grief
the smallest twine may lead me
friar 'tis well consented presently away
for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
come lady die to live this wedding day
perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure
bene lady beatrice have you wept all this while
beat yea and i will weep a while longer
bene i will not desire that
beat you have no reason i do it freely
bene surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged
beat ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right
empty
bene is there any way to show such friendship
beat a very even way but no such friend
beat it is a mans office but not yours
bene i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that
empty
beat as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for
me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and
yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry
for my cousin
bene by my sword beatrice thou lovest me
beat do not swear and eat it
it that says i love not you
beat will you not eat your word
bene with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love
empty
beat why then god forgive me
bene what offence sweet beatrice
beat you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i
loved you
bene and do it with all thy heart
empty
bene come bid me do anything for thee
beat kill claudio
bene ha not for the wide world
beat you kill me to deny it farewell
bene tarry sweet beatrice
beat i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i
pray you let me go
bene beatrice
bene we'll be friends first
beat you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine
empty
bene is claudio thine enemy
beat is 'a not approved in the height a villain that hath
slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a
man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and
then with public accusation uncover'd slander unmitigated
rancour o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the
bene hear me beatrice
beat talk with a man out at a window a proper saying
bene nay but beatrice
beat sweet hero she is wrong'd she is sland'red she is undone
bene beat
beat princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly
count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man
for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my
sake but manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment
as valiant as hercules that only tells a lieand swears it i
cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with
empty
bene tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee
beat use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
bene think you in your soul the count claudio hath wrong'd hero
beat yea as sure is i have a thought or a soul
bene enough i am engag'd i will challenge him i will kiss your
hand and so i leave you by this hand claudio shall render me a
cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell

act v scene i
the street near leonato's house
enter leonato and his brother antonio
ant if you go on thus you will kill yourself
and 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
against yourself
leon i pray thee cease thy counsel
which falls into mine ears as profitless
as water in a sieve give not me counsel
but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
bring me a father that so lov'd his child
whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine
and bid him speak to me of patience
measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
and let it answer every strain for strain
as thus for thus and such a grief for such
in every lineament branch shape and form
if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
with candle wasters bring him yet to me
and i of him will gather patience
but there is no such man for brother men
can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
which they themselves not feel but tasting it
their counsel turns to passion which before
would give preceptial medicine to rage
fetter strong madness in a silken thread
no no 'tis all mens office to speak patience
to those that wring under the load of sorrow
but no mans virtue nor sufficiency
to be so moral when he shall endure
the like himself therefore give me no counsel
my griefs cry louder than advertisement
ant therein do men from children nothing differ
leon i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood
for there was never yet philosopher
however they have writ the style of gods
and made a push at chance and sufferance
ant yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
make those that do offend you suffer too
leon there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so
my soul doth tell me hero is belied
and that shall claudio know so shall the prince
and all of them that thus dishonour her
enter don pedro and claudio
pedro good den good den

leon hear you my lords
pedro we have some haste leonato
leon some haste my lord well fare you well my lord

pedro nay do not quarrel with us good old man
ant if he could right himself with quarrelling
some of us would lie low
leon marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
i fear thee not
claud mary beshrew my hand
if it should give your age such cause of fear
in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
leon tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
i speak not like a dotard nor a fool
as under privilege of age to brag
were i not old know claudio to thy head
thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
that i am forc'd to lay my reverence by
and with grey hairs and bruise of many days
do challenge thee to trial of a man
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child
thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
and she lied buried with her ancestors
o in a tomb where never scandal slept
claud my villany
leon thine claudio thine i say
pedro you say not right old man
leon my lord my lord
i'll prove it on his body if he dare
despite his nice fence and his active practice
his may of youth and bloom of lustihood
claud away i will not have to do with you
leon canst thou so daff me thou hast killd my child
and he shall kill two of us and men indeed
but that's no matter let him kill one first
win me and wear me let him answer me
come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
sir boy i'll whip you from your foining fence
nay as i am a gentleman i will
leon brother
ant content yourself god knows i lov'd my niece
and she is dead slander'd to death by villains
as i dare take a serpent by the tongue
boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
leon brother anthony
ant hold you content what man i know them yea
and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
scambling outfacing fashion monging boys
that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
go anticly show outward hideousness
and speak off half a dozen dang'rous words
and this is all
leon but brother anthony
ant come 'tis no matter
do not you meddle let me deal in this
pedro gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
my heart is sorry for your daughter's death

a capon the which if i do not carve most curiously say my
knife's naught shall i not find a woodcock too
bene sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
pedro i'll tell thee how beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day i
said thou hadst a fine wit 'true' said she 'a fine little
one' 'no' said i 'a great wit' 'right' says she 'a great
gross one' 'nay' said i 'a good wit' 'just' said she 'it
said she a wise gentleman' 'nay' said i 'he hath the
tongues' 'that i believe' said she 'for he swore a thing to me
on monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning there's a
double tongue there's two tongues' thus did she an hour
together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she
concluded with a sigh thou wast the proper'st man in italy
claud for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not
pedro yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not
hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old mans
claud all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the
empty
pedro but when shall we set the savage bulls horns on the
sensible benedick's head
claud yea and text underneath 'here dwells benedick the married
empty
bene fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave you now to
your gossiplike humour you break jests as braggards do their

dog come you sir if justice cannot tame you she shall ne'er
weigh more reasons in her balance nay an you be a cursing
pedro how now two of my brother's men bound borachio one
claud hearken after their offence my lord
pedro officers what offence have these men done
dog marry sir they have committed false report moreover they
have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and
lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified
unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves
pedro first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i ask thee
what's their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed
claud rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth
there's one meaning well suited
pedro who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to
your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be
understood what's your offence
bora sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you
hear me and let this count kill me i have deceived even your
very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow
fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me
slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and
saw me court margaret in hero's garments how you disgrac'd her
when you should marry her my villany they have upon record
which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
shame the lady is dead upon mine and my master's false
accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a
empty
pedro runs not this speech like iron through your blood
claud i have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it
bora yea and paid me richly for the practice of it
pedro he is compos'd and fram'd of treachery
and fled he is upon this villany

bene suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i
love thee against my will
beat in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you
spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never
love that which my friend hates

good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb
ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell
rings and the widow weeps
beat and how long is that think you
bene question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum
therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his
of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising
myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now
tell me how doth your cousin
beat very ill

beat very ill too
bene serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for

eyes and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncle's

followed by musicians
claud is this the monument of leonato
lord it is my lord
claud reads from a scroll
empty
done to death by slanderous tongues
was the hero that here lies
death in guerdon of her wrongs
gives her fame which never dies
lives in death with glorious fame
hang thou there upon the tomb
hangs up the scroll
praising her when i am dumb
now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
empty
pardon goddess of the night
those that slew thy virgin knight
for the which with songs of woe
midnight assist our moan
help us to sigh and groan
heavily heavily
graves yawn and yield your dead
till death be uttered
heavily heavily
claud now unto thy bones good night
yearly will i do this rite
pedro good morrow masters put your torches out
before the wheels of phoebus round about
dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
thanks to you all and leave us fare you well
claud good morrow masters each his several way
pedro come let us hence and put on other weeds
and then to leonato's we will go
claud and hymen now with luckier issue speeds
than this for whom we rend'red up this woe exeunt

that you have such a february face
so full of frost of storm and cloudiness
claud i think he thinks upon the savage bull
and all europa shall rejoice at thee
as once europa did at lusty jove
when he would play the noble beast in love
bene bull jove sir had an amiable low
and some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
and got a calf in that same noble feat
much like to you for you have just his bleat
enter leonato's brother antonio hero beatrice
margaret ursula the ladies wearing masks
which is the lady i must seize upon
ant this same is she and i do give you her
claud why then she's mine sweet let me see your face
leon no that you shall not till you take her hand

beat no truly but in friendly recompense
leon come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman
claud and i'll be sworn upont that he loves her
for here's a paper written in his hand
a halting sonnet of his own pure brain
fashiond to beatrice
writ in my cousins hand stoln from her pocket
containing her affection unto benedick
bene a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts

wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to
marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said
against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion
for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in
that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruis'd and love my
empty
claud i had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i
double dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do
not look exceeding narrowly to thee
bene come come we are friends let's have a dance ere we are
married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels
leon we'll have dancing afterward
bene first of my word therefore play music prince thou art
sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more
reverent than one tipp'd with horn

scene venice and cyprus
act i scene i
venice a street
enter roderigo and iago
roderigo tush never tell me i take it much unkindly
as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
iago 'sblood but you will not hear me
if ever i did dream of such a matter
abhor me
roderigo thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate
iago despise me if i do not three great ones of the city
in personal suit to make me his lieutenant
off capp'd to him and by the faith of man
i know my price i am worth no worse a place
evades them with a bumbast circumstance
horribly stuff'd with epithets of war
and in conclusion
nonsuits my mediators for certes says he
i have already chose my officer
and what was he
forsooth a great arithmetician
one michael cassio a florentine
a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife
nor the division of a battle knows
more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
wherein the toged consuls can propose
as masterly as he mere prattle without practice
is all his soldiership but he sir had the election
and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof
at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds
christian and heathen must be belee'd and calm'd
by debitor and creditor this counter caster
and i god bless the mark his moorship's ancient
roderigo by heaven i rather would have been his hangman
iago why there's no remedy 'tis the curse of service
preferment goes by letter and affection
and not by old gradation where each second
stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself
whether i in any just term am affined
to love the moor
roderigo i would not follow him then
i follow him to serve my turn upon him
we cannot all be masters nor all masters
cannot be truly follow'd you shall mark
many a duteous and knee crooking knave
that doting on his own obsequious bondage
wears out his time much like his master's ass
for nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd
whip me such honest knaves others there are
who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty
and throwing but shows of service on their lords
do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
and such a one do i profess myself
for sir
it is as sure as you are roderigo
were i the moor i would not be iago
in following him i follow but myself
heaven is my judge not i for love and duty
for when my outward action doth demonstrate
the native act and figure of my heart
in complement extern 'tis not long after
but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
for daws to peck at i am not what i am
roderigo what a full fortune does the thick lips owe
if he can carry't thus
iago call up her father
rouse him make after him poison his delight
and though he in a fertile climate dwell
plague him with flies though that his joy be joy
yet throw such changes of vexation ont
as it may lose some color
roderigo here is her father's house i'll call aloud
iago do with like timorous accent and dire yell
as when by night and negligence the fire
is spied in populous cities
roderigo what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho
look to your house your daughter and your bags
thieves thieves
brabantio appears above at a window
brabantio what is the reason of this terrible summons
what is the matter there
roderigo signior is all your family within
iago are your doors lock'd
brabantio why wherefore ask you this
iago 'zounds sir you're robb'd for shame put on your gown
even now now very now an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe arise arise
awake the snorting citizens with the bell
or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
arise i say
brabantio what have you lost your wits
roderigo most reverend signior do you know my voice
brabantio not i what are you
roderigo my name is roderigo
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
my daughter is not for thee and now in madness
being full of supper and distempering draughts
upon malicious bravery dost thou come
to start my quiet
roderigo sir sir sir
brabantio but thou must needs be sure
my spirit and my place have in them power
roderigo patience good sir
brabantio what tellst thou me of robbing this is venice
my house is not a grange
roderigo most grave brabantio
in simple and pure soul i come to you
iago 'zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god
if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you
think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a
barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have
brabantio what profane wretch art thou
iago i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the
moor are now making the beast with two backs
brabantio thou are a villain
iago you are a senator
brabantio this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo
roderigo sir i will answer anything but i beseech you
if't be your pleasure and most wise consent
as partly i find it is that your fair daughter
transported with no worse nor better guard
but with a knave of common hire a gondolier
to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor
if this be known to you and your allowance
we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
but if you know not this my manners tell me
we have your wrong rebuke do not believe
that from the sense of all civility
i thus would play and trifle with your reverence
i say again hath made a gross revolt
tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
of here and everywhere straight satisfy yourself
if she be in her chamber or your house
let loose on me the justice of the state
for thus deluding you
brabantio strike on the tinder ho
give me a taper call up all my people
belief of it oppresses me already
light i say light exit above
iago farewell for i must leave you
it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
to be produced as if i stay i shall
against the moor for i do know the state
however this may gall him with some check
cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd
with such loud reason to the cyprus wars
another of his fathom they have none
to lead their business in which regard
though i do hate him as i do hell pains
yet for necessity of present life
i must show out a flag and sign of love
which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him
lead to the sagittary the raised search
and there will i be with him so farewell exit
enter below brabantio in his nightgown and
brabantio it is too true an evil gone she is
and what's to come of my despised time
is nought but bitterness now roderigo
where didst thou see her o unhappy girl
with the moor say'st thou who would be a father
how didst thou know 'twas she o she deceives me
past thought what said she to you get more tapers
raise all my kindred are they married think you
roderigo truly i think they are
fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds
by what you see them act is there not charms
by which the property of youth and maidhood
may be abused have you not read roderigo
of some such thing
roderigo yes sir i have indeed
brabantio call up my brother o would you had had her
some one way some another do you know
where we may apprehend her and the moor
to get good guard and go along with me
brabantio pray you lead on at every house i'll call
i may command at most get weapons ho
and raise some special officers of night
on good roderigo i'll deserve your pains exeunt
scene ii
another street
enter othello iago and attendants with torches
iago though in the trade of war i have slain men
to do no contrived murther i lack iniquity
sometimes to do me service nine or ten times
i had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs
othello 'tis better as it is
iago nay but he prated
and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
against your honor
that with the little godliness i have
i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir
that the magnifico is much beloved
and hath in his effect a voice potential
as double as the duke's he will divorce you
or put upon you what restraint and grievance
the law with all his might to enforce it on
will give him cable
othello let him do his spite
my services which i have done the signiory
shall out tongue his complaints 'tis yet to know
i shall promulgate i fetch my life and being
from men of royal siege and my demerits
may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
as this that i have reach'd for know iago
but that i love the gentle desdemona
i would not my unhoused free condition
put into circumscription and confine
for the sea's worth but look what lights come yond
iago those are the raised father and his friends
othello not i i must be found
my parts my title and my perfect soul
shall manifest me rightly is it they
iago by janus i think no
enter cassio and certain officers with torches
othello the servants of the duke and my lieutenant
the goodness of the night upon you friends
what is the news
cassio the duke does greet you general
even on the instant
othello what is the matter think you
cassio something from cyprus as i may divine
it is a business of some heat the galleys
have sent a dozen sequent messengers
this very night at one another's heels
and many of the consuls raised and met
are at the duke's already you have been hotly calld for
when being not at your lodging to be found
to search you out
othello 'tis well i am found by you
i will but spend a word here in the house
and go with you exit
cassio ancient what makes he here
iago faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack
if it prove lawful prize he's made forever
cassio i do not understand
iago he's married
re enter othello
iago marry to come captain will you go
othello have with you
cassio here comes another troop to seek for you
iago it is brabantio general be advised
he comes to bad intent
enter brabantio roderigo and officers with torches
and weapons
othello holla stand there
brabantio down with him thief
they draw on both sides
iago you roderigo come sir i am for you
othello keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
good signior you shall more command with years
than with your weapons
brabantio o thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter
damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
for i'll refer me to all things of sense
whether a maid so tender fair and happy
so opposite to marriage that she shunnd
the wealthy curled darlings of our nation
would ever have to incur a general mock
run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense
that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms
abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
'tis probable and palpable to thinking
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
for an abuser of the world a practicer
of arts inhibited and out of warrant
lay hold upon him if he do resist
subdue him at his peril
othello hold your hands
both you of my inclining and the rest
were it my cue to fight i should have known it
to answer this your charge
brabantio to prison till fit time
of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer
othello what if i do obey
how may the duke be therewith satisfied
whose messengers are here about my side
upon some present business of the state
to bring me to him
the duke's in council and your noble self
i am sure is sent for
brabantio how the duke in council
in this time of the night bring him away
mine's not an idle cause the duke himself
or any of my brothers of the state
cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own
for if such actions may have passage free
bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be exeunt
a council chamber the duke and senators sitting at a table
officers attending
duke there is no composition in these news
that gives them credit
first senator indeed they are disproportiond
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys
duke and mine a hundred and forty
second senator and mine two hundred
but though they jump not on a just account
'tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm
a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus
duke nay it is possible enough to judgement
i do not so secure me in the error
but the main article i do approve
in fearful sense
sailor within what ho what ho what ho
first officer a messenger from the galleys
enter sailor
sailor the turkish preparation makes for rhodes
so was i bid report here to the state
by signior angelo
duke how say you by this change
first senator this cannot be
by no assay of reason 'tis a pageant
to keep us in false gaze when we consider
the importancy of cyprus to the turk
and let ourselves again but understand
so may he with more facile question bear it
for that it stands not in such warlike brace
but altogether lacks the abilities
that rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this
we must not think the turk is so unskillful
to leave that latest which concerns him first
neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
to wake and wage a danger profitless
duke nay in all confidence he's not for rhodes
enter a messenger
messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious
steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes
have there injointed them with an after fleet
first senator ay so i thought how many as you guess
messenger of thirty sail and now they do re stem
their backward course bearing with frank appearance
their purposes toward cyprus signior montano
your trusty and most valiant servitor
and prays you to believe him
duke 'tis certain then for cyprus
marcus luccicos is not he in town
first senator he's now in florence
duke write from us to him post post haste dispatch
first senator here comes brabantio and the valiant moor
enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers
duke valiant othello we must straight employ you
against the general enemy ottoman
we lack'd your counsel and your help tonight
brabantio so did i yours good your grace pardon me
neither my place nor aught i heard of business
hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
take hold on me for my particular grief
is of so flood gate and o'erbearing nature
that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
and it is still itself
duke why what's the matter
all dead
brabantio ay to me
she is abused stoln from me and corrupted
by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
for nature so preposterously to err
being not deficient blind or lame of sense
sans witchcraft could not
duke whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
after your own sense yea though our proper son
stood in your action
brabantio humbly i thank your grace
here is the man this moor whom now it seems
your special mandate for the state affairs
hath hither brought
all we are very sorry for't
duke to othello what in your own part can you say to this
othello most potent grave and reverend signiors
my very noble and approved good masters
that i have ta'en away this old mans daughter
it is most true true i have married her
the very head and front of my offending
hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech
and little blest with the soft phrase of peace
for since these arms of mine had seven years' pith
till now some nine moons wasted they have used
and little of this great world can i speak
more than pertains to feats of broil and battle
and therefore little shall i grace my cause
in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience
i will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
what conjuration and what mighty magic
for such proceeding i am charged withal
i won his daughter
of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature
of years of country credit everything
to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on
it is judgement maim'd and most imperfect
that will confess perfection so could err
against all rules of nature and must be driven
to find out practices of cunning hell
why this should be i therefore vouch again
or with some dram conjured to this effect
he wrought upon her
duke to vouch this is no proof
without more certain and more overt test
than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
of modern seeming do prefer against him
first senator but othello speak
did you by indirect and forced courses
subdue and poison this young maid's affections
as soul to soul affordeth
othello i do beseech you
send for the lady to the sagittary
and let her speak of me before her father
if you do find me foul in her report
the trust the office i do hold of you
not only take away but let your sentence
even fall upon my life
duke fetch desdemona hither
exeunt iago and attendants
and till she come as truly as to heaven
i do confess the vices of my blood
so justly to your grave ears i'll present
how i did thrive in this fair lady's love
and she in mine
duke say it othello
othello her father loved me oft invited me
still questiond me the story of my life
that i have pass'd
i ran it through even from my boyish days
to the very moment that he bade me tell it
wherein i spake of most disastrous chances
of moving accidents by flood and field
of hair breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach
of being taken by the insolent foe
and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
and portance in my travels' history
rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
it was my hint to speak such was the process
and of the cannibals that each other eat
the anthropophagi and men whose heads
do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear
would desdemona seriously incline
but still the house affairs would draw her thence
which ever as she could with haste dispatch
she'ld come again and with a greedy ear
took once a pliant hour and found good means
to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
that i would all my pilgrimage dilate
whereof by parcels she had something heard
but not intentively i did consent
and often did beguile her of her tears
when i did speak of some distressful stroke
that my youth suffer'd my story being done
she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
'twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful
she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd
that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me
and bade me if i had a friend that loved her
i should but teach him how to tell my story
and that would woo her upon this hint i spake
she loved me for the dangers i had pass'd
and i loved her that she did pity them
this only is the witchcraft i have used
enter desdemona iago and attendants
duke i think this tale would win my daughter too
good brabantio
take up this mangled matter at the best
men do their broken weapons rather use
than their bare hands
brabantio i pray you hear her speak
if she confess that she was half the wooer
destruction on my head if my bad blame
do you perceive in all this noble company
where most you owe obedience
desdemona my noble father
i do perceive here a divided duty
to you i am bound for life and education
my life and education both do learn me
how to respect you you are the lord of duty
i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband
and so much duty as my mother show'd
so much i challenge that i may profess
due to the moor my lord
brabantio god be with you i have done
please it your grace on to the state affairs
i had rather to adopt a child than get it
come hither moor
i here do give thee that with all my heart
which but thou hast already with all my heart
i would keep from thee for your sake jewel
for thy escape would teach me tyranny
to hang clogs on them i have done my lord
duke let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
which as a grise or step may help these lovers
into your favor
when remedies are past the griefs are ended
by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
is the next way to draw new mischief on
patience her injury a mockery makes
the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief
he robs himself that spends a bootless grief
brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile
we lose it not so long as we can smile
he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
but the free comfort which from thence he hears
but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
being strong on both sides are equivocal
but words are words i never yet did hear
that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
duke the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus
othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and
though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency
yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss
empty
othello the tyrant custom most grave senators
hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
my thrice driven bed of down i do agnize
a natural and prompt alacrity
i find in hardness and do undertake
these present wars against the ottomites
most humbly therefore bending to your state
i crave fit disposition for my wife
with such accommodation and besort
as levels with her breeding
duke if you please
be't at her father's
brabantio i'll not have it so
othello nor i
desdemona nor i i would not there reside
to put my father in impatient thoughts
by being in his eye most gracious duke
and let me find a charter in your voice
to assist my simpleness
duke what would you desdemona
desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him
my downright violence and storm of fortunes
may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued
even to the very quality of my lord
i saw othello's visage in his mind
and to his honors and his valiant parts
so that dear lords if i be left behind
a moth of peace and he go to the war
the rites for which i love him are bereft me
and i a heavy interim shall support
by his dear absence let me go with him
othello let her have your voices
vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not
to please the palate of my appetite
nor to comply with heat the young affects
but to be free and bounteous to her mind
and heaven defend your good souls that you think
i will your serious and great business scant
for she is with me no when light wing'd toys
of feather'd cupid seel with wanton dullness
my speculative and officed instruments
that my disports corrupt and taint my business
let housewives make a skillet of my helm
and all indign and base adversities
duke be it as you shall privately determine
either for her stay or going the affair cries haste
and speed must answer't you must hence tonight
desdemona tonight my lord
duke this night
othello with all my heart
duke at nine i' the morning here we'll meet again
othello leave some officer behind
and he shall our commission bring to you
as doth import you
othello so please your grace my ancient
a man he is of honesty and trust
to his conveyance i assign my wife
with what else needful your good grace shall think
to be sent after me
duke let it be so
good night to everyone to brabantio and noble signior
if virtue no delighted beauty lack
first senator adieu brave moor use desdemona well
brabantio look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see
she has deceived her father and may thee
exeunt duke senators and officers
othello my life upon her faith honest iago
my desdemona must i leave to thee
i prithee let thy wife attend on her
and bring them after in the best advantage
come desdemona i have but an hour
to spend with thee we must obey the time
exeunt othello and desdemona
roderigo iago
iago what say'st thou noble heart
roderigo what will i do thinkest thou
iago why go to bed and sleep
roderigo i will incontinently drown myself
iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after
why thou silly gentleman
have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
iago o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times
seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i
would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i
would change my humanity with a baboon
roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond
but it is not in my virtue to amend it
iago virtue a fig 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus
that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed
up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with
industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of
reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of
our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions
but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings
our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to
roderigo it cannot be
iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind
puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to
thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never
better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou
the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard i say put
money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long
continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his
answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors
are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the
food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him
shortly as acerb as the coloquintida she must change for youth
when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her
choice she must have change she must therefore put money in
thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate
way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony
and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle
thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning
thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be
hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without
empty
roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue
iago thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often
and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is
hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our
revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself
which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will
have more of this tomorrow adieu
roderigo where shall we meet i' the morning
iago at my lodging
roderigo i'll be with thee betimes
iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo
roderigo what say you
iago no more of drowning do you hear
roderigo i am changed i'll go sell all my land exit
for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane
if i would time expend with such a snipe
but for my sport and profit i hate the moor
and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
he has done my office i know not if't be true
but i for mere suspicion in that kind
will do as if for surety he holds me well
the better shall my purpose work on him
cassio's a proper man let me see now
in double knavery how how let's see
after some time to abuse othello's ear
that he is too familiar with his wife
he hath a person and a smooth dispose
to be suspected framed to make women false
the moor is of a free and open nature
that thinks men honest that but seem to be so
and will as tenderly be led by the nose
as asses are
must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
empty
act ii scene i
a seaport in cyprus an open place near the quay
enter montano and two gentlemen
montano what from the cape can you discern at sea
first gentleman nothing at all it is a high wrought flood
i cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main
descry a sail
a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
if it hath ruffiand so upon the sea
what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this
second gentleman a segregation of the turkish fleet
for do but stand upon the foaming shore
the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
the wind shaked surge with high and monstrous mane
seems to cast water on the burning bear
i never did like molestation view
on the enchafed flood
montano if that the turkish fleet
be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drownd
it is impossible to bear it out
enter a third gentleman
third gentleman news lads our wars are done
the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the turks
that their designment halts a noble ship of venice
on most part of their fleet
montano how is this true
third gentleman the ship is here put in
a veronesa michael cassio
lieutenant to the warlike moor othello
is come on shore the moor himself at sea
and is in full commission here for cyprus
montano i am glad ont 'tis a worthy governor
third gentleman but this same cassio though he speak of comfort
and prays the moor be safe for they were parted
with foul and violent tempest
montano pray heavens he be
for i have served him and the man commands
like a full soldier let's to the seaside ho
as well to see the vessel that's come in
as to throw out our eyes for brave othello
even till we make the main and the aerial blue
an indistinct regard
for every minute is expectancy
of more arrivance
enter cassio
cassio thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
that so approve the moor o let the heavens
give him defense against the elements
for i have lost him on a dangerous sea
montano i she well shipp'd
cassio his bark is stoutly timber'd and his pilot
therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
stand in bold cure
a cry within a sail a sail a sail
enter a fourth gentleman
what noise
fourth gentleman the town is empty on the brow o' the sea
stand ranks of people and they cry a sail
cassio my hopes do shape him for the governor
guns heard
our friends at least
cassio i pray you sir go forth
and give us truth who 'tis that is arrived
second gentleman i shall exit
montano but good lieutenant is your general wived
cassio most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
that paragons description and wild fame
one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
and in the essential vesture of creation
re enter second gentleman
how now who has put in
second gentleman 'tis one iago ancient to the general
cassio he has had most favorable and happy speed
tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands
traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel
as having sense of beauty do omit
their mortal natures letting go safely by
montano what is she
cassio she that i spake of our great captains captain
left in the conduct of the bold iago
whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
a se'nnight's speed great jove othello guard
and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
that he may bless this bay with his tall ship
make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms
give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
enter desdemona emilia iago roderigo and attendants
o behold
the riches of the ship is come on shore
ye men of cyprus let her have your knees
hall to thee lady and the grace of heaven
before behind thee and on every hand
enwheel thee round
desdemona i thank you valiant cassio
what tidings can you tell me of my lord
but that he's well and will be shortly here
desdemona o but i fear how lost you company
cassio the great contention of the sea and skies
parted our fellowship but hark a sail
a cry within a sail a sail guns heard
second gentleman they give their greeting to the citadel
this likewise is a friend
cassio see for the news
exit gentleman
let it not gall your patience good iago
that i extend my manners 'tis my breeding
that gives me this bold show of courtesy kisses her
iago sir would she give you so much of her lips
as of her tongue she oft bestows on me
you'ld have enough
desdemona alas she has no speech
iago in faith too much
i find it still when i have list to sleep
she puts her tongue a little in her heart
and chides with thinking
emilia you have little cause to say so
iago come on come on you are pictures out of doors
bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
saints in your injuries devils being offended
players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
desdemona o fie upon thee slanderer
iago nay it is true or else i am a turk
emilia you shall not write my praise
iago no let me not
desdemona what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
praise me
iago o gentle lady do not put me to't
for i am nothing if not critical
desdemona come on assay there's one gone to the harbor
iago ay madam
desdemona i am not merry but i do beguile
come how wouldst thou praise me
iago i am about it but indeed my invention
comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze
it plucks out brains and all but my muse labors
and thus she is deliver'd
if she be fair and wise fairness and wit
the one's for use the other useth it
desdemona well praised how if she be black and witty
iago if she be black and thereto have a wit
desdemona worse and worse
emilia how if fair and foolish
iago she never yet was foolish that was fair
for even her folly help'd her to an heir
desdemona these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and
empty
iago there's none so foul and foolish thereunto
but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that
in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very
malice itself
iago she that was ever fair and never proud
had tongue at will and yet was never loud
never lack'd gold and yet went never gay
fled from her wish and yet said now i may
she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh
bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
to change the cod's head for the salmons tail
she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
see suitors following and not look behind
she was a wight if ever such wight were
desdemona to do what
iago to suckle fools and chronicle small beer
desdemona o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him
emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not
a most profane and liberal counselor
soldier than in the scholar
iago aside he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper
with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as
cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own
courtship you say true 'tis so indeed if such tricks as these
strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had
not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are
most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent
courtesy 'tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips
the moor i know his trumpet
cassio 'tis truly so
desdemona let's meet him and receive him
cassio lo where he comes
enter othello and attendants
othello o my fair warrior
desdemona my dear othello
othello it gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me o my souls joy
may the winds blow till they have wakend death
and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
olympus high and duck again as low
as hells from heaven if it were now to die
'twere now to be most happy for i fear
my soul hath her content so absolute
that not another comfort like to this
succeeds in unknown fate
desdemona the heavens forbid
even as our days do grow
othello amen to that sweet powers
i cannot speak enough of this content
it stops me here it is too much of joy
and this and this the greatest discords be kisses her
that e'er our hearts shall make
iago aside o you are well tuned now
but i'll set down the pegs that make this music
as honest as i am
news friends our wars are done the turks are drownd
how does my old acquaintance of this isle
honey you shall be well desired in cyprus
i have found great love amongst them o my sweet
i prattle out of fashion and i dote
in mine own comforts i prithee good iago
go to the bay and disembark my coffers
bring thou the master to the citadel
he is a good one and his worthiness
once more well met at cyprus
exeunt all but iago and roderigo
iago do thou meet me presently at the harbor come hither if thou
be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a
nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i
must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him
roderigo with him why 'tis not possible
iago lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me
telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for
prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be
fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when
the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be
again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite
loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties
all which the moor is defective in now for want of these
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor
choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and
unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this
fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present
itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young
look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found
him already
roderigo i cannot believe that in her she's full of most blest
empty
iago blest fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if
she had been blest she would never have loved the moor blest
pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
didst not mark that
roderigo yes that i did but that was but courtesy
history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their
lips that their breaths embraced together villainous thoughts
roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand
comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion
pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from
venice watch you tonight for the command i'll lay't upon you
cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some
occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course you please
roderigo well
iago sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may
strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that
will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall
come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means
i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most
profitably removed without the which there were no expectation
of our prosperity
iago i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must
fetch his necessaries ashore farewell
roderigo adieu exit
iago that cassio loves her i do well believe it
that she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit
the moor howbeit that i endure him not
is of a constant loving noble nature
and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona
a most dear husband now i do love her too
i stand accountant for as great a sin
but partly led to diet my revenge
for that i do suspect the lusty moor
hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof
doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
and nothing can or shall content my soul
till i am evend with him wife for wife
or failing so yet that i put the moor
at least into a jealousy so strong
if this poor trash of venice whom i trace
for his quick hunting stand the putting on
i'll have our michael cassio on the hip
abuse him to the moor in the rank garb
for i fear cassio with my nightcap too
make the moor thank me love me and reward me
for making him egregiously an ass
and practicing upon his peace and quiet
even to madness 'tis here but yet confused
scene ii
a street
enter a herald with a proclamation people following
herald it is othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general
that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere
perdition of the turkish fleet every man put himself into
triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what
sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these
beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial so much
there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven heaven bless the isle of cyprus
and our noble general othello exeunt
scene iii
a hall in the castle
enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants
othello good michael look you to the guard tonight
let's teach ourselves that honorable stop
not to outsport discretion
but notwithstanding with my personal eye
will i look to't
othello iago is most honest
michael good night tomorrow with your earliest
let me have speech with you come my dear love
the purchase made the fruits are to ensue
that profit's yet to come 'tween me and you
good night
exeunt othello desdemona and attendants
cassio welcome iago we must to the watch
iago not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' the clock our
general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let
us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night
with her and she is sport for jove
cassio she's a most exquisite lady
iago and i'll warrant her full of game
cassio indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature
iago what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to
cassio an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
iago and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
cassio she is indeed perfection
iago well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a
stope of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants
that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello
cassio not tonight good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains
for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other
custom of entertainment
cassio i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily
qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am
unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with
any more
iago what man 'tis a night of revels the gallants desire it
cassio where are they
iago here at the door i pray you call them in
cassio i'll do't but it dislikes me exit
iago if i can fasten but one cup upon him
he'll be as full of quarrel and offense
as my young mistress' dog now my sick fool roderigo
whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out
to desdemona hath tonight caroused
potations pottle deep and he's to watch
three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits
that hold their honors in a wary distance
the very elements of this warlike isle
have i tonight fluster'd with flowing cups
am i to put our cassio in some action
that may offend the isle but here they come
if consequence do but approve my dream
my boat sails freely both with wind and stream
re enter cassio with him montano and gentlemen
servants following with wine
cassio 'fore god they have given me a rouse already
montano good faith a little one not past a pint as i am a
empty
sings and let me the canakin clink clink
and let me the canakin clink
a soldier's a man
o mans life's but a span
why then let a soldier drink
some wine boys
cassio 'fore god an excellent song
iago i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in
potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander
cassio is your englishman so expert in his drinking
iago why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he
sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a
vomit ere the next pottle can be filled
cassio to the health of our general
montano i am for it lieutenant and i'll do you justice
iago o sweet england
sings king stephen was and a worthy peer
his breeches cost him but a crown
with that he calld the tailor lown
he was a wight of high renown
and thou art but of low degree
'tis pride that pulls the country down
then take thine auld cloak about thee
some wine ho
cassio why this is a more exquisite song than the other
iago will you hear't again
cassio no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
saved and there be souls must not be saved
iago it's true good lieutenant
cassio for mine own part no offense to the general nor any man
of quality i hope to be saved
iago and so do i too lieutenant
cassio ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to
be saved before the ancient let's have no more of this let's to
our affairs god forgive us our sins gentlemen let's look to
our business do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my
drunk now i can stand well enough and i speak well enough
all excellent well
cassio why very well then you must not think then that i am
drunk exit
montano to the platform masters come let's set the watch
iago you see this fellow that is gone before
he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar
and give direction and do but see his vice
'tis to his virtue a just equinox
i fear the trust othello puts him in
on some odd time of his infirmity
will shake this island
montano but is he often thus
iago 'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
he'll watch the horologe a double set
if drink rock not his cradle
montano it were well
the general were put in mind of it
prizes the virtue that appears in cassio
and looks not on his evils is not this true
enter roderigo
iago aside to him how now roderigo
i pray you after the lieutenant go exit roderigo
montano and 'tis great pity that the noble moor
should hazard such a place as his own second
with one of an ingraft infirmity
it were an honest action to say
iago not i for this fair island
i do love cassio well and would do much
to cure him of this evil but hark what noise
a cry within help help
re enter cassio driving in roderigo
cassio 'zounds you rogue you rascal
montano what's the matter lieutenant
cassio a knave teach me my duty but i'll beat the knave into a
twiggen bottle
cassio dost thou prate rogue strikes roderigo
montano nay good lieutenant i pray you sir hold your hand
cassio let me go sir or i'll knock you o'er the mazzard
montano come come you're drunk
cassio drunk they fight
iago aside to roderigo away i say go out and cry a mutiny
exit roderigo
nay good lieutenant god's will gentlemen
help ho lieutenant sir montano sir
a bell rings
who's that that rings the bell diablo ho
the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold
you will be shamed forever
re enter othello and attendants
othello what is the matter here
montano 'zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death
empty
othello hold for your lives
have you forgot all place of sense and duty
hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
othello why how now ho from whence ariseth this
are we turnd turks and to ourselves do that
which heaven hath forbid the ottomites
for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
he that stirs next to carve for his own rage
holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
honest iago that look'st dead with grieving
speak who began this on thy love i charge thee
iago i do not know friends all but now even now
in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
devesting them for bed and then but now
as if some planet had unwitted men
swords out and tilting one at other's breast
in opposition bloody i cannot speak
any beginning to this peevish odds
those legs that brought me to a part of it
othello how comes it michael you are thus forgot
cassio i pray you pardon me i cannot speak
othello worthy montano you were wont be civil
the gravity and stillness of your youth
the world hath noted and your name is great
in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter
that you unlace your reputation thus
and spend your rich opinion for the name
montano worthy othello i am hurt to danger
your officer iago can inform you
while i spare speech which something now offends me
of all that i do know nor know i aught
by me that's said or done amiss this night
unless self charity be sometimes a vice
and to defend ourselves it be a sin
when violence assails us
othello now by heaven
and passion having my best judgement collied
assays to lead the way if i once stir
or do but lift this arm the best of you
shall sink in my rebuke give me to know
how this foul rout began who set it on
and he that is approved in this offense
though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
shall lose me what in a town of war
yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear
in night and on the court and guard of safety
'tis monstrous iago who begant
montano if partially affined or leagued in office
thou dost deliver more or less than truth
thou art no soldier
iago touch me not so near
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
than it should do offense to michael cassio
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth
montano and myself being in speech
there comes a fellow crying out for help
and cassio following him with determined sword
to execute upon him sir this gentleman
steps in to cassio and entreats his pause
myself the crying fellow did pursue
lest by his clamor as it so fell out
the town might fall in fright he swift of foot
outran my purpose and i returnd the rather
and cassio high in oath which till tonight
i ne'er might say before when i came back
for this was brief i found them close together
at blow and thrust even as again they were
when you yourself did part them
more of this matter cannot i report
but men are men the best sometimes forget
though cassio did some little wrong to him
as men in rage strike those that wish them best
from him that fled some strange indignity
which patience could not pass
othello i know iago
thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
making it light to cassio cassio i love thee
but never more be officer of mine
re enter desdemona attended
look if my gentle love be not raised up
i'll make thee an example
othello alls well now sweeting come away to bed
sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
lead him off exit montano attended
iago look with care about the town
and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
come desdemona 'tis the soldiers' life
to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
exeunt all but iago and cassio
iago what are you hurt lieutenant
iago marry heaven forbid
cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my
reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what
remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation
iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily
wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation
is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and
lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all
unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are
mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one
would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue
to him again and he's yours
cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an
officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear
and discourse fustian with one's own shadow o thou invisible
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call
thee devil
what had he done to you
cassio i know not
iago is't possible
cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a
quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an
enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should
with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves
into beasts
iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus
cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me
frankly despise myself
iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place
and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish
this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your
own good
cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a
drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would
presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblest
and the ingredient is a devil
iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be
well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i
think you think i love you
cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk
iago you or any man living may be drunk at some time man i'll
tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the
general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted
of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her
importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so
free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a
vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this
broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter
and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your
love shall grow stronger than it was before
cassio you advise me well
iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my
fortunes if they check me here
iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the
empty
cassio good night honest iago exit
iago and what's he then that says i play the villain
when this advice is free i give and honest
probal to thinking and indeed the course
to win the moor again for 'tis most easy
in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful
as the free elements and then for her
to win the moor were't to renounce his baptism
all seals and symbols of redeemed sin
his soul is so enfetter'd to her love
that she may make unmake do what she list
even as her appetite shall play the god
with his weak function how am i then a villain
to counsel cassio to this parallel course
when devils will the blackest sins put on
they do suggest at first with heavenly shows
as i do now for whiles this honest fool
plies desdemona to repair his fortune
and she for him pleads strongly to the moor
i'll pour this pestilence into his ear
that she repeals him for her body's lust
and by how much she strives to do him good
she shall undo her credit with the moor
and out of her own goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all
enter roderigo
how now roderigo
roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i
have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and i think the
issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and
so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to
iago how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
and wit depends on dilatory time

and thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd cassio
though other things grow fair against the sun

out of the way that your converse and business
may be more free
cassio i humbly thank you for't exit iago i never knew
a florentine more kind and honest
enter emilia
emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry
the general and his wife are talking of it
and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies
that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus
and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
and needs no other suitor but his likings
to take the safest occasion by the front
to bring you in again
cassio yet i beseech you
give me advantage of some brief discourse
with desdemona alone
emilia pray you come in
i will bestow you where you shall have time
to speak your bosom freely
cassio i am much bound to you

scene ii
a room in the castle
othello these letters give iago to the pilot
and by him do my duties to the senate
that done i will be walking on the works
repair there to me
iago well my good lord i'll do't
othello this fortification gentlemen shall we see't
gentlemen we'll wait upon your lordship exeunt
scene iii
the garden of the castle
desdemona be thou assured good cassio i will do
all my abilities in thy behalf
emilia good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband
as if the cause were his
desdemona o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio
but i will have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were
cassio bounteous madam
whatever shall become of michael cassio
desdemona i know't i thank you you do love my lord
you have known him long and be you well assured
he shall in strangeness stand no farther off
than in a politic distance
cassio ay but lady
that policy may either last so long
or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
or breed itself so out of circumstances
that i being absent and my place supplied
desdemona do not doubt that before emilia here
i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it
to the last article my lord shall never rest
i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
i'll intermingle everything he does
with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio
for thy solicitor shall rather die
enter othello and iago at a distance
emilia madam here comes my lord
cassio madam i'll take my leave
desdemona nay stay and hear me speak
cassio madam not now i am very ill at ease
unfit for mine own purposes
desdemona well do your discretion exit cassio
iago ha i like not that
othello what dost thou say
othello was not that cassio parted from my wife
iago cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it
that he would steal away so guilty like
seeing you coming
othello i do believe 'twas he
desdemona how now my lord
i have been talking with a suitor here
a man that languishes in your displeasure
othello who is't you mean
if i have any grace or power to move you
his present reconciliation take
for if he be not one that truly loves you
that errs in ignorance and not in cunning
i have no judgement in an honest face
i prithee call him back
othello went he hence now
desdemona ay sooth so humbled
that he hath left part of his grief with me
othello not now sweet desdemona some other time
desdemona but shallt be shortly
othello the sooner sweet for you
desdemona shallt be tonight at supper
othello no not tonight
desdemona tomorrow dinner then
othello i shall not dine at home
i meet the captains at the citadel
desdemona why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn
i prithee name the time but let it not
exceed three days in faith he's penitent
and yet his trespass in our common reason
save that they say the wars must make example
out of their best is not almost a fault
to incur a private check when shall he come
tell me othello i wonder in my soul
what you would ask me that i should deny
or stand so mammering on what michael cassio
when i have spoke of you dispraisingly
hath ta'en your part to have so much to do
to bring him in trust me i could do much
othello prithee no more let him come when he will
i will deny thee nothing
desdemona why this is not a boon
'tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves
or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
wherein i mean to touch your love indeed
it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
and fearful to be granted
othello i will deny thee nothing
whereon i do beseech thee grant me this
to leave me but a little to myself
desdemona shall i deny you no farewell my lord
othello farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight
desdemona emilia come be as your fancies teach you
exeunt desdemona and emilia
othello excellent wretch perdition catch my soul
but i do love thee and when i love thee not
chaos is come again
iago my noble lord
othello what dost thou say iago
iago did michael cassio when you woo'd my lady
know of your love
othello he did from first to last why dost thou ask
no further harm
othello why of thy thought iago
iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her
othello o yes and went between us very oft
iago indeed
othello indeed ay indeed discernst thou aught in that
is he not honest
iago honest my lord
othello honest ay honest
othello what dost thou think
iago think my lord
othello think my lord by heaven he echoes me
as if there were some monster in his thought
too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something
i heard thee say even now thou like'st not that
when cassio left my wife what didst not like
and when i told thee he was of my counsel
in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed
as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
some horrible conceit if thou dost love me
show me thy thought
iago my lord you know i love you
othello i think thou dost
and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty
and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath
therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
for such things in a false disloyal knave
they're close dilations working from the heart
that passion cannot rule
iago for michael cassio
i dare be sworn i think that he is honest
othello i think so too
iago men should be what they seem
or those that be not would they might seem none
othello certain men should be what they seem
iago why then i think cassio's an honest man
i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words
iago good my lord pardon me
though i am bound to every act of duty
i am not bound to that all slaves are free to
utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false
as where's that palace whereinto foul things
sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
keep leets and law days and in session sit
with meditations lawful
othello thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
if thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
a stranger to thy thoughts
iago i do beseech you
though i perchance am vicious in my guess
as i confess it is my nature's plague
to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
from one that so imperfectly conceits
would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
out of his scattering and unsure observance
it were not for your quiet nor your good
nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
to let you know my thoughts
othello what dost thou mean
iago good name in man and woman dear my lord
is the immediate jewel of their souls
'twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands
but he that filches from me my good name
robs me of that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed
othello by heaven i'll know thy thoughts
iago you cannot if my heart were in your hand
nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody
othello ha
iago o beware my lord of jealousy
the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
but o what damned minutes tells he o'er
who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
othello o misery
iago poor and content is rich and rich enough
but riches fineless is as poor as winter
to him that ever fears he shall be poor
good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
othello why why is this
think'st thou i'ld make a life of jealousy
to follow still the changes of the moon
with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt
is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat
when i shall turn the business of my soul
to such exsufflicate and blown surmises
matching thy inference 'tis not to make me jealous
to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
where virtue is these are more virtuous
nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
for she had eyes and chose me no iago
i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove
and on the proof there is no more but this
away at once with love or jealousy
iago i am glad of it for now i shall have reason
to show the love and duty that i bear you
receive it from me i speak not yet of proof
look to your wife observe her well with cassio
wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
i would not have your free and noble nature
out of self bounty be abused look to't
i know our country disposition well
in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown
iago she did deceive her father marrying you
and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks
she loved them most
othello and so she did
iago why go to then
she that so young could give out such a seeming
to seel her father's eyes up close as oak
he thought 'twas witchcraft but i am much to blame
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
othello i am bound to thee forever
iago i see this hath a little dash'd your spirits
othello not a jot not a jot
iago i'faith i fear it has
i hope you will consider what is spoke
comes from my love but i do see you're moved
i am to pray you not to strain my speech
to grosser issues nor to larger reach
than to suspicion
iago should you do so my lord
my speech should fall into such vile success
which my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend
my lord i see you're moved
othello no not much moved
i do not think but desdemona's honest
iago long live she so and long live you to think so
othello and yet how nature erring from itself
iago ay there's the point as to be bold with you
of her own clime complexion and degree
whereto we see in all things nature tends
foh one may smell in such a will most rank
foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
but pardon me i do not in position
distinctly speak of her though i may fear
her will recoiling to her better judgement
may fall to match you with her country forms
and happily repent
if more thou dost perceive let me know more
set on thy wife to observe leave me iago
iago going my lord i take my leave
othello why did i marry this honest creature doubtless
sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
iago returning my lord i would i might entreat your honor
to scan this thing no further leave it to time
though it be fit that cassio have his place
for sure he fills it up with great ability
you shall by that perceive him and his means
note if your lady strain his entertainment
with any strong or vehement importunity
much will be seen in that in the meantime
let me be thought too busy in my fears
as worthy cause i have to fear i am
and hold her free i do beseech your honor
othello fear not my government
iago i once more take my leave exit
and knows all qualities with a learned spirit
of human dealings if i do prove her haggard
though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
to prey at fortune haply for i am black
and have not those soft parts of conversation
that chamberers have or for i am declined
into the vale of years yet that's not much
she's gone i am abused and my relief
that we can call these delicate creatures ours
and not their appetites i had rather be a toad
and live upon the vapor of a dungeon
than keep a corner in the thing i love
for others' uses yet 'tis the plague of great ones
prerogatived are they less than the base
'tis destiny unshunnable like death
even then this forked plague is fated to us
when we do quicken desdemona comes
if she be false o then heaven mocks itself
i'll not believe't
desdemona how now my dear othello
your dinner and the generous islanders
by you invited do attend your presence
othello i am to blame
desdemona why do you speak so faintly
are you not well
othello i have a pain upon my forehead here
let me but bind it hard within this hour
it will be well
othello your napkin is too little
he puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it
let it alone come i'll go in with you
desdemona i am very sorry that you are not well
exeunt othello and desdemona
emilia i am glad i have found this napkin
this was her first remembrance from the moor
woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token
for he conjured her she should ever keep it
that she reserves it evermore about her
to kiss and talk to i'll have the work ta'en out
and give't iago what he will do with it
heaven knows not i
i nothing but to please his fantasy
re enter iago
iago how now what do you here alone
iago a thing for me it is a common thing
emilia ha
iago to have a foolish wife
emilia o is that all what will you give me now
for that same handkerchief
iago what handkerchief
emilia what handkerchief
why that the moor first gave to desdemona
that which so often you did bid me steal
emilia no faith she let it drop by negligence
and to the advantage i being here took't up
look here it is
iago a good wench give it me
emilia what will you do with't that you have been so earnest
to have me filch it
iago snatching it why what is that to you
emilia if't be not for some purpose of import
give't me again poor lady she'll run mad
iago be not acknown ont i have use for it
go leave me exit emilia
i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin
and let him find it trifles light as air
are to the jealous confirmations strong
as proofs of holy writ this may do something
the moor already changes with my poison
dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
which at the first are scarce found to distaste
burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so
look where he comes
re enter othello
not poppy nor mandragora
nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
which thou owedst yesterday
othello ha ha false to me
iago why how now general no more of that
i swear 'tis better to be much abused
than but to know't a little
iago how now my lord
othello what sense had i of her stoln hours of lust
i saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me
i slept the next night well was free and merry
i found not cassio's kisses on her lips
he that is robb'd not wanting what is stoln
let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all
othello i had been happy if the general camp
pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
so i had nothing known o now forever
farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
that make ambition virtue o farewell
farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
the spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife
the royal banner and all quality
and o you mortal engines whose rude throats
the immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit
farewell othello's occupations gone
iago is't possible my lord
othello villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
be sure of it give me the ocular proof
or by the worth of mans eternal soul
thou hadst been better have been born a dog
than answer my waked wrath
othello make me to see't or at the least so prove it
that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
iago my noble lord
othello if thou dost slander her and torture me
never pray more abandon all remorse
on horror's head horrors accumulate
do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
for nothing canst thou to damnation add
iago o grace o heaven defend me
are you a man have you a soul or sense
god be wi' you take mine office o wretched fool
that livest to make thine honesty a vice
o monstrous world take note take note o world
to be direct and honest is not safe
i thank you for this profit and from hence
i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense
othello nay stay thou shouldst be honest
and loses that it works for
othello by the world
i think my wife be honest and think she is not
i think that thou art just and think thou art not
i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh
as dians visage is now begrimed and black
as mine own face if there be cords or knives
poison or fire or suffocating streams
i'll not endure it would i were satisfied
i do repent me that i put it to you
you would be satisfied
othello would nay i will
iago and may but how how satisfied my lord
would you the supervisor grossly gape on
behold her topp'd
othello death and damnation o
iago it were a tedious difficulty i think
to bring them to that prospect damn them then
more than their own what then how then
what shall i say where's satisfaction
it is impossible you should see this
were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
as ignorance made drunk but yet i say
if imputation and strong circumstances
which lead directly to the door of truth
will give you satisfaction you may have't
iago i do not like the office
but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far
prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love
i will go on i lay with cassio lately
and being troubled with a raging tooth
i could not sleep
there are a kind of men so loose of soul
that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
one of this kind is cassio
let us be wary let us hide our loves
and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard
as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
that grew upon my lips then laid his leg
over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then
cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor
othello o monstrous monstrous
iago nay this was but his dream
'tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
iago and this may help to thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly
othello i'll tear her all to pieces
iago nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
she may be honest yet tell me but this
have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand
othello i gave her such a one 'twas my first gift
i am sure it was your wife's did i today
see cassio wipe his beard with
othello if it be that
iago if it be that or any that was hers
it speaks against her with the other proofs
othello o that the slave had forty thousand lives
one is too poor too weak for my revenge
now do i see 'tis true look here iago
all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven
arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell
yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne
to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught
for 'tis of aspics' tongues
iago yet be content
othello o blood blood blood
iago patience i say your mind perhaps may change
othello never iago like to the pontic sea
whose icy current and compulsive course
to the propontic and the hellespont
even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love
till that a capable and wide revenge
swallow them up now by yond marble heaven
in the due reverence of a sacred vow kneels
i here engage my words
iago do not rise yet kneels
witness you ever burning lights above
witness that here iago doth give up
the execution of his wit hands heart
to wrong'd othello's service let him command
and to obey shall be in me remorse
what bloody business ever they rise
othello i greet thy love
not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
and will upon the instant put thee to't
within these three days let me hear thee say
iago my friend is dead 'tis done at your request
but let her live
othello damn her lewd minx o damn her
come go with me apart i will withdraw
to furnish me with some swift means of death
for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant
iago i am your own forever exeunt
scene iv
before the castle
desdemona do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies
clown i dare not say he lies anywhere
desdemona why man
clown he's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is
empty
desdemona go to where lodges he
clown to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie
desdemona can anything be made of this
clown i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging
empty
desdemona can you inquire him out and be edified by report
clown i will catechize the world for him that is make questions
and by them answer
desdemona seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my
lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
clown to do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore
i will attempt the doing it exit
desdemona where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
desdemona believe me i had rather have lost my purse
full of crusadoes and but my noble moor
is true of mind and made of no such baseness
as jealous creatures are it were enough
to put him to ill thinking
emilia is he not jealous
desdemona who he i think the sun where he was born
drew all such humors from him
emilia look where he comes
be calld to him
enter othello
how is't with you my lord
othello well my good lady aside o hardness to dissemble
how do you desdemona
desdemona well my good lord
othello give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
desdemona it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow
othello this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
much castigation exercise devout
for here's a young and sweating devil here
that commonly rebels 'tis a good hand
a frank one
desdemona you may indeed say so
for 'twas that hand that gave away my heart
othello a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
but our new heraldry is hands not hearts
othello what promise chuck
desdemona i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
othello i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
lend me thy handkerchief
desdemona here my lord
othello that which i gave you
desdemona i have it not about me
othello not
desdemona no faith my lord
did an egyptian to my mother give
she was a charmer and could almost read
the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it
'twould make her amiable and subdue my father
entirely to her love but if she lost it
or made a gift of it my father's eye
should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies she dying gave it me
and bid me when my fate would have me wive
make it a darling like your precious eye
to lose't or give't away were such perdition
as nothing else could match
desdemona is't possible
othello 'tis true there's magic in the web of it
a sibyl that had number'd in the world
the sun to course two hundred compasses
in her prophetic fury sew'd the work
the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk
conserved of maidens hearts
desdemona indeed is't true
othello most veritable therefore look to't well
desdemona then would to god that i had never seent
othello ha wherefore
desdemona why do you speak so startingly and rash
othello is't lost is't gone speak is it out o' the way
desdemona heaven bless us
othello say you
othello how
desdemona i say it is not lost
othello fetch't let me see it
desdemona why so i can sir but i will not now
this is a trick to put me from my suit
pray you let cassio be received again
othello fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
desdemona come come
you'll never meet a more sufficient man
desdemona i pray talk me of cassio
othello the handkerchief
desdemona a man that all his time
hath founded his good fortunes on your love
shared dangers with you
othello the handkerchief
desdemona in sooth you are to blame
othello away exit
emilia is not this man jealous
sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief
i am most unhappy in the loss of it
emilia 'tis not a year or two shows us a man
they are all but stomachs and we all but food
they eat us hungerly and when they are full
they belch us look you cassio and my husband
enter cassio and iago
iago there is no other way 'tis she must do't
and lo the happiness go and importune her
cassio madam my former suit i do beseech you
that by your virtuous means i may again
exist and be a member of his love
whom i with all the office of my heart
entirely honor i would not be delay'd
if my offense be of such mortal kind
that nor my service past nor present sorrows
nor purposed merit in futurity
can ransom me into his love again
so shall i clothe me in a forced content
and shut myself up in some other course
to fortune's alms
desdemona alas thrice gentle cassio
my advocation is not now in tune
my lord is not my lord nor should i know him
were he in favor as in humor alter'd
so help me every spirit sanctified
as i have spoken for you all my best
for my free speech you must awhile be patient
what i can do i will and more i will
than for myself i dare let that suffice you
iago is my lord angry
emilia he went hence but now
and certainly in strange unquietness
iago can he be angry i have seen the cannon
when it hath blown his ranks into the air
and like the devil from his very arm
something of moment then i will go meet him
there's matter int indeed if he be angry
desdemona i prithee do so exit iago
something sure of state
either from venice or some unhatch'd practice
made demonstrable here in cyprus to him
hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
mens natures wrangle with inferior things
though great ones are their object 'tis even so
our other healthful members even to that sense
of pain nay we must think men are not gods
nor of them look for such observancy
as fits the bridal beshrew me much emilia
i was unhandsome warrior as i am
arraigning his unkindness with my soul
but now i find i had subornd the witness
and he's indicted falsely
emilia pray heaven it be state matters as you think
concerning you
desdemona alas the day i never gave him cause
emilia but jealous souls will not be answer'd so
they are not ever jealous for the cause
but jealous for they are jealous 'tis a monster
begot upon itself born on itself
desdemona heaven keep that monster from othello's mind
emilia lady amen
desdemona i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout
and seek to effect it to my uttermost
cassio i humbly thank your ladyship
exeunt desdemona and emilia
enter bianca
bianca save you friend cassio
cassio what make you from home
how is it with you my most fair bianca
i'faith sweet love i was coming to your house
bianca and i was going to your lodging cassio
eight score eight hours and lovers' absent hours
more tedious than the dial eight score times
o weary reckoning
cassio pardon me bianca
i have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd
but i shall in a more continuate time
strike off this score of absence sweet bianca
gives her desdemona's handkerchief
take me this work out
this is some token from a newer friend
to the felt absence now i feel a cause
is't come to this well well
cassio go to woman
throw your vile guesses in the devils teeth
from whence you have them you are jealous now
that this is from some mistress some remembrance
no by my faith bianca
bianca why whose is it
i like the work well ere it be demanded
as like enough it will i'ld have it copied
take it and do't and leave me for this time
bianca leave you wherefore
cassio i do attend here on the general
and think it no addition nor my wish
to have him see me womand
bianca why i pray you
cassio not that i love you not
i pray you bring me on the way a little
and say if i shall see you soon at night

act iv scene i
cyprus before the castle
enter othello and iago
iago will you think so
iago what
to kiss in private
othello an unauthorized kiss
iago or to be naked with her friend in bed
an hour or more not meaning any harm
othello naked in bed iago and not mean harm
it is hypocrisy against the devil
they that mean virtuously and yet do so
the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
but if i give my wife a handkerchief
othello what then
iago why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers
she may i think bestow't on any man
othello she is protectress of her honor too
may she give that
iago her honor is an essence that's not seen
they have it very oft that have it not
but for the handkerchief
thou said'st o it comes o'er my memory
as doth the raven o'er the infected house
boding to all he had my handkerchief
iago ay what of that
othello that's not so good now
iago what
if i had said i had seen him do you wrong
or heard him say as knaves be such abroad
who having by their own importunate suit
convinced or supplied them cannot choose
but they must blab
othello hath he said anything
iago he hath my lord but be you well assured
no more than he'll unswear
othello what hath he said
iago faith that he did i know not what he did
othello what what
iago lie
iago with her on her what you will
othello lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when they
belie her lie with her 'zounds that's fulsome handkerchief
confessions handkerchief to confess and be hanged for his labor
first to be hanged and then to confess i tremble at it
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without
some instruction it is not words that shakes me thus pish
noses ears and lips is't possible confess handkerchief o
empty
iago work on
my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught
and many worthy and chaste dames even thus
all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord

how now cassio
cassio what's the matter
iago my lord is falln into an epilepsy
cassio rub him about the temples
iago no forbear
the lethargy must have his quiet course
if not he foams at mouth and by and by
breaks out to savage madness look he stirs
do you withdraw yourself a little while
he will recover straight when he is gone
i would on great occasion speak with you exit cassio
how is it general have you not hurt your head
iago i mock you no by heaven
would you would bear your fortune like a man
othello a horned mans a monster and a beast
iago there's many a beast then in a populous city
and many a civil monster
othello did he confess it
iago good sir be a man
think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
may draw with you there's millions now alive
which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
o 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock
to lip a wanton in a secure couch
and to suppose her chaste no let me know
and knowing what i am i know what she shall be
othello o thou art wise 'tis certain
iago stand you awhile apart
confine yourself but in a patient list
whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief
cassio came hither i shifted him away
and laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy
bade him anon return and here speak with me
the which he promised do but encave yourself
and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
that dwell in every region of his face
for i will make him tell the tale anew
where how how oft how long ago and when
he hath and is again to cope your wife
or i shall say you are all in all in spleen
and nothing of a man
othello dost thou hear iago
i will be found most cunning in my patience
but dost thou hear most bloody
iago that's not amiss
but yet keep time in all will you withdraw
othello retires
now will i question cassio of bianca
buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
that dotes on cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague
to beguile many and be beguiled by one
he when he hears of her cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter here he comes
re enter cassio
as he shall smile othello shall go mad
and his unbookish jealousy must construe
poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior
cassio the worser that you give me the addition
whose want even kills me
iago ply desdemona well and you are sure ont
now if this suit lay in bianco's power
how quickly should you speed

scene ii
a room in the castle
enter othello and emilia
othello you have seen nothing then
emilia nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
othello yes you have seen cassio and she together
emilia but then i saw no harm and then i heard
each syllable that breath made up between them
othello what did they never whisper
othello nor send you out o' the way
emilia never
othello to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
emilia never my lord
othello that's strange
emilia i durst my lord to wager she is honest
lay down my soul at stake if you think other
remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
if any wretch have put this in your head
for if she be not honest chaste and true
there's no man happy the purest of their wives
is foul as slander
othello bid her come hither go exit emilia
she says enough yet she's a simple bawd
that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore
a closet lock and key of villainous secrets
and yet she'll kneel and pray i have seen her do't
enter desdemona with emilia
othello pray chuck come hither
desdemona what is your pleasure
othello let me see your eyes
look in my face
desdemona what horrible fancy's this
othello to emilia some of your function mistress
leave procreants alone and shut the door
cough or cry hem if anybody come
your mystery your mystery nay dispatch exit emilia
i understand a fury in your words
but not the words
othello why what art thou
desdemona your wife my lord your true and loyal wife
othello come swear it damn thyself
lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
should fear to seize thee therefore be double damnd
swear thou art honest
desdemona heaven doth truly know it
desdemona to whom my lord with whom how am i false
othello o desdemona away away away
desdemona alas the heavy day why do you weep
am i the motive of these tears my lord
if haply you my father do suspect
an instrument of this your calling back
lay not your blame on me if you have lost him
why i have lost him too
othello had it pleased heaven
all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
steep'd me in poverty to the very lips
given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
i should have found in some place of my soul
a drop of patience but alas to make me
a fixed figure for the time of scorn
to point his slow unmoving finger at
yet could i bear that too well very well
but there where i have garner'd up my heart
the fountain from the which my current runs
or else dries up to be discarded thence
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there
patience thou young and rose lipp'd cherubin
ay there look grim as hell
desdemona i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
othello o ay as summer flies are in the shambles
that quicken even with blowing o thou weed
that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born
desdemona alas what ignorant sin have i committed
othello was this fair paper this most goodly book
made to write whore upon what committed
committed o thou public commoner
i should make very forges of my cheeks
that would to cinders burn up modesty
did i but speak thy deeds what committed
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth
and will not hear it what committed
impudent strumpet
desdemona by heaven you do me wrong
othello are not you a strumpet
desdemona no as i am a christian
if to preserve this vessel for my lord
from any other foul unlawful touch
be not to be a strumpet i am none
desdemona no as i shall be saved
othello is't possible
desdemona o heaven forgive us
othello i cry you mercy then
i took you for that cunning whore of venice
that married with othello raises his voice you mistress
that have the office opposite to saint peter
and keep the gate of hell
re enter emilia
we have done our course there's money for your pains
i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel exit
emilia alas what does this gentleman conceive
how do you madam how do you my good lady
desdemona faith half asleep
emilia good madam what's the matter with my lord
desdemona with who
emilia why with my lord madam

desdemona i have none do not talk to me emilia
i cannot weep nor answer have i none
but what should go by water prithee tonight
lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember

emilia here's a change indeed
empty
desdemona 'tis meet i should be used so very meet
how have i been behaved that he might stick
re enter emilia with iago
iago what is your pleasure madam how is't with you
desdemona i cannot tell those that do teach young babes
do it with gentle means and easy tasks
he might have chid me so for in good faith
i am a child to chiding
iago what's the matter lady
emilia alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
desdemona am i that name iago
iago what name fair lady
desdemona such as she says my lord did say i was
emilia he calld her whore a beggar in his drink
could not have laid such terms upon his callet
iago why did he so
desdemona i do not know i am sure i am none such
iago do not weep do not weep alas the day
emilia hath she forsook so many noble matches
to be calld whore would it not make one weep
desdemona it is my wretched fortune
iago beshrew him for't
how comes this trick upon him
desdemona nay heaven doth know
emilia i will be hang'd if some eternal villain
some busy and insinuating rogue
some cogging cozening slave to get some office
have not devised this slander i'll be hang'd else
desdemona if any such there be heaven pardon him
emilia a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
why should he call her whore who keeps her company
what place what time what form what likelihood
the moor's abused by some most villainous knave
some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
o heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold
and put in every honest hand a whip
to lash the rascals naked through the world
iago speak within door
emilia o fie upon them some such squire he was
that turnd your wit the seamy side without
and made you to suspect me with the moor
iago you are a fool go to
desdemona o good iago
what shall i do to win my lord again
good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
i know not how i lost him here i kneel
either in discourse of thought or actual deed
or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
delighted them in any other form
or that i do not yet and ever did
and ever will though he do shake me off
to beggarly divorcement love him dearly
comfort forswear me unkindness may do much
and his unkindness may defeat my life
but never taint my love i cannot say whore
to do the act that might the addition earn
not the world's mass of vanity could make me
iago i pray you be content 'tis but his humor
the business of the state does him offense
and he does chide with you
desdemona if 'twere no other
iago 'tis but so i warrant trumpets within
hark how these instruments summon to supper
the messengers of venice stay the meat
exeunt desdemona and emilia
enter roderigo
how now roderigo
roderigo i do not find that thou dealest justly with me
iago what in the contrary
roderigo every day thou daffest me with some device iago and
rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope i will indeed
no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace
iago will you hear me roderigo
roderigo faith i have heard too much for your words and
performances are no kin together
iago you charge me most unjustly
roderigo with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of my
means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona
would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath
received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance but i find none
roderigo very well go to i cannot go to man nor 'tis not very
well by this hand i say 'tis very scurvy and begin to find
myself fopped in it
iago very well
roderigo i tell you 'tis not very well i will make myself known
to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over
my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure
yourself i will seek satisfaction of you
iago you have said now
empty
iago why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from this
instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before give
me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just
exception but yet i protest have dealt most directly in thy
empty
roderigo it hath not appeared
iago i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is
not without wit and judgement but roderigo if thou hast that
ever i mean purpose courage and valor this night show it if
thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from
this world with treachery and devise engines for my life
roderigo well what is it is it within reason and compass
iago sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute
cassio in othello's place
roderigo is that true why then othello and desdemona return again
to venice
iago o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the
accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
empty
roderigo how do you mean removing of him
iago why by making him uncapable of othello's place knocking out
his brains
roderigo and that you would have me to do
iago ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups
tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows
not yet of his honorable fortune if you will watch his going
one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second
your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not
amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a
necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
it on him it is now high supper time and the night grows to
waste about it
roderigo i will hear further reason for this
iago and you shall be satisfied exeunt
scene iii
enter othello lodovico desdemona emilia and attendants
lodovico i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
othello o pardon me 'twill do me good to walk
lodovico madam good night i humbly thank your ladyship
desdemona your honor is most welcome
othello will you walk sir
o desdemona
desdemona my lord
othello get you to bed on the instant i will be returned
desdemona i will my lord
exeunt othello lodovico and attendants
emilia how goes it now he looks gentler than he did
desdemona he says he will return incontinent
he hath commanded me to go to bed
and bade me to dismiss you
emilia dismiss me
desdemona it was his bidding therefore good emilia
give me my nightly wearing and adieu
emilia i would you had never seen him
desdemona so would not i my love doth so approve him
that even his stubbornness his checks his frowns
prithee unpin me have grace and favor in them
emilia i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
desdemona alls one good faith how foolish are our minds
if i do die before thee prithee shroud me
in one of those same sheets
emilia come come you talk
she was in love and he she loved proved mad
and did forsake her she had a song of willow
an old thing 'twas but it express'd her fortune
and she died singing it that song tonight
will not go from my mind i have much to do
but to go hang my head all at one side
and sing it like poor barbary prithee dispatch
emilia shall i go fetch your nightgown
desdemona no unpin me here
emilia a very handsome man
desdemona he speaks well
emilia i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to
palestine for a touch of his nether lip
desdemona sings
the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
sing all a green willow
her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
sing willow willow willow
sing willow willow willow
her salt tears fell from her and softend the stones
lay be these
sings sing willow willow willow
prithee hie thee he'll come anon
sings sing all a green willow must be my garland
let nobody blame him his scorn i approve
nay that's not next hark who is't that knocks
emilia it's the wind
i calld my love false love but what said he then
sing willow willow willow
if i court moe women you'll couch with moe men
so get thee gone good night mine eyes do itch
doth that bode weeping
emilia 'tis neither here nor there
desdemona i have heard it said so o these men these men
dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia
that there be women do abuse their husbands
emilia there be some such no question
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia why would not you
desdemona no by this heavenly light
emilia nor i neither by this heavenly light i might do't as well
i' the dark
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia the world's a huge thing it is a great price
for a small vice
emilia in troth i think i should and undo't when i had done
marry i would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for
measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any
petty exhibition but for the whole world why who would not
make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should
venture purgatory for't
desdemona beshrew me if i would do such a wrong
for the whole world
emilia why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world and having the
might quickly make it right
desdemona i do not think there is any such woman
emilia yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the
world they played for
but i do think it is their husbands' faults
if wives do fall say that they slack their duties
and pour our treasures into foreign laps
or else break out in peevish jealousies
throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
why we have galls and though we have some grace
yet have we some revenge let husbands know
their wives have sense like them they see and smell
and have their palates both for sweet and sour
as husbands have what is it that they do
when they change us for others is it sport
i think it is and doth affection breed it
i think it doth is't frailty that thus errs
it is so too and have not we affections
then let them use us well else let them know
the ills we do their ills instruct us so
desdemona good night good night heaven me such uses send
not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend exeunt

scene ii
a bedchamber in the castle desdemona in bed asleep a light burning
enter othello
othello it is the cause it is the cause my soul
let me not name it to you you chaste stars
it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
and smooth as monumental alabaster
put out the light and then put out the light
if i quench thee thou flaming minister
i can again thy former light restore
should i repent me but once put out thy light
thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature
i know not where is that promethean heat
that can thy light relume when i have pluck'd the rose
i cannot give it vital growth again
it must needs wither i'll smell it on the tree kisses her
justice to break her sword one more one more
be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee
and love thee after one more and this the last
so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep
but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly
it strikes where it doth love she wakes
desdemona who's there othello
othello ay desdemona
desdemona will you come to bed my lord
desdemona ay my lord
othello if you bethink yourself of any crime
unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
solicit for it straight
desdemona alas my lord what may you mean by that
othello well do it and be brief i will walk by
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit
no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul
desdemona talk you of killing
desdemona then heaven have mercy on me
othello amen with all my heart
desdemona if you say so i hope you will not kill me
othello hum
desdemona and yet i fear you for you are fatal then
when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not
since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
othello think on thy sins
desdemona they are loves i bear to you
desdemona that death's unnatural that kills for loving
alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
some bloody passion shakes your very frame
these are portents but yet i hope i hope
they do not point on me
othello peace and be still
desdemona i will so what's the matter
othello that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee
thou gavest to cassio
send for the man and ask him
othello sweet soul take heed
take heed of perjury thou are on thy deathbed
desdemona ay but not yet to die
othello yes presently
therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
for to deny each article with oath
cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
that i do groan withal thou art to die
othello i say amen
desdemona and have you mercy too i never did
offend you in my life never loved cassio
but with such general warranty of heaven
as i might love i never gave him token
othello by heaven i saw my handkerchief in 's hand
o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart
and makest me call what i intend to do
a murther which i thought a sacrifice
desdemona he found it then
i never gave it him send for him hither
let him confess a truth
othello he hath confess'd
desdemona what my lord
othello that he hath used thee
desdemona how unlawfully
othello ay
desdemona he will not say so
honest iago hath ta'en order for't
desdemona o my fear interprets what is he dead
othello had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
had stomach for them all
desdemona alas he is betray'd and i undone
othello out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face
desdemona o banish me my lord but kill me not
othello down strumpet
desdemona kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
desdemona but half an hour
othello being done there is no pause
desdemona but while i say one prayer
othello it is too late he stifles her
emilia within my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord
othello what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead
i that am cruel am yet merciful
i would not have thee linger in thy pain
so so
othello who's there
emilia within o good my lord i would speak a word with you
othello yes 'tis emilia by and by she's dead
'tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death
the noise was here ha no more moving
still as the grave shall she come in were't good
i think she stirs again no what's best to do
if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife
my wife my wife what wife i have no wife
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
should yawn at alteration

othello she's like a liar gone to burning hell
'twas i that killd her
and you the blacker devil
othello she turnd to folly and she was a whore
emilia thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
othello she was false as water
emilia thou art rash as fire to say

othello cassio did top her ask thy husband else
o i were damnd beneath all depth in hell
but that i did proceed upon just grounds
emilia my husband

for thou hast killd the sweetest innocent
that e'er did lift up eye
othello rises o she was foul
whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd
i know this act shows horrible and grim
gratiano poor desdemon i am glad thy father's dead
thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
shore his old thread in twain did he live now
this sight would make him do a desperate turn
yea curse his better angel from his side
and fall to reprobation
othello 'tis pitiful but yet iago knows
a thousand times committed cassio confess'd it
and she did gratify his amorous works
with that recognizance and pledge of love
which i first gave her i saw it in his hand
it was a handkerchief an antique token
my father gave my mother
emilia o heaven o heavenly powers
iago 'zounds hold your peace
emilia 'twill out 'twill i peace
let heaven and men and devils let them all
all all cry shame against me yet i'll speak
iago be wise and get you home

othello look in upon me then and speak with me
or naked as i am i will assault thee

othello behold i have a weapon

upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day
that with this little arm and this good sword
i have made my way through more impediments
than twenty times your stop but o vain boast
who can control his fate 'tis not so now
be not afraid though you do see me weapond
here is my journey's end here is my butt
do you go back dismay'd 'tis a lost fear
man but a rush against othello's breast
and he retires where should othello go
now how dost thou look now o ill starr'd wench
pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl
even like thy chastity o cursed cursed slave

wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire

enter lodovico montano cassio carried in a chair
and officers with iago prisoner
lodovico where is this rash and most unfortunate man
othello that's he that was othello here i am
lodovico where is that viper bring the villain forth
if that thou be'st a devil i cannot kill thee wounds iago
lodovico wrench his sword from him
iago i bleed sir but not killd
othello i am not sorry neither i'ld have thee live
for in my sense 'tis happiness to die
lodovico o thou othello that wert once so good
falln in the practice of a damned slave
what shall be said to thee
othello why anything
for nought did i in hate but all in honor
lodovico this wretch hath part confess'd his villainy
did you and he consent in cassio's death
othello ay
cassio dear general i never gave you cause
othello i do believe it and i ask your pardon
will you i pray demand that demi devil
why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
iago demand me nothing what you know you know
lodovico what not to pray
gratiano torments will ope your lips
othello well thou dost best
lodovico sir you shall understand what hath befalln
which as i think you know not here is a letter
found in the pocket of the slain roderigo
and here another the one of them imports
the death of cassio to be undertook
by roderigo
cassio most heathenish and most gross
lodovico now here's another discontented paper
found in his pocket too and this it seems
roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
but that belike iago in the interim
came in and satisfied him
othello o the pernicious caitiff
how came you cassio by that handkerchief
that was my wife's
and he himself confess'd but even now
that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
which wrought to his desire
othello o fool fool fool
cassio there is besides in roderigo's letter
how he upbraids iago that he made him
brave me upon the watch whereon it came
that i was cast and even but now he spake
after long seeming dead iago hurt him
lodovico you must forsake this room and go with us
your power and your command is taken off
and cassio rules in cyprus for this slave
if there be any cunning cruelty
that can torment him much and hold him long
it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest
till that the nature of your fault be known
to the venetian state come bring away
othello soft you a word or two before you go
no more of that i pray you in your letters
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate
speak of me as i am nothing extenuate
nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
of one that loved not wisely but too well
of one not easily jealous but being wrought
perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand
like the base indian threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
their medicinal gum set you down this
and say besides that in aleppo once
where a malignant and a turband turk
beat a venetian and traduced the state
i took by the throat the circumcised dog
and smote him thus stabs himself
lodovico o bloody period
gratiano all that's spoke is marr'd
killing myself to die upon a kiss
falls on the bed and dies
cassio this did i fear but thought he had no weapon
for he was great of heart
lodovico to iago o spartan dog
more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
look on the tragic loading of this bed
this is thy work the object poisons sight
let it be hid gratiano keep the house
for they succeed on you to you lord governor
remains the censure of this hellish villain
the time the place the torture o enforce it
myself will straight aboard and to the state

king richard old john of gaunt time honoured lancaster
hast thou according to thy oath and band
brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
here to make good the boist'rous late appeal
which then our leisure would not let us hear
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
gaunt i have my liege
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
or worthily as a good subject should
on some known ground of treachery in him
gaunt as near as i could sift him on that argument
on some apparent danger seen in him
aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice
king richard then call them to our presence face to face
and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
the accuser and the accused freely speak
in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
enter bolingbroke and mowbray
bolingbroke many years of happy days befall
my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
mowbray each day still better other's happiness
until the heavens envying earth's good hap
add an immortal title to your crown
king richard we thank you both yet one but flatters us
as well appeareth by the cause you come
cousin of hereford what dost thou object
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
bolingbroke first heaven be the record to my speech
in the devotion of a subject's love
tend'ring the precious safety of my prince
and free from other misbegotten hate
come i appellant to this princely presence
now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
and mark my greeting well for what i speak
or my divine soul answer it in heaven
thou art a traitor and a miscreant
too good to be so and too bad to live
since the more fair and crystal is the sky
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
once more the more to aggravate the note
with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat
and wish so please my sovereign ere i move
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
'tis not the trial of a womans war
the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
the blood is hot that must be coold for this
yet can i not of such tame patience boast
as to be hush'd and nought at an to say
first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
which else would post until it had returnd
setting aside his high blood's royalty
and let him be no kinsman to my liege
i do defy him and i spit at him
call him a slanderous coward and a villain
which to maintain i would allow him odds
and meet him were i tied to run afoot
even to the frozen ridges of the alps
or any other ground inhabitable
where ever englishman durst set his foot
by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
bolingbroke pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
disclaiming here the kindred of the king
and lay aside my high blood's royalty
which fear not reverence makes thee to except
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
by that and all the rites of knighthood else
will i make good against thee arm to arm
mowbray i take it up and by that sword i swear
which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
i'll answer thee in any fair degree
or chivalrous design of knightly trial
and when i mount alive may i not light
if i be traitor or unjustly fight
king richard what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge
it must be great that can inherit us
so much as of a thought of ill in him
that mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
in name of lendings for your highness' soldiers
the which he hath detaind for lewd employments
like a false traitor and injurious villain
besides i say and will in battle prove
or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
that ever was survey'd by english eye
that all the treasons for these eighteen years
complotted and contrived in this land
further i say and further will maintain
upon his bad life to make all this good
that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death
suggest his soon believing adversaries
and consequently like a traitor coward
sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood
which blood like sacrificing abels cries
even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
to me for justice and rough chastisement
this arm shall do it or this life be spent
king richard how high a pitch his resolution soars
thomas of norfolk what say'st thou to this
mowbray o let my sovereign turn away his face
and bid his ears a little while be deaf
till i have told this slander of his blood
how god and good men hate so foul a liar
king richard mowbray impartial are our eyes and cars
were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir
now by my sceptre's awe i make a vow
such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
should nothing privilege him nor partialize
the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
he is our subject mowbray so art thou
free speech and fearless i to thee allow
mowbray then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
three parts of that receipt i had for calais
the other part reserv'd i by consent
for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
upon remainder of a dear account
since last i went to france to fetch his queen
now swallow down that lie for gloucester's death
i slew him not but to my own disgrace
neglected my sworn duty in that case
for you my noble lord of lancaster
the honourable father to my foe
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
but ere i last receiv'd the sacrament
i did confess it and exactly begg'd
your grace's pardon and i hope i had it
this is my fault as for the rest appeald
it issues from the rancour of a villain
a recreant and most degenerate traitor
which in myself i boldly will defend
and interchangeably hurl down my gage
to prove myself a loyal gentleman
even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom
in haste whereof most heartily i pray
your highness to assign our trial day
king richard wrath kindled gentlemen be ruld by me
let's purge this choler without letting blood
this we prescribe though no physician
deep malice makes too deep incision
forget forgive conclude and be agreed
good uncle let this end where it begun
we'll calm the duke of norfolk you your son
gaunt to be a make peace shall become my age
throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage
king richard and norfolk throw down his
gaunt when harry when
obedience bids i should not bid again
king richard norfolk throw down we bid
there is no boot
my life thou shalt command but not my shame
the one my duty owes but my fair name
despite of death that lives upon my grave
to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
i am disgrac'd impeach'd and baffld here
pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear
the which no balm can cure but his heart blood
which breath'd this poison
king richard rage must be withstood
mowbray yea but not change his spots take but my shame
and i resign my gage my dear dear lord
the purest treasure mortal times afford
is spotless reputation that away
men are but gilded loam or painted clay
a jewel in a ten times barr'd up chest
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
mine honour is my life both grow in one
take honour from me and my life is done
in that i live and for that will i die
king richard cousin throw up your gage do you begin
bolingbroke o god defend my soul from such deep sin
shall i seem crest fallen in my father's sight
or with pale beggar fear impeach my height
before this outdar'd dastard ere my tongue
shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
the slavish motive of recanting fear
where shame doth harbour even in mowbray's face
exit gaunt
king richard we were not born to sue but to command
which since we cannot do to make you friends
be ready as your lives shall answer it
at coventry upon saint lambert's day
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
the swelling difference of your settled hate
since we can not atone you we shall see
lord marshal command our officers at arms
be ready to direct these home alarms exeunt
scene 2
london the duke of lancaster's palace
enter john of gaunt with the duchess of gloucester
gaunt alas the part i had in woodstock's blood
doth more solicit me than your exclaims
to stir against the butchers of his life
but since correction lieth in those hands
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
who when they see the hours ripe on earth
will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads
duchess finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
hath love in thy old blood no living fire
edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one
were as seven vials of his sacred blood
or seven fair branches springing from one root
some of those seven are dried by nature's course
but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
one vial full of edward's sacred blood
one flourishing branch of his most royal root
is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt
is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded
by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe
ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
that mettle that self mould that fashiond thee
made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
in some large measure to thy father's death
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
who was the model of thy father's life
call it not patience gaunt it is despair
in suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
that which in mean men we entitle patience
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
the best way is to venge my gloucester's death
gaunt god's is the quarrel for god's substitute
his deputy anointed in his sight
hath caus'd his death the which if wrongfully
let heaven revenge for i may never lift
an angry arm against his minister
duchess where then alas may i complain myself
gaunt to god the widow's champion and defence
duchess why then i will farewell old gaunt
our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight
o sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear
that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast
or if misfortune miss the first career
be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
that they may break his foaming courser's back
and throw the rider headlong in the lists
a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife
gaunt sister farewell i must to coventry
as much good stay with thee as go with me
duchess yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
not with the empty hollowness but weight
i take my leave before i have begun
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
commend me to thy brother edmund york
lo this is all nay yet depart not so
though this be all do not so quickly go
with all good speed at plashy visit me
alack and what shall good old york there see
but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
unpeopled offices untrodden stones
and what hear there for welcome but my groans
therefore commend me let him not come there
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
desolate desolate will i hence and die
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye exeunt
the lists at coventry
enter the lord marshal and the duke of aumerle

appointed to direct these fair designs
bolingbroke lord marshal let me kiss my sovereigns hand
and bow my knee before his majesty

king richard we will descend and fold him in our arms
cousin of hereford as thy cause is right
so be thy fortune in this royal fight
farewell my blood which if to day thou shed
lament we may but not revenge thee dead
bolingbroke o let no noble eye profane a tear
for me if i be gor'd with mowbray's spear
as confident as is the falcons flight
my loving lord i take my leave of you
of you my noble cousin lord aumerle
not sick although i have to do with death
but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
lo as at english feasts so i regreet
the daintiest last to make the end most sweet
o thou the earthly author of my blood
whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
and with thy blessings steel my lance's point
that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat
and furbish new the name of john o' gaunt
even in the lusty haviour of his son
gaunt god in thy good cause make thee prosperous
be swift like lightning in the execution
and let thy blows doubly redoubled
fall like amazing thunder on the casque
rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
bolingbroke mine innocence and saint george to thrive
mowbray however god or fortune cast my lot
there lives or dies true to king richard's throne
a loyal just and upright gentleman
never did captive with a freer heart
cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
his golden uncontrolld enfranchisement
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
most mighty liege and my companion peers
take from my mouth the wish of happy years
as gentle and as jocund as to jest
go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast
king richard farewell my lord securely i espy
virtue with valour couched in thine eye
order the trial marshal and begin
marshal harry of hereford lancaster and derby
receive thy lance and god defend the right
marshal to an officer go bear this lance to thomas
duke of norfolk
first herald harry of hereford lancaster and derby
stands here for god his sovereign and himself
on pain to be found false and recreant
to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
a traitor to his god his king and him
and dares him to set forward to the fight
second herald here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
both to defend himself and to approve
henry of hereford lancaster and derby
to god his sovereign and to him disloyal
courageously and with a free desire
attending but the signal to begin
marshal sound trumpets and set forward combatants
a charge sounded
stay the king hath thrown his warder down
king richard let them lay by their helmets and their spears
withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
while we return these dukes what we decree
a long flourish while the king consults his council
draw near
and list what with our council we have done
for that our kingdom's earth should not be soild
with that dear blood which it hath fostered
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword
of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts
with rival hating envy set on you
to wake our peace which in our country's cradle
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
which so rous'd up with boist'rous untund drums
with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
and make us wade even in our kindred's blood
you cousin hereford upon pain of life
till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
shall not regreet our fair dominions
but tread the stranger paths of banishment
bolingbroke your will be done this must my comfort be
that sun that warms you here shall shine on me
and those his golden beams to you here lent
shall point on me and gild my banishment
king richard norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
the sly slow hours shall not determinate
the dateless limit of thy dear exile
the hopeless word of 'never to return
breathe i against thee upon pain of life
mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
and all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth
a dearer merit not so deep a maim
as to be cast forth in the common air
have i deserved at your highness' hands
my native english now i must forgo
and now my tongue's use is to me no more
than an unstringed viol or a harp
or like a cunning instrument cas'd up
or being open put into his hands
that knows no touch to tune the harmony
within my mouth you have engaold my tongue
doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips
and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
too far in years to be a pupil now
what is thy sentence then but speechless death
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
king richard it boots thee not to be compassionate
after our sentence plaining comes too late
mowbray then thus i turn me from my countrv's light
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
king richard return again and take an oath with thee
swear by the duty that you owe to god
our part therein we banish with yourselves
to keep the oath that we administer
you never shall so help you truth and god
embrace each other's love in banishment
nor never look upon each other's face
nor never write regreet nor reconcile
this louring tempest of your home bred hate
nor never by advised purpose meet
'gainst us our state our subjects or our land
bolingbroke i swear
mowbray and i to keep all this
bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy
by this time had the king permitted us
one of our souls had wand'red in the air
banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
as now our flesh is banish'd from this land
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
the clogging burden of a guilty soul
mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor
my name be blotted from the book of life
and i from heaven banish'd as from hence
but what thou art god thou and i do know
and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
farewell my liege now no way can i stray
save back to england an the world's my way exit
king richard uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
hath from the number of his banish'd years
pluck'd four away to bolingbroke six frozen winters spent
return with welcome home from banishment
bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word
four lagging winters and four wanton springs
end in a word such is the breath of kings
gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me
he shortens four years of my sons exile
but little vantage shall i reap thereby
can change their moons and bring their times about
my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light
shall be extinct with age and endless night
my inch of taper will be burnt and done
and blindfold death not let me see my son
king richard why uncle thou hast many years to live
gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
thy word is current with him for my death
but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
king richard thy son is banish'd upon good advice
whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave
why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour
gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
you urg'd me as a judge but i had rather
you would have bid me argue like a father
to smooth his fault i should have been more mild
a partial slander sought i to avoid
and in the sentence my own life destroy'd
alas i look'd when some of you should say
i was too strict to make mine own away
but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
against my will to do myself this wrong
king richard cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
six years we banish him and he shall go
aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know
from where you do remain let paper show
marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride
as far as land will let me by your side
gaunt o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
that thou returnest no greeting to thy friends
bolingbroke i have too few to take my leave of you
when the tongue's office should be prodigal
to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time
gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone
bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
gaunt call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure
bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
which finds it an enforced pilgrimage
gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps
esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
the precious jewel of thy home return
will but remember me what a deal of world
i wander from the jewels that i love
must i not serve a long apprenticehood
to foreign passages and in the end
having my freedom boast of nothing else
but that i was a journeyman to grief
gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits
are to a wise man ports and happy havens
teach thy necessity to reason thus
think not the king did banish thee
but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit
where it perceives it is but faintly home
go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
and not the king exild thee or suppose
devouring pestilence hangs in our air
and thou art flying to a fresher clime
look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
to lie that way thou goest not whence thou com'st
the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd
the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
than a delightful measure or a dance
for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
the man that mocks at it and sets it light
bolingbroke o who can hold a fire in his hand
by thinking on the frosty caucasus
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
by bare imagination of a feast
by thinking on fantastic summer's heat
o no the apprehension of the good
gives but the greater feeling to the worse
fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
gaunt come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way
had i thy youtli and cause i would not stay
bolingbroke then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
though banish'd yet a trueborn english man exeunt

london the court
enter the king with bagot and green at one door
and the duke of aumerle at another
king richard we did observe cousin aumerle
how far brought you high hereford on his way
aumerle i brought high hereford if you call him so
but to the next high way and there i left him
aumerle faith none for me except the north east wind
which then blew bitterly against our faces
awak'd the sleeping rheum and so by chance
did grace our hollow parting with a tear
king richard what said our cousin when you parted with him
aumerle 'farewell'
and for my heart disdained that my tongue
should so profane the word that taught me craft
to counterfeit oppression of such grief
marry would the word 'farewell have length'ned hours
and added years to his short banishment
he should have had a volume of farewells
but since it would not he had none of me
king richard he is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt
when time shall call him home from banishment
whether our kinsman come to see his friends
ourself and bushy bagot here and green
observ'd his courtship to the common people
with humble and familiar courtesy
what reverence he did throw away on slaves
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
and patient underbearing of his fortune
as 'twere to banish their affects with him
off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench
a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
and had the tribute of his supple knee
with 'thanks my countrymen my loving friends'
and he our subjects' next degree in hope
green well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland
expedient manage must be made my liege
ere further leisure yicld them further means
for their advantage and your highness' loss
king richard we will ourself in person to this war
and for our coffers with too great a court
and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
the revenue whereof shall furnish us
for our affairs in hand if that come short
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
whereto when they shall know what men are rich
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
and send them after to supply our wants
for we will make for ireland presently
enter bushy
bushy what news
suddenly taken and hath sent poste haste
to entreat your majesty to visit him
king richard where lies he

to deck our soldiers for these irish wars
come gentlemen let's all go visit him

act ii scene i
london ely house
enter john of gaunt sick with the duke of york etc
gaunt will the king come that i may breathe my last
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
gaunt o but they say the tongues of dying men
where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
he that no more must say is listend more
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
more are mens ends mark'd than their lives before
the setting sun and music at the close
as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
writ in remembrance more than things long past
though richard my life's counsel would not hear
york no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
lascivious metres to whose venom sound
the open ear of youth doth always listen
report of fashions in proud italy
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after in base imitation
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
so it be new there's no respect how vile
then all too late comes counsel to be heard
where will doth mutiny with wit's regard
direct not him whose way himself will choose
'tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose
gaunt methinks i am a prophet new inspir'd
and thus expiring do foretell of him
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
for violent fires soon burn out themselves
small showers last long but sudden storms are short
with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
light vanity insatiate cormorant
consuming means soon preys upon itself
this royal throne of kings this scept'red isle
this earth of majesty this seat of mars
this other eden demi paradise
this fortress built by nature for herself
against infection and the hand of war
this happy breed of men this little world
which serves it in the office of a wall
or as a moat defensive to a house
against the envy of less happier lands
this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth
renowned for their deeds as far from home
for christian service and true chivalry
as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
dear for her reputation through the world
is now leas'd out i die pronouncing it
like to a tenement or pelting farm
england bound in with the triumphant sea
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
of wat'ry neptune is now bound in with shame
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
that england that was wont to conquer others
ah would the scandal vanish with my life
how happy then were my ensuing death
enter king and queen aumerle bushy green bagot
ross and willoughby
york the king is come deal mildly with his youth
for young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more
queen how fares our noble uncle lancaster
king richard what comfort man how is't with aged gaunt
gaunt o how that name befits my composition
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
for sleeping england long time have i watch'd
watching breeds leanness leanness is an gaunt
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
is my strict fast i mean my childrens looks
and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
gaunt no misery makes sport to mock itself
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
i mock my name great king to flatter thee
king richard should dying men flatter with those that live
gaunt no no men living flatter those that die
king richard thou now a dying sayest thou flatterest me
gaunt o no thou diest though i the sicker be
king richard i am in health i breathe and see thee ill
gaunt now he that made me knows i see thee ill
thy death bed is no lesser than thy land
wherein thou liest in reputation sick
and thou too careless patient as thou art
commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
of those physicians that first wounded thee
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
whose compass is no bigger than thy head
and yet incaged in so small a verge
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
seen how his sons son should destroy his sons
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
deposing thee before thou wert possess'd
which art possess'd now to depose thyself
why cousin wert thou regent of the world
it were a shame to let this land by lease
but for thy world enjoying but this land
is it not more than shame to shame it so
landlord of england art thou now not king
and thou
king richard a lunatic lean witted fool
presuming on an ague's privilege
darest with thy frozen admonition
make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
with fury from his native residence
now by my seat's right royal majesty
wert thou not brother to great edward's son
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
gaunt o spare me not my brother edward's son
for that i was his father edward's son
that blood already like the pelican
hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly carous'd
my brother gloucester plain well meaning soul
whom fair befall in heaven 'mongst happy souls
may be a precedent and witness good
that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood
join with the present sickness that i have
to crop at once a too long withered flower
live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
these words hereafter thy tormentors be
convey me to my bed then to my grave
love they to live that love and honour have
exit borne out by his attendants
king richard and let them die that age and sullens have
for both hast thou and both become the grave
york i do beseech your majesty impute his words
he loves you on my life and holds you dear
as harry duke of hereford were he here
king richard right you say true as hereford's love so his
as theirs so mine and all be as it is
enter northumberland
northumberland my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
king richard what says he
northumberland nay nothing all is said
his tongue is now a stringless instrument
york be york the next that must be bankrupt so
though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
king richard the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
so much for that now for our irish wars
we must supplant those rough rug headed kerns
which live like venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege to live
and for these great affairs do ask some charge
the plate coin revenues and moveables
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd
york how long shall i be patient ah how long
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment
nor gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs
nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
about his marriage nor my own disgrace
have ever made me sour my patient cheek
i am the last of noble edward's sons
of whom thy father prince of wales was first
in war was never lion rag'd more fierce
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
than was that young and princely gentleman
his face thou hast for even so look'd he
accomplish'd with the number of thy hours
but when he frownd it was against the french
and not against his friends his noble hand
which his triumphant father's hand had won
his hands were guilty of no kindred blood
but bloody with the enemies of his kin
o richard york is too far gone with grief
or else he never would compare between
king richard why uncle what's the matter
york o my liege
pardon me if you please if not i pleas'd
not to be pardoned am content withal
the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford
is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live
was not gaunt just and is not harry true
did not the one deserve to have an heir
is not his heir a well deserving son
take hereford's rights away and take from time
his charters and his customary rights
let not to morrow then ensue to day
be not thyself for how art thou a king
now afore god god forbid i say true
if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights
call in the letters patents that he hath
by his attorneys general to sue
his livery and deny his off'red homage
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
you lose a thousand well disposed hearts
and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
which honour and allegiance cannot think
his plate his goods his money and his lands
york i'll not be by the while my liege farewell
what will ensue hereof there's none can tell
but by bad courses may be understood
that their events can never fall out good exit
king richard go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight
bid him repair to us to ely house
to see this business to morrow next
we will for ireland and 'tis time i trow
our uncle york lord governor of england
for he is just and always lov'd us well
come on our queen to morrow must we part
be merry for our time of stay is short
flourish exeunt king queen bushy aumerle
green and bagot
northumberland well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
ross and living too for now his son is duke
willoughby barely in title not in revenues
ross my heart is great but it must break with silence
ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue
northumberland nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
willoughby tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
if it be so out with it boldly man
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
ross no good at all that i can do for him
unless you call it good to pity him
northumberland now afore god 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
in him a royal prince and many moe
of noble blood in this declining land
the king is not himself but basely led
by flatterers and what they will inform
merely in hate 'gainst any of us an
that will the king severely prosecute
'gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
ross the commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes
for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
willoughby and daily new exactions are devis'd
as blanks benevolences and i wot not what
but what a god's name doth become of this
northumberland wars hath not wasted it for warr'd he hath not
but basely yielded upon compromise
that which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
ross the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
northumberland reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
ross he hath not money for these irish wars
his burdenous taxations notwithstanding
but by the robbing of the banish'd duke
northumberland his noble kinsman most degenerate king
but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
and yet we strike not but securely perish
and unavoided is the danger now
for suffering so the causes of our wreck
northumberland not so even through the hollow eyes of death
i spy life peering but i dare not say
how near the tidings of our comfort is
willoughby nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
ross be confident to speak northumberland
we three are but thyself and speaking so
thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
in brittany receiv'd intelligence
that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham
that late broke from the duke of exeter
his brother archbishop late of canterbury
sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston
sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint
all these well furnish'd by the duke of britaine
with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
are making hither with all due expedience
perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
the first departing of the king for ireland
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
imp out our drooping country's broken wing
redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
and make high majesty look like itself
away with me in post to ravenspurgh
but if you faint as fearing to do so
ross to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
willoughby hold out my horse and i will first be there

enter queen bushy and bagot
bushy madam your majesty is too much sad
you promis'd when you parted with the king
to lay aside life harming heaviness
queen to please the king i did to please myself
i cannot do it yet i know no cause
why i should welcome such a guest as grief
save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
as my sweet richard yet again methinks
some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb
is coming towards me and my inward soul
with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
more than with parting from my lord the king
which shows like grief itself but is not so
for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears
divides one thing entire to many objects
like perspectives which rightly gaz'd upon
show nothing but confusion ey'd awry
distinguish form so your sweet majesty
looking awry upon your lord's departure
find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows
more than your lord's departure weep not more is not seen
or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye
which for things true weeps things imaginary
queen it may be so but yet my inward soul
persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be
i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
as though on thinking on no thought i think
makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
bushy 'tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
from some forefather grief mine is not so
for nothing hath begot my something grief
or something hath the nothing that i grieve
'tis in reversion that i do possess
but what it is that is not yet known what
i cannot name 'tis nameless woe i wot

green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen
i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland
for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd
green that he our hope might have retir'd his power
and driven into despair an enemy's hope
who strongly hath set footing in this land
the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself
and with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd
at ravenspurgh
queen now god in heaven forbid
the lord northumberland his son young henry percy
the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby
with all their powerful friends are fled to him
bushy why have you not proclaim'd northumberland
and all the rest revolted faction traitors
green we have whereupon the earl of worcester
hath broken his staff resignd his stewardship
and all the household servants fled with him
to bolingbroke
and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
and i a gasping new deliver'd mother
have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind
bushy despair not madam
queen who shall hinder me
i will despair and be at enmity
with cozening hope he is a flatterer
a parasite a keeper back of death
which false hope lingers in extremity
enter york
green here comes the duke of york
queen with signs of war about his aged neck
o full of careful business are his looks
uncle for god's sake speak comfortable words
york should i do so i should belie my thoughts
comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth
where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
whilst others come to make him lose at home
here am i left to underprop his land
who weak with age cannot support myself
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him
enter a servingman
servingman my lord your son was gone before i came

hold take my ring
servingman my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship
to day as i came by i called there
but i shall grieve you to report the rest
york what is't knave
servingman an hour before i came the duchess died
york god for his mercy what a tide of woes
i know not what to do i would to god
so my untruth had not provok'd him to it
the king had cut off my head with my brother's
what are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland
how shall we do for money for these wars
come sister cousin i would say pray pardon me
go fellow get thee home provide some carts
and bring away the armour that is there
exit servingman
if i know how or which way to order these affairs
thus disorderly thrust into my hands
never believe me both are my kinsmen
t'one is my sovereign whom both my oath
and duty bids defend t'other again
is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
well somewhat we must do come cousin
i'll dispose of you gentlemen go muster up your men
i should to plashy too
but time will not permit all is uneven
and everything is left at six and seven
exeunt york and queen
bushy the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland
but none returns for us to levy power
proportionable to the enemy
is all unpossible
green besides our nearness to the king in love
bagot and that is the wavering commons for their love
lies in their purses and whoso empties them
by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
bushy wherein the king stands generally condemnd
bagot if judgment lie in them then so do we
because we ever have been near the king
green well i will for refuge straight to bristow castle
the earl of wiltshire is already there
bushy thither will i with you for little office
except eke curs to tear us all to pieces
will you go along with us
bagot no i will to ireland to his majesty
farewell if heart's presages be not vain
we three here part that ne'er shall meet again
bushy that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke

is numb'ring sands and drinking oceans dry
where one on his side fights thousands will fly

bolingbroke how far is it my lord to berkeley now
northumberland believe me noble lord
i am a stranger here in gloucestershire
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
making the hard way sweet and delectable
but i bethink me what a weary way
from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
in ross and willoughby wanting your company
which i protest hath very much beguild
the tediousness and process of my travel
but theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have
the present benefit which i possess
than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords
shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
by sight of what i have your noble company
bolingbroke of much less value is my company
than your good words but who comes here
enter harry percy
northumberland it is my son young harry percy
sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
harry how fares your uncle
northumberland why is he not with the queen
percy no my good lord he hath forsook the court
broken his staff of office and dispers'd
the household of the king
northumberland what was his reason
he was not so resolv'd when last we spake together
percy because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
to offer service to the duke of hereford
what power the duke of york had levied there
then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
northumberland have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
percy no my good lord for that is not forgot
which ne'er i did remember to my knowledge
i never in my life did look on him
northumberland then learn to know him now this is the duke
percy my gracious lord i tender you my service
such as it is being tender raw and young
to more approved service and desert
bolingbroke i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
i count myself in nothing else so happy
as in a soul rememb'ring my good friends
and as my fortune ripens with thy love
it shall be still thy true love's recompense
my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
northumberland how far is it to berkeley and what stir
keeps good old york there with his men of war
mannd with three hundred men as i have heard
and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour
none else of name and noble estimate
enter ross and willoughby
northumberland here come the lords of ross and willoughby
bloody with spurring fiery red with haste
bolingbroke welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
a banish'd traitor all my treasury
is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd
ross your presence makes us rich most noble lord
willoughby and far surmounts our labour to attain it
bolingbroke evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
which till my infant fortune comes to years
stands for my bounty but who comes here
enter berkeley
northumberland it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
berkeley my lord of hereford my message is to you
bolingbroke my lord my answer is 'to lancaster'
and i must find that title in your tongue
before i make reply to aught you say
berkeley mistake me not my lord 'tis not my meaning
to raze one title of your honour out
to you my lord i come what lord you will
from the most gracious regent of this land
the duke of york to know what pricks you on
to take advantage of the absent time
and fright our native peace with self borne arms
bolingbroke i shall not need transport my words by you
here comes his grace in person my noble uncle
empty
york show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
whose duty is deceivable and false
bolingbroke my gracious uncle
york tut tut
grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
i am no traitor's uncle and that word 'grace'
why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
dar'd once to touch a dust of england's ground
but then more 'why' why have they dar'd to march
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
frighting her pale fac'd villages with war
and ostentation of despised arms
com'st thou because the anointed king is hence
why foolish boy the king is left behind
and in my loyal bosom lies his power
as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
rescued the black prince that young mars of men
from forth the ranks of many thousand french
o then how quickly should this arm of mine
now prisoner to the palsy chastise the
and minister correction to thy fault
bolingbroke my gracious uncle let me know my fault
on what condition stands it and wherein
york even in condition of the worst degree
thou art a banish'd man and here art come
before the expiration of thy time
in braving arms against thy sovereign
bolingbroke as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford
but as i come i come for lancaster
and noble uncle i beseech your grace
look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
you are my father for methinks in you
i see old gaunt alive o then my father
a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
if that my cousin king be king in england
it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
had you first died and he been thus trod down
he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
and yet my letters patents give me leave
my father's goods are all distraind and sold
and these and all are all amiss employ'd
what would you have me do i am a subject
and i challenge law attorneys are denied me
and therefore personally i lay my claim
to my inheritance of free descent
northumberland the noble duke hath been too much abused
ross it stands your grace upon to do him right
york my lords of england let me tell you this
i have had feeling of my cousins wrongs
and labour'd all i could to do him right
but in this kind to come in braving arms
be his own carver and cut out his way
to find out right with wrong it may not be
and you that do abet him in this kind
cherish rebellion and are rebels all
northumberland the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
and let him never see joy that breaks that oath
york well well i see the issue of these arms
i cannot mend it i must needs confess
because my power is weak and all ill left
but if i could by him that gave me life
i would attach you all and make you stoop
unto the sovereign mercy of the king
but since i cannot be it known unto you
unless you please to enter in the castle
and there repose you for this night
bolingbroke an offer uncle that we will accept
but we must win your grace to go with us
to bristow castle which they say is held
by bushy bagot and their complices
the caterpillars of the commonwealth
which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
york it may be i will go with you but yet i'll pause
nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
things past redress are now with me past care exeunt

a camp in wales
enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain
captain my lord of salisbury we have stay'd ten days
and hardly kept our countrymen together
and yet we hear no tidings from the king
therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
captain 'tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
the bay trees in our country are all wither'd
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
the pale fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth
and lean look'd prophets whisper fearful change
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
the other to enjoy by rage and war
farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
as well assur'd richard their king is dead exit
salisbury ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
i see thy glory like a shooting star
fall to the base earth from the firmament
the sun sets weeping in the lowly west
witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes exit
bolingbroke's camp at bristol
enter bolingbroke york northumberland percy ross willoughby
bushy and green prisoners
bolingbroke bring forth these men
bushy and green i will not vex your souls
since presently your souls must part your bodies
with too much urging your pernicious lives
for 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood
from off my hands here in the view of men
you have misled a prince a royal king
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
by you unhappied and disfigured clean
you have in manner with your sinful hours
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
broke the possession of a royal bed
and staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
myself a prince by fortune of my birth
till you did make him misinterpret me
have stoop'd my neck under your injuries
and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds
eating the bitter bread of banishment
whilst you have fed upon my signories
dispark'd my parks and felld my forest woods
from my own windows torn my household coat
raz'd out my imprese leaving me no sign
save mens opinions and my living blood
this and much more much more than twice all this
condemns you to the death see them delivered over
to execution and the hand of death
bushy more welcome is the stroke of death to me
than bolingbroke to england lords farewell
green my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
and plague injustice with the pains of hell
bolingbroke my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd
exeunt northumberland and others with the prisoners
for god's sake fairly let her be entreated
tell her i send to her my kind commends
take special care my greetings be delivered
york a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd
with letters of your love to her at large
bolingbroke thanks gentle uncle come lords away
to fight with glendower and his complices
awhile to work and after holiday exeunt

drums flourish and colours enter the king the bishop of carlisle
aumerle and soldiers
king richard barkloughly castle can they this at hand
aumerle yea my lord how brooks your grace the air
after your late tossing on the breaking seas
king richard needs must i like it well i weep for joy
to stand upon my kingdom once again
dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth
and do thee favours with my royal hands
feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
and heavy gaited toads lie in their way
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
which with usurping steps do trample thee
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies
mock not my senseless conjuration lords
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
prove armed soldiers ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellions arms
carlisle fear not my lord that power that made you king
the means that heaven yields must be embrac'd
and not neglected else if heaven would
and we will not heavens offer we refuse
the proffered means of succour and redress
aumerle he means my lord that we are too remiss
whilst bolingbroke through our security
grows strong and great in substance and in power
king richard discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
in murders and in outrage boldly here
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
and darts his light through every guilty hole
then murders treasons and detested sins
the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs
stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
whilst we were wand'ring with the antipodes
shall see us rising in our throne the east
his treasons will sit blushing in his face
not able to endure the sight of day
but self affrighted tremble at his sin
not all the water in the rough rude sea
can wash the balm off from an anointed king
the breath of worldly men cannot depose
the deputy elected by the lord
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
a glorious angel then if angels fight
weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
enter salisbury
welcome my lord how far off lies your power
salisbury nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but despair
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
o call back yesterday bid time return
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
to day to day unhappy day too late
o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead
are gone to bolingbroke dispers'd and fled
aumerle comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
king richard but now the blood of twenty thousand men
and till so much blood thither come again
have i not reason to look pale and dead
all souls that will be safe fly from my side
for time hath set a blot upon my pride
aumerle comfort my liege remember who you are
king richard i had forgot myself am i not king
awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
is not the king's name twenty thousand names
arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
ye favourites of a king are we not high
high be our thoughts i know my uncle york
hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here
enter scroop
scroop more health and happiness betide my liege
than can my care tund tongue deliver him
king richard mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
say is my kingdom lost why 'twas my care
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
greater he shall not be if he serve god
we'll serve him too and be his fellow so
revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
they break their faith to god as well as us
cry woe destruction ruin and decay
the worst is death and death will have his day
scroop glad am i that your highness is so arm'd
to bear the tidings of calamity
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
as if the world were all dissolv'd to tears
so high above his limits swells the rage
of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
white beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
against thy majesty boys with womens voices
strive to speak big and clap their female joints
in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
of double fatal yew against thy state
yea distaff women manage rusty bills
against thy seat both young and old rebel
and all goes worse than i have power to tell
king richard too well too well thou tellst a tale so in
where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
what is become of bushy where is green
that they have let the dangerous enemy
measure our confines with such peaceful steps
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
scroop peace have they made with him indeed my lord
king richard o villains vipers damnd without redemption
dogs easily won to fawn on any man
snakes in my heart blood warm'd that sting my heart
three judases each one thrice worse than judas
would they make peace terrible hell make war
upon their spotted souls for this offence
scroop sweet love i see changing his property
again uncurse their souls their peace is made
with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
and lie full low grav'd in the hollow ground
aumerle is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
scroop ay all of them at bristow lost their heads
aumerle where is the duke my father with his power
king richard no matter where of comfort no man speak
let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
let's choose executors and talk of wills
and yet not so for what can we bequeath
save our deposed bodies to the ground
our lands our lives and an are bolingbroke's
and nothing can we can our own but death
and that small model of the barren earth
which serves as paste and cover to our bones
for god's sake let us sit upon the ground
how some have been depos'd some slain in war
some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd
some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd
all murder'd for within the hollow crown
that rounds the mortal temples of a king
keeps death his court and there the antic sits
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
allowing him a breath a little scene
to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks
as if this flesh which walls about our life
were brass impregnable and humour'd thus
comes at the last and with a little pin
bores through his castle wall and farewell king
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
with solemn reverence throw away respect
tradition form and ceremonious duty
for you have but mistook me all this while
i live with bread like you feel want
how can you say to me i am a king
carlisle my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes
but presently prevent the ways to wail
to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
and so your follies fight against yourself
fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
and fight and die is death destroying death
where fearing dying pays death servile breath
and learn to make a body of a limb
king richard thou chid'st me well proud bolingbroke i come
to change blows with thee for our day of doom
this ague fit of fear is over blown
an easy task it is to win our own
say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
scroop men judge by the complexion of the sky
the state in inclination of the day
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
i play the torturer by small and small
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
your uncle york is joind with bolingbroke
and all your northern castles yielded up
and all your southern gentlemen in arms
upon his party
king richard thou hast said enough
to aumerle beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
what say you now what comfort have we now
by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly
that bids me be of comfort any more
go to flint castle there i'll pine away
a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey
that power i have discharge and let them go
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
for i have none let no man speak again
to alter this for counsel is but vain
king richard he does me double wrong
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
discharge my followers let them hence away
from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day exeunt
scene 3
wales before flint castle
enter with drum and colours bolingbroke york northumberland
and forces
bolingbroke so that by this intelligence we learn
is gone to meet the king who lately landed
with some few private friends upon this coast
northumberland the news is very fair and good my lord
richard not far from hence hath hid his head
york it would beseem the lord northumberland
to say 'king richard' alack the heavy day
when such a sacred king should hide his head
northumberland your grace mistakes only to be brief
left i his title out
would you have been so brief with him he would
have been so brief with you to shorten you
for taking so the head your whole head's length
bolingbroke mistake not uncle further than you should
york take not good cousin further than you should
lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads
bolingbroke i know it uncle and oppose not myself
against their will but who comes here
enter percy
piercy the castle royally is mannd my lord
against thy entrance
bolingbroke royally
why it contains no king
percy yes my good lord
it doth contain a king king richard lies
within the limits of yon lime and stone
and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury
sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
northumberland o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
bolingbroke to northumberland noble lord
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
into his ruind ears and thus deliver
henry bolingbroke
on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
to his most royal person hither come
provided that my banishment repeald
and lands restor'd again be freely granted
if not i'll use the advantage of my power
and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
raind from the wounds of slaughtered englishmen
the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land
my stooping duty tenderly shall show
upon the grassy carpet of this plain
northumberland advances to the castle with a trumpet
let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum
that from this castle's tottered battlements
our fair appointments may be well perus'd
methinks king richard and myself should meet
with no less terror than the elements
of fire and water when their thund'ring shock
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
my waters on the earth and not on him
march on and mark king richard how he looks
parle without and answer within then a flourish
enter on the walls the king the bishop of carlisle
aumerle scroop and salisbury
see see king richard doth himself appear
as doth the blushing discontented sun
from out the fiery portal of the east
to dim his glory and to stain the track
of his bright passage to the occident
york yet he looks like a king behold his eye
as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth
controlling majesty alack alack for woe
that any harm should stain so fair a show
king richard to northumberland we are amaz'd and thus long
have we stood
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
and if we be how dare thy joints forget
to pay their awful duty to our presence
if we be not show us the hand of god
that hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship
for well we know no hand of blood and bone
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
unless he do profane steal or usurp
and though you think that all as you have done
have torn their souls by turning them from us
yet know my master god omnipotent
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
armies of pestilence and they shall strike
your children yet unborn and unbegot
that lift your vassal hands against my head
and threat the glory of my precious crown
tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands
that every stride he makes upon my land
is dangerous treason he is come to open
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
shall ill become the flower of england's face
change the complexion of her maid pale peace
to scarlet indignation and bedew
her pastures' grass with faithful english blood
northumberland the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
should so with civil and uncivil arms
be rush'd upon thy thrice noble cousin
and by the honourable tomb he swears
that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones
and by the royalties of both your bloods
currents that spring from one most gracious head
and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
and by the worth and honour of himself
comprising all that may be sworn or said
his coming hither hath no further scope
than for his lineal royalties and to beg
which on thy royal party granted once
his glittering arms he will commend to rust
his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
to faithful service of your majesty
this swears he as he is a prince is just
and as i am a gentleman i credit him
king richard northumberland say thus the king returns
his noble cousin is right welcome hither
and all the number of his fair demands
with all the gracious utterance thou hast
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
to aumerle we do debase ourselves cousin do we not
to look so poorly and to speak so fair
shall we call back northumberland and send
defiance to the traitor and so die
aumerle no good my lord let's fight with gentle words
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
king richard o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine
on yon proud man should take it off again
with words of sooth o that i were as great
as is my grief or lesser than my name
or that i could forget what i have been
or not remember what i must be now
swellst thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
aumerle northumberland comes back from bolingbroke
king richard what must the king do now must he submit
the king shall be contented must he lose
the name of king a god's name let it go
i'll give my jewels for a set of beads
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
my gay apparel for an almsmans gown
my figur'd goblets for a dish of wood
my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff
my subjects for a pair of carved saints
and my large kingdom for a little grave
or i'll be buried in the king's high way
some way of common trade where subjects' feet
may hourly trample on their sovereigns head
for on my heart they tread now whilst i live
and buried once why not upon my head
aumerle thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin
we'll make foul weather with despised tears
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
and make a dearth in this revolting land
and make some pretty match with shedding tears
as thus to drop them still upon one place
till they have fretted us a pair of graves
within the earth and therein laid there lies
two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes
would not this ill do well well well i see
i talk but idly and you laugh at me
most mighty prince my lord northumberland
what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
northumberland my lord in the base court he doth attend
to speak with you may it please you to come down
king richard down down i come like glist'ring phaethon
wanting the manage of unruly jades
in the base court base court where kings grow base
to come at traitors' calls and do them grace
in the base court come down down court down king
for night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing
bolingbroke what says his majesty
northumberland sorrow and grief of heart
makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
yet he is come
enter the king and his attendants below
bolingbroke stand all apart
and show fair duty to his majesty he kneels down
my gracious lord
king richard fair cousin you debase your princely knee
me rather had my heart might feel your love
than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy
up cousin up your heart is up i know
touching his own head thus high at least although your
knee be low
bolingbroke my gracious lord i come but for mine own
king richard your own is yours and i am yours and all
bolingbroke so far be mine my most redoubted lord
as my true service shall deserve your love
that know the strong'st and surest way to get
uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes
tears show their love but want their remedies
cousin i am too young to be your father
though you are old enough to be my heir
what you will have i'll give and willing too
for do we must what force will have us do
set on towards london cousin is it so
bolingbroke yea my good lord
scene 4
the duke of york's garden
enter the queen and two ladies
queen what sport shall we devise here in this garden
to drive away the heavy thought of care
lady madam we'll play at bowls
queen 'twill make me think the world is full of rubs
and that my fortune runs against the bias
lady madam we'll dance
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
therefore no dancing girl some other sport
lady madam we'll tell tales
queen of sorrow or of joy
lady of either madam
queen of neither girl
for if of joy being altogether wanting
it doth remember me the more of sorrow
or if of grief being altogether had
for what i have i need not to repeat
and what i want it boots not to complain
lady madam i'll sing
queen 'tis well that thou hast cause
but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
lady i could weep madam would it do you good
queen and i could sing would weeping do me good
and never borrow any tear of thee
enter a gardener and two servants
let's step into the shadow of these trees
my wretchedness unto a row of pins
they will talk of state for every one doth so
against a change woe is forerun with woe
queen and ladies retire
gardener go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
which like unruly children make their sire
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
give some supportance to the bending twigs
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
that look too lofty in our commonwealth
all must be even in our government
you thus employ'd i will go root away
the noisome weeds which without profit suck
the soils fertility from wholesome flowers
servant why should we in the compass of a pale
keep law and form and due proportion
showing as in a model our firm estate
is full of weeds her fairest flowers chok'd up
her fruit trees all unprund her hedges ruind
her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs
swarming with caterpillars
gardener hold thy peace
he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
the weeds which his broad spreading leaves did shelter
that seem'd in eating him to hold him up
i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
servant what are they dead
gardener they are and bolingbroke
hath seiz'd the wasteful king o what pity is it
that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
as we this garden we at time of year
do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees
lest being over proud in sap and blood
with too much riches it confound itself
they might have ev'd to bear and he to taste
their fruits of duty superfluous branches
we lop away that bearing boughs may live
had he done so himself had home the crown
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
servant what think you the king shall be deposed
gardener depress'd he is already and depos'd
'tis doubt he will be letters came last night
to a dear friend of the good duke of york's
queen o i am press'd to death through want of speaking
coming forward
thou old adam's likeness set to dress this garden
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
what eve what serpent hath suggested the
to make a second fall of cursed man
why dost thou say king richard is depos'd
dar'st thou thou little better thing than earth
divine his downfall say where when and how
gardener pardon me madam little joy have
to breathe this news yet what i say is true
king richard he is in the mighty hold
of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh'd
in your lord's scale is nothing but himself
and some few vanities that make him light
but in the balance of great bolingbroke
besides himself are all the english peers
and with that odds he weighs king richard down
i speak no more than every one doth know
queen nimble mischance that art so light of foot
doth not thy embassage belong to me
and am i last that knows it o thou thinkest
to serve me last that i may longest keep
thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go
to meet at london londons king in woe
what was i born to this that my sad look
should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow
exeunt queen and ladies
gardener poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
i would my skill were subject to thy curse
here did she fall a tear here in this place
i'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
in the remembrance of a weeping queen exeunt

enter as to the parliament bolingbroke aumerle northumberland percy
fitzwater surrey the bishop of carlisle the abbot of westminster
and others herald officers and bagot
bolingbroke call forth bagot
now bagot freely speak thy mind
what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death
who wrought it with the king and who perform'd
the bloody office of his timeless end
bagot then set before my face the lord aumerle
bagot my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd
in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted
i heard you say 'is not my arm of length
that reacheth from the restful english court
as far as calais to mine uncle's head'
amongst much other talk that very time
i heard you say that you had rather refuse
the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
adding withal how blest this land would be
in this your cousins death
aumerle princes and noble lords
what answer shall i make to this base man
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars
on equal terms to give him chastisement
either i must or have mine honour soild
with the attainder of his slanderous lips
there is my gage the manual seal of death
and will maintain what thou hast said is false
in thy heart blood through being all too base
to stain the temper of my knightly sword
bolingbroke bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
aumerle excepting one i would he were the best
in all this presence that hath mov'd me so
fitzwater if that thy valour stand on sympathy
there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine
by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death
if thou deniest it twenty times thou liest
and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
where it was forged with my rapier's point
aumerle thou dar'st not coward live to see that day
fitzwater now by my soul i would it were this hour
aumerle fitzwater thou art damnd to hell for this
percy aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
in this appeal as thou art an unjust
to prove it on thee to the extremest point
of mortal breathing seize it if thou dar'st
aumerle an if i do not may my hands rot of
and never brandish more revengeful steel
over the glittering helmet of my foe
another lord i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle
and spur thee on with fun as many lies
as may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear
from sun to sun there is my honour's pawn
aumerle who sets me else by heaven i'll throw at all
i have a thousand spirits in one breast
to answer twenty thousand such as you
surrey my lord fitzwater i do remember well
the very time aumerle and you did talk
fitzwater 'tis very true you were in presence then
and you can witness with me this is true
surrey as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
fitzwater surrey thou liest
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
that it shall render vengeance and revenge
till thou the lie giver and that lie do he
in earth as quiet as thy father's skull
in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn
engage it to the trial if thou dar'st
fitzwater how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live
i dare meet surrey in a wilderness
and lies and lies there is my bond of faith
to tie thee to my strong correction
as i intend to thrive in this new world
aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
besides i heard the banish'd norfolk say
that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
to execute the noble duke at calais
aumerle some honest christian trust me with a gage
that norfolk lies here do i throw down this
bolingbroke these differences shall all rest under gage
till norfolk be repeald repeald he shall be
and though mine enemy restor'd again
to all his lands and signories when he is returnd
against aumerle we will enforce his trial
carlisle that honourable day shall never be seen
many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought
for jesu christ in glorious christian field
streaming the ensign of the christian cross
and toild with works of war retir'd himself
to italy and there at venice gave
his body to that pleasant country's earth
and his pure soul unto his captain christ
under whose colours he had fought so long
bolingbroke why bishop is norfolk dead
carlisle as surely as i live my lord
bolingbroke sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
of good old abraham lords appellants
till we assign you to your days of trial
enter york attended
york great duke of lancaster i come to the
from plume pluck'd richard who with willing soul
adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
to the possession of thy royal hand
ascend his throne descending now from him
and long live henry fourth of that name
bolingbroke in god's name i'll ascend the regal throne
worst in this royal presence may i speak
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
would god that any in this noble presence
were enough noble to be upright judge
of noble richard then true noblesse would
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
what subject can give sentence on his king
and who sits here that is not richard's subject
thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear
and shall the figure of god's majesty
his captain steward deputy elect
anointed crowned planted many years
be judg'd by subject and inferior breath
and he himself not present o forfend it god
that in a christian climate souls refind
should show so heinous black obscene a deed
i speak to subjects and a subject speaks
stirr'd up by god thus boldly for his king
is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king
and if you crown him let me prophesy
the blood of english shall manure the ground
and future ages groan for this foul act
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels
and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
disorder horror fear and mutiny
shall here inhabit and this land be calld
o if you raise this house against this house
it will the woefullest division prove
that ever fell upon this cursed earth
prevent it resist it let it not be so
lest child child's children cry against you woe
northumberland well have you argued sir and for your pains
of capital treason we arrest you here
my lord of westminster be it your charge
to keep him safely till his day of trial
bolingbroke fetch hither richard that in common view
he may surrender so we shall proceed
without suspicion
york i will be his conduct exit
bolingbroke lords you that here are under our arrest
procure your sureties for your days of answer
little are we beholding to your love
and little look'd for at your helping hands
re enter york with king richard and officers
king richard alack why am i sent for to a king
before i have shook off the regal thoughts
wherewith i reignd i hardly yet have learnd
to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
to this submission yet i well remember
the favours of these men were they not mine
did they not sometime cry 'all hail' to me
so judas did to christ but he in twelve
god save the king will no man say amen
am i both priest and clerk well then amen
god save the king although i be not he
and yet amen if heaven do think him me
to do what service am i sent for hither
york to do that office of thine own good will
which tired majesty did make thee offer
the resignation of thy state and crown
to henry bolingbroke
here cousin
on this side my hand and on that side thine
now is this golden crown like a deep well
that owes two buckets filling one another
the emptier ever dancing in the air
the other down unseen and full of water
that bucket down and fun of tears am i
drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
bolingbroke i thought you had been willing to resign
you may my glories and my state depose
but not my griefs still am i king of those
bolingbroke part of your cares you give me with your crown
king richard your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
my care is loss of care by old care done
your care is gain of care by new care won
the cares i give i have though given away
they tend the crown yet still with me they stay
bolingbroke are you contented to resign the crown
therefore no no for i resign to thee
now mark me how i will undo myself
i give this heavy weight from off my head
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
with mine own tears i wash away my balm
with mine own hands i give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
my manors rents revenues i forgo
my acts decrees and statutes i deny
god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
make me that nothing have with nothing griev'd
and thou with all pleas'd that hast an achiev'd
long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit
and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
god save king henry unking'd richard says
what more remains
northumberland no more but that you read
these accusations and these grievous crimes
committed by your person and your followers
against the state and profit of this land
that by confessing them the souls of men
may deem that you are worthily depos'd
king richard must i do so and must i ravel out
my weav'd up follies gentle northumberland
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
there shouldst thou find one heinous article
containing the deposing of a king
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
mark'd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven
nay all of you that stand and look upon me
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
though some of you with pilate wash your hands
have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
and water cannot wash away your sin
northumberland my lord dispatch read o'er these
empty
king richard mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see
and yet salt water blinds them not so much
but they can see a sort of traitors here
nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
i find myself a traitor with the rest
t'undeck the pompous body of a king
made glory base and sovereignty a slave
proud majesty a subject state a peasant
northumberland my lord
king richard no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
nor no mans lord i have no name no tide
no not that name was given me at the font
but 'tis usurp'd alack the heavy day
that i have worn so many winters out
o that i were a mockery king of snow
standing before the sun of bolingbroke
to melt myself away in water drops
good king great king and yet not greatly good
an if my word be sterling yet in england
let it command a mirror hither straight
that it may show me what a face i have
since it is bankrupt of his majesty
bolingbroke go some of you and fetch a looking glass
northumberland read o'er this paper while the glass doth come
king richard fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell
bolingbroke urge it no more my lord northumberland
northumberland the commons will not then be satisfied
king richard they shall be satisfied i'll read enough
when i do see the very book indeed
where all my sins are writ and that's myself
re enter attendant with glass
give me that glass and therein will i read
so many blows upon this face of mine
and made no deeper wounds o flatt'ring glass
like to my followers in prosperity
thou dost beguile me was this face the face
that every day under his household roof
did keep ten thousand men was this the face
that like the sun did make beholders wink
is this the face which fac'd so many follies
that was at last out fac'd by bolingbroke
as brittle as the glory is the face
dashes the glass against the ground
for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers
mark silent king the moral of this sport
how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face
bolingbroke the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
the shadow of your face
king richard say that again
the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see
and these external manner of laments
are merely shadows to the unseen grief
that swells with silence in the tortur'd soul
there lies the substance and i thank thee king
for thy great bounty that not only giv'st
me cause to wail but teachest me the way
how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon
and then be gone and trouble you no more
shall i obtain it
king richard fair cousin i am greater than a king
for when i was a king my flatterers
were then but subjects being now a subject
i have a king here to my flatterer
being so great i have no need to beg
bolingbroke yet ask
king richard and shall i have
bolingbroke you shall
king richard then give me leave to go
king richard whither you will so i were from your sights
bolingbroke go some of you convey him to the tower
king richard o good convey conveyers are you all
that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall
exeunt king richard some lords and a guard
bolingbroke on wednesday next we solemnly set down
our coronation lords prepare yourselves
exeunt all but the abbot of westminster the
bishop of carlisle and aumerle
carlisle the woe's to come the children yet unborn
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
aumerle you holy clergymen is there no plot
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
abbot my lord
before i freely speak my mind herein
you shall not only take the sacrament
to bury mine intents but also to effect
whatever i shall happen to devise
your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
come home with me to supper i will lay
a plot shall show us all a merry day exeunt
act v scene 1
london a street leading to the tower
enter the queen with her attendants
queen this way the king will come this is the way
to julius caesar's ill erected tower
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
here let us rest if this rebellious earth
have any resting for her true king's queen
enter king richard and guard
but soft but see or rather do not see
my fair rose wither yet look up behold
that you in pity may dissolve to dew
and wash him fresh again with true love tears
ah thou the model where old troy did stand
thou map of honour thou king richard's tomb
why should hard favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee
when triumph is become an alehouse guest
king richard join not with grief fair woman do not so
to make my end too sudden learn good soul
to think our former state a happy dream
from which awak'd the truth of what we are
shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet
to grim necessity and he and
will keep a league till death hie thee to france
our holy lives must win a new world's crown
which our profane hours here have thrown down
queen what is my richard both in shape and mind
transform'd and weak'ned hath bolingbroke depos'd
thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
to be o'erpow'r'd and wilt thou pupil like
take the correction mildly kiss the rod
which art a lion and the king of beasts
king richard a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
i had been still a happy king of men
good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for france
think i am dead and that even here thou takest
as from my death bed thy last living leave
in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
of woeful ages long ago betid
tell thou the lamentable tale of me
and send the hearers weeping to their beds
for why the senseless brands will sympathize
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
and in compassion weep the fire out
and some will mourn in ashes some coal black
for the deposing of a rightful king
enter northumberland attended
northumberland my lord the mind of bolingbroke is chang'd
and madam there is order ta'en for you
with all swift speed you must away to france
king richard northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne
the time shall not be many hours of age
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
shall break into corruption thou shalt think
though he divide the realm and give thee half
it is too little helping him to all
to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
being ne'er so little urg'd another way
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
the love of wicked men converts to fear
that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
to worthy danger and deserved death
northumberland my guilt be on my head and there an end
take leave and part for you must part forthwith
king richard doubly divorc'd bad men you violate
and then betwixt me and my married wife
let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me
and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made
part us northumberland i towards the north
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp
she came adorned hither like sweet may
sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day
queen and must we be divided must we part
queen banish us both and send the king with me
northumberland that were some love but little policy
queen then whither he goes thither let me go
king richard so two together weeping make one woe
weep thou for me in france i for thee here
better far off than near be ne'er the near
go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
queen so longest way shall have the longest moans
king richard twice for one step i'll groan the way being short
come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief
since wedding it there is such length in grief
one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
queen give me mine own again 'twere no good part
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
so now i have mine own again be gone
that i may strive to kill it with a groan
king richard we make woe wanton with this fond delay
scene 2
the duke of york's palace
enter the duke of york and the duchess
duchess my lord you told me you would tell the rest
when weeping made you break the story off
of our two cousins' coming into london
york where did i leave
duchess at that sad stop my lord
where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops
york then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
with slow but stately pace kept on his course
whilst all tongues cried 'god save thee bolingbroke'
you would have thought the very windows spake
so many greedy looks of young and old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage and that all the walls
'jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke'
whilst he from the one side to the other turning
bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck
bespake them thus 'i thank you countrymen'
and thus still doing thus he pass'd along
duchess alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
york as in a theatre the eyes of men
after a well grac'd actor leaves the stage
are idly bent on him that enters next
even so or with much more contempt mens eyes
did scowl on gentle richard no man cried 'god save him'
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
his face still combating with tears and smiles
the badges of his grief and patience
that had not god for some strong purpose steeld
the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
but heaven hath a hand in these events
to whose high will we bound our calm contents
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
whose state and honour i for aye allow
duchess here comes my son aumerle
york aumerle that was
but that is lost for being richard's friend
and madam you must call him rudand now
i am in parliament pledge for his truth
enter aumerle
duchess welcome my son who are the violets now
that strew the green lap of the new come spring
aumerle madam i know not nor i greatly care not
god knows i had as lief be none as one
york well bear you well in this new spring of time
lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime
what news from oxford do these justs and triumphs hold
aumerle for aught i know my lord they do
aumerle if god prevent not i purpose so
york what seal is that that without thy bosom
yea look'st thou pale let me see the writing
aumerle my lord 'tis nothing
york no matter then who see it
i will be satisfied let me see the writing
aumerle i do beseech your grace to pardon me
it is a matter of small consequence
which for some reasons i would not have seen
i fear i fear
duchess what should you fear
'tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
for gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day
york bound to himself what doth he with a bond
that he is bound to wife thou art a fool
boy let me see the writing
aumerle i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it
york i will be satisfied let me see it i say
treason foul treason villain traitor slave

duchess thy life answer
york bring me my boots i will unto the king
his man enters with his boots
hence villain never more come in my sight
york give me my boots i say
duchess why york what wilt thou do
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
have we more sons or are we like to have
is not my teeming date drunk up with time
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
and rob me of a happy mother's name
is he not like thee is he not thine own
wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
and interchangeably set down their hands
to kill the king at oxford
duchess he shall be none
we'll keep him here then what is that to him
york away fond woman were he twenty times my son
i would appeach him
duchess hadst thou groand for him
but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
that i have been disloyal to thy bed
and that he is a bastard not thy son
sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind
he is as like thee as a man may be
not like to me or any of my kin
and yet i love him
york make way unruly woman exit
duchess after aumerle mount thee upon his horse
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
i'll not be long behind though i be old
i doubt not but to ride as fast as york
and never will i rise up from the ground
till bolingbroke have pardond thee away be gone

windsor castle
enter bolingbroke as king percy and other lords
'tis full three months since i did see him last
if any plague hang over us 'tis he
i would to god my lords he might be found
inquire at london 'mongst the taverns there
for there they say he daily doth frequent
with unrestrained loose companions
even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
and beat our watch and rob our passengers
which he young wanton and effeminate boy
so dissolute a crew
percy my lord some two days since i saw the prince
and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
bolingbroke and what said the gallant
percy his answer was he would unto the stews
and from the commonst creature pluck a glove
and wear it as a favour and with that
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
bolingbroke as dissolute as desperate yet through both
may happily bring forth but who comes here
enter aumerle amazed
aumerle where is the king
bolingbroke what means our cousin that he stares and looks
so wildly
aumerle god save your grace i do beseech your majesty
to have some conference with your grace alone
bolingbroke withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
exeunt percy and lords
aumerle for ever may my knees grow to the earth
empty
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
bolingbroke intended or committed was this fault
if on the first how heinous e'er it be
to win thy after love i pardon thee
aumerle then give me leave that i may turn the key
that no man enter till my tale be done
the duke of york knocks at the door and crieth
york within my liege beware look to thyself
thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
bolingbroke drawing villain i'll make thee safe
aumerle stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear
york within open the door secure foolhardy king
shall i for love speak treason to thy face
open the door or i will break it open
enter york
recover breath tell us how near is danger
that we may arm us to encounter it
york peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
the treason that my haste forbids me show
aumerle remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd
i do repent me read not my name there
my heart is not confederate with my hand
york it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
i tore it from the traitor's bosom king
forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
bolingbroke o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
o loyal father of a treacherous son
thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
from whence this stream through muddy passages
hath held his current and defild himself
thy overflow of good converts to bad
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
york so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies
thou killst me in his life giving him breath
the traitor lives the true mans put to death
duchess within i what ho my liege for god's sake let me in
bolingbroke what shrill voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry
speak with me pity me open the door
a beggar begs that never begg'd before
bolingbroke our scene is alt'red from a serious thing
and now chang'd to 'the beggar and the king'
my dangerous cousin let your mother in
i know she is come to pray for your foul sin
york if thou do pardon whosoever pray
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
this fest'red joint cut off the rest rest sound
enter duchess
duchess o king believe not this hard hearted man
love loving not itself none other can
york thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
duchess sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
empty
bolingbroke rise up good aunt
duchess not yet i thee beseech
and never see day that the happy sees
till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
aumerle unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee
empty
york against them both my true joints bended be
empty
ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
duchess pleads he in earnest look upon his face
his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
he prays but faintly and would be denied
we pray with heart and soul and all beside
his weary joints would gladly rise i know
our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
ours of true zeal and deep integrity
our prayers do out pray his then let them have
that mercy which true prayer ought to have
duchess do not say 'stand up'
say 'pardon first and afterwards 'stand up'
an if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
'pardon should be the first word of thy speech
i never long'd to hear a word till now
say 'pardon' king let pity teach thee how
the word is short but not so short as sweet
no word like 'pardon for kings' mouths so meet
york speak it in french king say 'pardonne moy'
ah my sour husband my hard hearted lord
that sets the word itself against the word
speak 'pardon as 'tis current in our land
the chopping french we do not understand
thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
pity may move thee 'pardon to rehearse
bolingbroke good aunt stand up
pardon is all the suit i have in hand
bolingbroke i pardon him as god shall pardon me
duchess o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
yet am i sick for fear speak it again
twice saying 'pardon doth not pardon twain
but makes one pardon strong
bolingbroke with all my heart
i pardon him
duchess a god on earth thou art
with all the rest of that consorted crew
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
good uncle help to order several powers
to oxford or where'er these traitors are
they shall not live within this world i swear
but i will have them if i once know where
uncle farewell and cousin adieu

enter sir pierce of exton and a servant
exton didst thou not mark the king what words he spake
'have i no friend will rid me of this living fear'
was it not so
servant these were his very words
exton 'have i no friend' quoth he he spake it twice
and urg'd it twice together did he not
servant he did

that would divorce this terror from my heart'
meaning the king at pomfret come let's go

scene 5
pomfret castle the dungeon of the castle
enter king richard
king richard i have been studying how i may compare
this prison where i live unto the world
and here is not a creature but myself
i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out
my brain i'll prove the female to my soul
my soul the father and these two beget
a generation of still breeding thoughts
and these same thoughts people this little world
in humours like the people of this world
for no thought is contented the better sort
as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd
against the word
as thus 'come little ones' and then again
'it is as hard to come as for a camel
to thread the postern of a small needle's eye'
thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
of this hard world my ragged prison walls
and for they cannot die in their own pride
that they are not the first of fortune's slaves
nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
that many have and others must sit there
and in this thought they find a kind of ease
bearing their own misfortunes on the back
of such as have before endur'd the like
thus play i in one person many people
and none contented sometimes am i king
and so i am then crushing penury
persuades me i was better when a king
then am i king'd again and by and by
think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke
and straight am nothing but whate'er i be
nor i nor any man that but man is
with nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
with being nothing the music plays
music do i hear
when time is broke and no proportion kept
so is it in the music of mens lives
and here have i the daintiness of ear
to check time broke in a disorder'd string
but for the concord of my state and time
had not an ear to hear my true time broke
i wasted time and now doth time waste me
for now hath time made me his numb'ring clock
my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
whereto my finger like a dials point
is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
show minutes times and hours but my time
runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy
while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock
this music mads me let it sound no more
in me it seems it will make wise men mad
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard
is a strange brooch in this all hating world
enter a groom of the stable
groom hail royal prince
king richard thanks noble peer
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
what art thou and how comest thou hither
that brings me food to make misfortune live
groom i was a poor groom of thy stable king
when thou wert king who travelling towards york
with much ado at length have gotten leave
to look upon my sometimes royal master's face
o how it ernd my heart when i beheld
in london streets that coronation day
when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
king richard rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
how went he under him
groom so proudly as if he disdaind the ground
king richard so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
would he not stumble would he not fall down
since pride must have a fall and break the neck
of that proud man that did usurp his back
since thou created to be aw'd by man
wast born to bear i was not made a horse
and yet i bear a burden like an ass
spurr'd galld and tir'd by jauncing bolingbroke

london a street
enter richard duke of gloucester solus
made glorious summer by this sun of york
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
our bruised arms hung up for monuments
our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings
our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grim visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
and now instead of mounting barbed steeds
he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but i that am not shap'd for sportive tricks
nor made to court an amorous looking glass
i that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
i that am curtaild of this fair proportion
cheated of feature by dissembling nature
deform'd unfinish'd sent before my time
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
why i in this weak piping time of peace
have no delight to pass away the time
unless to spy my shadow in the sun
and descant on mine own deformity
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
to entertain these fair well spoken days
i am determined to prove a villain
plots have i laid inductions dangerous
by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
to set my brother clarence and the king
in deadly hate the one against the other
and if king edward be as true and just
as i am subtle false and treacherous
this day should clarence closely be mew'd up
about a prophecy which says that g
of edward's heirs the murderer shall be
enter clarence guarded and brakenbury
brother good day what means this armed guard
that waits upon your grace
clarence his majesty
tend'ring my persons safety hath appointed
this conduct to convey me to th' tower
gloucester upon what cause
clarence because my name is george
gloucester alack my lord that fault is none of yours
o belike his majesty hath some intent
that you should be new christ'ned in the tower
but what's the matter clarence may i know
clarence yea richard when i know for i protest
as yet i do not but as i can learn
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
and from the cross row plucks the letter g
and says a wizard told him that by g
his issue disinherited should be
it follows in his thought that i am he
these as i learn and such like toys as these
hath mov'd his highness to commit me now
gloucester why this it is when men are ruld by women
'tis not the king that sends you to the tower
my lady grey his wife clarence 'tis she
that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship
antony woodville her brother there
from whence this present day he is delivered
we are not safe clarence we are not safe
clarence by heaven i think there is no man is secure
but the queens kindred and night walking heralds
that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
heard you not what an humble suppliant
lord hastings was for her delivery
gloucester humbly complaining to her deity
got my lord chamberlain his liberty
if we will keep in favour with the king
to be her men and wear her livery
the jealous o'er worn widow and herself
since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen
are mighty gossips in our monarchy
brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me
his majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference
of what degree soever with your brother
you may partake of any thing we say
we speak no treason man we say the king
is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
well struck in years fair and not jealous
we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot
a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks
how say you sir can you deny all this
brakenbury with this my lord myself have naught to do
empty
he that doth naught with her excepting one
were best to do it secretly alone
brakenbury what one my lord
gloucester her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
brakenbury i do beseech your grace to pardon me and
empty
forbear your conference with the noble duke
clarence we know thy charge brakenbury and will
gloucester we are the queens abjects and must obey
brother farewell i will unto the king
and whatsoe'er you will employ me in
were it to call king edward's widow sister
i will perform it to enfranchise you
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
touches me deeper than you can imagine
clarence i know it pleaseth neither of us well
gloucester well your imprisonment shall not be long
meantime have patience
clarence i must perforce farewell
exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard
gloucester go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
simple plain clarence i do love thee so
that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
if heaven will take the present at our hands
but who comes here the new delivered hastings
enter lord hastings
gloucester as much unto my good lord chamberlain
well are you welcome to the open air
how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment
hastings with patience noble lord as prisoners must
but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment
gloucester no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
for they that were your enemies are his
and have prevaild as much on him as you
whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
gloucester what news abroad
hastings no news so bad abroad as this at home
the king is sickly weak and melancholy
and his physicians fear him mightily
gloucester now by saint john that news is bad indeed
o he hath kept an evil diet long
and overmuch consum'd his royal person
'tis very grievous to be thought upon
hastings he is
gloucester go you before and i will follow you
exit hastings
he cannot live i hope and must not die
till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven
i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence
with lies well steeld with weighty arguments
and if i fail not in my deep intent
clarence hath not another day to live
and leave the world for me to bustle in
for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter
what though i killd her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends
is to become her husband and her father
the which will i not all so much for love
as for another secret close intent
by marrying her which i must reach unto
but yet i run before my horse to market
when they are gone then must i count my gains exit

enter corpse of king henry the sixth with halberds to guard it
lady anne being the mourner attended by tressel and berkeley
anne set down set down your honourable load
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
th' untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
pale ashes of the house of lancaster
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
to hear the lamentations of poor anne
wife to thy edward to thy slaughtered son
stabb'd by the self same hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
o cursed be the hand that made these holes
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
more direful hap betide that hated wretch
that makes us wretched by the death of thee
than i can wish to adders spiders toads
or any creeping venom'd thing that lives
if ever he have child abortive be it
prodigious and untimely brought to light
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view
if ever he have wife let her be made
more miserable by the death of him
than i am made by my young lord and thee
come now towards chertsey with your holy load
taken from pauls to be interred there
and still as you are weary of this weight
rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse
the bearers take up the coffin
enter gloucester
anne what black magician conjures up this fiend
to stop devoted charitable deeds
gloucester villains set down the corse or by saint paul
i'll make a corse of him that disobeys
first gentleman my lord stand back and let the coffin
empty
gloucester unmannerd dog stand thou when i command
advance thy halberd higher than my breast
or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot
the bearers set down the coffin
anne what do you tremble are you all afraid
alas i blame you not for you are mortal
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
thou hadst but power over his mortal body
his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
gloucester sweet saint for charity be not so curst
anne foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not
filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
behold this pattern of thy butcheries
o gentlemen see see dead henry's wounds
open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
for 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
o god which this blood mad'st revenge his death
o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death
either heav'n with lightning strike the murd'rer dead
or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
which his hell governd arm hath butchered
gloucester lady you know no rules of charity
which renders good for bad blessings for curses
anne villain thou knowest nor law of god nor man
gloucester but i know none and therefore am no beast
anne o wonderful when devils tell the truth
gloucester more wonderful when angels are so angry
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
of these supposed crimes to give me leave
by circumstance but to acquit myself
anne vouchsafe diffus'd infection of a man
of these known evils but to give me leave
by circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
some patient leisure to excuse myself
anne fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
no excuse current but to hang thyself
gloucester by such despair i should accuse myself
anne and by despairing shalt thou stand excused
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
that didst unworthy slaughter upon others
gloucester say that i slew them not
anne then say they were not slain
gloucester i did not kill your husband
anne why then he is alive
gloucester nay he is dead and slain by edward's hands
anne in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw
thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood
the which thou once didst bend against her breast
but that thy brothers beat aside the point
gloucester i was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
that never dream'st on aught but butcheries
didst thou not kill this king
gloucester i grant ye
anne dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me to
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
o he was gentle mild and virtuous
gloucester the better for the king of heaven that hath
empty
anne he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
empty
for he was fitter for that place than earth
anne and thou unfit for any place but hell
gloucester yes one place else if you will hear me name it
anne some dungeon
gloucester your bed chamber
anne ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
gloucester so will it madam till i lie with you
anne i hope so
to leave this keen encounter of our wits
and fall something into a slower method
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these plantagenets henry and edward
as blameful as the executioner
anne thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect
gloucester your beauty was the cause of that effect
your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
to undertake the death of all the world
anne if i thought that i tell thee homicide
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
gloucester these eyes could not endure that beauty's
empty
you should not blemish it if i stood by
as all the world is cheered by the sun
so i by that it is my day my life
anne black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life
gloucester curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
gloucester it is a quarrel most unnatural
to be reveng'd on him that loveth thee
anne it is a quarrel just and reasonable
to be reveng'd on him that killd my husband
gloucester he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
did it to help thee to a better husband
anne his better doth not breathe upon the earth
gloucester he lives that loves thee better than he could
anne name him
anne why that was he
gloucester the self same name but one of better nature
anne where is he
gloucester here she spits at him why dost thou spit
at me
anne would it were mortal poison for thy sake
gloucester never came poison from so sweet a place
anne never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes
anne would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
gloucester i would they were that i might die at once
for now they kill me with a living death
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops
these eyes which never shed remorseful tear
no when my father york and edward wept
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
when black fac'd clifford shook his sword at him
told the sad story of my father's death
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
that all the standers by had wet their cheeks
like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
i never sued to friend nor enemy
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
she looks scornfully at him
teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword
which if thou please to hide in this true breast
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabb'd young edward
but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on
she falls the sword
take up the sword again or take up me
anne arise dissembler though i wish thy death
i will not be thy executioner
anne i have already
gloucester that was in thy rage
speak it again and even with the word
this hand which for thy love did kill thy love
shall for thy love kill a far truer love
to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
anne i would i knew thy heart
gloucester 'tis figur'd in my tongue
anne i fear me both are false
anne well put up your sword
gloucester say then my peace is made
anne that shalt thou know hereafter
gloucester but shall i live in hope
anne all men i hope live so
gloucester vouchsafe to wear this ring
anne to take is not to give puts on the ring
gloucester look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
and if thy poor devoted servant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
anne what is it
gloucester that it may please you leave these sad designs
to him that hath most cause to be a mourner
and presently repair to crosby house
where after i have solemnly interr'd
at chertsey monast'ry this noble king
i will with all expedient duty see you
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
grant me this boon
anne with all my heart and much it joys me too
to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
gloucester bid me farewell
anne 'tis more than you deserve
but since you teach me how to flatter you
exeunt two gentlemen with lady anne
gloucester sirs take up the corse
gentlemen towards chertsey noble lord
gloucester no to white friars there attend my coming
exeunt all but gloucester
was ever woman in this humour woo'd
was ever woman in this humour won
i'll have her but i will not keep her long
what i that killd her husband and his father
with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
the bleeding witness of my hatred by
having god her conscience and these bars against me
and i no friends to back my suit at all
but the plain devil and dissembling looks
and yet to win her all the world to nothing
empty
hath she forgot already that brave prince
edward her lord whom i some three months since
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
fram'd in the prodigality of nature
young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet abase her eyes on me
that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
and made her widow to a woeful bed
on me whose all not equals edward's moiety
on me that halts and am misshapen thus
i do mistake my person all this while
upon my life she finds although i cannot
myself to be a marv'llous proper man
i'll be at charges for a looking glass
and entertain a score or two of tailors
to study fashions to adorn my body
since i am crept in favour with myself
i will maintain it with some little cost
but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
that i may see my shadow as i pass exit

enter gloucester hastings and dorset
gloucester they do me wrong and i will not endure it
who is it that complains unto the king
that i forsooth am stern and love them not
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because i cannot flatter and look fair
smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
duck with french nods and apish courtesy
i must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm
but thus his simple truth must be abus'd
with silken sly insinuating jacks
grey to who in all this presence speaks your grace
when have i injur'd thee when done thee wrong
or thee or thee or any of your faction
a plague upon you all his royal grace
whom god preserve better than you would wish
cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
queen elizabeth brother of gloucester you mistake the
empty
the king on his own royal disposition
aiming belike at your interior hatred
that in your outward action shows itself
against my children brothers and myself
makes him to send that he may learn the ground
gloucester i cannot tell the world is grown so bad
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
since every jack became a gentleman
there's many a gentle person made a jack
queen elizabeth come come we know your meaning
you envy my advancement and my friends'
god grant we never may have need of you
gloucester meantime god grants that i have need of you
our brother is imprisond by your means
myself disgrac'd and the nobility
held in contempt while great promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
queen elizabeth by him that rais'd me to this careful
from that contented hap which i enjoy'd
i never did incense his majesty
against the duke of clarence but have been
an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
gloucester you may deny that you were not the mean
of my lord hastings' late imprisonment
rivers she may my lord for
not so
she may do more sir than denying that
she may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein
and lay those honours on your high desert
what may she not she may ay marry may she
rivers what marry may she
gloucester what marry may she marry with a king
a bachelor and a handsome stripling too
queen elizabeth my lord of gloucester i have too long
empty
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
of those gross taunts that oft i have endur'd
i had rather be a country servant maid
than a great queen with this condition
to be so baited scornd and stormed at
enter old queen margaret behind
queen margaret and less'ned be that small god i
beseech him
thy honour state and seat is due to me
gloucester what threat you me with telling of the
empty
tell him and spare not look what i have said
i will avouch't in presence of the king
i dare adventure to be sent to th' tow'r
'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
empty
thou killdst my husband henry in the tower
and edward my poor son at tewksbury
gloucester ere you were queen ay or your husband
empty
i was a pack horse in his great affairs
a weeder out of his proud adversaries
a liberal rewarder of his friends
to royalize his blood i spent mine own
empty
gloucester in all which time you and your husband grey
were factious for the house of lancaster
and rivers so were you was not your husband
in margaret's battle at saint albans slain
let me put in your minds if you forget
what you have been ere this and what you are
withal what i have been and what i am
queen margaret a murd'rous villain and so still thou art
ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon
queen margaret which god revenge
gloucester to fight on edward's party for the crown
and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up
i would to god my heart were flint like edward's
or edward's soft and pitiful like mine
i am too childish foolish for this world
queen margaret hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
empty
rivers my lord of gloucester in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies
we follow'd then our lord our sovereign king
so should we you if you should be our king
gloucester if i should be i had rather be a pedlar
far be it from my heart the thought thereof
queen elizabeth as little joy my lord as you suppose
you should enjoy were you this country's king
as little joy you may suppose in me
queen margaret as little joy enjoys the queen thereof
for i am she and altogether joyless
i can no longer hold me patient advancing
hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
in sharing that which you have pilld from me
which of you trembles not that looks on me
if not that i am queen you bow like subjects
yet that by you depos'd you quake like rebels
ah gentle villain do not turn away
empty
queen margaret but repetition of what thou hast marr'd
that will i make before i let thee go
gloucester wert thou not banished on pain of death
queen margaret i was but i do find more pain in
empty
than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou ow'st to me
and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
gloucester the curse my noble father laid on thee
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout
steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
his curses then from bitterness of soul
denounc'd against thee are all falln upon thee
and god not we hath plagu'd thy bloody deed
hastings o 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
and the most merciless that e'er was heard of
rivers tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
dorset no man but prophesied revenge for it
buckingham northumberland then present wept to see it
queen margaret what were you snarling all before i came
ready to catch each other by the throat
and turn you all your hatred now on me
did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
their kingdom's loss my woeful banishment
should all but answer for that peevish brat
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
though not by war by surfeit die your king
as ours by murder to make him a king
edward thy son that now is prince of wales
for edward our son that was prince of wales
die in his youth by like untimely violence
outlive thy glory like my wretched self
long mayest thou live to wail thy childrens death
and see another as i see thee now
deck'd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
long die thy happy days before thy death
and after many length'ned hours of grief
die neither mother wife nor england's queen
rivers and dorset you were standers by
and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
that none of you may live his natural age
but by some unlook'd accident cut off
gloucester have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd
empty
queen margaret and leave out thee stay dog for thou
shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace
the worm of conscience still be gnaw thy soul
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
unless it be while some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
thou elvish mark'd abortive rooting hog

gloucester margaret
queen margaret richard
gloucester ha
queen margaret i call thee not
gloucester i cry thee mercy then for i did think
that thou hadst calld me all these bitter names

gloucester 'tis done by me and ends in margaret
queen elizabeth thus have you breath'd your curse

queen margaret poor painted queen vain flourish of my

whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself
to help thee curse this poisonous bunch back'd toad

lest to thy harm thou move our patience
queen margaret foul shame upon you you have all
mov'd mine
rivers were you well serv'd you would be taught your
empty
queen margaret to serve me well you all should do me
empty
o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dorset dispute not with her she is lunatic
queen margaret peace master marquis you are malapert
your fire new stamp of honour is scarce current
o that your young nobility could judge
what 'twere to lose it and be miserable
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
gloucester good counsel marry learn it learn it marquis
gloucester ay and much more but i was born so high
our aery buildeth in the cedar's top
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
queen margaret and turns the sun to shade alas alas
witness my son now in the shade of death
whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath
hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aery's nest
o god that seest it do not suffer it
buckingham peace peace for shame if not for charity
queen margaret urge neither charity nor shame to me
uncharitably with me have you dealt
and shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd
my charity is outrage life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage
buckingham have done have done
queen margaret o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy
empty

thy garments are not spotted with our blood
nor thou within the compass of my curse
buckingham nor no one here for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air
queen margaret i will not think but they ascend the sky
and there awake god's gentle sleeping peace
o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
have not to do with him beware of him
sin death and hell have set their marks on him
and all their ministers attend on him
gloucester what doth she say my lord of buckingham
buckingham nothing that i respect my gracious lord
queen margaret what dost thou scorn me for my gentle
empty
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
o but remember this another day
and say poor margaret was a prophetess
live each of you the subjects to his hate
and he to yours and all of you to god's exit
buckingham my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
rivers and so doth mine i muse why she's at liberty
gloucester i cannot blame her by god's holy mother
she hath had too much wrong and i repent
my part thereof that i have done to her
queen elizabeth i never did her any to my knowledge
i was too hot to do somebody good
that is too cold in thinking of it now
marry as for clarence he is well repaid
he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
god pardon them that are the cause thereof
rivers a virtuous and a christian like conclusion
to pray for them that have done scathe to us
gloucester so do i ever aside being well advis'd
for had i curs'd now i had curs'd myself
catesby madam his majesty doth can for you
and for your grace and you my gracious lords
queen elizabeth catesby i come lords will you go
with me
rivers we wait upon your grace
exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
i lay unto the grievous charge of others
i do beweep to many simple gulls
namely to derby hastings buckingham
and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me
to be reveng'd on rivers dorset grey
but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
tell them that god bids us do good for evil
and thus i clothe my naked villainy
and seem a saint when most i play the devil
enter two murderers
but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates
are you now going to dispatch this thing
first murderer we are my lord and come to have the
empty
that we may be admitted where he is
gloucester well thought upon i have it here about me
when you have done repair to crosby place
but sirs be sudden in the execution
withal obdurate do not hear him plead
for clarence is well spoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
first murderer tut tut my lord we will not stand to
empty
talkers are no good doers be assur'd
we go to use our hands and not our tongues
empty
i like you lads about your business straight
go go dispatch
first murderer we will my noble lord exeunt
scene 4
london the tower
enter clarence and keeper
keeper why looks your grace so heavily to day
clarence o i have pass'd a miserable night
that as i am a christian faithful man
i would not spend another such a night
though 'twere to buy a world of happy days
so full of dismal terror was the time
keeper what was your dream my lord i pray you
tell me
clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower
and was embark'd to cross to burgundy
and in my company my brother gloucester
upon the hatches thence we look'd toward england
and cited up a thousand heavy times
during the wars of york and lancaster
that had befalln us as we pac'd along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches
methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
struck me that thought to stay him overboard
into the tumbling billows of the main
o lord methought what pain it was to drown
what sights of ugly death within my eyes
methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
a thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon
wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
inestimable stones unvalued jewels
all scatt'red in the bottom of the sea
some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes
where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
as 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by
keeper had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon these secrets of the deep
clarence methought i had and often did i strive
to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
to find the empty vast and wand'ring air
but smother'd it within my panting bulk
who almost burst to belch it in the sea
clarence no no my dream was lengthend after life
o then began the tempest to my soul
i pass'd methought the melancholy flood
with that sour ferryman which poets write of
unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul
was my great father in law renowned warwick
who spake aloud 'what scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence'
a shadow like an angel with bright hair
dabbled in blood and he shriek'd out aloud
'clarence is come false fleeting perjur'd clarence
that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury
seize on him furies take him unto torment'
with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
environd me and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries that with the very noise
i trembling wak'd and for a season after
such terrible impression made my dream
keeper no marvel lord though it affrighted you
i am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
clarence ah keeper keeper i have done these things
that now give evidence against my soul
for edward's sake and see how he requites me
o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
but thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds
yet execute thy wrath in me alone
keeper i prithee sit by me awhile
my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
keeper i will my lord god give your grace good rest
clarence sleeps
enter brakenbury the lieutenant
brakenbury sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
makes the night morning and the noontide night
princes have but their titles for their glories
an outward honour for an inward toil
they often feel a world of restless cares
so that between their tides and low name
there's nothing differs but the outward fame
enter the two murderers
first murderer ho who's here
brakenbury what wouldst thou fellow and how cam'st
thou hither
first murderer i would speak with clarence and i came
hither on my legs
second murderer 'tis better sir than to be tedious let
him see our commission and talk no more
brakenbury reads it
brakenbury i am in this commanded to deliver
the noble duke of clarence to your hands
i will not reason what is meant hereby
because i will be guiltless from the meaning
there lies the duke asleep and there the keys
i'll to the king and signify to him
first murderer you may sir 'tis a point of wisdom fare
you well exeunt brakenbury and keeper
second murderer what shall i stab him as he sleeps
first murderer no he'll say 'twas done cowardly when
he wakes
second murderer why he shall never wake until the great
empty
first murderer why then he'll say we stabb'd him
empty
bred a kind of remorse in me
first murderer what art thou afraid
second murderer not to kill him having a warrant but to
be damnd for killing him from the which no warrant can
defend me
first murderer i thought thou hadst been resolute
second murderer so i am to let him live
first murderer i'll back to the duke of gloucester and
tell him so
passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to
hold me but while one tells twenty
first murderer how dost thou feel thyself now
second murderer faith some certain dregs of conscience
are yet within me
first murderer remember our reward when the deed's
empty
second murderer zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
first murderer where's thy conscience now
first murderer when he opens his purse to give us our
reward thy conscience flies out
second murderer 'tis no matter let it go there's few or
none will entertain it
first murderer what if it come to thee again
second murderer i'll not meddle with it it makes a man
coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man
cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his
neighbour's wife but it detects him 'tis a blushing shame
full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
that by chance i found it beggars any man that keeps it
it is turnd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing
and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
to himself and live without it
first murderer zounds 'tis even now at my elbow
persuading me not to kill the duke
second murderer take the devil in thy mind and believe
him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the
first murderer i am strong fram'd he cannot prevail with
empty
second murderer spoke like a tall man that respects thy
reputation come shall we fall to work
first murderer take him on the costard with the hilts of
thy sword and then chop him in the malmsey butt in the
next room
second murderer o excellent device and make a sop of
empty
second murderer strike
first murderer no we'll reason with him
clarence where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
second murderer you shall have wine enough my lord
empty
clarence in god's name what art thou
first murderer a man as you are
clarence but not as i am royal
second murderer nor you as we are loyal
first murderer my voice is now the king's my looks
mine own
clarence how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
your eyes do menace me why look you pale
who sent you hither wherefore do you come
second murderer to to to
clarence to murder me
both murderers ay ay
clarence you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
wherein my friends have i offended you
first murderer offended us you have not but the king
clarence i shall be reconcild to him again
second murderer never my lord therefore prepare to die
clarence are you drawn forth among a world of men
to slay the innocent what is my offence
where is the evidence that doth accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge or who pronounc'd
before i be convict by course of law
to threaten me with death is most unlawful
i charge you as you hope to have redemption
by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable
first murderer what we will do we do upon command
second murderer and he that hath commanded is our
empty
hath in the tables of his law commanded
that thou shalt do no murder will you then
spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand
to hurl upon their heads that break his law
second murderer and that same vengeance doth he hurl
on thee
for false forswearing and for murder too
thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
first murderer and like a traitor to the name of god
didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reigns son
second murderer whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
empty
first murderer how canst thou urge god's dreadful law
to us
when thou hast broke it in such dear degree
clarence alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
he sends you not to murder me for this
for in that sin he is as deep as i
if god will be avenged for the deed
o know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his pow'rful arm
he needs no indirect or lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him
first murderer who made thee then a bloody minister
when gallant springing brave plantagenet
clarence my brother's love the devil and my rage
first murderer thy brother's love our duty and thy
empty
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence if you do love my brother hate not me
i am his brother and i love him well
if you are hir'd for meed go back again
and i will send you to my brother gloucester
who shall reward you better for my life
second murderer you are deceiv'd your brother gloucester
hates you
clarence o no he loves me and he holds me dear
go you to him from me
first murderer ay so we will
clarence tell him when that our princely father york
bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
and charg'd us from his soul to love each other
he little thought of this divided friendship
first murderer ay millstones as he lessond us to weep
clarence o do not slander him for he is kind
first murderer right as snow in harvest come you
deceive yourself
'tis he that sends us to destroy you here
clarence it cannot be for he bewept my fortune
and hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs
that he would labour my delivery
first murderer why so he doth when he delivers you
second murderer make peace with god for you must die
my lord
clarence have you that holy feeling in your souls
to counsel me to make my peace with god
and are you yet to your own souls so blind
that you will war with god by murd'ring me
o sirs consider they that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed
second murderer what shall we do
first murderer relent no 'tis cowardly and womanish
clarence not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a prince's son
being pent from liberty as i am now
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
would not entreat for life
my friend i spy some pity in thy looks
o if thine eye be not a flatterer
come thou on my side and entreat for me
a begging prince what beggar pities not
second murderer look behind you my lord
first murderer stabbing him take that and that if all
this will not do
i'll drown you in the malmsey butt within
exit with the body
second murderer a bloody deed and desperately
empty
how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
re enter first murderer
first murderer how now what meanst thou that thou
help'st me not
by heavens the duke shall know how slack you have
empty
second murderer i would he knew that i had sav'd his
empty
take thou the fee and tell him what i say
for i repent me that the duke is slain exit
well i'll go hide the body in some hole
till that the duke give order for his burial
and when i have my meed i will away
for this will out and then i must not stay exit

since i have made my friends at peace on earth
hastings and rivers take each other's hand
dissemble not your hatred swear your love
rivers by heaven my soul is purg'd from grudging hate
and with my hand i seal my true heart's love
king edward take heed you dally not before your king
lest he that is the supreme king of kings
confound your hidden falsehood and award
either of you to be the other's end
hastings so prosper i as i swear perfect love
rivers and i as i love hastings with my heart
king edward madam yourself is not exempt from this
nor you son dorset buckingham nor you

and what you do do it unfeignedly

dorset this interchange of love i here protest
upon my part shall be inviolable

and make me happy in your unity
buckingham to the queen whenever buckingham
doth turn his hate
upon your grace but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours god punish me
with hate in those where i expect most love
when i have most need to employ a friend
deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
be he unto me this do i beg of god
when i am cold in love to you or yours
they embrace
king edward a pleasing cordial princely buckingham
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here
to make the blessed period of this peace
buckingham and in good time
enter gloucester and ratcliff
gloucester good morrow to my sovereign king and
empty
and princely peers a happy time of day
king edward happy indeed as we have spent the day
gloucester we have done deeds of charity
made peace of enmity fair love of hate
between these swelling wrong incensed peers
gloucester a blessed labour my most sovereign lord
by false intelligence or wrong surmise
hold me a foe
if i unwittingly or in my rage
have aught committed that is hardly borne
to any in this presence i desire
to reconcile me to his friendly peace
'tis death to me to be at enmity
i hate it and desire all good mens love
first madam i entreat true peace of you
of you my noble cousin buckingham
if ever any grudge were lodg'd between us
of you and you lord rivers and of dorset
that all without desert have frownd on me
of you lord woodville and lord scales of you
dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
i do not know that englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born to night
queen elizabeth a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign lord i do beseech your highness
to take our brother clarence to your grace
gloucester why madam have i off'red love for this
to be so flouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
they all start
you do him injury to scorn his corse
he is
queen elizabeth all seeing heaven what a world is this
buckingham look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
dorset ay my good lord and no man in the presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
king edward is clarence dead the order was revers'd
gloucester but he poor man by your first order died
and that a winged mercury did bear
some tardy cripple bare the countermand
god grant that some less noble and less loyal
nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
and yet go current from suspicion
enter derby
derby a boon my sovereign for my service done
king edward i prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow
derby i will not rise unless your highness hear me
king edward then say at once what is it thou requests
who slew to day a riotous gentleman
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
king edward have i a tongue to doom my brother's death
and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
my brother killed no man his fault was thought
and yet his punishment was bitter death
who sued to me for him who in my wrath
kneeld at my feet and bid me be advis'd
who spoke of brotherhood who spoke of love
the mighty warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field at tewksbury
when oxford had me down he rescued me
and said 'dear brother live and be a king'
who told me when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death how he did lap me
even in his garments and did give himself
all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
had so much race to put it in my mind
but when your carters or your waiting vassals
have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
the precious image of our dear redeemer
you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
and i unjustly too must grant it you derby rises
but for my brother not a man would speak
nor i ungracious speak unto myself
for him poor soul the proudest of you all
yet none of you would once beg for his life
o god i fear thy justice will take hold
on me and you and mine and yours for this
come hastings help me to my closet ah poor clarence
exeunt some with king and queen
gloucester this is the fruits of rashness mark'd you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
look'd pale when they did hear of clarence' death
o they did urge it still unto the king
to comfort edward with our company
buckingham we wait upon your grace exeunt

son good grandam tell us is our father dead
duchess no boy
daughter why do you weep so oft and beat your breast
and cry 'o clarence my unhappy son'
and call us orphans wretches castaways
if that our noble father were alive
duchess my pretty cousins you mistake me both
i do lament the sickness of the king
as loath to lose him not your father's death
it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost
son then you conclude my grandam he is dead
the king mine uncle is to blame for it
god will revenge it whom i will importune
daughter and so will i
duchess peace children peace the king doth love you
empty
incapable and shallow innocents
you cannot guess who caus'd your father's death
son grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
told me the king provok'd to it by the queen
devis'd impeachments to imprison him
and when my uncle told me so he wept
bade me rely on him as on my father
and he would love me dearly as a child
duchess ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape
and with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice
he is my son ay and therein my shame
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
son think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
duchess ay boy
son i cannot think it hark what noise is this
ears rivers and dorset after her
queen elizabeth ah who shall hinder me to wail and
empty
to chide my fortune and torment myself
i'll join with black despair against my soul
and to myself become an enemy
duchess what means this scene of rude impatience
queen elizabeth to make an act of tragic violence
edward my lord thy son our king is dead
why wither not the leaves that want their sap
if you will live lament if die be brief
that our swift winged souls may catch the king's
or like obedient subjects follow him
to his new kingdom of ne'er changing night
duchess ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
as i had title in thy noble husband
i have bewept a worthy husband's death
and liv'd with looking on his images
are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
and i for comfort have but one false glass
that grieves me when i see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
and hast the comfort of thy children left
but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands
clarence and edward o what cause have i
thine being but a moiety of my moan
son ah aunt you wept not for our father's death
how can we aid you with our kindred tears
daughter our fatherless distress was left unmoand
your widow dolour likewise be unwept
queen elizabeth give me no help in lamentation
i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
that i being governd by the watery moon
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
children ah for our father for our dear lord clarence
duchess alas for both both mine edward and clarence
queen elizabeth what stay had i but edward and he's
empty
children what stay had we but clarence and he's gone
duchess what stays had i but they and they are gone
queen elizabeth was never widow had so dear a loss
children were never orphans had so dear a loss
duchess was never mother had so dear a loss
their woes are parcelld mine is general
she for an edward weeps and so do i
i for a clarence weep so doth not she
these babes for clarence weep and so do i
i for an edward weep so do not they
alas you three on me threefold distress'd
pour all your tears i am your sorrow's nurse
and i will pamper it with lamentation
dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeas'd
in common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
with dull unwillingness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
much more to be thus opposite with heaven
for it requires the royal debt it lent you
rivers madam bethink you like a careful mother
of the young prince your son send straight for him
let him be crownd in him your comfort lives
drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave
enter gloucester buckingham derby
hastings and ratcliff
gloucester sister have comfort all of us have cause
to wail the dimming of our shining star

madam my mother i do cry you mercy
i did not see your grace humbly on my knee
i crave your blessing
duchess god bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
gloucester amen aside and make me die a good old
empty
that is the butt end of a mother's blessing
i marvel that her grace did leave it out
buckingham you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing
empty
that bear this heavy mutual load of moan
now cheer each other in each other's love
though we have spent our harvest of this king
the broken rancour of your high swoln hearts
but lately splinter'd knit and joind together
must gently be preserv'd cherish'd and kept
me seemeth good that with some little train
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet
hither to london to be crownd our king
rivers why with some little train my lord of
empty
buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude
which would be so much the more dangerous
by how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd
where every horse bears his commanding rein
and may direct his course as please himself
as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
in my opinion ought to be prevented
gloucester i hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me
rivers and so in me and so i think in an
to no apparent likelihood of breach
which haply by much company might be urg'd
therefore i say with noble buckingham
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
hastings and so say i
gloucester then be it so and go we to determine
who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
madam and you my sister will you go
to give your censures in this business
buckingham my lord whoever journeys to the prince
for god sake let not us two stay at home
for by the way i'll sort occasion
as index to the story we late talk'd of

second citizen ay sir it is too true god help the while
third citizen then masters look to see a troublous

first citizen no no by god's good grace his son shall
third citizen woe to that land that's governd by a child
second citizen in him there is a hope of government
which in his nonage council under him
and in his full and ripened years himself
no doubt shall then and till then govern well
first citizen so stood the state when henry the sixth
was crownd in paris but at nine months old
third citizen stood the state so no no good friends
god wot
with politic grave counsel then the king
had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
first citizen why so hath this both by his father and
empty
third citizen better it were they all came by his father
or by his father there were none at all
for emulation who shall now be nearest
will touch us all too near if god prevent not
o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
and were they to be ruld and not to rule
this sickly land might solace as before
first citizen come come we fear the worst all will be
empty
third citizen when clouds are seen wise men put on
their cloaks
when great leaves fall then winter is at hand
when the sun sets who doth not look for night
untimely storms make men expect a dearth
'tis more than we deserve or i expect
second citizen truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
you cannot reason almost with a man
that looks not heavily and fun of dread
third citizen before the days of change still is it so
by a divine instinct mens minds mistrust
ensuing danger as by proof we see
the water swell before a boist'rous storm
but leave it all to god whither away
third citizen and so was i i'll bear you company

york grandam one night as we did sit at supper
my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow
more than my brother 'ay' quoth my uncle gloucester
'small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace'
because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste
duchess good faith good faith the saying did not hold
in him that did object the same to thee
he was the wretched'st thing when he was young
so long a growing and so leisurely
that if his rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop and so no doubt he is my gracious madam
duchess i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york now by my troth if i had been rememb'red
to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine
duchess how my young york i prithee let me hear it
york marry they say my uncle grew so fast
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
grandam this would have been a biting jest
duchess i prithee pretty york who told thee this

queen elizabeth ay me i see the ruin of my house
the tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind
insulting tyranny begins to jet
upon the innocent and aweless throne
welcome destruction blood and massacre
i see as in a map the end of all
duchess accursed and unquiet wrangling days
how many of you have mine eyes beheld
my husband lost his life to get the crown
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
and being seated and domestic broils
clean over blown themselves the conquerors

blood to blood self against self o preposterous
and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
or let me die to look on death no more
queen elizabeth come come my boy we will to

act iii scene 1
the trumpets sound enter the prince of wales gloucester buckingham
catesby cardinal bourchier and others
buckingham welcome sweet prince to london to your
empty
gloucester welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy
prince no uncle but our crosses on the way
have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
i want more uncles here to welcome me
empty
hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit
nor more can you distinguish of a man
than of his outward show which god he knows
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
those uncles which you want were dangerous
your grace attended to their sug'red words
but look'd not on the poison of their hearts
god keep you from them and from such false friends
empty
gloucester my lord the mayor of london comes to greet
empty
enter the lord mayor and his train
mayor god bless your grace with health and happy days
prince i thank you good my lord and thank you all
i thought my mother and my brother york
would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
enter lord hastings
buckingham and in good time here comes the sweating
empty
prince welcome my lord what will our mother come
hastings on what occasion god he knows not i
the queen your mother and your brother york
have taken sanctuary the tender prince
would fain have come with me to meet your grace
but by his mother was perforce withheld
is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
persuade the queen to send the duke of york
unto his princely brother presently
if she deny lord hastings go with him
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
cardinal my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
can from his mother win the duke of york
anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
would i be guilty of so deep a sin
buckingham you are too senseless obstinate my lord
too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age
you break not sanctuary in seizing him
the benefit thereof is always granted
to those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
and those who have the wit to claim the place
and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
then taking him from thence that is not there
you break no privilege nor charter there
oft have i heard of sanctuary men
but sanctuary children never till now
cardinal my lord you shall o'errule my mind for once
come on lord hastings will you go with me
hastings i go my lord
prince good lords make all the speedy haste you may
say uncle gloucester if our brother come
where shall we sojourn till our coronation
gloucester where it seems best unto your royal self
if i may counsel you some day or two
your highness shall repose you at the tower
then where you please and shall be thought most fit
for your best health and recreation
prince i do not like the tower of any place
did julius caesar build that place my lord
which since succeeding ages have re edified
prince is it upon record or else reported
successively from age to age he built it
buckingham upon record my gracious lord
prince but say my lord it were not regist'red
methinks the truth should eve from age to age
as 'twere retaild to all posterity
even to the general all ending day
gloucester aside so wise so young they say do never
prince what say you uncle
gloucester i say without characters fame lives long
aside thus like the formal vice iniquity
i moralize two meanings in one word
prince that julius caesar was a famous man
with what his valour did enrich his wit
his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror
for now he lives in fame though not in life
buckingham what my gracious lord
prince an if i live until i be a man
i'll win our ancient right in france again
or die a soldier as i liv'd a king
gloucester aside short summers lightly have a forward
empty
enter hastings young york and the cardinal
buckingham now in good time here comes the duke of
empty
york well my dread lord so must i can you now
prince ay brother to our grief as it is yours
too late he died that might have kept that title
which by his death hath lost much majesty
gloucester how fares our cousin noble lord of york
york i thank you gentle uncle o my lord
you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
gloucester he hath my lord
gloucester o my fair cousin i must not say so
york then he is more beholding to you than i
gloucester he may command me as my sovereign
but you have power in me as in a kinsman
york i pray you uncle give me this dagger
gloucester my dagger little cousin with all my heart
prince a beggar brother
york of my kind uncle that i know will give
and being but a toy which is no grief to give
york a greater gift o that's the sword to it
gloucester ay gentle cousin were it light enough
york o then i see you will part but with light gifts
in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay
gloucester it is too heavy for your grace to wear
york i weigh it lightly were it heavier
gloucester what would you have my weapon little
empty
york i would that i might thank you as you call me
york little
prince my lord of york will still be cross in talk
uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
york you mean to bear me not to bear with me
uncle my brother mocks both you and me
because that i am little like an ape
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
buckingham with what a sharp provided wit he reasons
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
so cunning and so young is wonderful
gloucester my lord willt please you pass along
myself and my good cousin buckingham
will to your mother to entreat of her
to meet you at the tower and welcome you
york what will you go unto the tower my lord
prince my lord protector needs will have it so
york i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
gloucester why what should you fear
my grandam told me he was murder'd there
prince i fear no uncles dead
gloucester nor none that live i hope
prince an if they live i hope i need not fear
but come my lord and with a heavy heart
thinking on them go i unto the tower
a sennet
exeunt all but gloucester buckingham and catesby
buckingham think you my lord this little prating york
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
gloucester no doubt no doubt o 'tis a perilous boy
bold quick ingenious forward capable
he is all the mother's from the top to toe
buckingham well let them rest come hither catesby
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
as closely to conceal what we impart
thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way
what think'st thou is it not an easy matter
for the instalment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle
catesby he for his father's sake so loves the prince
that he will not be won to aught against him
buckingham what think'st thou then of stanley will
not he
catesby he will do all in all as hastings doth
buckingham well then no more but this go gentle
empty
how he doth stand affected to our purpose
and summon him to morrow to the tower
to sit about the coronation
if thou dost find him tractable to us
encourage him and tell him all our reasons
if he be leaden icy cold unwilling
be thou so too and so break off the talk
and give us notice of his inclination
for we to morrow hold divided councils
gloucester commend me to lord william tell him
empty
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
to morrow are let blood at pomfret castle
and bid my lord for joy of this good news
give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
buckingham good catesby go effect this business soundly

hastings cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious

messenger so it appears by that i have to say
first he commends him to your noble self
hastings what then
messenger then certifies your lordship that this night
besides he says there are two councils kept
and that may be determind at the one
which may make you and him to rue at th' other
therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
if you will presently take horse with him
and with all speed post with him toward the north
to shun the danger that his soul divines
hastings go fellow go return unto thy lord
bid him not fear the separated council
and at the other is my good friend catesby
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
whereof i shall not have intelligence
tell him his fears are shallow without instance
and for his dreams i wonder he's so simple
to trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues
were to incense the boar to follow us
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
and we will both together to the tower
where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
messenger i'll go my lord and tell him what you say
empty
enter catesby

but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
catesby ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
and thereupon he sends you this good news
that this same very day your enemies
the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
hastings indeed i am no mourner for that news
because they have been still my adversaries
but that i'll give my voice on richard's side
to bar my master's heirs in true descent
god knows i will not do it to the death
catesby god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
that they which brought me in my master's hate
i live to look upon their tragedy
well catesby ere a fortnight make me older
i'll send some packing that yet think not ont
catesby 'tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
when men are unprepar'd and look not for it
hastings o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
with rivers vaughan grey and so 'twill do
with some men else that think themselves as safe
to princely richard and to buckingham

enter buckingham derby hastings the bishop of ely ratcliff lovel
with others and seat themselves at a table
hastings now noble peers the cause why we are met
is to determine of the coronation
in god's name speak when is the royal day
buckingham is all things ready for the royal time
derby it is and wants but nomination
bishop of ely to morrow then i judge a happy day
buckingham who knows the lord protector's mind
who is most inward with the noble duke
bishop of ely your grace we think should soonest know
his mind
buckingham we know each other's faces for our hearts
he knows no more of mine than i of yours
or i of his my lord than you of mine
lord hastings you and he are near in love
hastings i thank his grace i know he loves me well
but for his purpose in the coronation
his gracious pleasure any way therein
but you my honourable lords may name the time
and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice
which i presume he'll take in gentle part
enter gloucester
bishop of ely in happy time here comes the duke himself
gloucester my noble lords and cousins an good morrow
i have been long a sleeper but i trust
my absence doth neglect no great design
buckingham had you not come upon your cue my lord
william lord hastings had pronounc'd your part
i mean your voice for crowning of the king
gloucester than my lord hastings no man might be
empty
his lordship knows me well and loves me well
my lord of ely when i was last in holborn
i saw good strawberries in your garden there
i do beseech you send for some of them
empty
gloucester cousin of buckingham a word with you
takes him aside
catesby hath sounded hastings in our business
and finds the testy gentleman so hot
that he will lose his head ere give consent
his master's child as worshipfully he terms it
shall lose the royalty of england's throne
buckingham withdraw yourself awhile i'll go with you
derby we have not yet set down this day of triumph
to morrow in my judgment is too sudden
for i myself am not so well provided
as else i would be were the day prolong'd
re enter the bishop of ely
bishop of ely where is my lord the duke of gloucester
i have sent for these strawberries
hastings his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
empty
when that he bids good morrow with such spirit
i think there's never a man in christendom
can lesser hide his love or hate than he
for by his face straight shall you know his heart
derby what of his heart perceive you in his face
by any livelihood he show'd to day
hastings marry that with no man here he is offended
for were he he had shown it in his looks
re enter gloucester and buckingham
that do conspire my death with devilish plots
of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild
upon my body with their hellish charms
hastings the tender love i bear your grace my lord
makes me most forward in this princely presence
to doom th' offenders whosoe'er they be
i say my lord they have deserved death
gloucester then be your eyes the witness of their evil
look how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm
and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch
consorted with that harlot strumpet shore
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
hastings if they have done this deed my noble lord
gloucester if thou protector of this damned strumpet
talk'st thou to me of ifs thou art a traitor
off with his head now by saint paul i swear
i will not dine until i see the same
lovel and ratcliff look that it be done
exeunt all but hastings lovel and ratcliff
hastings woe woe for england not a whit for me
for i too fond might have prevented this
stanley did dream the boar did raze our helms
and i did scorn it and disdain to fly
three times to day my foot cloth horse did stumble
and started when he look'd upon the tower
as loath to bear me to the slaughter house
o now i need the priest that spake to me
as too triumphing how mine enemies
to day at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
and i myself secure in grace and favour
o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
is lighted on poor hastings' wretched head
ratcliff come come dispatch the duke would be at
empty
make a short shrift he longs to see your head
hastings o momentary grace of mortal men
who builds his hope in air of your good looks
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
ready with every nod to tumble down
into the fatal bowels of the deep
lovel come come dispatch 'tis bootless to exclaim
hastings o bloody richard miserable england
i prophesy the fearfullst time to thee
that ever wretched age hath look'd upon
come lead me to the block bear him my head
scene 5
london the tower walls
enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour marvellous ill favoured
gloucester come cousin canst thou quake and change
thy colour
murder thy breath in middle of a word
and then again begin and stop again
as if thou were distraught and mad with terror
buckingham tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian
tremble and start at wagging of a straw
intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
are at my service like enforced smiles
and both are ready in their offices
at any time to grace my stratagems
but what is catesby gone
gloucester he is and see he brings the mayor along
enter the lord mayor and catesby
buckingham lord mayor
buckingham hark a drum
gloucester catesby o'erlook the walls
buckingham lord mayor the reason we have sent
gloucester look back defend thee here are enemies
buckingham god and our innocence defend and guard us
enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings' head
gloucester be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor
the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
i took him for the plainest harmless creature
that breath'd upon the earth a christian
made him my book wherein my soul recorded
the history of all her secret thoughts
so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
that his apparent open guilt omitted
i mean his conversation with shore's wife
he liv'd from all attainder of suspects
buckingham well well he was the covert'st shelt'red
that ever liv'd
would you imagine or almost believe
were't not that by great preservation
we live to tell it that the subtle traitor
this day had plotted in the council house
to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
mayor had he done so
gloucester what think you we are turks or infidels
or that we would against the form of law
but that the extreme peril of the case
the peace of england and our persons' safety
enforc'd us to this execution
mayor now fair befall you he deserv'd his death
and your good graces both have well proceeded
to warn false traitors from the like attempts
i never look'd for better at his hands
after he once fell in with mistress shore
buckingham yet had we not determind he should die
which now the loving haste of these our friends
something against our meanings have prevented
because my lord i would have had you heard
the traitor speak and timorously confess
the manner and the purpose of his treasons
that you might well have signified the same
unto the citizens who haply may
misconster us in him and wail his death
mayor but my good lord your grace's words shall serve
and do not doubt right noble princes both
but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens
with all your just proceedings in this cause
gloucester and to that end we wish'd your lordship here
t' avoid the the the censures of the carping world
buckingham which since you come too late of our intent
yet witness what you hear we did intend
and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
exit lord mayor
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in an post
there at your meet'st advantage of the time
infer the bastardy of edward's children
tell them how edward put to death a citizen
only for saying he would make his son
heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
which by the sign thereof was termed so
moreover urge his hateful luxury
and bestial appetite in change of lust
even where his raging eye or savage heart
without control lusted to make a prey
nay for a need thus far come near my person
tell them when that my mother went with child
of that insatiate edward noble york
my princely father then had wars in france
and by true computation of the time
found that the issue was not his begot
which well appeared in his lineaments
yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off
because my lord you know my mother lives
buckingham doubt not my lord i'll play the orator
as if the golden fee for which i plead
were for myself and so my lord adieu
gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynard's
empty
where you shall find me well accompanied
with reverend fathers and well learned bishops
look for the news that the guildhall affords exit
gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
to catesby go thou to friar penker bid them both
meet me within this hour at baynard's castle
exeunt all but gloucester
now will i go to take some privy order
to draw the brats of clarence out of sight
and to give order that no manner person
have any time recourse unto the princes exit
london a street
enter a scrivener
scrivener here is the indictment of the good lord hastings
which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
that it may be to day read o'er in pauls
and mark how well the sequel hangs together
eleven hours i have spent to write it over
for yesternight by catesby was it sent me
the precedent was full as long a doing
untainted unexamind free at liberty
here's a good world the while who is so gros
that cannot see this palpable device
yet who's so bold but says he sees it not
bad is the world and all will come to nought
when such ill dealing must be seen in thought exit
scene 7
london baynard's castle
enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors
buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord
the citizens are mum say not a word
gloucester touch'd you the bastardy of edward's
empty
buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy
and his contract by deputy in france
th' insatiate greediness of his desire
and his enforcement of the city wives
his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
and his resemblance being not like the duke
withal i did infer your lineaments
being the right idea of your father
both in your form and nobleness of mind
laid open all your victories in scotland
your discipline in war wisdom in peace
your bounty virtue fair humility
indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse
i bid them that did love their country's good
cry 'god save richard england's royal king'
gloucester and did they so
buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word
but like dumb statues or breathing stones
star'd each on other and look'd deadly pale
which when i saw i reprehended them
and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilfull silence
his answer was the people were not used
then he was urg'd to tell my tale again
'thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd'
but nothing spoke in warrant from himself
when he had done some followers of mine own
at lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
and some ten voices cried 'god save king richard'
and thus i took the vantage of those few
'thanks gentle citizens and friends' quoth i
'this general applause and cheerful shout
and even here brake off and came away
gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would
they not speak
will not the mayor then and his brethren come
buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear
be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
and look you get a prayer book in your hand
and stand between two churchmen good my lord
for on that ground i'll make a holy descant
play the maid's part still answer nay and take it
gloucester i go and if you plead as well for them
as i can say nay to thee for myself
no doubt we bring it to a happy issue
buckingham go go up to the leads the lord mayor
knocks exit gloucester
enter the lord mayor aldermen and citizens
welcome my lord i dance attendance here
i think the duke will not be spoke withal
now catesby what says your lord to my request
catesby he doth entreat your grace my noble lord
to visit him to morrow or next day
he is within with two right reverend fathers
divinely bent to meditation
and in no worldly suits would he be mov'd
to draw him from his holy exercise
buckingham return good catesby to the gracious duke
tell him myself the mayor and aldermen
no less importing than our general good
are come to have some conference with his grace
catesby i'll signify so much unto him straight exit
buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
he is not lolling on a lewd love bed
but on his knees at meditation
not dallying with a brace of courtezans
but meditating with two deep divines
not sleeping to engross his idle body
happy were england would this virtuous prince
take on his grace the sovereignty thereof
but sure i fear we shall not win him to it
mayor marry god defend his grace should say us nay
buckingham i fear he will here catesby comes again
re enter catesby
now catesby what says his grace
catesby my lord
he wonders to what end you have assembled
his grace not being warnd thereof before
he fears my lord you mean no good to him
buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should
suspect me that i mean no good to him
by heaven we come to him in perfect love
and so once more return and tell his grace
exit catesby
when holy and devout religious men
are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence
enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
catesby returns
mayor see where his grace stands 'tween two clergymen
buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince
to stay him from the fall of vanity
and see a book of prayer in his hand
true ornaments to know a holy man
famous plantagenet most gracious prince
lend favourable ear to our requests
of thy devotion and right christian zeal
gloucester my lord there needs no such apology
i do beseech your grace to pardon me
who earnest in the service of my god
deferr'd the visitation of my friends
but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure
buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above
and all good men of this ungovernd isle
gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
buckingham you have my lord would it might please
your grace
on our entreaties to amend your fault
gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
buckingham know then it is your fault that you resign
the supreme seat the throne majestical
the scept'red office of your ancestors
your state of fortune and your due of birth
to the corruption of a blemish'd stock
whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
which here we waken to our country's good
the noble isle doth want her proper limbs
her face defac'd with scars of infamy
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
and almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
which to recure we heartily solicit
and kingly government of this your land
not as protector steward substitute
or lowly factor for another's gain
but as successively from blood to blood
your right of birth your empery your own
for this consorted with the citizens
your very worshipful and loving friends
and by their vehement instigation
in this just cause come i to move your grace
or bitterly to speak in your reproof
best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think
tongue tied ambition not replying yielded
to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
which fondly you would here impose on me
if to reprove you for this suit of yours
so seasond with your faithful love to me
then on the other side i check'd my friends
and then in speaking not to incur the last
definitively thus i answer you
your love deserves my thanks but my desert
unmeritable shuns your high request
first if all obstacles were cut away
and that my path were even to the crown
as the ripe revenue and due of birth
yet so much is my poverty of spirit
so mighty and so many my defects
being a bark to brook no mighty sea
than in my greatness covet to be hid
and in the vapour of my glory smother'd
but god be thank'd there is no need of me
and much i need to help you were there need
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time
will well become the seat of majesty
and make no doubt us happy by his reign
the right and fortune of his happy stars
which god defend that i should wring from him
buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your
empty
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
all circumstances well considered
you say that edward is your brother's son
so say we too but not by edward's wife
for first was he contract to lady lucy
and afterward by substitute betroth'd
to bona sister to the king of france
these both put off a poor petitioner
a care craz'd mother to a many sons
a beauty waning and distressed widow
even in the afternoon of her best days
made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
to base declension and loath'd bigamy
this edward whom our manners call the prince
more bitterly could i expostulate
save that for reverence to some alive
i give a sparing limit to my tongue
then good my lord take to your royal self
this proffer'd benefit of dignity
if not to bless us and the land withal
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
from the corruption of abusing times
mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you
buckingham refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love
catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
gloucester alas why would you heap this care on me
i am unfit for state and majesty
i do beseech you take it not amiss
i cannot nor i will not yield to you
buckingham if you refuse it as in love and zeal
loath to depose the child your brother's son
and gentle kind effeminate remorse
which we have noted in you to your kindred
and egally indeed to all estates
yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no
your brother's son shall never reign our king
but we will plant some other in the throne
to the disgrace and downfall of your house
and in this resolution here we leave you
come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more
exeunt buckingham mayor and citizens
catesby call him again sweet prince accept their suit
if you deny them all the land will rue it
gloucester will you enforce me to a world of cares
call them again i am not made of stones
but penetrable to your kind entreaties
albeit against my conscience and my soul
re enter buckingham and the rest
cousin of buckingham and sage grave men
to bear her burden whe'er i will or no
i must have patience to endure the load
but if black scandal or foul fac'd reproach
attend the sequel of your imposition
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
from all the impure blots and stains thereof
for god doth know and you may partly see
how far i am from the desire of this
mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it
buckingham then i salute you with this royal title
long live king richard england's worthy king
all amen
buckingham to morrow may it please you to be crownd
gloucester even when you please for you will have it so
buckingham to morrow then we will attend your grace
and so most joyfully we take our leave
gloucester to the bishops come let us to our holy
work again

whose unavoided eye is murderous
anne and i with all unwillingness will go

were red hot steel to sear me to the brains
anointed let me be with deadly venom
and die ere men can say 'god save the queen'
queen elizabeth go go poor soul i envy not thy glory
to feed my humour wish thyself no harm
anne no why when he that is my husband now
when scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
which issued from my other angel husband
and that dear saint which then i weeping follow'd
o when i say i look'd on richard's face
this was my wish 'be thou' quoth i 'accurs'd
for making me so young so old a widow
and when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed
and be thy wife if any be so mad
more miserable by the life of thee
lo ere i can repeat this curse again
within so small a time my womans heart
grossly grew captive to his honey words
and prov'd the subject of mine own souls curse
which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest
for never yet one hour in his bed
did i enjoy the golden dew of sleep
but with his timorous dreams was still awak'd
besides he hates me for my father warwick
queen elizabeth poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining

dorset farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
anne adieu poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it
duchess to dorset go thou to richmond and good
fortune guide thee

and each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen
queen elizabeth stay yet look back with me unto the
empty
pity you ancient stones those tender babes
whom envy hath immur'd within your walls
rough cradle for such little pretty ones
rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
for tender princes use my babies well

enter tyrrel
tyrrel the tyrannous and bloody act is done
the most arch deed of piteous massacre
that ever yet this land was guilty of
dighton and forrest who i did suborn
to do this piece of ruthless butchery
albeit they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs
melted with tenderness and mild compassion
wept like two children in their deaths' sad story
'thus thus' quoth forrest 'girdling one another
within their alabaster innocent arms
their lips were four red roses on a stalk
and in their summer beauty kiss'd each other
a book of prayers on their pillow lay
which once' quoth forrest 'almost chang'd my mind
but o the devil there the villain stopp'd
when dighton thus told on 'we smothered
the most replenished sweet work of nature
hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
they could not speak and so i left them both
to bear this tidings to the bloody king

london before the palace
enter old queen margaret
queen margaret so now prosperity begins to mellow
and drop into the rotten mouth of death
to watch the waning of mine enemies
a dire induction am i witness to
and will to france hoping the consequence
will prove as bitter black and tragical
withdraw thee wretched margaret who comes here
empty
enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york
queen elizabeth ah my poor princes ah my tender
empty
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
and be not fix'd in doom perpetual
hover about me with your airy wings
and hear your mother's lamentation
queen margaret hover about her say that right for right
hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night
duchess so many miseries have craz'd my voice
that my woe wearied tongue is still and mute
edward plantagenet why art thou dead
edward for edward pays a dying debt
queen elizabeth wilt thou o god fly from such gentle
empty
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
queen margaret when holy harry died and my sweet
empty
duchess dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost
woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd
rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth sitting down
unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood
queen elizabeth ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a
empty
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
then would i hide my bones not rest them here
ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
sitting down by her
queen margaret coming forward if ancient sorrow be
give mine the benefit of seniory
and let my griefs frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society sitting down with them
tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
i had an edward till a richard killd him
i had a husband till a richard killd him
thou hadst an edward till a richard killd him
thou hadst a richard till a richard killd him
duchess i had a richard too and thou didst kill him
queen margaret thou hadst a clarence too and richard
killd him
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
a hell hound that doth hunt us all to death
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
that foul defacer of god's handiwork
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
o upright just and true disposing god
how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
preys on the issue of his mother's body
and makes her pew fellow with others' moan
duchess o harry's wife triumph not in my woes
god witness with me i have wept for thine
queen margaret bear with me i am hungry for revenge
and now i cloy me with beholding it
thy edward he is dead that killd my edward
young york he is but boot because both they
match'd not the high perfection of my loss
thy clarence he is dead that stabb'd my edward
and the beholders of this frantic play
th' adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey
untimely smother'd in their dusky graves
richard yet lives hells black intelligencer
only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
and send them thither but at hand at hand
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
to have him suddenly convey'd from hence
cancel his bond of life dear god i pray
that i may live and say 'the dog is dead'
queen elizabeth o thou didst prophesy the time would
empty
that i should wish for thee to help me curse
that bottled spider that foul bunch back'd toad
queen margaret i calld thee then vain flourish of my
i calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
the presentation of but what i was
the flattering index of a direful pageant
one heav'd a high to be hurld down below
a mother only mock'd with two fair babes
a dream of what thou wast a garish flag
to be the aim of every dangerous shot
a sign of dignity a breath a bubble
a queen in jest only to fill the scene
where be thy two sons wherein dost thou joy
who sues and kneels and says 'god save the queen
where be the bending peers that flattered thee
where be the thronging troops that followed thee
decline an this and see what now thou art
for happy wife a most distressed widow
for joyful mother one that wails the name
for one being su'd to one that humbly sues
for queen a very caitiff crownd with care
for she being fear'd of all now fearing one
for she commanding all obey'd of none
thus hath the course of justice whirld about
and left thee but a very prey to time
having no more but thought of what thou wast
to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
now thy proud neck bears half my burdend yoke
and leave the burden of it all on thee
farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance
these english woes shall make me smile in france
queen elizabeth o thou well skilld in curses stay awhile
and teach me how to curse mine enemies
queen margaret forbear to sleep the nights and fast the
empty
compare dead happiness with living woe
think that thy babes were sweeter than they were
bett'ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse
revolving this will teach thee how to curse
queen elizabeth my words are dull o quicken them
with thine
queen margaret thy woes will make them sharp and
pierce like mine exit
duchess why should calamity be fun of words
queen elizabeth windy attorneys to their client woes
airy succeeders of intestate joys
let them have scope though what they will impart
help nothing else yet do they case the heart
duchess if so then be not tongue tied go with me
and in the breath of bitter words let's smother
my damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd
the trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims
enter king richard and his train marching with
drums and trumpets
king richard who intercepts me in my expedition
by strangling thee in her accursed womb
from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
queen elizabeth hidest thou that forehead with a golden
empty
where't should be branded if that right were right
the slaughter of the prince that ow'd that crown
and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
tell me thou villain slave where are my children
duchess thou toad thou toad where is thy brother
and little ned plantagenet his son
queen elizabeth where is the gentle rivers vaughan
empty
duchess where is kind hastings
king richard a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
let not the heavens hear these tell tale women
rail on the lord's anointed strike i say
flourish alarums
either be patient and entreat me fair
thus will i drown your exclamations
duchess art thou my son
king richard ay i thank god my father and yourself
duchess then patiently hear my impatience
king richard madam i have a touch of your condition
that cannot brook the accent of reproof
duchess o let me speak
king richard do then but i'll not hear
duchess i will be mild and gentle in my words
duchess art thou so hasty i have stay'd for thee
god knows in torment and in agony
king richard and came i not at last to comfort you
duchess no by the holy rood thou know'st it well
thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burden was thy birth to me
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
thy school days frightful desp'rate wild and furious
thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
what comfortable hour canst thou name
that ever grac'd me with thy company
king richard faith none but humphrey hour that calld
your grace
to breakfast once forth of my company
if i be so disgracious in your eye
let me march on and not offend you madam
strike up the drum
king richard you speak too bitterly
duchess hear me a word
for i shall never speak to thee again
king richard so
duchess either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
and never more behold thy face again
therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
than all the complete armour that thou wear'st
my prayers on the adverse party fight
and there the little souls of edward's children
whisper the spirits of thine enemies
and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend exit
queen elizabeth though far more cause yet much less
spirit to curse
king richard stay madam i must talk a word with you
queen elizabeth i have no moe sons of the royal blood
for thee to slaughter for my daughters richard
they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
and therefore level not to hit their lives
king richard you have a daughter calld elizabeth
virtuous and fair royal and gracious
queen elizabeth and must she die for this o let her
empty
slander myself as false to edward's bed
throw over her the veil of infamy
so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
i will confess she was not edward's daughter
king richard wrong not her birth she is a royal
empty
queen elizabeth to save her life i'll say she is not so
king richard her life is safest only in her birth
queen elizabeth and only in that safety died her
king richard lo at their birth good stars were opposite
queen elizabeth no to their lives ill friends were
empty
king richard all unavoided is the doom of destiny
queen elizabeth true when avoided grace makes destiny
my babes were destind to a fairer death
if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life
king richard you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
queen elizabeth cousins indeed and by their uncle
of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts
thy head an indirectly gave direction
no doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart
to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes
like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
king richard madam so thrive i in my enterprise
and dangerous success of bloody wars
as i intend more good to you and yours
than ever you or yours by me were harm'd
queen elizabeth what good is cover'd with the face of
empty
to be discover'd that can do me good
empty
queen elizabeth up to some scaffold there to lose their
empty
king richard unto the dignity and height of fortune
the high imperial type of this earth's glory
queen elizabeth flatter my sorrow with report of it
tell me what state what dignity what honour
canst thou demise to any child of mine
king richard even all i have ay and myself and all
so in the lethe of thy angry soul
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
which thou supposest i have done to thee
queen elizabeth be brief lest that the process of thy
empty
last longer telling than thy kindness' date
king richard then know that from my soul i love thy
empty
queen elizabeth my daughter's mother thinks it with her
king richard what do you think
queen elizabeth that thou dost love my daughter from
thy soul
so from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it
king richard be not so hasty to confound my meaning
i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
and do intend to make her queen of england
queen elizabeth well then who dost thou mean shall be
king richard even he that makes her queen who else
should be
queen elizabeth what thou
king richard even so how think you of it
queen elizabeth how canst thou woo her
king richard that would i learn of you
as one being best acquainted with her humour
queen elizabeth and wilt thou learn of me
king richard madam with all my heart
empty
a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
'edward' and 'york' then haply will she weep
therefore present to her as sometimes margaret
did to thy father steep'd in rutland's blood
a handkerchief which say to her did drain
the purple sap from her sweet brother's body
and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
if this inducement move her not to love
tell her thou mad'st away her uncle clarence
her uncle rivers ay and for her sake
mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
king richard you mock me madam this is not the way
to win your daughter
queen elizabeth there is no other way
unless thou couldst put on some other shape
and not be richard that hath done all this
king richard say that i did all this for love of her
hate thee
having bought love with such a bloody spoil
king richard look what is done cannot be now amended
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
which after hours gives leisure to repent
if i did take the kingdom from your sons
to make amends i'll give it to your daughter
if i have killd the issue of your womb
to quicken your increase i will beget
a grandam's name is little less in love
than is the doating title of a mother
they are as children but one step below
even of your metal of your very blood
of all one pain save for a night of groans
endur'd of her for whom you bid like sorrow
your children were vexation to your youth
but mine shall be a comfort to your age
the loss you have is but a son being king
i cannot make you what amends i would
therefore accept such kindness as i can
dorset your son that with a fearful soul
leads discontented steps in foreign soil
this fair alliance quickly shall can home
to high promotions and great dignity
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
again shall you be mother to a king
repair'd with double riches of content
what we have many goodly days to see
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed

and hear the sentence of your moved prince
three civil brawls bred of an airy word
by thee old capulet and montague
have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
and made verona's ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
to wield old partisans in hands as old
cank'red with peace to part your cank'red hate
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
for this time all the rest depart away
you capulet shall go along with me

ben here were the servants of your adversary
and yours close fighting ere i did approach
i drew to part them in the instant came
the fiery tybalt with his sword prepar'd
which as he breath'd defiance to my ears
he swung about his head and cut the winds
who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
came more and more and fought on part and part
m wife o where is romeo saw you him to day
right glad i am he was not at this fray
ben madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun
peer'd forth the golden window of the east
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the city's side
so early walking did i see your son
towards him i made but he was ware of me
i measuring his affections by my own
which then most sought where most might not be found
being one too many by my weary self
pursu'd my humour not pursuing his
and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
mon many a morning hath he there been seen
with tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
but all so soon as the all cheering sun
the shady curtains from aurora's bed
away from light steals home my heavy son
and private in his chamber pens himself
shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
and makes himself an artificial night
black and portentous must this humour prove
unless good counsel may the cause remove
ben my noble uncle do you know the cause
mon i neither know it nor can learn of him
mon both by myself and many other friend
but he his own affections' counsellor
is to himself i will not say how true
but to himself so secret and so close
so far from sounding and discovery
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
enter romeo
ben see where he comes so please you step aside
i'll know his grievance or be much denied
mon i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift come madam let's away
exeunt montague and wife
ben good morrow cousin

was that my father that went hence so fast
ben it was what sadness lengthens romeo's hours
rom not having that which having makes them short
ben in love
rom out
ben of love
rom out of her favour where i am in love
ben alas that love so gentle in his view
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
should without eyes see pathways to his will
where shall we dine o me what fray was here
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
here's much to do with hate but more with love
why then o brawling love o loving hate
o anything of nothing first create
o heavy lightness serious vanity
misshapen chaos of well seeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
this love feel i that feel no love in this
dost thou not laugh
ben no coz i rather weep
rom good heart at what
ben at thy good heart's oppression
rom why such is love's transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs
being purg'd a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes
being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears
what is it else a madness most discreet
a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz
ben soft i will go along
an if you leave me so you do me wrong
rom tut i have lost myself i am not here
ben tell me in sadness who is that you love
rom what shall i groan and tell thee
ben groan why no
but sadly tell me who
rom bid a sick man in sadness make his will
ah word ill urg'd to one that is so ill
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
ben i aim'd so near when i suppos'd you lov'd
rom a right good markman and she's fair i love
rom well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit
with cupid's arrow she hath dians wit
and in strong proof of chastity well arm'd
from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes
nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold
o she's rich in beauty only poor
that when she dies with beauty dies her store
rom she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
for beauty starv'd with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
to merit bliss by making me despair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
do i live dead that live to tell it now
ben be ruld by me forget to think of her
rom o teach me how i should forget to think
examine other beauties
rom 'tis the way
to call hers exquisite in question more
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
show me a mistress that is passing fair
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
ben i'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt exeunt

come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen
susan and she god rest all christian souls

she was too good for me but as i said
on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen
'tis since the earthquake now eleven years
and she was weand i never shall forget it
of all the days of the year upon that day
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug
sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
my lord and you were then at mantua
nay i do bear a brain but as i said
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
shake quoth the dovehouse 'twas no need i trow
to bid me trudge
and since that time it is eleven years
for then she could stand high lone nay by th' rood
she could have run and waddled all about
for even the day before she broke her brow
and then my husband god be with his soul
'a was a merry man took up the child
'yea' quoth he 'dost thou fall upon thy face
wilt thou not jule' and by my holidam
the pretty wretch left crying and said 'ay'
to see now how a jest shall come about
i warrant an i should live a thousand yeas
i never should forget it 'wilt thou not jule' quoth he
and pretty fool it stinted and said 'ay'
wife enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace
nurse yes madam yet i cannot choose but laugh
to think it should leave crying and say 'ay'
a bump as big as a young cock'rels stone
a perilous knock and it cried bitterly
'yea' quoth my husband 'fallst upon thy face
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
wilt thou not jule' it stinted and said 'ay'
jul and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i
nurse peace i have done god mark thee to his grace
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nurs'd
an i might live to see thee married once i have my wish
i came to talk of tell me daughter juliet
how stands your disposition to be married
jul it is an honour that i dream not of
nurse an honour were not i thine only nurse
i would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat
wife well think of marriage now younger than you
here in verona ladies of esteem
are made already mothers by my count
i was your mother much upon these years
the valiant paris seeks you for his love
nurse a man young lady lady such a man
as all the world why he's a man of wax
wife verona's summer hath not such a flower
nurse nay he's a flower in faith a very flower
wife what say you can you love the gentleman
this night you shall behold him at our feast
read o'er the volume of young paris' face
and find delight writ there with beauty's pen
and see how one another lends content
and what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
find written in the margent of his eyes
this precious book of love this unbound lover
to beautify him only lacks a cover
the fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride
for fair without the fair within to hide
that book in many's eyes doth share the glory
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
by having him making yourself no less
nurse no less nay bigger women grow by men
wife speak briefly can you like of paris' love
jul i'll look to like if looking liking move
but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly

scene iv
a street
enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six other maskers torchbearers
rom what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
ben the date is out of such prolixity
we'll have no cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf
bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
nor no without book prologue faintly spoke
after the prompter for our entrance
but let them measure us by what they will
we'll measure them a measure and be gone
rom give me a torch i am not for this ambling
mer nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
rom not i believe me you have dancing shoes
with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
mer you are a lover borrow cupid's wings
and soar with them above a common bound
rom i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers and so bound
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
mer and to sink in it should you burthen love
too great oppression for a tender thing
rom is love a tender thing it is too rough
too rude too boist'rous and it pricks like thorn
mer if love be rough with you be rough with love
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in
a visor for a visor what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities
ben come knock and enter and no sooner in
but every man betake him to his legs
rom a torch for me let wantons light of heart
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase
i'll be a candle holder and look on
the game was ne'er so fair and i am done
mer tut duns the mouse the constable's own word
if thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire
up to the ears come we burn daylight ho
rom nay that's not so
mer i mean sir in delay
we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits
rom and we mean well in going to this masque
but 'tis no wit to go
mer why may one ask
mer and so did i
rom well what was yours
mer that dreamers often lie
rom in bed asleep while they do dream things true
mer o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies' midwife and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate stone
on the forefinger of an alderman
drawn with a team of little atomies
her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
her traces of the smallest spider's web
her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams
her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film
her wagoner a small grey coated gnat
not half so big as a round little worm
prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid
her chariot is an empty hazelnut
time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers
and in this state she 'gallops night by night
through lovers' brains and then they dream of love
o'er courtiers' knees that dream on cursies straight
o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees
o'er ladies' lips who straight on kisses dream
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose
and sometime comes she with a tithe pig's tail
tickling a parsons nose as 'a lies asleep
then dreams he of another benefice
sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
of healths five fadom deep and then anon
drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
that plats the manes of horses in the night
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
which once untangled much misfortune bodes
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
that presses them and learns them first to bear
making them women of good carriage
this is she
rom peace peace mercutio peace
thou talk'st of nothing
which are the children of an idle brain
begot of nothing but vain fantasy
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north
and being anger'd puffs away from thence
turning his face to the dew dropping south
ben this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
supper is done and we shall come too late
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels and expire the term
of a despised life clos'd in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my sail on lusty gentlemen

and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now forswear it sight
for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night

her eye discourses i will answer it
i am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
having some business do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand
that i might touch that cheek
jul ay me
rom she speaks
as glorious to this night being o'er my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white upturned wond'ring eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air
jul o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
rom aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
jul 'tis but thy name that is my enemy
thou art thyself though not a montague
what's montague it is nor hand nor foot
nor arm nor face nor any other part
belonging to a man o be some other name
what's in a name that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet
so romeo would were he not romeo calld
without that title romeo doff thy name
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself
rom i take thee at thy word
call me but love and i'll be new baptiz'd
henceforth i never will be romeo
jul what man art thou that thus bescreend in night
so stumblest on my counsel
rom by a name
my name dear saint is hateful to myself
because it is an enemy to thee
had i it written i would tear the word
jul my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance yet i know the sound
art thou not romeo and a montague
rom neither fair saint if either thee dislike
jul how cam'st thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
if any of my kinsmen find thee here
rom with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls
for stony limits cannot hold love out
and what love can do that dares love attempt
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
jul if they do see thee they will murther thee
rom alack there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
and i am proof against their enmity
rom i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight
and but thou love me let them find me here
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued wanting of thy love
jul by whose direction found'st thou out this place
rom by love that first did prompt me to enquire
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea
jul thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak to night
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
what i have spoke but farewell compliment
dost thou love me i know thou wilt say 'ay'
and i will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
thou mayst prove false at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs o gentle romeo
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won
i'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay
so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond
and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
but trust me gentleman i'll prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess
but that thou overheard'st ere i was ware
and not impute this yielding to light love
which the dark night hath so discovered
rom lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops
jul o swear not by the moon th' inconstant moon
that monthly changes in her circled orb
lest that thy love prove likewise variable
rom what shall i swear by
jul do not swear at all
which is the god of my idolatry
and i'll believe thee
rom if my heart's dear love
jul well do not swear although i joy in thee
i have no joy of this contract to night
it is too rash too unadvis'd too sudden
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say 'it lightens' sweet good night
this bud of love by summer's ripening breath
good night good night as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast
rom o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
jul what satisfaction canst thou have to night
rom th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
jul i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
and yet i would it were to give again
rom would'st thou withdraw it for what purpose love
jul but to be frank and give it thee again
my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep the more i give to thee
the more i have for both are infinite
i hear some noise within dear love adieu
nurse calls within

where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world
nurse within madam

nurse within madam
jul by and by i come
to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
to morrow will i send

and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine

like softest music to attending ears
jul romeo

rom by the hour of nine

rom let me stand here till thou remember it
rememb'ring how i love thy company
rom and i'll still stay to have thee still forget
forgetting any other home but this
jul 'tis almost morning i would have thee gone
and yet no farther than a wantons bird
that lets it hop a little from her hand
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
and with a silk thread plucks it back again
so loving jealous of his liberty
jul sweet so would i

good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow
that i shall say good night till it be morrow

his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
scene iii
friar laurence's cell
enter friar laurence alone with a basket
friar the grey ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night
check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth day's path and titans fiery wheels
non ere the sun advance his burning eye
the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry
with baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers
the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb
what is her burying gave that is her womb
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find
many for many virtues excellent
none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
but to the earth some special good doth give
nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
and vice sometime's by action dignified
within the infant rind of this small flower
poison hath residence and medicine power
for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
being tasted slays all senses with the heart
in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
and where the worser is predominant
full soon the canker death eats up that plant
enter romeo
rom good morrow father
friar benedicite
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distempered head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
and where care lodges sleep will never lie
but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature
or if not so then here i hit it right
our romeo hath not been in bed to night
rom that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
friar god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline
i have forgot that name and that name's woe
friar that's my good son but where hast thou been then
rom i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
i have been feasting with mine enemy
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that's by me wounded both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies
i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
my intercession likewise steads my foe
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
rom then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich capulet
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
and all combind save what thou must combine
by holy marriage when and where and how
we met we woo'd and made exchange of vow
i'll tell thee as we pass but this i pray
that thou consent to marry us to day
is rosaline that thou didst love so dear
so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine
hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste
to season love that of it doth not taste
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
thou and these woes were all for rosaline
and art thou chang'd pronounce this sentence then
women may fall when there's no strength in men
rom thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline
friar for doting not for loving pupil mine
rom and bad'st me bury love
friar not in a grave
rom i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow
the other did not so
friar o she knew well
thy love did read by rote that could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me
in one respect i'll thy assistant be
for this alliance may so happy prove
to turn your households' rancour to pure love
friar wisely and slow they stumble that run fast

cold death aside and with the other sends
retorts it romeo he cries aloud
'hold friends friends part' and swifter than his tongue

an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled

i have an interest in your hate's proceeding
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a bleeding
but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
else when he is found that hour is his last
bear hence this body and attend our will
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
empty
scene ii
capulet's orchard
enter juliet alone
towards phoebus' lodging such a wagoner
as phaeton would whip you to the west
and bring in cloudy night immediately
spread thy close curtain love performing night
that runaway eyes may wink and romeo
leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties or if love be blind
it best agrees with night come civil night
and learn me how to lose a winning match
play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
think true love acted simple modesty
come night come romeo come thou day in night
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow upon a ravens back
come gentle night come loving black brow'd night
take him and cut him out in little stars
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun
o i have bought the mansion of a love
but not possess'd it and though i am sold
not yet enjoy'd so tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
enter nurse with cords
and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence
now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords
that romeo bid thee fetch
nurse ay ay the cords
throws them down
jul ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
nurse ah weraday he's dead he's dead he's dead
alack the day he's gone he's killd he's dead
jul can heaven be so envious
nurse romeo can
though heaven cannot o romeo romeo
who ever would have thought it romeo
jul what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell
hath romeo slain himself say thou but 'i'
and that bare vowel 'i' shall poison more
i am not i if there be such an 'i'
or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'i'
if be be slain say 'i' or if not 'no'
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
nurse i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
god save the mark here on his manly breast
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood
all in gore blood i swounded at the sight
to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
nurse o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
that ever i should live to see thee dead
jul what storm is this that blows so contrary
is romeo slaught'red and is tybalt dead
my dear lov'd cousin and my dearer lord
for who is living if those two are gone
nurse tybalt is gone and romeo banished
romeo that killd him he is banished
jul o god did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood
nurse it did it did alas the day it did
jul o serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dove feather'd raven wolvish ravening lamb
just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
a damned saint an honourable villain
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace
nurse there's no trust
all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
ah where's my man give me some aqua vitae
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
shame come to romeo
jul blister'd be thy tongue
for such a wish he was not born to shame
upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit
for 'tis a throne where honour may be crownd
sole monarch of the universal earth
nurse will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
jul shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
when i thy three hours wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have killd my husband
back foolish tears back to your native spring
your tributary drops belong to woe
which you mistaking offer up to joy
and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalt's death
that murd'red me i would forget it fain
but o it presses to my memory
like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds
'tybalt is dead and romeo banished'
that 'banished' that one word 'banished'
hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death
or if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rank'd with other griefs
why followed not when she said 'tybalt's dead'
thy father or thy mother nay or both
which modern lamentation might have mov'd
but with a rearward following tybalt's death
'romeo is banished' to speak that word
is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
all slain all dead 'romeo is banished'
in that word's death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse
nurse weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse
will you go to them i will bring you thither
jul wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
when theirs are dry for romeo's banishment
take up those cords poor ropes you are beguild
both you and i for romeo is exild
he made you for a highway to my bed
come cords come nurse i'll to my wedding bed
and death not romeo take my maidenhead
nurse hie to your chamber i'll find romeo
to comfort you i wot well where he is
hark ye your romeo will be here at night
i'll to him he is hid at laurence' cell
jul o find him give this ring to my true knight
and bid him come to take his last farewell
empty
friar laurence's cell
enter friar laurence
friar romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts
and thou art wedded to calamity
enter romeo
rom father what news what is the prince's doom
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
that i yet know not
is my dear son with such sour company
i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom
rom what less than doomsday is the prince's doom
friar a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips
not body's death but body's banishment
rom ha banishment be merciful say 'death'
for exile hath more terror in his look
much more than death do not say 'banishment'
friar hence from verona art thou banished
rom there is no world without verona walls
but purgatory torture hell itself
hence banished is banish'd from the world
and world's exile is death then 'banishment'
is death misterm'd calling death 'banishment'
thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
friar o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
and turnd that black word death to banishment
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
rom 'tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
where juliet lives and every cat and dog
and little mouse every unworthy thing
live here in heaven and may look on her
but romeo may not more validity
more honourable state more courtship lives
in carrion flies than romeo they may seize
and steal immortal blessing from her lips
who even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
but romeo may not he is banished
this may flies do when i from this must fly
they are free men but i am banished
and sayest thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharp ground knife
no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean
o friar the damned use that word in hell
howling attends it how hast thou the heart
being a divine a ghostly confessor
a sin absolver and my friend profess'd
to mangle me with that word 'banished'
friar thou fond mad man hear me a little speak
rom o thou wilt speak again of banishment
friar i'll give thee armour to keep off that word
adversity's sweet milk philosophy
rom yet 'banished' hang up philosophy
unless philosophy can make a juliet
displant a town reverse a prince's doom
it helps not it prevails not talk no more
friar o then i see that madmen have no ears
rom how should they when that wise men have no eyes
friar let me dispute with thee of thy estate
rom thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
doting like me and like me banished
then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
and fall upon the ground as i do now
taking the measure of an unmade grave
knock within
friar arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself
rom not i unless the breath of heartsick groans
mist like infold me from the search of eyes knock
friar hark how they knock who's there romeo arise
run to my study by and by god's will
what simpleness is this i come i come knock
who knocks so hard whence come you what's your will
nurse within let me come in and you shall know my errand
i come from lady juliet
friar welcome then
enter nurse
nurse o holy friar o tell me holy friar
where is my lady's lord where's romeo
nurse o he is even in my mistress' case
just in her case
friar o woeful sympathy
piteous predicament
nurse even so lies she
blubb'ring and weeping weeping and blubbering
stand up stand up stand an you be a man
for juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand
why should you fall into so deep an o
nurse ah sir ah sir well death's the end of all
rom spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
doth not she think me an old murtherer
now i have staind the childhood of our joy
with blood remov'd but little from her own
where is she and how doth she and what says
my conceald lady to our cancelld love
nurse o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
and now falls on her bed and then starts up
and then down falls again
rom as if that name
shot from the deadly level of a gun
did murther her as that name's cursed hand
murder'd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
the hateful mansion draws his dagger
friar hold thy desperate hand
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast
unseemly woman in a seeming man
or ill beseeming beast in seeming both
thou hast amaz'd me by my holy order
i thought thy disposition better temper'd
hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives
by doing damned hate upon thyself
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
which like a usurer abound'st in all
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
thy noble shape is but a form of wax
digressing from the valour of a man
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
thy wit that ornament to shape and love
misshapen in the conduct of them both
like powder in a skilless soldier's flask
is get afire by thine own ignorance
and thou dismemb'red with thine own defence
what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
but thou slewest tybalt there art thou happy too
and turns it to exile there art thou happy
a pack of blessings light upon thy back
happiness courts thee in her best array
but like a misbhav'd and sullen wench
thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed
ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou went'st forth in lamentation
go before nurse commend me to thy lady
and bid her hasten all the house to bed
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
romeo is coming
to hear good counsel o what learning is
my lord i'll tell my lady you will come
rom do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
nurse here is a ring she bid me give you sir
hie you make haste for it grows very late exit
rom how well my comfort is reviv'd by this
friar go hence good night and here stands all your state
either be gone before the watch be set
or by the break of day disguis'd from hence
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here
give me thy hand 'tis late farewell good night
rom but that a joy past joy calls out on me
it were a grief so brief to part with thee

scene v
enter romeo and juliet aloft at the window
jul wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
it was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale
rom it was the lark the herald of the morn
no nightingale look love what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die
jul yond light is not daylight i know it i
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torchbearer
and light thee on the way to mantua
therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone
rom let me be ta'en let me be put to death
i am content so thou wilt have it so
'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
i have more care to stay than will to go
come death and welcome juliet wills it so
how is't my soul let's talk it is not day
jul it is it is hie hence be gone away
it is the lark that sings so out of tune
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
this doth not so for she divideth us
some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes
o now i would they had chang'd voices too
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
hunting thee hence with hunt's up to the day
o now be gone more light and light it grows
rom more light and light more dark and dark our woes
enter nurse

jul o think'st thou we shall ever meet again
rom i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our time to come

what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither
enter mother
lady why how now juliet
jul madam i am not well
lady evermore weeping for your cousins death
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
but much of grief shows still some want of wit
jul yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
lady so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
which you weep for
jul feeling so the loss
i cannot choose but ever weep the friend
lady well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death
as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him
jul what villain madam
jul aside villain and he be many miles asunder
god pardon him i do with all my heart
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
lady that is because the traitor murderer lives
jul ay madam from the reach of these my hands
would none but i might venge my cousins death
lady we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
then weep no more i'll send to one in mantua
where that same banish'd runagate doth live
that he shall soon keep tybalt company
and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
jul indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold him dead
is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd
madam if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison i would temper it
that romeo should upon receipt thereof
soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt
upon his body that hath slaughter'd him
lady find thou the means and i'll find such a man
but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings girl
jul and joy comes well in such a needy time
what are they i beseech your ladyship
lady well well thou hast a careful father child
one who to put thee from thy heaviness
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
jul madam in happy time what day is that
lady marry my child early next thursday morn
the gallant young and noble gentleman
the county paris at saint peter's church
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
jul now by saint peter's church and peter too
he shall not make me there a joyful bride
i wonder at this haste that i must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo
i will not marry yet and when i do i swear
it shall be romeo whom you know i hate
rather than paris these are news indeed
lady here comes your father tell him so yourself
and see how be will take it at your hands
enter capulet and nurse
cap when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
but for the sunset of my brother's son
it rains downright
evermore show'ring in one little body
thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind
for still thy eyes which i may call the sea
do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
who raging with thy tears and they with them
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempest tossed body how now wife
have you delivered to her our decree
i would the fool were married to her grave
cap soft take me with you take me with you wife
how will she none doth she not give us thanks
is she not proud doth she not count her blest
unworthy as she is that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
jul not proud you have but thankful that you have
proud can i never be of what i hate
but thankful even for hate that is meant love
'proud' and 'i thank you' and 'i thank you not'
and yet 'not proud' mistress minion you
thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
but fettle your fine joints 'gainst thursday next
to go with paris to saint peter's church
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither
out you green sickness carrion i out you baggage
you tallow face
lady fie fie what are you mad
hear me with patience but to speak a word
cap hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
i tell thee what get thee to church a thursday
or never after look me in the face
speak not reply not do not answer me
my fingers itch wife we scarce thought us blest
that god had lent us but this only child
but now i see this one is one too much
and that we have a curse in having her
nurse god in heaven bless her
you are to blame my lord to rate her so
cap and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
good prudence smatter with your gossips go
nurse i speak no treason
cap o god i god en
nurse may not one speak
cap peace you mumbling fool
utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl
lady you are too hot
cap god's bread i it makes me mad day night late early
at home abroad alone in company
waking or sleeping still my care hath been
to have her match'd and having now provided
a gentleman of princely parentage
of fair demesnes youthful and nobly traind
stuff'd as they say with honourable parts
proportiond as one's thought would wish a man
a whining mammet in her fortune's tender
to answer 'i'll not wed i cannot love
i am too young i pray you pardon me'
but an you will not wed i'll pardon you
graze where you will you shall not house with me
look to't think ont i do not use to jest
thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
an you be mine i'll give you to my friend
an you be not hang beg starve die in the streets
nor what is mine shall never do thee good
trust to't bethink you i'll not be forsworn exit
jul is there no pity sitting in the clouds
that sees into the bottom of my grief
o sweet my mother cast me not away
delay this marriage for a month a week
or if you do not make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies
lady talk not to me for i'll not speak a word
jul o god o nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
how shall that faith return again to earth
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth comfort me counsel me
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself
what say'st thou hast thou not a word of joy
some comfort nurse
romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing
that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you
or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth
i think it best you married with the county
o he's a lovely gentleman
romeo's a dishclout to him an eagle madam
hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
as paris hath beshrew my very heart
for it excels your first or if it did not
your first is dead or 'twere as good he were
as living here and you no use of him
jul speak'st thou this from thy heart
nurse and from my soul too else beshrew them both
jul amen
nurse what
jul well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
go in and tell my lady i am gone
to make confession and to be absolv'd
nurse marry i will and this is wisely done exit
jul ancient damnation o most wicked fiend
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath prais'd him with above compare
so many thousand times go counsellor
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
i'll to the friar to know his remedy
act iv scene i
friar laurence's cell
enter friar laurence and county paris
friar on thursday sir the time is very short
par my father capulet will have it so
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
friar you say you do not know the lady's mind
uneven is the course i like it not
par immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death
for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous
that she do give her sorrow so much sway
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears
which too much minded by herself alone
may be put from her by society
now do you know the reason of this haste
friar aside i would i knew not why it should be slow'd
enter juliet
par happily met my lady and my wife
jul that may be sir when i may be a wife
par that may be must be love on thursday next
jul what must be shall be
friar that's a certain text
par come you to make confession to this father
jul to answer that i should confess to you
par do not deny to him that you love me
par so will ye i am sure that you love me
jul if i do so it will be of more price
being spoke behind your back than to your face
par poor soul thy face is much abus'd with tears
jul the tears have got small victory by that
for it was bad enough before their spite
par thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report
jul that is no slander sir which is a truth
and what i spake i spake it to my face
jul it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now
or shall i come to you at evening mass
friar my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone
par god shield i should disturb devotion
juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss exit
jul o shut the door and when thou hast done so
friar ah juliet i already know thy grief
it strains me past the compass of my wits
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
on thursday next be married to this county
jul tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
do thou but call my resolution wise
and with this knife i'll help it presently
and ere this hand by thee to romeo's seald
shall be the label to another deed
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another this shall slay them both
therefore out of thy long experienc'd time
give me some present counsel or behold
'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the empire arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
be not so long to speak i long to die
if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
friar hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame
and if thou dar'st i'll give thee remedy
jul o bid me leap rather than marry paris
from off the battlements of yonder tower
or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
or shut me nightly in a charnel house
o'ercover'd quite with dead mens rattling bones
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
or bid me go into a new made grave
things that to hear them told have made me tremble
and i will do it without fear or doubt
to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
friar hold then go home be merry give consent
to marry paris wednesday is to morrow
to morrow night look that thou lie alone
let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
take thou this vial being then in bed
and this distilled liquor drink thou off
a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
shall keep his native progress but surcease
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall
like death when he shuts up the day of life
each part depriv'd of supple government
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
then as the manner of our country is
in thy best robes uncovered on the bier
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake
shall romeo by my letters know our drift
will watch thy waking and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it
jul give me give me o tell not me of fear
friar hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
in this resolve i'll send a friar with speed
to mantua with my letters to thy lord
farewell dear father

to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes

the horrible conceit of death and night
together with the terror of the place
as in a vault an ancient receptacle
where for this many hundred years the bones
of all my buried ancestors are pack'd
where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
at some hours in the night spirits resort
alack alack is it not like that i
so early waking what with loathsome smells
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
that living mortals hearing them run mad
o if i wake shall i not be distraught
environed with all these hideous fears
and madly play with my forefathers' joints
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
as with a club dash out my desp'rate brains
o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay
romeo i come this do i drink to thee
she drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains

act v scene i
mantua a street
enter romeo
rom if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep
my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne
and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
and breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
that i reviv'd and was an emperor
ah me how sweet is love itself possess'd
when but love's shadows are so rich in joy
news from verona how now balthasar
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
how doth my lady is my father well
how fares my juliet that i ask again
for nothing can be ill if she be well
man then she is well and nothing can be ill
her body sleeps in capels monument
and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
o pardon me for bringing these ill news
since you did leave it for my office sir
rom is it e'en so then i defy you stars
thou knowest my lodging get me ink and paper
and hire posthorses i will hence to night
man i do beseech you sir have patience
your looks are pale and wild and do import
some misadventure
rom tush thou art deceiv'd
hast thou no letters to me from the friar
man no my good lord
rom no matter get thee gone
and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight
exit balthasar
well juliet i will lie with thee to night
let's see for means o mischief thou art swift
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
i do remember an apothecary
in tatt'red weeds with overwhelming brows
culling of simples meagre were his looks
sharp misery had worn him to the bones
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
an alligator stuff'd and other skins
of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes
green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
noting this penury to myself i said
'an if a man did need a poison now
whose sale is present death in mantua
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him'
o this same thought did but forerun my need
and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggar's shop is shut what ho apothecary
enter apothecary
rom come hither man i see that thou art poor
hold there is forty ducats let me have
a dram of poison such soon speeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins
that the life weary taker mall fall dead
and that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
as violently as hasty powder fir'd
doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb
apoth such mortal drugs i have but mantua's law
rom art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
the world is not thy friend nor the world's law
the world affords no law to make thee rich
then be not poor but break it and take this
apoth my poverty but not my will consents
rom i pay thy poverty and not thy will
and drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
rom there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
doing more murther in this loathsome world
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
come cordial and not poison go with me
to juliet's grave for there must i use thee

welcome from mantua what says romeo
or if his mind be writ give me his letter

here in this city visiting the sick
and finding him the searchers of the town
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign
seald up the doors and would not let us forth
so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd
laur who bare my letter then to romeo
john i could not send it here it is again
nor get a messenger to bring it thee

scene iii
verona a churchyard in it the monument of the capulets
enter paris and his page with flowers and a torch
par give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
yet put it out for i would not be seen
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
as signal that thou hear'st something approach
give me those flowers do as i bid thee go
page aside i am almost afraid to stand alone
here in the churchyard yet i will adventure retires
par sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew
which with sweet water nightly i will dew
or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
the obsequies that i for thee will keep
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
whistle boy
the boy gives warning something doth approach
what cursed foot wanders this way to night
to cross my obsequies and true love's rite
what with a torch muffle me night awhile retires
and a crow of iron
rom give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
hold take this letter early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father
give me the light upon thy life i charge thee
whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course
why i descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my lady's face
a precious ring a ring that i must use
in dear employment therefore hence be gone
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what i farther shall intend to do
by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
the time and my intents are savage wild
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea
rom so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that
live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
bal aside for all this same i'll hide me hereabout
his looks i fear and his intents i doubt retires
rom thou detestable maw thou womb of death
gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open
and in despite i'll cram thee with more food
romeo opens the tomb
that murd'red my love's cousin with which grief
it is supposed the fair creature died
and here is come to do some villanous shame
to the dead bodies i will apprehend him
stop thy unhallowed toil vile montague
can vengeance be pursu'd further than death
condemned villain i do apprehend thee
obey and go with me for thou must die
rom i must indeed and therefore came i hither
fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
let them affright thee i beseech thee youth
but not another sin upon my head
by urging me to fury o be gone
by heaven i love thee better than myself
for i come hither arm'd against myself
stay not be gone live and hereafter say
a madmans mercy bid thee run away
par i do defy thy conjuration
rom wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
they fight
page o lord they fight i will go call the watch
exit paris falls
par o i am slain if thou be merciful
open the tomb lay me with juliet dies
rom in faith i will let me peruse this face
mercutio's kinsman noble county paris
what said my man when my betossed soul
he told me paris should have married juliet
said he not so or did i dream it so
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet
to think it was so o give me thy hand
one writ with me in sour misfortune's book
i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave
a grave o no a lanthorn slaught'red youth
for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light
lays him in the tomb
how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry which their keepers call
a lightning before death o how may i
call this a lightning o my love my wife
death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
o what more favour can i do to thee
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
to sunder his that was thine enemy
forgive me cousin' ah dear juliet
why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again here here will i remain
with worms that are thy chambermaids o here
will i set up my everlasting rest
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world wearied flesh eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace and lips o you
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death
thou desperate pilot now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
here's to my love drinks o true apothecary
thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die falls
enter friar laurence with lanthorn crow and spade
friar saint francis be my speed how oft to night

stay not to question for the watch is coming
come go good juliet i dare no longer stay
exit friar
what's here a cup clos'd in my true love's hand

enter paris's boy and watch

exeunt some of the watch
pitiful sight here lies the county slain
who here hath lain this two days buried
go tell the prince run to the capulets
raise up the montagues some others search
exeunt others of the watch
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
we cannot without circumstance descry
enter some of the watch with romeo's man balthasar
2 watch here's romeo's man we found him in the churchyard
enter friar laurence and another watchman
3 watch here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
we took this mattock and this spade from him
as he was coming from this churchyard side
chief watch a great suspicion stay the friar too
enter the prince and attendants
prince what misadventure is so early up
that calls our person from our morning rest
enter capulet and his wife with others
wife the people in the street cry 'romeo'
some 'juliet' and some 'paris' and all run
with open outcry toward our monument
prince what fear is this which startles in our ears
chief watch sovereign here lies the county paris slain
and romeo dead and juliet dead before
warm and new killd
prince search seek and know how this foul murder comes
chief watch here is a friar and slaughter'd romeo's man
these dead mens tombs
cap o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mista'en for lo his house
is empty on the back of montague
and it missheathed in my daughter's bosom
wife o me this sight of death is as a bell
that warns my old age to a sepulchre
enter montague and others
prince come montague for thou art early up
mon alas my liege my wife is dead to night
grief of my sons exile hath stopp'd her breath
what further woe conspires against mine age
prince look and thou shalt see
mon o thou untaught what manners is in this
to press before thy father to a grave
prince seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
till we can clear these ambiguities
and know their spring their head their true descent
and lead you even to death meantime forbear
and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion
friar i am the greatest able to do least
yet most suspected as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murther
and here i stand both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excus'd
prince then say it once what thou dost know in this
is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife
i married them and their stoln marriage day
was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death
banish'd the new made bridegroom from this city
for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind
you to remove that siege of grief from her
betroth'd and would have married her perforce
and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
to rid her from this second marriage
or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutored by my art
a sleeping potion which so took effect
as i intended for it wrought on her
the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
that he should hither come as this dire night
to help to take her from her borrowed grave
but he which bore my letter friar john
was stay'd by accident and yesternight
returnd my letter back then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
came i to take her from her kindred's vault
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
till i conveniently could send to romeo
but when i came some minute ere the time
of her awaking here untimely lay
she wakes and i entreated her come forth
and bear this work of heaven with patience
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
and she too desperate would not go with me
but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage
her nurse is privy and if aught in this
miscarried by my fault let my old life
be sacrific'd some hour before his time
prince we still have known thee for a holy man
where's romeo's man what can he say in this
bal i brought my master news of juliet's death
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father
and threat'ned me with death going in the vault
if i departed not and left him there
prince give me the letter i will look on it
sirrah what made your master in this place
boy he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
and bid me stand aloof and so i did
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
and by and by my master drew on him
and then i ran away to call the watch
prince this letter doth make good the friar's words
their course of love the tidings of her death
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
where be these enemies capulet montage
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and i for winking at you discords too
have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish'd
cap o brother montague give me thy hand
this is my daughter's jointure for no more
can i demand
for i will raise her statue in pure gold
that whiles verona by that name is known
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet
cap as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie
poor sacrifices of our enmity
prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings
the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo

'twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well
i have forgot your name but sure that part
was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd
player i think 'twas soto that your honour means
lord 'tis very true thou didst it excellent
well you are come to me in happy time
the rather for i have some sport in hand
there is a lord will hear you play to night
but i am doubtful of your modesties
lest over eying of his odd behaviour
for yet his honour never heard a play
you break into some merry passion
and so offend him for i tell you sirs
if you should smile he grows impatient
player fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
were he the veriest antic in the world
and give them friendly welcome every one
let them want nothing that my house affords
exit one with the players
sirrah go you to bartholomew my page
and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady
that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber
and call him 'madam' do him obeisance
tell him from me as he will win my love
he bear himself with honourable action
unto their lords by them accomplished
such duty to the drunkard let him do
with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
and say 'what is't your honour will command
wherein your lady and your humble wife
may show her duty and make known her love'
and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
and with declining head into his bosom
bid him shed tears as being overjoyed
who for this seven years hath esteemed him
no better than a poor and loathsome beggar
and if the boy have not a womans gift
to rain a shower of commanded tears
an onion will do well for such a shift
which in a napkin being close convey'd
shall in despite enforce a watery eye
see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst
anon i'll give thee more instructions exit a servingman
voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
i long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband'
and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
when they do homage to this simple peasant
i'll in to counsel them haply my presence
may well abate the over merry spleen
which otherwise would grow into extremes exeunt

third servant o this it is that makes your lady mourn
second servant o this is it that makes your servants droop
lord hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
as beaten hence by your strange lunacy
o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
and banish hence these abject lowly dreams
look how thy servants do attend on thee
each in his office ready at thy beck
wilt thou have music hark apollo plays music
and twenty caged nightingales do sing
or wilt thou sleep we'll have thee to a couch
softer and sweeter than the lustful bed

say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground
their harness studded all with gold and pearl
dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
and fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth
first servant say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
second servant dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee
empty

which seem to move and wanton with her breath
even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind
lord we'll show thee lo as she was a maid

as lively painted as the deed was done
third servant or daphne roaming through a thorny wood
scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds

lord thou art a lord and nothing but a lord
thou hast a lady far more beautiful
than any woman in this waning age
first servant and till the tears that she hath shed for thee
like envious floods o'er run her lovely face
she was the fairest creature in the world
and yet she is inferior to none
sly am i a lord and have i such a lady

these fifteen years you have been in a dream
sly these fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
but did i never speak of all that time
first servant o yes my lord but very idle words
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber
yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
and rail upon the hostess of the house
and say you would present her at the leet
because she brought stone jugs and no seald quarts
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket
third servant why sir you know no house nor no such maid
nor no such men as you have reckond up

no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en

advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to
our fair mistress and be happy rivals in bianca's love to
gremio what's that i pray
hortensio marry sir to get a husband for her sister
gremio a husband a devil
hortensio i say a husband

hortensio tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine to
endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the
world an a man could light on them would take her with all
gremio i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with this
condition to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning

tranio i pray sir tell me is it possible
that love should of a sudden take such hold
lucentio o tranio till i found it to be true

as anna to the queen of carthage was
tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
if i achieve not this young modest girl
counsel me tranio for i know thou canst
assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
tranio master it is no time to chide you now
affection is not rated from the heart
if love have touch'd you nought remains but so
lucentio gramercies lad go forward this contents
the rest will comfort for thy counsels sound
tranio master you look'd so longly on the maid
perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all
lucentio o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
such as the daughter of agenor had
that made great jove to humble him to her hand
when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand
tranio saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
lucentio tranio i saw her coral lips to move
and with her breath she did perfume the air
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
tranio nay then 'tis time to stir him from his trance
i pray awake sir if you love the maid
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it stands
her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
that till the father rid his hands of her
and therefore has he closely mew'd her up
because she will not be annoy'd with suitors
lucentio ah tranio what a cruel father's he
but art thou not advis'd he took some care
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
tranio ay marry am i sir and now 'tis plotted
lucentio i have it tranio
tranio master for my hand
both our inventions meet and jump in one
tranio you will be schoolmaster
and undertake the teaching of the maid
that's your device

i will some other be some florentine
some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
'tis hatch'd and shall be so tranio at once
uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak
when biondello comes he waits on thee
tranio so had you need they exchange habits
in brief sir sith it your pleasure is
and i am tied to be obedient
for so your father charg'd me at our parting
'be serviceable to my son quoth he
although i think 'twas in another sense
i am content to be lucentio
because so well i love lucentio
lucentio tranio be so because lucentio loves
whose sudden sight hath thralld my wounded eye
enter biondello

biondello where have i been nay how now where are you
master has my fellow tranio stoln your clothes
or you stoln his or both pray what's the news
lucentio sirrah come hither 'tis no time to jest
and therefore frame your manners to the time

biondello i sir ne'er a whit
lucentio and not a jot of tranio in your mouth

page my lord 'tis but begun
sly 'tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady
would 'twere done they sit and mark
scene ii
padua before hortensio's house
petruchio verona for a while i take my leave
to see my friends in padua but of all
my best beloved and approved friend
hortensio and i trow this is his house
here sirrah grumio knock i say
grumio knock sir whom should i knock
is there any man has rebus'd your worship
petruchio villain i say knock me here soundly
grumio knock you here sir why sir what am i sir that i
petruchio villain i say knock me at this gate
and rap me well or i'll knock your knave's pate
grumio my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock you first
and then i know after who comes by the worst
petruchio will it not be
faith sirrah an you'll not knock i'll ring it
i'll try how you can sol fa and sing it
he wrings him by the ears
grumio help masters help my master is mad
enter hortensio
hortensio how now what's the matter my old friend grumio and my
good friend petruchio how do you all at verona
petruchio signior hortensio come you to part the fray
'con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may i say
hortensio alla nostra casa ben venuto
molto honorato signor mio petruchio
rise grumio rise we will compound this quarrel
grumio nay 'tis no matter sir what he 'leges in latin if this
he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir well was it fit
for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught i
see two and thirty a pip out
whom would to god i had well knock'd at first
then had not grumio come by the worst
petruchio a senseless villain good hortensio
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
and could not get him for my heart to do it
grumio knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these words
knock me soundly' and come you now with 'knocking at the gate'
petruchio sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
hortensio petruchio patience i am grumio's pledge
why this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you
your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
blows you to padua here from old verona
petruchio such wind as scatters young men through the world
to seek their fortunes farther than at home
signior hortensio thus it stands with me
antonio my father is deceas'd
and i have thrust myself into this maze
haply to wive and thrive as best i may
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
and so am come abroad to see the world
hortensio petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
and wish thee to a shrewd ill favour'd wife
thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel
and very rich but th'art too much my friend
and i'll not wish thee to her
petruchio signior hortensio 'twixt such friends as we
few words suffice and therefore if thou know
one rich enough to be petruchio's wife
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
be she as foul as was florentius' love
as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
as socrates' xanthippe or a worse
affections edge in me were she as rough
as are the swelling adriatic seas
i come to wive it wealthily in padua
if wealthily then happily in padua
grumio nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is
why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
aglet baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though
she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses why nothing
comes amiss so money comes withal
i will continue that i broach'd in jest
i can petruchio help thee to a wife
with wealth enough and young and beauteous
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
her only fault and that is faults enough
is that she is intolerable curst
and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
that were my state far worser than it is
i would not wed her for a mine of gold
tell me her father's name and 'tis enough
for i will board her though she chide as loud
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
hortensio her father is baptista minola
an affable and courteous gentleman
her name is katherina minola
renownd in padua for her scolding tongue
petruchio i know her father though i know not her
and he knew my deceased father well
and therefore let me be thus bold with you
to give you over at this first encounter
unless you will accompany me thither
grumio i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts o' my
word and she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding
would do little good upon him she may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so why that's nothing and he begin once he'll
rail in his rope tricks i'll tell you what sir an she stand
him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so
withal than a cat you know him not sir
hortensio tarry petruchio i must go with thee
for in baptista's keep my treasure is
he hath the jewel of my life in hold
his youngest daughter beautiful bianca
and her withholds from me and other more
suitors to her and rivals in my love
supposing it a thing impossible
for those defects i have before rehears'd
therefore this order hath baptista ta'en
that none shall have access unto bianca
till katherine the curst have got a husband
grumio katherine the curst
a title for a maid of all titles the worst
hortensio now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
and offer me disguis'd in sober robes
to old baptista as a schoolmaster
well seen in music to instruct bianca
have leave and leisure to make love to her
and unsuspected court her by herself
enter gremio with lucentio disguised as cambio
grumio here's no knavery see to beguile the old folks how the
young folks lay their heads together master master look about
you who goes there ha
hortensio peace grumio it is the rival of my love petruchio
stand by awhile
grumio a proper stripling and an amorous
gremio o very well i have perus'd the note
hark you sir i'll have them very fairly bound
all books of love see that at any hand
and see you read no other lectures to her
you understand me over and beside
signior baptista's liberality
i'll mend it with a largess take your paper too
and let me have them very well perfum'd
for she is sweeter than perfume itself
lucentio whate'er i read to her i'll plead for you
as for my patron stand you so assur'd
as firmly as yourself were still in place
yea and perhaps with more successful words
than you unless you were a scholar sir
gremio o this learning what a thing it is
grumio o this woodcock what an ass it is
petruchio peace sirrah
hortensio grumio mum coming forward
gremio and you are well met signior hortensio
trow you whither i am going to baptista minola
i promis'd to enquire carefully
about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca
and by good fortune i have lighted well
on this young man for learning and behaviour
fit for her turn well read in poetry
and other books good ones i warrant ye
hortensio 'tis well and i have met a gentleman
a fine musician to instruct our mistress
so shall i no whit be behind in duty
to fair bianca so beloved of me
gremio beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
grumio and that his bags shall prove
hortensio gremio 'tis now no time to vent our love
listen to me and if you speak me fair
i'll tell you news indifferent good for either
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met
will undertake to woo curst katherine
yea and to marry her if her dowry please
gremio so said so done is well
hortensio have you told him all her faults
petruchio i know she is an irksome brawling scold
if that be all masters i hear no harm
gremio no say'st me so friend what countryman
petruchio born in verona old antonio's son
my father dead my fortune lives for me
gremio o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
but if you have a stomach to't a god's name
you shall have me assisting you in all
but will you woo this wild cat
petruchio will i live
grumio will he woo her ay or i'll hang her
petruchio why came i hither but to that intent
think you a little din can daunt mine ears
have i not in my time heard lions roar
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
have i not heard great ordnance in the field
and heavens artillery thunder in the skies
have i not in a pitched battle heard
loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets' clang
and do you tell me of a womans tongue
that gives not half so great a blow to hear
as will a chestnut in a fariner's fire
tush tush fear boys with bugs
gremio hortensio hark
this gentleman is happily arriv'd
my mind presumes for his own good and ours
hortensio i promis'd we would be contributors
and bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er
gremio and so we will provided that he win her
grumio i would i were as sure of a good dinner
enter tranio bravely apparelled as lucentio and biondello
tranio gentlemen god save you if i may be bold
to the house of signior baptista minola
biondello he that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean
tranio even he biondello
gremio hark you sir you mean not her to
tranio perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
petruchio not her that chides sir at any hand i pray
tranio i love no chiders sir biondello let's away
lucentio aside well begun tranio
hortensio sir a word ere you go
tranio and if i be sir is it any offence
gremio no if without more words you will get you hence
tranio why sir i pray are not the streets as free
for me as for you
gremio but so is not she
tranio for what reason i beseech you
gremio for this reason if you'll know
that she's the choice love of signior gremio
hortensio that she's the chosen of signior hortensio
do me this right hear me with patience
baptista is a noble gentleman
to whom my father is not all unknown
and were his daughter fairer than she is
she may more suitors have and me for one
fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers
then well one more may fair bianca have
and so she shall lucentio shall make one
though paris came in hope to speed alone
lucentio sir give him head i know he'll prove a jade
petruchio hortensio to what end are all these words
hortensio sir let me be so bold as ask you
did you yet ever see baptista's daughter
tranio no sir but hear i do that he hath two
the one as famous for a scolding tongue
as is the other for beauteous modesty
petruchio sir sir the first's for me let her go by
gremio yea leave that labour to great hercules
petruchio sir understand you this of me in sooth
the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
her father keeps from all access of suitors
and will not promise her to any man
until the elder sister first be wed
the younger then is free and not before
tranio if it be so sir that you are the man
must stead us all and me amongst the rest
and if you break the ice and do this feat
for our access whose hap shall be to have her
will not so graceless be to be ingrate
hortensio sir you say well and well you do conceive
and since you do profess to be a suitor
you must as we do gratify this gentleman
to whom we all rest generally beholding
tranio sir i shall not be slack in sign whereof
please ye we may contrive this afternoon
and quaff carouses to our mistress' health
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
grumio biondello o excellent motion fellows let's be gone
hortensio the motions good indeed and be it so
petruchio i shall be your ben venuto exeunt

baptista good morrow neighbour gremio
god save you gentlemen
petruchio and you good sir pray have you not a daughter
calld katherina fair and virtuous
baptista i have a daughter sir calld katherina
gremio you are too blunt go to it orderly
i am a gentleman of verona sir
that hearing of her beauty and her wit
her affability and bashful modesty
her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour
am bold to show myself a forward guest
within your house to make mine eye the witness
of that report which i so oft have heard
and for an entrance to my entertainment
i do present you with a man of mine
cunning in music and the mathematics
to instruct her fully in those sciences
whereof i know she is not ignorant
accept of him or else you do me wrong
his name is licio born in mantua
baptista y'are welcome sir and he for your good sake
but for my daughter katherine this i know
she is not for your turn the more my grief
petruchio i see you do not mean to part with her
baptista mistake me not i speak but as i find
whence are you sir what may i call your name
petruchio petruchio is my name antonio's son
a man well known throughout all italy
baptista i know him well you are welcome for his sake
gremio saving your tale petruchio i pray
let us that are poor petitioners speak too
bacare you are marvellous forward
petruchio o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am sure of it to
express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly
beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young
scholar presenting lucentio that hath been long studying at
rheims as cunning in greek latin and other languages as the
other in music and mathematics his name is cambio pray accept
his service
baptista a thousand thanks signior gremio welcome good cambio
to tranio but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
tranio pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
that being a stranger in this city here
do make myself a suitor to your daughter
unto bianca fair and virtuous
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
in the preferment of the eldest sister
this liberty is all that i request
that upon knowledge of my parentage
i may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
and toward the education of your daughters
i here bestow a simple instrument
and this small packet of greek and latin books
if you accept them then their worth is great
baptista lucentio is your name of whence i pray
tranio of pisa sir son to vincentio
baptista a mighty man of pisa by report
i know him well you are very welcome sir
take you the lute and you the set of books
holla within
enter a servant
sirrah lead these gentlemen
to my daughters and tell them both
these are their tutors bid them use them well
exit servant leading hortensio carrying the lute
and lucentio with the books
we will go walk a little in the orchard
and then to dinner you are passing welcome
petruchio signior baptista my business asketh haste
and every day i cannot come to woo
you knew my father well and in him me
left solely heir to all his lands and goods
which i have bettered rather than decreas'd
then tell me if i get your daughter's love
what dowry shall i have with her to wife
baptista after my death the one half of my lands
and in possession twenty thousand crowns
her widowhood be it that she survive me
in all my lands and leases whatsoever
let specialities be therefore drawn between us
that covenants may be kept on either hand
baptista ay when the special thing is well obtaind
that is her love for that is all in all
petruchio why that is nothing for i tell you father
i am as peremptory as she proud minded
and where two raging fires meet together
though little fire grows great with little wind
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
so i to her and so she yields to me
for i am rough and woo not like a babe
baptista well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words
petruchio ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
that shake not though they blow perpetually
re enter hortensio with his head broke
hortensio for fear i promise you if i look pale
baptista what will my daughter prove a good musician
hortensio i think she'll sooner prove a soldier
iron may hold with her but never lutes
baptista why then thou canst not break her to the lute
hortensio why no for she hath broke the lute to me
i did but tell her she mistook her frets
and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering
when with a most impatient devilish spirit
and with that word she struck me on the head
and through the instrument my pate made way
and there i stood amazed for a while
as on a pillory looking through the lute
while she did call me rascal fiddler
and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
as she had studied to misuse me so
petruchio now by the world it is a lusty wench
i love her ten times more than e'er i did
baptista well go with me and be not so discomfited
proceed in practice with my younger daughter
she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns
signior petruchio will you go with us
or shall i send my daughter kate to you
petruchio i pray you do exeunt all but petruchio
i'll attend her here
and woo her with some spirit when she comes
say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain
say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear
as morning roses newly wash'd with dew
say she be mute and will not speak a word
then i'll commend her volubility
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks
as though she bid me stay by her a week
if she deny to wed i'll crave the day
when i shall ask the banns and when be married
enter katherina
good morrow kate for that's your name i hear
katherina well have you heard but something hard of hearing
they call me katherine that do talk of me
petruchio you lie in faith for you are calld plain kate
and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst
but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
kate of kate hall my super dainty kate
for dainties are all kates and therefore kate
hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town
thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife
katherina mov'd in good time let him that mov'd you hither
remove you hence i knew you at the first
you were a moveable
petruchio why what's a moveable
katherina a joind stool
katherina asses are made to bear and so are you
petruchio women are made to bear and so are you
katherina no such jade as you if me you mean
petruchio alas good kate i will not burden thee
for knowing thee to be but young and light
katherina too light for such a swain as you to catch
and yet as heavy as my weight should be
petruchio should be should buzz
katherina well ta'en and like a buzzard
katherina ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
petruchio come come you wasp i' faith you are too angry
katherina if i be waspish best beware my sting
petruchio my remedy is then to pluck it out
katherina ay if the fool could find it where it lies
petruchio who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
in his tail
katherina in his tongue
petruchio whose tongue
petruchio what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
good kate i am a gentleman
katherina that i'll try she strikes him
petruchio i swear i'll cuff you if you strike again
katherina so may you lose your arms
if you strike me you are no gentleman
and if no gentleman why then no arms
petruchio a herald kate o put me in thy books
katherina what is your crest a coxcomb
katherina no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
petruchio nay come kate come you must not look so sour
katherina it is my fashion when i see a crab
petruchio why here's no crab and therefore look not sour
katherina there is there is
petruchio then show it me
katherina had i a glass i would
petruchio what you mean my face
katherina well aim'd of such a young one
katherina yet you are wither'd
petruchio 'tis with cares
katherina i care not
petruchio nay hear you kate in sooth you scape not so
katherina i chafe you if i tarry let me go
petruchio no not a whit i find you passing gentle
'twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
and now i find report a very liar
for thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous
thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
but thou with mildness entertainst thy wooers
with gentle conference soft and affable
why does the world report that kate doth limp
o sland'rous world kate like the hazel twig
is straight and slender and as brown in hue
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
katherina go fool and whom thou keep'st command
petruchio did ever dian so become a grove
as kate this chamber with her princely gait
o be thou dian and let her be kate
and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
katherina where did you study all this goodly speech
petruchio it is extempore from my mother wit
katherina a witty mother witless else her son
petruchio am i not wise
petruchio marry so i mean sweet katherine in thy bed
and therefore setting all this chat aside
thus in plain terms your father hath consented
that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
and will you nill you i will marry you
now kate i am a husband for your turn
for by this light whereby i see thy beauty
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
thou must be married to no man but me
and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
conformable as other household kates
re enter baptista gremio and tranio
here comes your father never make denial
i must and will have katherine to my wife
baptista now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
petruchio how but well sir how but well
it were impossible i should speed amiss
baptista why how now daughter katherine in your dumps
you have show'd a tender fatherly regard
to wish me wed to one half lunatic
a mad cap ruffian and a swearing jack
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
petruchio father 'tis thus yourself and all the world
that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her
if she be curst it is for policy
forshe's not froward but modest as the dove
she is not hot but temperate as the morn
and roman lucrece for her chastity
and to conclude we have 'greed so well together
that upon sunday is the wedding day
katherina i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first
gremio hark petruchio she says she'll see thee hang'd first
tranio is this your speeding nay then good night our part
petruchio be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself
if she and i be pleas'd what's that to you
'tis bargaind 'twixt us twain being alone
i tell you 'tis incredible to believe
how much she loves me o the kindest kate
she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
that in a twink she won me to her love
o you are novices 'tis a world to see
how tame when men and women are alone
a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
give me thy hand kate i will unto venice
provide the feast father and bid the guests
i will be sure my katherine shall be fine
baptista i know not what to say but give me your hands
god send you joy petruchio 'tis a match
gremio tranio amen say we we will be witnesses
petruchio father and wife and gentlemen adieu
i will to venice sunday comes apace
we will have rings and things and fine array
and kiss me kate we will be married a sunday
gremio was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly
baptista faith gentlemen now i play a merchant's part
and venture madly on a desperate mart
tranio 'twas a commodity lay fretting by you
'twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
baptista the gain i seek is quiet in the match
gremio no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
but now baptista to your younger daughter
now is the day we long have looked for
tranio and i am one that love bianca more
than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
gremio youngling thou canst not love so dear as i
tranio greybeard thy love doth freeze
gremio but thine doth fry
skipper stand back 'tis age that nourisheth
tranio but youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth
baptista content you gentlemen i will compound this strife
'tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
shall have my bianca's love
say signior gremio what can you assure her
gremio first as you know my house within the city
is richly furnished with plate and gold
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
my hangings all of tyrian tapestry
in ivory coffers i have stuff'd my crowns
in cypress chests my arras counterpoints
costly apparel tents and canopies
valance of venice gold in needle work
pewter and brass and all things that belongs
to house or housekeeping then at my farm
i have a hundred milch kine to the pail
six score fat oxen standing in my stalls
and all things answerable to this portion
myself am struck in years i must confess
and if i die to morrow this is hers
if whilst i live she will be only mine
i am my father's heir and only son
if i may have your daughter to my wife
i'll leave her houses three or four as good
within rich pisa's walls as any one
old signior gremio has in padua
besides two thousand ducats by the year
of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
what have i pinch'd you signior gremio
gremio two thousand ducats by the year of land
that she shall have besides an argosy
that now is lying in marseilles road
what have i chok'd you with an argosy
tranio gremio 'tis known my father hath no less
than three great argosies besides two galliasses
and twelve tight galleys these i will assure her
and twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next
gremio nay i have off'red all i have no more
and she can have no more than all i have
tranio why then the maid is mine from all the world
by your firm promise gremio is out vied
baptista i must confess your offer is the best
and let your father make her the assurance
she is your own else you must pardon me
if you should die before him where's her dower
tranio that's but a cavil he is old i young
gremio and may not young men die as well as old
baptista well gentlemen
my daughter katherine is to be married
now on the sunday following shall bianca
be bride to you if you make this assurance
if not to signior gremio

to give thee all and in his waning age

yet i have fac'd it with a card of ten
'tis in my head to do my master good
i see no reason but suppos'd lucentio
must get a father calld suppos'd vincentio
and that's a wonder fathers commonly
do get their children but in this case of wooing
a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning
act iii scene i
padua baptista's house
enter lucentio as cambio hortensio as licio and bianca
lucentio fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
have you so soon forgot the entertainment
her sister katherine welcome'd you withal
hortensio but wrangling pedant this is
the patroness of heavenly harmony
then give me leave to have prerogative
your lecture shall have leisure for as much
lucentio preposterous ass that never read so far
to know the cause why music was ordaind
was it not to refresh the mind of man
after his studies or his usual pain
then give me leave to read philosophy
and while i pause serve in your harmony
hortensio sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
bianca why gentlemen you do me double wrong
i arn no breeching scholar in the schools
i'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times
but learn my lessons as i please myself
and to cut off all strife here sit we down
take you your instrument play you the whiles
his lecture will be done ere you have tund
hortensio you'll leave his lecture when i am in tune
lucentio that will be never tune your instrument
bianca where left we last
'hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus
hic steterat priami regia celsa senis'
bianca construe them
lucentio 'hic ibat' as i told you before 'simois' i am lucentio
'hic est' son unto vincentio of pisa 'sigeia tellus' disguised
thus to get your love 'hic steterat' and that lucentio that
comes a wooing 'priami' is my man tranio 'regia' bearing my
port 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon
hortensio madam my instrument's in tune
lucentio spit in the hole man and tune again
bianca now let me see if i can construe it 'hic ibat simois' i
know you not 'hic est sigeia tellus' i trust you not 'hic
steterat priami' take heed he hear us not 'regia' presume not
'celsa senis' despair not
hortensio madam 'tis now in tune
lucentio all but the bass
hortensio the bass is right 'tis the base knave that jars
aside how fiery and forward our pedant is
pedascule i'll watch you better yet
bianca in time i may believe yet i mistrust
lucentio mistrust it not for sure aeacides
was ajax calld so from his grandfather
bianca i must believe my master else i promise you
i should be arguing still upon that doubt
but let it rest now licio to you
good master take it not unkindly pray
that i have been thus pleasant with you both
empty
my lessons make no music in three parts
lucentio are you so formal sir well i must wait
aside and watch withal for but i be deceiv'd
our fine musician groweth amorous
hortensio madam before you touch the instrument
to learn the order of my fingering
i must begin with rudiments of art
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
than hath been taught by any of my trade
and there it is in writing fairly drawn
bianca why i am past my gamut long ago
hortensio yet read the gamut of hortensio
bianca reads
'gamut i am the ground of all accord
a re to plead hortensio's passion
b mi bianca take him for thy lord
c fa ut that loves with all affection
e la mi show pity or i die'
call you this gamut tut i like it not
old fashions please me best i am not so nice
to change true rules for odd inventions
enter a servant
servant mistress your father prays you leave your books
and help to dress your sister's chamber up
you know to morrow is the wedding day
bianca farewell sweet masters both i must be gone
lucentio faith mistress then i have no cause to stay
empty
hortensio but i have cause to pry into this pedant
methinks he looks as though he were in love
yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble
to cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale
seize thee that list if once i find thee ranging
hortensio will be quit with thee by changing exit
scene ii
enter baptista gremio tranio as lucentio katherina bianca
lucentio as cambio and attendants
baptista to tranio signior lucentio this is the 'pointed day
that katherine and petruchio should be married
and yet we hear not of our son in law
what will be said what mockery will it be
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
what says lucentio to this shame of ours
to give my hand oppos'd against my heart
unto a mad brain rudesby full of spleen
who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
i told you i he was a frantic fool
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour
and to be noted for a merry man
he'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage
make friends invited and proclaim the banns
yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd
and say 'lo there is mad petruchio's wife
if it would please him come and marry her'
tranio patience good katherine and baptista too
upon my life petruchio means but well
whatever fortune stays him from his word
though he be blunt i know him passing wise
though he be merry yet withal he's honest
katherina would katherine had never seen him though
exit weeping followed by bianca and others
for such an injury would vex a very saint
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
enter biondello
master master news and such old news as you never heard of
baptista is it new and old too how may that be
biondello why is it not news to hear of petruchio's coming
baptista is he come
biondello why no sir
baptista what then
baptista when will he be here
biondello when he stands where i am and sees you there
tranio but say what to thine old news
biondello why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turnd a pair of boots
that have been candle cases one buckled another lac'd an old
rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury with a broken hilt
and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipp'd with an
old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possess'd
the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped
with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives
stark spoild with the staggers begnawn with the bots sway'd in
the back and shoulder shotten near legg'd before and with a
half cheek'd bit and a head stall of sheep's leather which
being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often
burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times piec'd
and a womans crupper of velure which hath two letters for her
name fairly set down in studs and here and there piec'd with
baptista who comes with him
biondello o sir his lackey for all the world caparisond like
the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose
on the other gart'red with a red and blue list an old hat and
the humour of forty fancies prick'd int for a feather a
monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian
footboy or a gentlemans lackey
tranio 'tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
yet oftentimes lie goes but mean apparelld
biondello why sir he comes not
baptista didst thou not say he comes
biondello who that petruchio came
baptista ay that petruchio came
biondello no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
baptista why that's all one
biondello nay by saint jamy

and yet not many
enter petruchio and grumio
petruchio come where be these gallants who's at home
baptista you are welcome sir
petruchio and yet i come not well
baptista and yet you halt not
tranio not so well apparelld
as i wish you were
petruchio were it better i should rush in thus
how does my father gentles methinks you frown
and wherefore gaze this goodly company
as if they saw some wondrous monument
some comet or unusual prodigy
baptista why sir you know this is your wedding day
first were we sad fearing you would not come
now sadder that you come so unprovided
fie doff this habit shame to your estate
an eye sore to our solemn festival
hath all so long detaind you from your wife
and sent you hither so unlike yourself
petruchio tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
sufficeth i am come to keep my word
though in some part enforced to digress
which at more leisure i will so excuse
as you shall well be satisfied withal
but where is kate i stay too long from her
the morning wears 'tis time we were at church
go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
petruchio not i believe me thus i'll visit her
baptista but thus i trust you will not marry her
petruchio good sooth even thus therefore ha' done with words
to me she's married not unto my clothes
could i repair what she will wear in me
as i can change these poor accoutrements
'twere well for kate and better for myself
but what a fool am i to chat with you
and seal the title with a lovely kiss
exeunt petruchio and petruchio
tranio he hath some meaning in his mad attire
we will persuade him be it possible
to put on better ere he go to church
baptista i'll after him and see the event of this
exeunt baptista gremio biondello and attendents
tranio but to her love concerneth us to ad
her father's liking which to bring to pass
i am to get a man whate'er he be
it skills not much we'll fit him to our turn
and he shall be vincentio of pisa
and make assurance here in padua
of greater sums than i have promised
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
and marry sweet bianca with consent
lucentio were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly
which once perform'd let all the world say no
i'll keep mine own despite of all the world
tranio that by degrees we mean to look into
and watch our vantage in this business
we'll over reach the greybeard gremio
the narrow prying father minola
the quaint musician amorous licio
all for my master's sake lucentio
re enter gremio
gremio as willingly as e'er i came from school
tranio and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
gremio a bridegroom say you 'tis a groom indeed
a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
tranio curster than she why 'tis impossible
gremio why he's a devil a devil a very fiend
tranio why she's a devil a devil the devils dam
gremio tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him
i'll tell you sir lucentio when the priest
'ay by gogs wouns' quoth he and swore so loud
that all amaz'd the priest let fall the book
and as he stoop'd again to take it up
this mad braind bridegroom took him such a cuff
that down fell priest and book and book and priest
'now take them up' quoth he 'if any list'
tranio what said the wench when he rose again
gremio trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore
as if the vicar meant to cozen him
he calls for wine 'a health' quoth he as if
he had been abroad carousing to his mates
after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel
and threw the sops all in the sextons face
having no other reason
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking
this done he took the bride about the neck
and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
and i seeing this came thence for very shame
and after me i know the rout is coming
such a mad marriage never was before
hark hark i hear the minstrels play music plays

re enter petruchio
petruchio thus have i politicly begun my reign
and 'tis my hope to end successfully
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be full gorg'd
for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard
to make her come and know her keeper's call
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
she eat no meat to day nor none shall eat
last night she slept not nor to night she shall not
as with the meat some undeserved fault
i'll find about the making of the bed
and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster
this way the coverlet another way the sheets
ay and amid this hurly i intend
that all is done in reverend care of her
and in conclusion she shall watch all night
and with the clamour keep her still awake
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour
he that knows better how to tame a shrew
now let him speak 'tis charity to show exit

'twere deadly sickness or else present death
i prithee go and get me some repast

what say you to a piece of beef and mustard

and if you cannot best you stop your ears
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart
or else my heart concealing it will break
even to the uttermost as i please in words
petruchio why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap

master cut out the gown but i did not bid him cut it to pieces

tailor why here is the note of the fashion to testify
grumio the note lies ins throat if he say i said so
tailor reads 'imprimis a loose bodied gown
grumio master if ever i said loose bodied gown sew me in the
skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread i
said a gown
petruchio proceed
tailor reads 'with a small compass'd cape'
grumio i confess the cape

tailor reads 'the sleeves curiously cut'
petruchio ay there's the villainy
grumio error i' th' bill sir error i' th' bill i commanded the
sleeves should be cut out and sew'd up again and that i'll
prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
tailor this is true that i say an i had thee in place where thou

away i say commend me to thy master exit tailor
petruchio well come my kate we will unto your father's
even in these honest mean habiliments
our purses shall be proud our garments poor
for 'tis the mind that makes the body rich
and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds
what is the jay more precious than the lark
because his feathers are more beautiful
or is the adder better than the eel
because his painted skin contents the eye
o no good kate neither art thou the worse
for this poor furniture and mean array
if thou account'st it shame lay it on me
and therefore frolic we will hence forthwith
to feast and sport us at thy father's house
and bring our horses unto long lane end
there will we mount and thither walk on foot

tranio 'tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
'tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay
baptista o o petruchio tranio hits you now
lucentio i thank thee for that gird good tranio
hortensio confess confess hath he not hit you here
and as the jest did glance away from me

to come at first when he doth send for her

lucentio twenty crowns
petruchio twenty crowns

hortensio content
petruchio a match 'tis done
hortensio who shall begin
lucentio that will i
biondello i go exit

petruchio worse and worse she will not come o vile
intolerable not to be endur'd

hortensio i know her answer
petruchio what
hortensio she will not
re enter katherina
baptista now by my holidame here comes katherina
katherina what is your sir that you send for me
petruchio where is your sister and hortensio's wife
katherina they sit conferring by the parlour fire
petruchio go fetch them hither if they deny to come
swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
away i say and bring them hither straight
exit katherina
hortensio and so it is i wonder what it bodes
petruchio marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
an awful rule and right supremacy
and to be short what not that's sweet and happy
baptista now fair befall thee good petruchio
the wager thou hast won and i will ad
unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
another dowry to another daughter
for she is chang'd as she had never been
and show more sign of her obedience
her new built virtue and obedience
re enter katherina with bianca and widow
see where she comes and brings your froward wives
as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
katherine that cap of yours becomes you not
off with that bauble throw it underfoot
katherina complies
widow lord let me never have a cause to sigh
bianca fie what a foolish duty call you this
lucentio i would your duty were as foolish too
the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper time
bianca the more fool you for laying on my duty
petruchio katherine i charge thee tell these headstrong women
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
widow come come you're mocking we will have no telling
petruchio come on i say and first begin with her
petruchio i say she shall and first begin with her
katherina fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled
muddy ill seeming thick bereft of beauty
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
and for thy maintenance commits his body
to painful labour both by sea and land
to watch the night in storms the day in cold
whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
and craves no other tribute at thy hands
but love fair looks and true obedience
such duty as the subject owes the prince
even such a woman oweth to her husband
and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
and not obedient to his honest will
what is she but a foul contending rebel
and graceless traitor to her loving lord
i am asham'd that women are so simple
to offer war where they should kneel for peace
or seek for rule supremacy and sway
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
unapt to toll and trouble in the world
but that our soft conditions and our hearts
should well agree with our external parts
come come you froward and unable worms
my mind hath been as big as one of yours
my heart as great my reason haply more
to bandy word for word and frown for frown
but now i see our lances are but straws
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
and place your hands below your husband's foot
in token of which duty if he please
my hand is ready may it do him ease
petruchio why there's a wench come on and kiss me kate
lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't
vincentio 'tis a good hearing when children are toward
lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward
we three are married but you two are sped
to lucentio 'twas i won the wager though you hit the white
and being a winner god give you good night
exeunt petruchio and katherina
hortensio now go thy ways thou hast tam'd a curst shrow
lucentio 'tis a wonder by your leave she will be tam'd so

the island before prospero's cell
enter prospero and miranda
miranda if by your art my dearest father you have
put the wild waters in this roar allay them
the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
but that the sea mounting to th' welkins cheek
dashes the fire out o i have suffered
with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel
who had no doubt some noble creature in her
against my very heart poor souls they perish'd
had i been any god of power i would
have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
it should the good ship so have swallow'd and
the fraughting souls within her
prospero be conected
no more amazement tell your piteous heart
there's no harm done
miranda o woe the day
i have done nothing but in care of thee
of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
of whence i am nor that i am more better
than prospero master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater father
miranda more to know
did never meddle with my thoughts
prospero 'tis time
and pluck my magic garment from me so
lays down his mantle
lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd
the very virtue of compassion in thee
i have with such provision in mine art
so safely ordered that there is no soul
no not so much perdition as an hair
betid to any creature in the vessel
sit down for thou must now know farther
miranda you have often
begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd
and left me to a bootless inquisition
concluding 'stay not yet'
prospero the hour's now come
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
obey and be attentive canst thou remember
a time before we came unto this cell
out three years old
miranda certainly sir i can
prospero by what by any other house or person
of any thing the image tell me that
hath kept with thy remembrance
miranda 'tis far off
and rather like a dream than an assurance
that my remembrance warrants had i not
four or five women once that tended me
that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
in the dark backward and abysm of time
if thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here
how thou cam'st here thou mayst
miranda but that i do not
prospero twelve year since miranda twelve year since
thy father was the duke of milan and
a prince of power
miranda sir are not you my father
she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
was duke of milan and his only heir
and princess no worse issued
miranda o the heavens
what foul play had we that we came from thence
or blessed was't we did
prospero both both my girl
by foul play as thou say'st were we heav'd thence
but blessedly holp hither
to think o' th' teen that i have turnd you to
which is from my remembrance please you farther
prospero my brother and thy uncle calld antonio
i pray thee mark me that a brother should
be so perfidious he whom next thyself
of all the world i lov'd and to him put
the manage of my state as at that time
through all the signories it was the first
and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
without a parallel those being all my study
the government i cast upon my brother
and to my state grew stranger being transported
and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle
dost thou attend me
miranda sir most heedfully
prospero being once perfected how to grant suits
how to deny them who t' advance and who
to trash for over topping new created
or else new form'd 'em having both the key
of officer and office set all hearts i' th' state
to what tune pleas'd his ear that now he was
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
and suck'd my verdure out ont thou attend'st not
miranda o good sir i do
prospero i pray thee mark me
i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
to closeness and the bettering of my mind
o'er priz'd all popular rate in my false brother
awak'd an evil nature and my trust
like a good parent did beget of him
a falsehood in its contrary as great
as my trust was which had indeed no limit
a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
not only with what my revenue yielded
but what my power might else exact like one
who having into truth by telling of it
to credit his own lie he did believe
he was indeed the duke out o' th' substitution
and executing th' outward face of royalty
with all prerogative hence his ambition growing
dost thou hear
miranda your tale sir would cure deafness
prospero to have no screen between this part he play'd
and him he play'd it for he needs will be
absolute milan me poor man my library
he thinks me now incapable confederates
so dry he was for sway wi' th' king of naples
to give him annual tribute do him homage
subject his coronet to his crown and bend
the dukedom yet unbow'd alas poor milan
to most ignoble stooping
miranda o the heavens
prospero mark his condition and th' event then tell me
if this might be a brother
to think but nobly of my grandmother
good wombs have borne bad sons
prospero now the condition
this king of naples being an enemy
to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit
which was that he in lieu o' th' premises
of homage and i know not how much tribute
should presently extirpate me and mine
out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
a treacherous army levied one midnight
fated to th' purpose did antonio open
the gates of milan and i' th' dead of darkness
the ministers for th' purpose hurried thence
me and thy crying self
miranda alack for pity
i not rememb'ring how i cried out then
will cry it o'er again it is a hint
that wrings mine eyes to't
and then i'll bring thee to the present busines
which now's upon 's without the which this story
were most impertinent
miranda wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us
prospero well demanded wench
my tale provokes that question dear they durst not
so dear the love my people bore me nor set
a mark so bloody on the business but
in few they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
a rotten carcass of a butt not rigg'd
nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
instinctively have quit it there they hoist us
to cry to th' sea that roar'd to us to sigh
to th' winds whose pity sighing back again
did us but loving wrong
miranda alack what trouble
prospero o a cherubin
thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile
infused with a fortitude from heaven
when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
under my burden groand which rais'd in me
an undergoing stomach to bear up
against what should ensue
miranda how came we ashore
prospero by providence divine
a noble neapolitan gonzalo
out of his charity who being then appointed
master of this design did give us with
rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
knowing i lov'd my books he furnish'd me
from mine own library with volumes that
i prize above my dukedom
miranda would i might
prospero now i arise puts on his mantle
sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow
here in this island we arriv'd and here
have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
than other princess' can that have more time
for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
miranda heavens thank you for't and now i pray you
empty
for still 'tis beating in my mind your reason
prospero know thus far forth
by accident most strange bountiful fortune
now my dear lady hath mine enemies
brought to this shore and by my prescience
i find my zenith doth depend upon
a most auspicious star whose influence
if now i court not but omit my fortunes
will ever after droop here cease more questions
thou art inclind to sleep 'tis a good dullness
miranda sleeps
come away servant come i am ready now
approach my ariel come
enter ariel
ariel all hail great master grave sir hail i come
to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly
to swim to dive into the fire to ride
on the curld clouds to thy strong bidding task
ariel and all his quality
perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee
ariel to every article
i boarded the king's ship now on the beak
now in the waist the deck in every cabin
i flam'd amazement sometime i'd divide
and burn in many places on the topmast
the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly
then meet and join jove's lightning the precursors
o' th' dreadful thunder claps more momentary
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
yea his dread trident shake
prospero my brave spirit
who was so firm so constant that this coil
would not infect his reason
ariel not a soul
but felt a fever of the mad and play'd
some tricks of desperation all but mariners
then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand
with hair up staring then like reeds not hair
was the first man that leapt cried 'hell is empty
and all the devils are here'
prospero why that's my spirit
but was not this nigh shore
ariel close by my master
prospero but are they ariel safe
ariel not a hair perish'd
but fresher than before and as thou bad'st me
in troops i have dispers'd them 'bout the isle
the king's son have i landed by himself
whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
his arms in this sad knot
prospero of the king's ship
the mariners say how thou hast dispos'd
and all the rest o' th' fleet
is the king's ship in the deep nook where once
thou calldst me up at midnight to fetch dew
from the still vex'd bermoothes there she's hid
the mariners all under hatches stowed
who with a charm joind to their suff'red labour
i have left asleep and for the rest o' th' fleet
which i dispers'd they all have met again
and are upon the mediterranean flote
bound sadly home for naples
and his great person perish
prospero ariel thy charge
exactly is perform'd but there's more work
what is the time o' th' day
ariel past the mid season
prospero at least two glasses the time 'twixt six and now
must by us both be spent most preciously
ariel is there more toil since thou dost give me pains
let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd
prospero how now moody
what is't thou canst demand
ariel my liberty
prospero before the time be out no more
ariel i prithee
remember i have done thee worthy service
told thee no lies made thee no mistakings serv'd
without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
to bate me a full year
from what a torment i did free thee
ariel no
prospero thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze
of the salt deep
to run upon the sharp wind of the north
to do me business in the veins o' th' earth
when it is bak'd with frost
ariel i do not sir
prospero thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot
was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
ariel no sir
prospero thou hast where was she born
speak tell me
ariel sir in argier
prospero o was she so i must
once in a month recount what thou hast been
which thou forget'st this damnd witch sycorax
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did
they would not take her life is not this true
ariel ay sir
prospero this blue ey'd hag was hither brought with child
and here was left by th'sailors thou my slave
as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant
and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
and in her most unmitigable rage
into a cloven pine within which rift
imprisond thou didst painfully remain
a dozen years within which space she died
and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
as fast as mill wheels strike then was this island
save for the son that she did litter here
a freckld whelp hag born not honour'd with
a human shape
prospero dull thing i say so he that caliban
whom now i keep in service thou best know'st
what torment i did find thee in thy groans
did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
of ever angry bears it was a torment
to lay upon the damnd which sycorax
could not again undo it was mine art
when i arriv'd and heard thee that made gape
the pine and let thee out
prospero if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howld away twelve winters
ariel pardon master
i will be correspondent to command
and do my spriting gently
prospero do so and after two days
i will discharge thee
ariel that's my noble master
prospero go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea be subject
to no sight but thine and mine invisible
to every eyeball else go take this shape
and hither come in 't go hence with diligence
exit ariel
awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well
empty
miranda the strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me
we'll visit caliban my slave who never
yields us kind answer
miranda 'tis a villain sir

prospero but as 'tis
we cannot miss him he does make our fire
fetch in our wood and serves in offices
that profit us what ho slave caliban

upon thy wicked dam come forth

drop on you both a south west blow on ye
and blister you all o'er
prospero for this be sure to night thou shalt have cramps
side stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
shall for that vast of night that they may work
all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd
as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
than bees that made 'em
this island's mine by sycorax my mother
which thou tak'st from me when thou cam'st first
thou strok'st me and made much of me wouldst give me
water with berries int and teach me how
to name the bigger light and how the less
that burn by day and night and then i lov'd thee
and show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle
the fresh springs brine pits barren place and fertile
curs'd be i that did so all the charms
for i am all the subjects that you have
which first was mine own king and here you sty me
in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
the rest o' th' island
prospero thou most lying slave
whom stripes may move not kindness i have us'd thee
filth as thou art with human care and lodg'd thee
in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child
thou didst prevent me i had peopld else
this isle with calibans
miranda abhorred slave
which any print of goodness wilt not take
being capable of all ill i pitied thee
took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
one thing or other when thou didst not savage
know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes
though thou didst learn had that int which good natures
could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
deservedly confind into this rock who hadst
deserv'd more than a prison
caliban you taught me language and my profit ont
is i know how to curse the red plague rid you
for learning me your language
prospero hag seed hence
fetch us in fuel and be quick thou 'rt best
if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps
fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
that beasts shall tremble at thy din
caliban no pray thee
aside i must obey his art is of such pow'r
it would control my dam's god setebos
and make a vassal of him
prospero so slave hence exit caliban
ferdinand following
ariels song
come unto these yellow sands
and then take hands
curtsied when you have and kiss'd
the wild waves whist
foot it featly here and there
and sweet sprites the burden bear
hark hark
the watch dogs bark
burden dispersedly bow wow
hark hark i hear
the strain of strutting chanticleer
cry cock a diddle dow
ferdinand where should this music be i' th' air or th'
empty
it sounds no more and sure it waits upon
some god o' th' island sitting on a bank
this music crept by me upon the waters
allaying both their fury and my passion
with its sweet air thence i have follow'd it
or it hath drawn me rather but 'tis gone
no it begins again
ariels song
full fathom five thy father lies
of his bones are coral made
those are pearls that were his eyes
but doth suffer a sea change
into something rich and strange
sea nymphs hourly ring his knell
burden ding dong
hark now i hear them ding dong bell
ferdinand the ditty does remember my drownd father
this is no mortal business nor no sound
that the earth owes i hear it now above me
prospero the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
miranda what is't a spirit
lord how it looks about believe me sir
it carries a brave form but 'tis a spirit
prospero no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
as we have such this gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck and but he's something staind
with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him
a goodly person he hath lost his fellows
and strays about to find 'em
a thing divine for nothing natural
i ever saw so noble
prospero aside it goes on i see
as my soul prompts it spirit fine spirit i'll free thee
within two days for this
ferdinand most sure the goddess
on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my pray'r
may know if you remain upon this island
and that you will some good instruction give
which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
if you be maid or no
miranda no wonder sir
but certainly a maid
ferdinand my language heavens
i am the best of them that speak this speech
were i but where 'tis spoken
prospero how the best
what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me
and that he does i weep myself am naples
who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
the king my father wreck'd
miranda alack for mercy
ferdinand yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan
and his brave son being twain
prospero aside the duke of milan
and his more braver daughter could control thee
they have chang'd eyes delicate ariel
i'll set thee free for this to ferdinand a word good
empty
i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
miranda why speaks my father so ungently this
is the third man that e'er i saw the first
that e'er i sigh'd for pity move my father
to be inclind my way
ferdinand o if a virgin
the queen of naples
prospero soft sir one word more
aside they are both in either's pow'rs but this swift
empty
i must uneasy make lest too light winning
make the prize light to ferdinand one word more i
charge thee
that thou attend me thou dost here usurp
the name thou ow'st not and hast put thyself
from me the lord ont
ferdinand no as i am a man
miranda there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
if the ill spirit have so fair a house
good things will strive to dwell with't
prospero follow me
speak not you for him he's a traitor come
i'll manacle thy neck and feet together
sea water shalt thou drink thy food shall be
wherein the acorn cradled follow
ferdinand no
i will resist such entertainment till
mine enemy has more power
he draws and is charmed from moving
miranda o dear father
make not too rash a trial of him for
he's gentle and not fearful
prospero what i say
who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike thy conscience
is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward
for i can here disarm thee with this stick
and make thy weapon drop
miranda beseech you father
prospero hence hang not on my garments
miranda sir have pity
i'll be his surety
prospero silence one word more
an advocate for an impostor hush
thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
having seen but him and caliban foolish wench
to th' most of men this is a caliban
and they to him are angels
miranda my affections
are then most humble i have no ambition
to see a goodlier man
prospero come on obey
and have no vigour in them
ferdinand so they are
my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
my father's loss the weakness which i feel
the wreck of all my friends nor this mans threats
to whom i am subdu'd are but light to me
might i but through my prison once a day
behold this maid all corners else o' th' earth
let liberty make use of space enough
prospero aside it works to ferdinand come on
thou hast done well fine ariel to ferdinand follow
empty
to ariel hark what thou else shalt do me
miranda be of comfort
my father's of a better nature sir
than he appears by speech this is unwonted
which now came from him
prospero to ariel thou shalt be as free
all points of my command
ariel to th' syllable

act ii scene 1
another part of the island
enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco and others
gonzalo beseech you sir be merry you have cause
so have we all of joy for our escape
is common every day some sailor's wife
the masters of some merchant and the merchant
have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
i mean our preservation few in millions
can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
our sorrow with our comfort
alonso prithee peace
sebastian he receives comfort like cold porridge
antonio the visitor will not give him o'er so
and by it will strike
gonzalo sir
sebastian one tell
gonzalo when every grief is entertaind that's offer'd
comes to th' entertainer
sebastian a dollar
gonzalo dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken
truer than you purpos'd
sebastian you have taken it wiselier than i meant you
gonzalo therefore my lord
antonio fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
alonso i prithee spare
gonzalo well i have done but yet
sebastian he will be talking
antonio which of he or adrian for a good wager first
begins to crow
sebastian the old cock
antonio the cock'rel
antonio a laughter
sebastian a match
adrian though this island seem to be desert
antonio ha ha ha
sebastian so you're paid
adrian uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
sebastian yet
adrian yet
antonio he could not miss't
empty
antonio temperance was a delicate wench
sebastian ay and a subtle as he most learnedly
empty
adrian the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
sebastian as if it had lungs and rotten ones
antonio or as 'twere perfum'd by a fen
gonzalo here is everything advantageous to life
antonio true save means to live
gonzalo how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
antonio the ground indeed is tawny
sebastian with an eye of green int
antonio he misses not much
sebastian no he doth but mistake the truth totally
gonzalo but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost
beyond credit
sebastian as many vouch'd rarities are
gonzalo that our garments being as they were drench'd
glosses being rather new dy'd than staind with salt
empty
antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it
not say he lies
sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report
gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the
king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
sebastian 'twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in
adrian tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
to their queen
gonzalo not since widow dido's time
antonio widow a pox o' that how came that 'widow'
in widow dido
sebastian what if he had said 'widower aeneas' too
good lord how you take it
adrian 'widow dido' said you you make me study of
that she was of carthage not of tunis
adrian carthage
gonzalo i assure you carthage
antonio his word is more than the miraculous harp
sebastian he hath rais'd the wall and houses too
antonio what impossible matter will he make easy next
sebastian i think he will carry this island home in his
pocket and give it his son for an apple
antonio and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
forth more islands
antonio why in good time
gonzalo sir we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of
your daughter who is now queen
antonio and the rarest that e'er came there
sebastian bate i beseech you widow dido
antonio o widow dido ay widow dido
gonzalo is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
wore it i mean in a sort
gonzalo when i wore it at your daughter's marriage
alonso you cram these words into mine ears against
the stomach of my sense would i had never
married my daughter there for coming thence
my son is lost and in my rate she too
who is so far from italy removed
i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir
of naples and of milan what strange fish
hath made his meal on thee
i saw him beat the surges under him
and ride upon their backs he trod the water
whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
'bove the contentious waves he kept and oared
himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
to th' shore that o'er his wave worn basis bowed
as stooping to relieve him i not doubt
he came alive to land
sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
that would not bless our europe with your daughter
but rather lose her to an african
where she at least is banish'd from your eye
who hath cause to wet the grief ont
alonso prithee peace
sebastian you were kneeld to and importund otherwise
by all of us and the fair soul herself
weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
i fear for ever milan and naples have
moe widows in them of this business' making
than we bring men to comfort them
the fault's your own
alonso so is the dear'st o' th' loss
gonzalo my lord sebastian
the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
and time to speak it in you rub the sore
when you should bring the plaster
antonio and most chirurgeonly
gonzalo it is foul weather in us all good sir
when you are cloudy
sebastian foul weather
antonio very foul
gonzalo had i plantation of this isle my lord
antonio he'd sow 't with nettle seed
sebastian or docks or mallows
gonzalo and were the king ont what would i do
gonzalo i' th' commonwealth i would by contraries
execute all things for no kind of traffic
would i admit no name of magistrate
letters should not be known riches poverty
and use of service none contract succession
bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
no use of metal corn or wine or oil
no occupation all men idle all
and women too but innocent and pure
sebastian yet he would be king ont
antonio the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
empty
gonzalo all things in common nature should produce
without sweat or endeavour treason felony
sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
would i not have but nature should bring forth
of it own kind all foison all abundance
to feed my innocent people
antonio none man all idle whores and knaves
gonzalo i would with such perfection govern sir
t' excel the golden age
sebastian save his majesty
antonio long live gonzalo
gonzalo and do you mark me sir
alonso prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
gonzalo i do well believe your highness and did it to
minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such
at nothing
antonio 'twas you we laugh'd at
gonzalo who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still
antonio what a blow was there given
sebastian an it had not falln flat long
gonzalo you are gentlemen of brave mettle you would
lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing
sebastian we would so and then go a bat fowling
antonio nay good my lord be not angry
gonzalo no i warrant you i will not adventure my
discretion so weakly will you laugh me asleep for i am
very heavy
antonio go sleep and hear us
all sleep but alonso sebastian and antonio
alonso what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes
would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find
sebastian please you sir
do not omit the heavy offer of it
it seldom visits sorrow when it doth
it is a comforter
antonio we two my lord
will guard your person while you take your rest
and watch your safety
alonso thank you wondrous heavy
alonso sleeps exit ariel
antonio it is the quality o' th' climate
sebastian why
doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
myself dispos'd to sleep
antonio nor i my spirits are nimble
they fell together all as by consent
they dropp'd as by a thunder stroke what might
worthy sebastian o what might no more
and yet methinks i see it in thy face
my strong imagination sees a crown
dropping upon thy head
sebastian what art thou waking
antonio do you not hear me speak
sebastian i do and surely
it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say
this is a strange repose to be asleep
with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
antonio noble sebastian
thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st
whiles thou art waking
sebastian thou dost snore distinctly
there's meaning in thy snores
antonio i am more serious than my custom you
must be so too if heed me which to do
trebles thee o'er
sebastian well i am standing water
sebastian do so to ebb
hereditary sloth instructs me
antonio o
if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
you more invest it ebbing men indeed
most often do so near the bottom run
by their own fear or sloth
sebastian prithee say on
a matter from thee and a birth indeed
which throes thee much to yield
antonio thus sir
although this lord of weak remembrance this
who shall be of as little memory
when he is earth'd hath here almost persuaded
for he's a spirit of persuasion only
professes to persuade the king his sons alive
'tis as impossible that he's undrownd
sebastian i have no hope
that he's undrownd
antonio o out of that 'no hope'
what great hope have you no hope that way is
another way so high a hope that even
ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
but doubt discovery there will you grant with me
that ferdinand is drownd
sebastian he's gone
who's the next heir of naples
sebastian claribel
antonio she that is queen of tunis she that dwells
ten leagues beyond mans life she that from naples
can have no note unless the sun were post
the man i' th' moons too slow till newborn chins
be rough and razorable she that from whom
we all were sea swallow'd though some cast again
and by that destiny to perform an act
in yours and my discharge
sebastian what stuff is this how say you
'tis true my brother's daughter's queen of tunis
so is she heir of naples 'twixt which regions
there is some space
antonio a space whose ev'ry cubit
seems to cry out 'how shall that claribel
measure us back to naples keep in tunis
and let sebastian wake' say this were death
than now they are there be that can rule naples
as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily
as this gonzalo i myself could make
a chough of as deep chat o that you bore
the mind that i do what a sleep were this
for your advancement do you understand me
sebastian methinks i do
antonio and how does your content
sebastian i remember
you did supplant your brother prospero
antonio true
and look how well my garments sit upon me
much feater than before my brother's servants
were then my fellows now they are my men
sebastian but for your conscience
antonio ay sir where lies that if 'twere a kibe
'twould put me to my slipper but i feel not
that stand 'twixt me and milan candied be they
and melt ere they molest here lies your brother
no better than the earth he lies upon
if he were that which now he's like that's dead
whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it
can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
to the perpetual wink for aye might put
this ancient morsel this sir prudence who
should not upbraid our course for all the rest
they'll tell the clock to any business that
we say befits the hour
sebastian thy case dear friend
shall be my precedent as thou got'st milan
i'll come by naples draw thy sword one stroke
shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
and i the king shall love thee
antonio draw together
and when i rear my hand do you the like
sebastian o but one word they talk apart
re enter ariel invisible with music and song
ariel my master through his art foresees the danger
that you his friend are in and sends me forth
for else his project dies to keep them living
sings in gonzalo's ear
while you here do snoring lie
open ey'd conspiracy
his time doth take
shake off slumber and beware
awake awake
antonio then let us both be sudden
gonzalo now good angels
preserve the king they wake
alonso why how now ho awake why are you drawn
wherefore this ghastly looking
gonzalo what's the matter
sebastian whiles we stood here securing your repose
like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you
it struck mine ear most terribly
alonso i heard nothing
antonio o 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear
to make an earthquake sure it was the roar
of a whole herd of lions
alonso heard you this gonzalo
gonzalo upon mine honour sir i heard a humming
and that a strange one too which did awake me
i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
that's verily 'tis best we stand upon our guard
or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons
alonso lead off this ground and let's make further
empty
for my poor son
gonzalo heavens keep him from these beasts
for he is sure i' th' island
alonso lead away
so king go safely on to seek thy son exeunt

act iii scene 1
enter ferdinand hearing a log
ferdinand there be some sports are painful and their
empty
delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
are nobly undergone and most poor matters
point to rich ends this my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious but
the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead
and makes my labours pleasures o she is
and he's compos'd of harshness i must remove
some thousands of these logs and pile them up
upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
had never like executor i forget
but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
most busy least when i do it
enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen
miranda alas now pray you
burnt up those logs that you are enjoind to pile
pray set it down and rest you when this burns
'twill weep for having wearied you my father
is hard at study pray now rest yourself
he's safe for these three hours
ferdinand o most dear mistress
the sun will set before i shall discharge
what i must strive to do
miranda if you'll sit down
i'll carry it to the pile
ferdinand no precious creature
i had rather crack my sinews break my back
than you should such dishonour undergo
while i sit lazy by
miranda it would become me
as well as it does you and i should do it
with much more ease for my good will is to it
and yours it is against
this visitation shows it
miranda you look wearily
ferdinand no noble mistress 'tis fresh morning with me
when you are by at night i do beseech you
chiefly that i might set it in my prayers
what is your name
miranda miranda o my father
i have broke your hest to say so
ferdinand admir'd miranda
i have ey'd with best regard and many a time
th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
have i lik'd several women never any
with so full soul but some defect in her
did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd
and put it to the foil but you o you
so perfect and so peerless are created
of every creature's best
one of my sex no womans face remember
save from my glass mine own nor have i seen
more that i may call men than you good friend
and my dear father how features are abroad
i am skilless of but by my modesty
the jewel in my dower i would not wish
any companion in the world but you
nor can imagination form a shape
besides yourself to like of but i prattle
i therein do forget
ferdinand i am in my condition
a prince miranda i do think a king
i would not so and would no more endure
this wooden slavery than to suffer
the flesh fly blow my mouth hear my soul speak
the very instant that i saw you did
my heart fly to your service there resides
to make me slave to it and for your sake
miranda do you love me
ferdinand o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound
and crown what i profess with kind event
if i speak true if hollowly invert
what best is boded me to mischief i
beyond all limit of what else i' th' world
do love prize honour you
miranda i am a fool
to weep at what i am glad of
of two most rare affections heavens rain grace
on that which breeds between 'em
ferdinand wherefore weep you
miranda at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
what i desire to give and much less take
what i shall die to want but this is trifling
and all the more it seeks to hide itself
the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning

stephano moon calf speak once in thy life if thou beest
a good moon calf

as i to day wilt thou tell a monstrous lie being but
half fish and half a monster

a natural
caliban lo lo again bite him to death i prithee
stephano trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if
you prove a mutineer the next tree the poor monster's
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity
caliban i thank my noble lord wilt thou be pleas'd to
hearken once again to the suit i made to thee
and so shall trinculo
enter ariel invisible

sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the
empty
ariel thou liest
caliban thou liest thou jesting monkey thou
i would my valiant master would destroy thee
i do not lie
by this hand i will supplant some of your teeth
trinculo why i said nothing
stephano mum then and no more proceed
caliban i say by sorcery he got this isle
from me he got it if thy greatness will
revenge it on him for i know thou dar'st
but this thing dare not
stephano that's most certain
caliban thou shalt be lord of it and i'll serve thee
bring me to the party
caliban yea yea my lord i'll yield him thee asleep
where thou mayst knock a nail into his head
ariel thou liest thou canst not
caliban what a pied ninny's this thou scurvy patch

stephano stand farther come proceed
caliban why as i told thee 'tis a custom with him
having first seiz'd his books or with a log
batter his skull or paunch him with a stake
or cut his wezand with thy knife remember
first to possess his books for without them
he's but a sot as i am nor hath not
one spirit to command they all do hate him
as rootedly as i burn but his books
he has brave utensils for so he calls them
which when he has a house he'll deck withal
the beauty of his daughter he himself
calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman
but only sycorax my dam and she
but she as far surpasseth sycorax
as great'st does least
stephano is it so brave a lass
caliban ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant
and bring thee forth brave brood
stephano monster i will kill this man his daughter and i
and thyself shall be viceroys dost thou like the plot
empty
trinculo excellent
stephano give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee but
while thou liv'st keep a good tongue in thy head
caliban within this half hour will he be asleep
wilt thou destroy him then
stephano ay on mine honour

you taught me but while ere
stephano at thy request monster i will do reason any
reason come on trinculo let us sing sings
flout 'em and scout 'em
and scout 'em and flout 'em
thought is free
caliban that's not the tune
ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe
trinculo this is the tune of our catch play'd by the
picture of nobody
stephano if thou beest a man show thyself in thy
likeness if thou beest a devil take't as thou list
trinculo o forgive me my sins
stephano he that dies pays all debts i defy thee mercy
upon us
caliban art thou afeard
stephano no monster not i
sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices
that if i then had wak'd after long sleep
will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
the clouds methought would open and show riches
ready to drop upon me that when i wak'd
i cried to dream again
stephano this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i
caliban when prospero is destroy'd
stephano that shall be by and by i remember the story
trinculo the sound is going away let's follow it and
after do our work
stephano lead monster we'll follow i would i could see
this taborer he lays it on
trinculo wilt come i'll follow stephano exeunt
scene 3
another part of the island
gonzalo by'r lakin i can go no further sir
my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed
through forth rights and meanders by your patience
i needs must rest me
alonso old lord i cannot blame thee
who am myself attach'd with weariness
to th' dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
even here i will put off my hope and keep it
no longer for my flatterer he is drownd
our frustrate search on land well let him go
antonio aside to sebastian i am right glad that he's
so out of hope
do not for one repulse forgo the purpose
that you resolv'd t' effect
sebastian aside to antonio the next advantage
will we take throughly
antonio aside to sebastian let it be to night
for now they are oppress'd with travel they
as when they are fresh
sebastian aside to antonio i say to night no more
solemn and strange music and prospero on the
top invisible enter several strange shapes
bringing in a banquet and dance about it with
gentle actions of salutations and inviting the
king etc to eat they depart
alonso what harmony is this my good friends hark
gonzalo marvellous sweet music
sebastian a living drollery now i will believe
that there are unicorns that in arabia
there is one tree the phoenix' throne one phoenix
at this hour reigning there
antonio i'll believe both
and what does else want credit come to me
and i'll be sworn 'tis true travellers ne'er did lie
though fools at home condemn 'em
gonzalo if in naples
if i should say i saw such islanders
for certes these are people of the island
who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
their manners are more gentle kind than of
our human generation you shall find
many nay almost any
prospero aside honest lord
thou hast said well for some of you there present
are worse than devils
such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
although they want the use of tongue a kind
of excellent dumb discourse
prospero aside praise in departing
francisco they vanish'd strangely
sebastian no matter since
they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
willt please you taste of what is here
alonso not i
who would believe that there were mountaineers
dewlapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at 'em
wallets of flesh or that there were such men
whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
each putter out of five for one will bring us
good warrant of
alonso i will stand to and feed
although my last no matter since i feel
the best is past brother my lord the duke
thunder and lightning enter ariel like a harpy
claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint
device the banquet vanishes
ariel you are three men of sin whom destiny
that hath to instrument this lower world
and what is int the never surfeited sea
hath caus'd to belch up you and on this island
where man doth not inhabit you 'mongst men
being most unfit to live i have made you mad
their proper selves
alonso sebastian etc draw their swords
you fools i and my fellows
are ministers of fate the elements
of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
wound the loud winds or with bemock'd at stabs
kill the still closing waters as diminish
one dowle that's in my plume my fellow ministers
are like invulnerable if you could hurt
and will not be uplifted but remember
for that's my business to you that you three
from milan did supplant good prospero
expos'd unto the sea which hath requit it
him and his innocent child for which foul deed
the pow'rs delaying not forgetting have
incens'd the seas and shores yea all the creatures
against your peace thee of thy son alonso
they have bereft and do pronounce by me
can be at once shall step by step attend
you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
which here in this most desolate isle else falls
upon your heads is nothing but heart's sorrow
and a clear life ensuing
he vanishes in thunder then to soft music enter
the shapes again and dance with mocks and mows
and carrying out the table
prospero bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
in what thou hadst to say so with good life
and observation strange my meaner ministers
their several kinds have done my high charms work
and these mine enemies are all knit up
in their distractions they now are in my pow'r
and in these fits i leave them while i visit
young ferdinand whom they suppose is drownd
and his and mine lov'd darling exit above
in this strange stare
alonso o it is monstrous monstrous
methought the billows spoke and told me of it
the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
that deep and dreadful organ pipe pronounc'd
the name of prosper it did bass my trespass
therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded and
i'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
and with him there lie mudded exit
i'll fight their legions o'er
antonio i'll be thy second exeunt sebastian and antonio
gonzalo all three of them are desperate their great guilt
like poison given to work a great time after
now gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you
that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
and hinder them from what this ecstasy
may now provoke them to
adrian follow i pray you exeunt
before prospero's cell
enter prospero ferdinand and miranda
prospero if i have too austerely punish'd you
your compensation makes amends for
have given you here a third of mine own life
or that for which i live who once again
i tender to thy hand all thy vexations
were but my trials of thy love and thou
hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven
do not smile at me that i boast her off
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
and make it halt behind her
ferdinand i do believe it
against an oracle
prospero then as my gift and thine own acquisition
wort'hily purchas'd take my daughter but
if thou dost break her virgin knot before
all sanctimonious ceremonies may
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
to make this contract grow but barren hate
sour ey'd disdain and discord shall bestrew
the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
that you shall hate it both therefore take heed
as hymens lamps shall light you
ferdinand as i hope
for quiet days fair issue and long life
with such love as 'tis now the murkiest den
our worser genius can shall never melt
mine honour into lust to take away
the edge of that day's celebration
when i shall think or phoebus' steeds are founder'd
or night kept chaind below
prospero fairly spoke
sit then and talk with her she is thine own
what ariel my industrious servant ariel
enter ariel
prospero thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
did worthily perform and i must use you
in such another trick go bring the rabble
o'er whom i give thee pow'r here to this place
incite them to quick motion for i must
bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
some vanity of mine art it is my promise
and they expect it from me
ariel presently
ariel before you can say 'come' and 'go'
and breathe twice and cry 'so so'
each one tripping on his toe
will be here with mop and mow
do you love me master no
prospero dearly my delicate ariel do not approach
till thou dost hear me call
ariel well i conceive exit
prospero look thou be true do not give dalliance
to th' fire i' th' blood be more abstemious
or else good night your vow
ferdinand i warrant you sir
the white cold virgin snow upon my heart
abates the ardour of my liver
prospero well
now come my ariel bring a corollary
rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
no tongue all eyes be silent soft music
iris ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas
of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease
thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep
and flat meads thatch'd with stover them to keep
thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
which spongy april at thy hest betrims
to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
being lass lorn thy pole clipt vineyard
where thou thyself dost air the queen o' th' sky
whose wat'ry arch and messenger am i
bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace
here on this grass plot in this very place
to come and sport her peacocks fly amain
juno descends in her car
approach rich ceres her to entertain
enter ceres
ceres hail many coloured messenger that ne'er
who with thy saffron wings upon my flow'rs
diffusest honey drops refreshing show'rs
and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
my bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down
rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
summond me hither to this short grass'd green
iris a contract of true love to celebrate
and some donation freely to estate
on the blest lovers
if venus or her son as thou dost know
do now attend the queen since they did plot
the means that dusky dis my daughter got
her and her blind boy's scandald company
i have forsworn
iris of her society
be not afraid i met her deity
cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son
dove drawn with her here thought they to have done
whose vows are that no bed rite shall be paid
till hymens torch be lighted but in vain
mars's hot minion is returnd again
her waspish headed son has broke his arrows
swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
and be a boy right out juno alights
ceres highest queen of state
great juno comes i know her by her gait
juno how does my bounteous sister go with me
and honour'd in their issue they sing
juno honour riches marriage blessing
long continuance and increasing
hourly joys be still upon you
juno sings her blessings on you
ceres earth's increase foison plenty
barns and gamers never empty
vines with clust'ring bunches growing
plants with goodly burden bowing
in the very end of harvest
scarcity and want shall shun you
ceres' blessing so is on you
ferdinand this is a most majestic vision and
harmonious charmingly may i be bold
to think these spirits
prospero spirits which by mine art
i have from their confines calld to enact
my present fancies
so rare a wond'red father and a wise
makes this place paradise
juno and ceres whisper and send iris on employment
prospero sweet now silence
juno and ceres whisper seriously
there's something else to do hush and be mute
or else our spell is marr'd
iris you nymphs calld naiads of the wind'ring brooks
with your sedg'd crowns and ever harmless looks
answer your summons juno does command
come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
a contract of true love be not too late
enter certain nymphs
you sun burnt sicklemen of august weary
come hither from the furrow and be merry
make holiday your rye straw hats put on
and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
in country footing
with the nymphs in a graceful dance towards the
end whereof prospero starts suddenly and speaks
after which to a strange hollow and confused
noise they heavily vanish
prospero aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast caliban and his confederates
against my life the minute of their plot
is almost come to the spirits well done avoid no
empty
that works him strongly
miranda never till this day
saw i him touch'd with anger so distemper'd
prospero you do look my son in a mov'd sort
as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir
our revels now are ended these our actors
as i foretold you were all spirits and
are melted into air into thin air
and like the baseless fabric of this vision
the solemn temples the great globe itself
yea all which it inherit shall dissolve
and like this insubstantial pageant faded
leave not a rack behind we are such stuff
as dreams are made on and our little life
is rounded with a sleep sir i am vex'd
bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled
be not disturb'd with my infirmity
if you be pleas'd retire into my cell
to still my beating mind
ferdinand miranda we wish your peace exeunt
prospero come with a thought i thank thee ariel come
enter ariel
ariel thy thoughts i cleave to what's thy pleasure
prospero spirit
we must prepare to meet with caliban
ariel ay my commander when i presented 'ceres'
i thought to have told thee of it but i fear'd
prospero say again where didst thou leave these varlets
ariel i told you sir they were red hot with drinking
so full of valour that they smote the air
for breathing in their faces beat the ground
for kissing of their feet yet always bending
towards their project then i beat my tabor
at which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears
advanc'd their eyelids lifted up their noses
as they smelt music so i charm'd their cars
tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
which ent'red their frail shins at last i left them
i' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell
there dancing up to th' chins that the foul lake
o'erstunk their feet
prospero this was well done my bird
thy shape invisible retain thou still
the trumpery in my house go bring it hither
for stale to catch these thieves
prospero a devil a born devil on whose nature
nurture can never stick on whom my pains
humanely taken all all lost quite lost
and as with age his body uglier grows
so his mind cankers i will plague them all
even to roaring
re enter ariel loaden with glistering apparel c
come hang them on this line
prospero and ariel remain invisible
caliban pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not
hear a foot fall we now are near his cell

a noise of hunters beard enter divers spirits in
shape of dogs and hounds bunting them about
prospero and ariel setting them on
prospero hey mountain hey
ariel silver there it goes silver
prospero fury fury there tyrant there hark hark
caliban stephano and trinculo are driven out
go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews

prospero let them be hunted soundly at this hour
lies at my mercy all mine enemies
shortly shall all my labours end and thou
shalt have the air at freedom for a little
follow and do me service exeunt
act v scene 1
before prospero's cell
prospero now does my project gather to a head
my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
goes upright with his carriage how's the day
ariel on the sixth hour at which time my lord
you said our work should cease
prospero i did say so
when first i rais'd the tempest say my spirit
how fares the king and 's followers
ariel confind together
just as you left them all prisoners sir
in the line grove which weather fends your cell
they cannot budge till your release the king
his brother and yours abide all three distracted
and the remainder mourning over them
brim full of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
him you term'd sir 'the good old lord gonzalo'
his tears run down his beard like winter's drops
from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works 'em
would become tender
prospero dost thou think so spirit
ariel mine would sir were i human
prospero and mine shall
hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
of their afflictions and shall not myself
one of their kind that relish all as sharply
passion as they be kindlier mov'd than thou art
though with their high wrongs i am struck to th' quick
do i take part the rarer action is
in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
not a frown further go release them ariel
my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore
and they shall be themselves
ariel i'll fetch them sir exit
prospero ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and
empty
do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
when he comes back you demi puppets that
by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
weak masters though ye be i have be dimm'd
the noontide sun calld forth the mutinous winds
and 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak
with his own bolt the strong bas'd promontory
have i made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
the pine and cedar graves at my command
have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let 'em forth
by my so potent art but this rough magic
i here abjure and when i have requir'd
some heavenly music which even now i do
to work mine end upon their senses that
bury it certain fathoms in the earth
and deeper than did ever plummet sound
i'll drown my book solem music
here enters ariel before then alonso with
frantic gesture attended by gonzalo sebastian
and antonio in like manner attended by adrian
and francisco they all enter the circle which
prospero had made and there stand charm'd which
prospero observing speaks
to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
now useless boild within thy skull there stand
for you are spell stopp'd
holy gonzalo honourable man
mine eyes ev'n sociable to the show of thine
fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace
and as the morning steals upon the night
melting the darkness so their rising senses
begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
my true preserver and a loyal sir
to him thou follow'st i will pay thy graces
home both in word and deed most cruelly
didst thou alonso use me and my daughter
thy brother was a furtherer in the act
thou art pinch'd for't now sebastian flesh and blood
you brother mine that entertaind ambition
expelld remorse and nature who with sebastian
whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
unnatural though thou art their understanding
begins to swell and the approaching tide
will shortly fill the reasonable shore
that now lies foul and muddy not one of them
that yet looks on me or would know me ariel
fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell exit ariel
i will discase me and myself present
as i was sometime milan quickly spirit
thou shalt ere long be free
where the bee sucks there suck i
in a cowslip's bell i lie
there i couch when owls do cry
on the bat's back i do fly
after summer merrily
merrily merrily shall i live now
under the blossom that hangs on the bough
prospero why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee
but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
under the hatches the master and the boatswain
being awake enforce them to this place
and presently i prithee
ariel i drink the air before me and return
or ere your pulse twice beat exit
gonzalo all torment trouble wonder and amazement
inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
out of this fearful country
the wronged duke of milan prospero
for more assurance that a living prince
does now speak to thee i embrace thy body
and to thee and thy company i bid
a hearty welcome
alonso whe'er thou be'st he or no
or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
as late i have been i not know thy pulse
beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee
i fear a madness held me this must crave
an if this be at all a most strange story
thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs but how should prospero
be living and be here
prospero first noble friend
let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
be measur'd or confind
gonzalo whether this be
prospero you do yet taste
some subtleties o' th' isle that will not let you
believe things certain welcome my friends all
aside to sebastian and antonio but you my brace of
lords were i so minded
i here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
and justify you traitors at this time
i will tell no tales
sebastian aside the devil speaks in him
for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
would even infect my mouth i do forgive
thy rankest fault all of them and require
my dukedom of thee which perforce i know
thou must restore
alonso if thou beest prospero
give us particulars of thy preservation
how thou hast met us here whom three hours since
were wreck'd upon this shore where i have lost
my dear son ferdinand
prospero i am woe for't sir
alonso irreparable is the loss and patience
says it is past her cure
prospero i rather think
you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
and rest myself content
alonso you the like loss
to make the dear loss have i means much weaker
than you may call to comfort you for i
have lost my daughter
alonso a daughter
o heavens that they were living both in naples
the king and queen there that they were i wish
myself were mudded in that oozy bed
where my son lies when did you lose your daughter
prospero in this last tempest i perceive these lords
that they devour their reason and scarce think
their eyes do offices of truth their words
are natural breath but howsoe'er you have
been justled from your senses know for certain
that i am prospero and that very duke
which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely
upon this shore where you were wrecked was landed
to be the lord ont no more yet of this
for 'tis a chronicle of day by day
befitting this first meeting welcome sir
this cells my court here have i few attendants
and subjects none abroad pray you look in
my dukedom since you have given me again
i will requite you with as good a thing
at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
as much as me my dukedom
here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda
playing at chess
ferdinand no my dearest love
i would not for the world
miranda yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
and i would call it fair play
alonso if this prove
a vision of the island one dear son
shall i twice lose
sebastian a most high miracle
ferdinand though the seas threaten they are merciful
alonso now all the blessings
of a glad father compass thee about
arise and say how thou cam'st here
miranda o wonder
how many goodly creatures are there here
how beauteous mankind is o brave new world
that has such people int
prospero 'tis new to thee
alonso what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
and brought us thus together
ferdinand sir she is mortal
but by immortal providence she's mine
i chose her when i could not ask my father
for his advice nor thought i had one she
is daughter to this famous duke of milan
of whom so often i have heard renown
but never saw before of whom i have
this lady makes him to me
alonso i am hers
but o how oddly will it sound that i
must ask my child forgiveness
prospero there sir stop
let us not burden our remembrances with
a heaviness that's gone
gonzalo i have inly wept
or should have spoke ere this look down you gods
for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
which brought us hither
alonso i say amen gonzalo
gonzalo was milan thrust from milan that his issue
should become kings of naples o rejoice
beyond a common joy and set it down
with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
did claribel her husband find at tunis
and ferdinand her brother found a wife
in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
when no man was his own
alonso to ferdinand and miranda give me your
empty
let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
that doth not wish you joy
gonzalo be it so amen
re enter ariel with the master and boatswain
amazedly following
i prophesied if a gallows were on land
this fellow could not drown now blasphemy
that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore
hast thou no mouth by land what is the news
boatswain the best news is that we have safely found
our king and company the next our ship
which but three glasses since we gave out split
is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
we first put out to sea
have i done since i went
prospero aside to ariel my tricksy spirit
alonso these are not natural events they strengthen
from strange to stranger say how came you hither
boatswain if i did think sir i were well awake
i'd strive to tell you we were dead of sleep
and how we know not all clapp'd under hatches
where but even now with strange and several noises
of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
we were awak'd straightway at liberty
where we in all her trim freshly beheld
our royal good and gallant ship our master
cap'ring to eye her on a trice so please you
even in a dream were we divided from them
and were brought moping hither
ariel aside to prospero was't well done
prospero aside to ariel bravely my diligence thou
shalt be free
and there is in this business more than nature
was ever conduct of some oracle
must rectify our knowledge
prospero sir my liege
do not infest your mind with beating on
the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure
which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you
which to you shall seem probable of every
these happend accidents till when be cheerful
hither spirit
set caliban and his companions free
untie the spell exit ariel how fares my gracious sir
there are yet missing of your company
some few odd lads that you remember not
re enter ariel driving in caliban stephano and
trinculo in their stolen apparel
stephano every man shift for all the rest and let no man
take care for himself for all is but fortune coragio
trinculo if these be true spies which i wear in my head
here's a goodly sight
caliban o setebos these be brave spirits indeed
how fine my master is i am afraid
he will chastise me
sebastian ha ha
what things are these my lord antonio
will money buy'em
antonio very like one of them
prospero mark but the badges of these men my lords
then say if they be true this mis shapen knave
his mother was a witch and one so strong
that could control the moon make flows and ebbs
and deal in her command without her power
these three have robb'd me and this demi devil
for he's a bastard one had plotted with them
to take my life two of these fellows you
must know and own this thing of darkness i
caliban i shall be pinch'd to death
alonso is not this stephano my drunken butler
sebastian he is drunk now where had he wine
alonso and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em
how cam'st thou in this pickle
trinculo i have been in such a pickle since i saw you
last that i fear me will never out of my bones i
shall not fear fly blowing
stephano o touch me not i am not stephano but a
empty
prospero you'd be king o' the isle sirrah
stephano i should have been a sore one then
alonso pointing to caliban this is as strange a thing
as e'er i look'd on
prospero he is as disproportioned in his manners
as in his shape go sirrah to my cell
take with you your companions as you look
caliban ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter
and seek for grace what a thrice double ass
was i to take this drunkard for a god
and worship this dull fool
prospero go to away
alonso hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
sebastian or stole it rather
exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo
prospero sir i invite your highness and your train
for this one night which part of it i'll waste
with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it
go quick away the story of my life
and the particular accidents gone by
since i came to this isle and in the morn
i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples
where i have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear belov'd solemnized
and thence retire me to my milan where
alonso i long
to hear the story of your life which must
take the ear strangely
prospero i'll deliver all
and promise you calm seas auspicious gales
and sail so expeditious that shall catch
your royal fleet far off aside to ariel my ariel
empty
that is thy charge then to the elements
empty
empty
empty
spoken by prospero
now my charms are all o'erthrown
and what strength i have's mine own
which is most faint now 'tis true
i must be here confind by you
or sent to naples let me not
and pardond the deceiver dwell
in this bare island by your spell
but release me from my bands
with the help of your good hands
gentle breath of yours my sails
must fill or else my project fails
which was to please now i want
spirits to enforce art to enchant
and my ending is despair
which pierces so that it assaults
mercy itself and frees all faults
as you from crimes would pardond be
let your indulgence set me free

act i scene i
athens timons house
enter poet painter jeweller merchant and mercer at several doors
painter i am glad y'are well
poet i have not seen you long how goes the world
painter it wears sir as it grows
poet ay that's well known
but what particular rarity what strange
which manifold record not matches see
magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
hath conjur'd to attend i know the merchant
painter i know them both th' other's a jeweller
jeweller nay that's most fix'd
merchant a most incomparable man breath'd as it were
to an untirable and continuate goodness
he passes
jeweller i have a jewel here
merchant o pray let's see't for the lord timon sir
jeweller if he will touch the estimate but for that
poet when we for recompense have prais'd the vile
it stains the glory in that happy verse
merchant looking at the jewel 'tis a good form
jeweller and rich here is a water look ye
painter you are rapt sir in some work some dedication
to the great lord
poet a thing slipp'd idly from me
our poesy is as a gum which oozes
from whence 'tis nourish'd the fire i' th' flint
shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
provokes itself and like the current flies
painter a picture sir when comes your book forth
poet upon the heels of my presentment sir
let's see your piece
painter 'tis a good piece
poet so 'tis this comes off well and excellent
painter indifferent
poet admirable how this grace
speaks his own standing what a mental power
this eye shoots forth how big imagination
one might interpret
painter it is a pretty mocking of the life
here is a touch is't good
poet i will say of it
it tutors nature artificial strife
lives in these touches livelier than life
enter certain senators and pass over
painter how this lord is followed
poet the senators of athens happy man
poet you see this confluence this great flood of visitors
i have in this rough work shap'd out a man
whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
with amplest entertainment my free drift
halts not particularly but moves itself
in a wide sea of tax no levelld malice
infects one comma in the course i hold
but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
leaving no tract behind
poet i will unbolt to you
you see how all conditions how all minds
as well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as
of grave and austere quality tender down
their services to lord timon his large fortune
upon his good and gracious nature hanging
subdues and properties to his love and tendance
all sorts of hearts yea from the glass fac'd flatterer
to apemantus that few things loves better
the knee before him and returns in peace
most rich in timons nod
painter i saw them speak together
poet sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill
feignd fortune to be thrond the base o' th' mount
is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures
that labour on the bosom of this sphere
to propagate their states amongst them all
whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
whose present grace to present slaves and servants
translates his rivals
painter 'tis conceiv'd to scope
this throne this fortune and this hill methinks
with one man beckond from the rest below
bowing his head against the steepy mount
to climb his happiness would be well express'd
in our condition
all those which were his fellows but of late
some better than his value on the moment
follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
make sacred even his stirrup and through him
drink the free air
painter ay marry what of these
poet when fortune in her shift and change of mood
spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
even on their knees and hands let him slip down
not one accompanying his declining foot
painter 'tis common
a thousand moral paintings i can show
that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune's
more pregnantly than words yet you do well
to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen
the foot above the head
trumpets sound enter timon addressing himself
ventidius talking with him lucilius and other
servants following

what levity's in youth
lucilius ay my good lord and she accepts of it
old athenian if in her marriage my consent be missing

mine heir from forth the beggars of the world
and dispossess her all

empty
merchant ay apemantus

trumpet sounds enter a messenger
timon what trumpet's that
messenger 'tis alcibiades and some twenty horse
all of companionship
timon pray entertain them give them guide to us
exeunt some attendants
you must needs dine with me go not you hence
till i have thank'd you when dinner's done
show me this piece i am joyful of your sights
most welcome sir they salute
apemantus so so there
aches contract and starve your supple joints
that there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves
and all this courtesy the strain of mans bred out
into baboon and monkey
alcibiades sir you have sav'd my longing and i feed
most hungerly on your sight
timon right welcome sir
in different pleasures pray you let us in
exeunt all but apemantus
enter two lords
first lord what time o' day is't apemantus
apemantus time to be honest
first lord that time serves still
apemantus the more accursed thou that still omit'st it
second lord thou art going to lord timons feast
apemantus ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools
apemantus thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice
second lord why apemantus
apemantus shouldst have kept one to thyself for i mean to give
thee none
first lord hang thyself
apemantus no i will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests
to thy friend
second lord away unpeaceable dog or i'll spurn thee hence
apemantus i will fly like a dog the heels o' th' ass exit
and taste lord timons bounty he outgoes
the very heart of kindness
second lord he pours it out plutus the god of gold
is but his steward no meed but he repays
sevenfold above itself no gift to him
but breeds the giver a return exceeding
all use of quittance
first lord the noblest mind he carries
that ever governd man
first lord i'll keep you company exeunt
scene ii
a room of state in timons house
hautboys playing loud music a great banquet serv'd in
flavius and others attending and then enter lord timon the states
the athenian lords ventidius which timon redeem'd from prison
then comes dropping after all apemantus discontentedly like himself
ventidius most honoured timon
it hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age
he is gone happy and has left me rich
then as in grateful virtue i am bound
to your free heart i do return those talents
doubled with thanks and service from whose help
i deriv'd liberty
timon o by no means
honest ventidius you mistake my love
i gave it freely ever and there's none
can truly say he gives if he receives
to imitate them faults that are rich are fair
ventidius a noble spirit
timon nay my lords ceremony was but devis'd at first
to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
recanting goodness sorry ere 'tis shown
but where there is true friendship there needs none
pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes
than my fortunes to me they sit
first lord my lord we always have confess'd it
timon o apemantus you are welcome
apemantus no
you shall not make me welcome
i come to have thee thrust me out of doors
timon fie th'art a churl ye have got a humour there
does not become a man 'tis much to blame
they say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever
angry go let him have a table by himself for he does neither
affect company nor is he fit for't indeed
i come to observe i give thee warning ont
timon i take no heed of thee th'art an athenian therefore
welcome i myself would have no power prithee let my meat make
thee silent
apemantus i scorn thy meat 't'would choke me for i should ne'er
flatter thee o you gods what a number of men eats timon and he
sees 'em not it grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one
mans blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too
i wonder men dare trust themselves with men
good for their meat and safer for their lives
there's much example for't the fellow that sits next him now
parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided
draught is the readiest man to kill him 't has been proved if
i were a huge man i should fear to drink at meals
lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes
great men should drink with harness on their throats
timon my lord in heart and let the health go round
second lord let it flow this way my good lord
those healths will make thee and thy state look ill timon
here's that which is too weak to be a sinner honest water which
ne'er left man i' th' mire
this and my food are equals there's no odds'
feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
apemantus' grace
immortal gods i crave no pelf
i pray for no man but myself
grant i may never prove so fond
or a harlot for her weeping
or a dog that seems a sleeping
or a keeper with my freedom
or my friends if i should need 'em
amen so fall to't
rich men sin and i eat root eats and drinks
much good dich thy good heart apemantus
timon captain alcibiades your heart's in the field now
alcibiades my heart is ever at your service my lord
empty
alcibiades so they were bleeding new my lord there's no meat
like 'em i could wish my best friend at such a feast
apemantus would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that
then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em
first lord might we but have that happiness my lord that you
would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of
our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect
timon o no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have
my friends else why have you that charitable title from
thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart i have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own
behalf and thus far i confirm you o you gods think i what
need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em
they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er
have use for 'em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung
up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves why i have
often wish'd myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we
our own than the riches of our friends o what a precious
comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one
another's fortunes o joy's e'en made away ere't can be born
mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to forget their
faults i drink to you
apemantus thou weep'st to make them drink timon
second lord joy had the like conception in our eyes
and at that instant like a babe sprung up
apemantus ho ho i laugh to think that babe a bastard
apemantus much sound tucket
timon what means that trump
enter a servant
how now
servant please you my lord there are certain ladies most
desirous of admittance
timon ladies what are their wills
servant there comes with them a forerunner my lord which bears
that office to signify their pleasures

that of his bounties taste the five best senses
acknowledge thee their patron and come freely

taste touch smell pleas'd from thy table rise
they only now come but to feast thine eyes
timon they're welcome all let 'em have kind admittance
music make their welcome exit cupid
music re enter cupid witb a masque of ladies as amazons
with lutes in their hands dancing and playing
apemantus hoy day what a sweep of vanity comes this way
they dance they are mad women
like madness is the glory of this life
as this pomp shows to a little oil and root
we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
and spend our flatteries to drink those men
upon whose age we void it up again
who lives that's not depraved or depraves
who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
of their friends' gift
i should fear those that dance before me now
would one day stamp upon me 't has been done
men shut their doors against a setting sun
the lords rise from table with much adoring of
timon and to show their loves each single out an
amazon and all dance men witb women a lofty
timon you have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
set a fair fashion on our entertainment
which was not half so beautiful and kind
you have added worth unto't and lustre
and entertaind me with mine own device
i am to thank you for't
first lady my lord you take us even at the best
apemantus faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold
taking i doubt me
please you to dispose yourselves
all ladies most thankfully my lord

third servant please you my lord that honourable gentleman lord
lucullus entreats your company to morrow to hunt with him and
has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds
timon i'll hunt with him and let them be receiv'd
not without fair reward exit servant
flavius aside what will this come to
he commands us to provide and give great gifts
and all out of an empty coffer
nor will he know his purse or yield me this
being of no power to make his wishes good
his promises fly so beyond his state
that what he speaks is all in debt he owes
for ev'ry word he is so kind that he now
pays interest for't his land's put to their books
well would i were gently put out of office
before i were forc'd out
happier is he that has no friend to feed
than such that do e'en enemies exceed
timon you do yourselves much wrong
you bate too much of your own merits
here my lord a trifle of our love
second lord with more than common thanks i will receive it
third lord o he's the very soul of bounty
timon and now i remember my lord you gave good words the other
day of a bay courser i rode on 'tis yours because you lik'd it
third lord o i beseech you pardon me my lord in that
timon you may take my word my lord i know no man
i weigh my friend's affection with mine own
i'll tell you true i'll call to you
all lords o none so welcome
timon i take all and your several visitations
so kind to heart 'tis not enough to give
methinks i could deal kingdoms to my friends
and ne'er be weary alcibiades
thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
it comes in charity to thee for all thy living
lie in a pitch'd field
alcibiades ay defild land my lord
first lord we are so virtuously bound

timon all to you lights more lights
first lord the best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with
you lord timon
timon ready for his friends
apemantus what a coils here
serving of becks and jutting out of bums
i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
that are given for 'em friendship's full of dregs
methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies
timon now apemantus if thou wert not sullen
i would be good to thee
apemantus no i'll nothing for if i should be brib'd too there
the faster thou giv'st so long timon i fear me thou wilt give
away thyself in paper shortly what needs these feasts pomps
and vain glories
timon nay an you begin to rail on society once i am sworn not to
give regard to you farewell and come with better music
empty
apemantus so thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then i'll
lock thy heaven from thee
o that mens ears should be

exeunt apemantus and fool
flavius pray you walk near i'll speak with you anon
exeunt servants
had you not fully laid my state before me
that i might so have rated my expense
as i had leave of means
flavius you would not hear me
at many leisures i propos'd
timon go to
perchance some single vantages you took
when my indisposition put you back
and that unaptness made your minister
flavius o my good lord
at many times i brought in my accounts
laid them before you you would throw them off
and say you found them in mine honesty
when for some trifling present you have bid me
return so much i have shook my head and wept
yea 'gainst th' authority of manners pray'd you
to hold your hand more close i did endure
not seldom nor no slight checks when i have
and your great flow of debts my lov'd lord
though you hear now too late yet now's a time
the greatest of your having lacks a half
to pay your present debts
timon let all my land be sold
flavius 'tis all engag'd some forfeited and gone
and what remains will hardly stop the mouth
of present dues the future comes apace
what shall defend the interim and at length
timon to lacedaemon did my land extend
flavius o my good lord the world is but a word
were it all yours to give it in a breath
how quickly were it gone
timon you tell me true
flavius if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
call me before th' exactest auditors
and set me on the proof so the gods bless me
when all our offices have been oppress'd
with drunken spilth of wine when every room
hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy
i have retir'd me to a wasteful cock
and set mine eyes at flow
timon prithee no more
flavius 'heavens' have i said 'the bounty of this lord
how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
this night englutted who is not lord timons
what heart head sword force means but is lord timons
ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
the breath is gone whereof this praise is made
feast won fast lost one cloud of winter show'rs
these flies are couch'd
timon come sermon me no further
no villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart
unwisely not ignobly have i given
why dost thou weep canst thou the conscience lack
to think i shall lack friends secure thy heart
and try the argument of hearts by borrowing
men and mens fortunes could i frankly use
as i can bid thee speak
flavius assurance bless your thoughts
timon and in some sort these wants of mine are crownd
that i account them blessings for by these
shall i try friends you shall perceive how you
mistake my fortunes i am wealthy in my friends
within there flaminius servilius
servants my lord my lord
timon i will dispatch you severally you to lord lucius to lord
lucullus you i hunted with his honour to day you to sempronius
commend me to their loves and i am proud say that my occasions
have found time to use 'em toward a supply of money let the
request be fifty talents
flaminius as you have said my lord exeunt servants
flavius aside lord lucius and lucullus humh
timon go you sir to the senators
deserv'd this hearing bid 'em send o' th' instant
a thousand talents to me
flavius i have been bold
for that i knew it the most general way
to them to use your signet and your name
but they do shake their heads and i am here
no richer in return
timon is't true cant be
flavius they answer in a joint and corporate voice
do what they would are sorry you are honourable
but yet they could have wish'd they know not
something hath been amiss a noble nature
may catch a wrench would all were well 'tis pity
and so intending other serious matters
after distasteful looks and these hard fractions
with certain half caps and cold moving nods
they froze me into silence
timon you gods reward them
have their ingratitude in them hereditary
their blood is cak'd 'tis cold it seldom flows
'tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
and nature as it grows again toward earth
is fashiond for the journey dull and heavy
go to ventidius prithee be not sad
thou art true and honest ingeniously i speak
no blame belongs to thee ventidius lately
buried his father by whose death he's stepp'd
imprisond and in scarcity of friends
i clear'd him with five talents greet him from me
bid him suppose some good necessity
touches his friend which craves to be rememb'red
with those five talents that had give't these fellows
to whom 'tis instant due nev'r speak or think
that timons fortunes 'mong his friends can sink
flavius i would i could not think it
that thought is bounty's foe
act iii scene i
lucullus' house
flaminius waiting to speak with lucullus enter servant to him
servant i have told my lord of you he is coming down to you
flaminius i thank you sir
enter lucullus
servant here's my lord
lucullus aside one of lord timons men a gift i warrant why
this hits right i dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to night
sir fill me some wine exit servant and how does that
honourable complete freehearted gentleman of athens thy very
bountiful good lord and master
flaminius his health is well sir
lucullus i am right glad that his health is well sir and what
hast thou there under thy cloak pretty flaminius
flaminius faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lord's
behalf i come to entreat your honour to supply who having
great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to
assistance therein
lucullius la la la la 'nothing doubting' says he alas good
lord a noble gentleman 'tis if he would not keep so good a
house many a time and often i ha' dind with him and told him
ont and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him
spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning
by my coming every man has his fault and honesty is his i ha'
told him ont but i could ne'er get him from't
re enter servant with wine
lucullus flaminius i have noted thee always wise here's to thee
flaminius your lordship speaks your pleasure
lucullus i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit
give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and
canst use the time well if the time use thee well good parts in
thee to servant get you gone sirrah exit servant draw
nearer honest flaminius thy lord's a bountiful gentleman but
thou art wise and thou know'st well enough although thou com'st
to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare
good boy wink at me and say thou saw'st me not fare thee well
flaminius is't possible the world should so much differ
and we alive that liv'd fly damned baseness
to him that worships thee throwing the money back
lucullus ha now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy master
empty
flaminius may these add to the number that may scald thee
let molten coin be thy damnation
thou disease of a friend and not himself
it turns in less than two nights o you gods
i feel my master's passion this slave
unto his honour has my lord's meat in him
why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
when he is turnd to poison
o may diseases only work upont
and when he's sick to death let not that part of nature
which my lord paid for be of any power
to expel sickness but prolong his hour exit
a public place
enter lucius with three strangers
lucius who the lord timon he is my very good friend and an
honourable gentleman
first stranger we know him for no less though we are but
strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and
which i hear from common rumours now lord timons happy hours
are done and past and his estate shrinks from him
lucius fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many
talents nay urg'd extremely for't and showed what necessity
belong'd to't and yet was denied
lucius how
second stranger i tell you denied my lord
lucius what a strange case was that now before the gods i am
asham'd ont denied that honourable man there was very little
honour show'd int for my own part i must needs confess i have
received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels
mistook him and sent to me i should ne'er have denied his
occasion so many talents
enter servilius
servilius see by good hap yonder's my lord i have sweat to see
his honour my honour'd lord
lucius servilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well commend
me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend
servilius may it please your honour my lord hath sent
lucius ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to that lord
has he sent now
servilius has only sent his present occasion now my lord
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
empty
lucius i know his lordship is but merry with me
he cannot want fifty five hundred talents
servilius but in the mean time he wants less my lord
if his occasion were not virtuous
i should not urge it half so faithfully
servilius upon my soul 'tis true sir
lucius what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such
a good time when i might ha' shown myself honourable how
unluckily it happ'ned that i should purchase the day before for a
little part and undo a great deal of honour servilius now
before the gods i am not able to do the more beast i say i
was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can
witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had done't
now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his
to be kind and tell him this from me i count it one of my
greatest afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman good servilius will you befriend me so far
as to use mine own words to him
servilius yes sir i shall
lucius i'll look you out a good turn servilius
exit servilius
true as you said timon is shrunk indeed
and he that's once denied will hardly speed exit
second stranger ay too well
first stranger why this is the world's soul and just of the same
empty
is every flatterer's spirit who can call him his friend
that dips in the same dish for in my knowing
timon has been this lord's father
and kept his credit with his purse
supported his estate nay timons money
has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks
and yet o see the monstrousness of man
when he looks out in an ungrateful shape
he does deny him in respect of his
what charitable men afford to beggars
third stranger religion groans at it
first stranger for mine own part
i never tasted timon in my life
nor came any of his bounties over me
to mark me for his friend yet i protest
and honourable carriage
had his necessity made use of me
i would have put my wealth into donation
and the best half should have returnd to him
so much i love his heart but i perceive
men must learn now with pity to dispense
for policy sits above conscience exeunt
scene iii
sempronius' house
sempronius must he needs trouble me int hum 'bove all others
he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus
and now ventidius is wealthy too
whom he redeem'd from prison all these
owe their estates unto him
servant my lord
they have all been touch'd and found base metal for
they have all denied him
sempronius how have they denied him
and does he send to me three humh
it shows but little love or judgment in him
must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians
thrice give him over must i take th' cure upon me
has much disgrac'd me int i'm angry at him
that might have known my place i see no sense for't
but his occasions might have woo'd me first
for in my conscience i was the first man
that e'er received gift from him
that i'll requite it last no
so it may prove an argument of laughter
to th' rest and i 'mongst lords be thought a fool
i'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum
had sent to me first but for my mind's sake
i'd such a courage to do him good but now return
and with their faint reply this answer join
who bates mine honour shall not know my coin exit
servant excellent your lordship's a goodly villain the devil
by't and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man
will set him clear how fairly this lord strives to appear foul
takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot
ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire
of such a nature is his politic love
this was my lord's best hope now all are fled
save only the gods now his friends are dead
doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
many a bounteous year must be employ'd
and this is all a liberal course allows
who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house exit
scene iv
a hall in timons house
enter two of varro's men meeting lucius' servant and others
all being servants of timons creditors to wait for his coming out
then enter titus and hortensius
first varro's servant well met good morrow titus and hortensius
titus the like to you kind varro
lucius' servant ay and i think one business does command us all
for mine is money
titus so is theirs and ours
enter philotus
lucius' servant and sir philotus too
philotus good day at once
lucius' servant welcome good brother what do you think the hour
philotus labouring for nine
lucius' servant so much
lucius' servant not yet
philotus i wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven
lucius' servant ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him
you must consider that a prodigal course
is like the suns but not like his recoverable
i fear
'tis deepest winter in lord timons purse
that is one may reach deep enough and yet
find little
titus i'll show you how t' observe a strange event
your lord sends now for money
hortensius most true he does
titus and he wears jewels now of timons gift
for which i wait for money
hortensius it is against my heart
lucius' servant mark how strange it shows
timon in this should pay more than he owes
and e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
hortensius i'm weary of this charge the gods can witness
i know my lord hath spent of timons wealth
and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
first varro's servant yes mine's three thousand crowns what's
empty
lucius' servant five thousand mine
first varro's servant 'tis much deep and it should seem by th'
empty
your master's confidence was above mine
enter flaminius
titus one of lord timons men
lucius' servant flaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to
come forth
flaminius no indeed he is not
titus we attend his lordship pray signify so much
flaminius i need not tell him that he knows you are to diligent
empty
enter flavius in a cloak muffled
he goes away in a cloud call him call him
titus do you hear sir
second varro's servant by your leave sir
flavius what do ye ask of me my friend
titus we wait for certain money here sir
flavius ay
if money were as certain as your waiting
'twere sure enough
why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills
then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
and take down th' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws
you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
let me pass quietly
believe't my lord and i have made an end
i have no more to reckon he to spend
lucius' servant ay but this answer will not serve
flavius if 'twill not serve 'tis not so base as you
for you serve knaves exit
second varro's servant no matter what he's poor and that's
revenge enough who can speak broader than he that has no house
to put his head in such may rail against great buildings
enter servilius
titus o here's servilius now we shall know some answer
servilius if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other
hour i should derive much from't for take't of my soul my lord
leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has
forsook him he's much out of health and keeps his chamber
and if it be so far beyond his health
methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
and make a clear way to the gods
servilius good gods
titus we cannot take this for answer sir
flaminius within servilius help my lord my lord
enter timon in a rage flaminius following
timon what are my doors oppos'd against my passage
have i been ever free and must my house
the place which i have feasted does it now
like all mankind show me an iron heart
lucius' servant put in now titus
titus my lord here is my bill
lucius' servant here's mine
hortensius and mine my lord
both varro's servants and ours my lord
philotus all our bills
timon knock me down with 'em cleave me to the girdle
timon cut my heart in sums
titus mine fifty talents
timon tell out my blood
lucius' servant five thousand crowns my lord
timon five thousand drops pays that what yours and yours
first varro's servant my lord
second varro's servant my lord
timon tear me take me and the gods fall upon you exit
hortensius faith i perceive our masters may throw their caps at
madman owes 'em exeunt
re enter timon and flavius
timon they have e'en put my breath from me the slaves
creditors devils
flavius my dear lord
timon what if it should be so
flaminius my lord
timon i'll have it so my steward
flavius here my lord
lucius lucullus and sempronius all
i'll once more feast the rascals
flavius o my lord
you only speak from your distracted soul
there is not so much left to furnish out
a moderate table
timon be it not in thy care
go i charge thee invite them all let in the tide
of knaves once more my cook and i'll provide exeunt
the senate house
enter three senators at one door alcibiades meeting them with attendants
first senator my lord you have my voice to't the fault's bloody
'tis necessary he should die
nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
second senator most true the law shall bruise him
alcibiades honour health and compassion to the senate
first senator now captain
alcibiades i am an humble suitor to your virtues
and none but tyrants use it cruelly
it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth
to those that without heed do plunge into't
he is a man setting his fate aside
of comely virtues
nor did he soil the fact with cowardice
an honour in him which buys out his fault
seeing his reputation touch'd to death
he did oppose his foe
and with such sober and unnoted passion
he did behove his anger ere 'twas spent
as if he had but prov'd an argument
first senator you undergo too strict a paradox
striving to make an ugly deed look fair
your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
to bring manslaughter into form and set
is valour misbegot and came into the world
when sects and factions were newly born
he's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
the worst that man can breathe
and make his wrongs his outsides
to wear them like his raiment carelessly
and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart
to bring it into danger
if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
alcibiades my lord
first senator you cannot make gross sins look clear
to revenge is no valour but to bear
alcibiades my lords then under favour pardon me
if i speak like a captain
why do fond men expose themselves to battle
and not endure all threats sleep upont
and let the foes quietly cut their throats
without repugnancy if there be
abroad why then women are more valiant
that stay at home if bearing carry it
and the ass more captain than the lion the fellow
loaden with irons wiser than the judge
if wisdom be in suffering o my lords
as you are great be pitifully good
who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
to kill i grant is sins extremest gust
but in defence by mercy 'tis most just
but who is man that is not angry
weigh but the crime with this
second senator you breathe in vain
alcibiades in vain his service done
at lacedaemon and byzantium
were a sufficient briber for his life
first senator what's that
alcibiades why i say my lords has done fair service
and slain in fight many of your enemies
in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
second senator he has made too much plenty with 'em
he's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
if there were no foes that were enough
to overcome him in that beastly fury
he has been known to commit outrages
and cherish factions 'tis inferr'd to us
his days are foul and his drink dangerous
alcibiades hard fate he might have died in war
my lords if not for any parts in him
though his right arm might purchase his own time
and be in debt to none yet more to move you
take my deserts to his and join 'em both
and for i know your reverend ages love
security i'll pawn my victories all
my honours to you upon his good returns
if by this crime he owes the law his life
for law is strict and war is nothing more
first senator we are for law he dies urge it no more
on height of our displeasure friend or brother
he forfeits his own blood that spills another
alcibiades must it be so it must not be my lords
i do beseech you know me
second senator how
alcibiades call me to your remembrances
third senator what
it could not else be i should prove so base
to sue and be denied such common grace
my wounds ache at you
first senator do you dare our anger
'tis in few words but spacious in effect
we banish thee for ever
alcibiades banish me
banish your dotage banish usury
that makes the senate ugly
attend our weightier judgment and not to swell our spirit
he shall be executed presently exeunt senators
alcibiades now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
only in bone that none may look on you
i'm worse than mad i have kept back their foes
while they have told their money and let out
their coin upon large interest i myself
rich only in large hurts all those for this
is this the balsam that the usuring senate
it comes not ill i hate not to be banish'd
it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
that i may strike at athens i'll cheer up
my discontented troops and lay for hearts
'tis honour with most lands to be at odds
soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods exit
scene vi
a banqueting hall in timons house
music tables set out servants attending enter divers lords
first lord the good time of day to you sir
second lord i also wish it to you i think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day
first lord upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red
i hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial
of his several friends
second lord it should not be by the persuasion of his new
empty
first lord i should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting
conjur'd me beyond them and i must needs appear
second lord in like manner was i in debt to my importunate
business but he would not hear my excuse i am sorry when he
sent to borrow of me that my provision was out
first lord i am sick of that grief too as i understand how all
things go
second lord every man here's so what would he have borrowed of
empty
first lord a thousand pieces
first lord what of you
second lord he sent to me sir here he comes
enter timon and attendants
timon with all my heart gentlemen both and how fare you
first lord ever at the best hearing well of your lordship
second lord the swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship
timon aside nor more willingly leaves winter such summer birds
are men gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long
harshly o' th' trumpet's sound we shall to't presently
first lord i hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that
i returnd you an empty messenger
timon o sir let it not trouble you
second lord my noble lord
timon ah my good friend what cheer
second lord my most honourable lord i am e'en sick of shame that
when your lordship this other day sent to me i was so
unfortunate a beggar
second lord if you had sent but two hours before
timon let it not cumber your better remembrance the banquet
brought in come bring in all together
second lord all cover'd dishes
first lord royal cheer i warrant you
third lord doubt not that if money and the season can yield it
first lord how do you what's the news
third lord alcibiades is banish'd hear you of it
first and second lords alcibiades banish'd
first lord how how
second lord i pray you upon what
timon my worthy friends will you draw near
third lord i'll tell you more anon here's a noble feast toward
second lord this is the old man still
third lord willt hold willt hold
second lord it does but time will and so
third lord i do conceive
timon each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip
a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon
the first place sit sit the gods require our thanks
you great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness
for your own gifts make yourselves prais'd but reserve still to
give lest your deities be despised lend to each man enough
that one need not lend to another for were your god heads to
borrow of men men would forsake the gods make the meat be
beloved more than the man that gives it let no assembly of
twenty be without a score of villains if there sit twelve women
your foes o gods the senators of athens together with the
common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make
suitable for destruction for these my present friends as they
are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are
they welcome
uncover dogs and lap the dishes are uncovered and
seen to he full of warm water
some speak what does his lordship mean
some other i know not
you knot of mouth friends smoke and lukewarm water
is your perfection this is timons last
who stuck and spangled with your flatteries
washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
throwing the water in their faces
your reeking villainy live loath'd and long
most smiling smooth detested parasites
courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears
you fools of fortune trencher friends time's flies
of man and beast the infinite malady
crust you quite o'er what dost thou go
soft take thy physic first thou too and thou
stay i will lend thee money borrow none throws the
dishes at them and drives them out
what all in motion henceforth be no feast
whereat a villains not a welcome guest
burn house sink athens henceforth hated be
of timon man and all humanity exit
first lord how now my lords
second lord know you the quality of lord timons fury
third lord push did you see my cap
fourth lord i have lost my gown
first lord he's but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him
he gave me a jewel th' other day and now he has beat it out of
my hat did you see my jewel
third lord did you see my cap
second lord here 'tis
first lord let's make no stay

act iv scene i
without the walls of athens
enter timon
timon let me look back upon thee o thou wall
and fence not athens matrons turn incontinent
obedience fail in children slaves and fools
pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench
and minister in their steads to general filths
convert o' th' instant green virginity
do't in your parents' eyes bankrupts hold fast
rather than render back out with your knives
and cut your trusters' throats bound servants steal
large handed robbers your grave masters are
thy mistress is o' th' brothel son of sixteen
pluck the lind crutch from thy old limping sire
with it beat out his brains piety and fear
religion to the gods peace justice truth
domestic awe night rest and neighbourhood
instruction manners mysteries and trades
degrees observances customs and laws
decline to your confounding contraries
and let confusion live plagues incident to men
on athens ripe for stroke thou cold sciatica
cripple our senators that their limbs may halt
as lamely as their manners lust and liberty
creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
that 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive
and drown themselves in riot itches blains
sow all th' athenian bosoms and their crop
be general leprosy breath infect breath
that their society as their friendship may
but nakedness thou detestable town
take thou that too with multiplying bans
timon will to the woods where he shall find
th' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind
the gods confound hear me you good gods all
the athenians both within and out that wall
and grant as timon grows his hate may grow
to the whole race of mankind high and low
amen exit
athens timons house
enter flavius with two or three servants
first servant hear you master steward where's our master
are we undone cast off nothing remaining
flavius alack my fellows what should i say to you
let me be recorded by the righteous gods
i am as poor as you
first servant such a house broke
so noble a master falln all gone and not
and go along with him
second servant as we do turn our backs
from our companion thrown into his grave
so his familiars to his buried fortunes
slink all away leave their false vows with him
like empty purses pick'd and his poor self
a dedicated beggar to the air
with his disease of all shunnd poverty
walks like contempt alone more of our fellows
flavius all broken implements of a ruind house
third servant yet do our hearts wear timons livery
that see i by our faces we are fellows still
serving alike in sorrow leak'd is our bark
and we poor mates stand on the dying deck
hearing the surges threat we must all part
into this sea of air
flavius good fellows all
the latest of my wealth i'll share amongst you
let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say
as 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune
'we have seen better days' let each take some
giving them money
nay put out all your hands not one word more
thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
embrace and part several ways
o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
who would be so mock'd with glory or to live
but in a dream of friendship
to have his pomp and all what state compounds
but only painted like his varnish'd friends
poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
undone by goodness strange unusual blood
when mans worst sin is he does too much good
who then dares to be half so kind again
for bounty that makes gods does still mar men
rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
are made thy chief afflictions alas kind lord
he's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
of monstrous friends nor has he with him to
supply his life or that which can command it
i'll follow and enquire him out
i'll ever serve his mind with my best will
whilst i have gold i'll be his steward still exit
scene iii
enter timon in the woods
timon o blessed breeding sun draw from the earth
rotten humidity below thy sister's orb
infect the air twinnd brothers of one womb
whose procreation residence and birth
scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes
the greater scorns the lesser not nature
to whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune
but by contempt of nature
the senator shall bear contempt hereditary
the beggar native honour
it is the pasture lards the rother's sides
the want that makes him lean who dares who dares
in purity of manhood stand upright
and say 'this mans a flatterer' if one be
so are they all for every grise of fortune
is smooth'd by that below the learned pate
ducks to the golden fool alls oblique
but direct villainy therefore be abhorr'd
all feasts societies and throngs of men
his semblable yea himself timon disdains
destruction fang mankind earth yield me roots
empty
who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate
with thy most operant poison what is here
gold yellow glittering precious gold no gods
i am no idle votarist roots you clear heavens
wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
ha you gods why this what this you gods why this
will lug your priests and servants from your sides
pluck stout mens pillows from below their heads
this yellow slave
will knit and break religions bless th' accurs'd
make the hoar leprosy ador'd place thieves
and give them title knee and approbation
with senators on the bench this is it
she whom the spital house and ulcerous sores
would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
to th 'april day again come damnd earth
thou common whore of mankind that puts odds
among the rout of nations i will make thee
do thy right nature march afar off
ha a drum th'art quick
but yet i'll bury thee thou't go strong thief
when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
enter alcibiades with drum and fife in warlike
manner and phrynia and timandra
alcibiades what art thou there speak
timon a beast as thou art the canker gnaw thy heart
for showing me again the eyes of man
alcibiades what is thy name is man so hateful to thee
that art thyself a man
timon i am misanthropos and hate mankind
for thy part i do wish thou wert a dog
alcibiades i know thee well
but in thy fortunes am unlearnd and strange
timon i know thee too and more than that i know thee
i not desire to know follow thy drum
with mans blood paint the ground gules gules
religious canons civil laws are cruel
then what should war be this fell whore of thine
hath in her more destruction than thy sword
for all her cherubin look
timon i will not kiss thee then the rot returns
to thine own lips again
alcibiades how came the noble timon to this change
timon as the moon does by wanting light to give
but then renew i could not like the moon
there were no suns to borrow of
alcibiades noble timon
what friendship may i do thee
timon none but to
alcibiades what is it timon
timon promise me friendship but perform none if thou wilt not
promise the gods plague thee for thou art man if thou dost
perform confound thee for thou art a man
alcibiades i have heard in some sort of thy miseries
timon thou saw'st them when i had prosperity
alcibiades i see them now then was a blessed time
timon as thine is now held with a brace of harlots
timandra is this th' athenian minion whom the world
timon art thou timandra
timandra yes
timon be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
make use of thy salt hours season the slaves
for tubs and baths bring down rose cheek'd youth
to the tub fast and the diet
timandra hang thee monster
alcibiades pardon him sweet timandra for his wits
i have but little gold of late brave timon
the want whereof doth daily make revolt
in my penurious band i have heard and griev'd
how cursed athens mindless of thy worth
forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them
timon i prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
alcibiades i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon
timon how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
alcibiades why fare thee well
here is some gold for thee
timon keep it i cannot eat it
alcibiades when i have laid proud athens on a heap
timon war'st thou 'gainst athens
alcibiades ay timon and have cause
timon the gods confound them all in thy conquest
and thee after when thou hast conquer'd
alcibiades why me timon
thou wast born to conquer my country
put up thy gold go on here's gold go on
be as a planetary plague when jove
will o'er some high vic'd city hang his poison
in the sick air let not thy sword skip one
pity not honour'd age for his white beard
he is an usurer strike me the counterfeit matron
it is her habit only that is honest
herself's a bawd let not the virgins cheek
that through the window bars bore at mens eyes
are not within the leaf of pity writ
but set them down horrible traitors spare not the babe
whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
think it a bastard whom the oracle
hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut
and mince it sans remorse swear against abjects
put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
shall pierce a jot there's gold to pay thy soldiers
make large confusion and thy fury spent
confounded be thyself speak not be gone
alcibiades hast thou gold yet i'll take the gold thou givest me
not all thy counsel
timon dost thou or dost thou not heavens curse upon thee
phrynia and timandra give us some gold good timon
hast thou more
timon enough to make a whore forswear her trade
your aprons mountant you are not oathable
although i know you'll swear terribly swear
into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
th' immortal gods that hear you spare your oaths
i'll trust to your conditions be whores still
and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
be strong in whore allure him burn him up
let your close fire predominate his smoke
and be no turncoats yet may your pains six months
with burdens of the dead some that were hang'd
no matter wear them betray with them whore still
paint till a horse may mire upon your face
a pox of wrinkles
phrynia and timandra well more gold what then
believe't that we'll do anything for gold
timon consumptions sow
in hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
and mar mens spurring crack the lawyer's voice
nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen
that scolds against the quality of flesh
and not believes himself down with the nose
down with it flat take the bridge quite away
of him that his particular to foresee
smells from the general weal make curld pate ruffians bald
and let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
derive some pain from you plague all
that your activity may defeat and quell
do you damn others and let this damn you
and ditches grave you all
phrynia and timandra more counsel with more money bounteous
empty
timon more whore more mischief first i have given you earnest
alcibiades strike up the drum towards athens farewell timon
if i thrive well i'll visit thee again
timon if i hope well i'll never see thee more
alcibiades i never did thee harm
alcibiades callst thou that harm
timon men daily find it get thee away and take
thy beagles with thee
alcibiades we but offend him strike
drum beats exeunt all but timon
timon that nature being sick of mans unkindness
should yet be hungry common mother thou digging
whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
teems and feeds all whose self same mettle
engenders the black toad and adder blue
the gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm
with all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven
whereon hyperions quick'ning fire doth shine
yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
from forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
let it no more bring out ingrateful man
go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears
hath to the marbled mansion all above
never presented o a root dear thanks
dry up thy marrows vines and plough torn leas
whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts
and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind
that from it all consideration slips
enter apemantus
more man plague plague
apemantus i was directed hither men report
timon 'tis then because thou dost not keep a dog
whom i would imitate consumption catch thee
apemantus this is in thee a nature but infected
a poor unmanly melancholy sprung
from change of fortune why this spade this place
this slave like habit and these looks of care
thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
hug their diseas'd perfumes and have forgot
that ever timon was shame not these woods
be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive
by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
and let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
and call it excellent thou wast told thus
thou gav'st thine ears like tapsters that bade welcome
to knaves and all approachers 'tis most just
that thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
rascals should have't do not assume my likeness
apemantus thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
a madman so long now a fool what think'st
that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
will put thy shirt on warm will these moist trees
that have outliv'd the eagle page thy heels
and skip when thou point'st out will the cold brook
candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
to cure thy o'ernight's surfeit call the creatures
whose naked natures live in all the spite
to the conflicting elements expos'd
answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
o thou shalt find
timon a fool of thee depart
apemantus i love thee better now than e'er i did
timon i hate thee worse
apemantus why
timon thou flatter'st misery
apemantus i flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
apemantus to vex thee
timon always a villains office or a fools
dost please thyself int
apemantus ay
timon what a knave too
apemantus if thou didst put this sour cold habit on
to castigate thy pride 'twere well but thou
dost it enforcedly thou'dst courtier be again
wert thou not beggar willing misery
the one is filling still never complete
the other at high wish best state contentless
hath a distracted and most wretched being
worse than the worst content
thou should'st desire to die being miserable
timon not by his breath that is more miserable
thou art a slave whom fortune's tender arm
with favour never clasp'd but bred a dog
hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
to such as may the passive drugs of it
freely command thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
in general riot melted down thy youth
in different beds of lust and never learnd
the icy precepts of respect but followed
the sug'red game before thee but myself
who had the world as my confectionary
the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
at duty more than i could frame employment
do on the oak have with one winter's brush
fell from their boughs and left me open bare
for every storm that blows i to bear this
that never knew but better is some burden
thy nature did commence in sufferance time
hath made thee hard int why shouldst thou hate men
they never flatter'd thee what hast thou given
if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
poor rogue hereditary hence be gone
if thou hadst not been born the worst of men
thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
apemantus art thou proud yet
timon ay that i am not thee
apemantus i that i was
no prodigal
timon i that i am one now
were all the wealth i have shut up in thee
that the whole life of athens were in this
thus would i eat it eating a root
apemantus here i will mend thy feast
offering him food
timon first mend my company take away thyself
apemantus so i shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine
timon 'tis not well mended so it is but botch'd
if not i would it were
apemantus what wouldst thou have to athens
tell them there i have gold look so i have
apemantus here is no use for gold
timon the best and truest
for here it sleeps and does no hired harm
apemantus where liest a nights timon
timon under that's above me
where feed'st thou a days apemantus
apemantus where my stomach finds meat or rather where i eat it
timon would poison were obedient and knew my mind
timon to sauce thy dishes
apemantus the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the
extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt and thy
perfume they mock'd thee for too much curiosity in thy rags
thou know'st none but art despis'd for the contrary there's a
medlar for thee eat it
timon on what i hate i feed not
apemantus dost hate a medlar
timon ay though it look like thee
loved thyself better now what man didst thou ever know unthrift
that was beloved after his means
timon who without those means thou talk'st of didst thou ever
know belov'd
apemantus myself
timon i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog
apemantus what things in the world canst thou nearest compare to
thy flatterers
timon women nearest but men men are the things themselves what
empty
apemantus give it the beasts to be rid of the men
timon wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and
remain a beast with the beasts
apemantus ay timon
timon a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t' attain to
if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert
the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion
would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accus'd by the
still thou liv'dst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert
the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn
pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the
conquest of thy fury wert thou bear thou wouldst be killd by
the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seiz'd by the
leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to the lion and
the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety
were remotion and thy defence absence what beast couldst thou
already that seest not thy loss in transformation
apemantus if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou
mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of athens is
become a forest of beasts
timon how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the
empty
apemantus yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of company
light upon thee i will fear to catch it and give way when i
know not what else to do i'll see thee again
welcome i had rather be a beggar's dog than apemantus
apemantus thou art the cap of all the fools alive
timon would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
apemantus a plague on thee thou art too bad to curse
timon all villains that do stand by thee are pure
apemantus there is no leprosy but what thou speak'st
timon if i name thee
i'll beat thee but i should infect my hands
apemantus i would my tongue could rot them off
choler does kill me that thou art alive
i swoon to see thee
apemantus would thou wouldst burst
timon away
thou tedious rogue i am sorry i shall lose
a stone by thee throws a stone at him
apemantus beast
timon slave
apemantus toad
i am sick of this false world and will love nought
but even the mere necessities upont
then timon presently prepare thy grave
lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph
that death in me at others' lives may laugh
looks at the gold o thou sweet king killer and dear divorce
'twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler
of hymens purest bed thou valiant mars
whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
that lies on dians lap thou visible god
that sold'rest close impossibilities
and mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue
to every purpose o thou touch of hearts
think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
set them into confounding odds that beasts
may have the world in empire
apemantus would 'twere so
thou wilt be throng'd to shortly
timon throng'd to
apemantus ay
timon thy back i prithee
apemantus live and love thy misery
timon long live so and so die exit apemantus i am quit more
things like men eat timon and abhor them
enter the banditti
first bandit where should he have this gold it is some poor
gold and the falling from of his friends drove him into this
empty
second bandit it is nois'd he hath a mass of treasure
third bandit let us make the assay upon him if he care not for't
he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how
shalls get it
second bandit true for he bears it not about him 'tis hid
first bandit is not this he
banditti where
third bandit he i know him
banditti save thee timon
timon now thieves
banditti soldiers not thieves
timon both too and womens sons
banditti we are not thieves but men that much do want
timon your greatest want is you want much of meat
why should you want behold the earth hath roots
within this mile break forth a hundred springs
the bounteous housewife nature on each bush
lays her full mess before you want why want
first bandit we cannot live on grass on berries water
as beasts and birds and fishes
timon nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
you must eat men yet thanks i must you con
that you are thieves profess'd that you work not
in holier shapes for there is boundless theft
in limited professions rascal thieves
till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
and so scape hanging trust not the physician
his antidotes are poison and he slays
moe than you rob take wealth and lives together
do villainy do since you protest to do't
like workmen i'll example you with thievery
the suns a thief and with his great attraction
robs the vast sea the moons an arrant thief
and her pale fire she snatches from the sun
the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief
that feeds and breeds by a composture stoln
from genral excrement each thing's a thief
the laws your curb and whip in their rough power
has uncheck'd theft love not yourselves away
rob one another there's more gold cut throats
all that you meet are thieves to athens go
break open shops nothing can you steal
but thieves do lose it steal not less for this
empty
third bandit has almost charm'd me from my profession by
persuading me to it
first bandit 'tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
us not to have us thrive in our mystery
second bandit i'll believe him as an enemy and give over my
empty
first bandit let us first see peace in athens there is no time so
miserable but a man may be true exeunt thieves
flavius o you gods
is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord
full of decay and failing o monument
and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd
what an alteration of honour
has desp'rate want made
what viler thing upon the earth than friends
who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
how rarely does it meet with this time's guise
grant i may ever love and rather woo
those that would mischief me than those that do
has caught me in his eye i will present
my honest grief unto him and as my lord
still serve him with my life my dearest master
timon away what art thou
flavius have you forgot me sir
timon why dost ask that i have forgot all men
then if thou grant'st th'art a man i have forgot thee
timon then i know thee not
i never had honest man about me i
all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
flavius the gods are witness
nev'r did poor steward wear a truer grief
for his undone lord than mine eyes for you
timon what dost thou weep come nearer then i love thee
because thou art a woman and disclaim'st
flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
flavius i beg of you to know me good my lord
t' accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
to entertain me as your steward still
timon had i a steward
so true so just and now so comfortable
it almost turns my dangerous nature mild
let me behold thy face surely this man
was born of woman
you perpetual sober gods i do proclaim
one honest man mistake me not but one
no more i pray and he's a steward
how fain would i have hated all mankind
and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee
i fell with curses
methinks thou art more honest now than wise
for by oppressing and betraying me
thou mightst have sooner got another service
upon their first lord's neck but tell me true
for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure
is not thy kindness subtle covetous
if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
expecting in return twenty for one
flavius no my most worthy master in whose breast
doubt and suspect alas are plac'd too late
you should have fear'd false times when you did feast
suspect still comes where an estate is least
duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
care of your food and living and believe it
my most honour'd lord
for any benefit that points to me
either in hope or present i'd exchange
for this one wish that you had power and wealth
to requite me by making rich yourself
timon look thee 'tis so thou singly honest man
here take the gods out of my misery
but thus conditiond thou shalt build from men
hate all curse all show charity to none
but let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone
ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs
what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em
debts wither 'em to nothing be men like blasted woods
and may diseases lick up their false bloods
and so farewell and thrive
flavius o let me stay
timon if thou hat'st curses
stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee
exeunt severally
act v scene i
the woods before timons cave
enter poet and painter
painter as i took note of the place it cannot be far where he
empty
so full of gold
painter certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had
gold of him he likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with
great quantity 'tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum
poet then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
painter nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens again
and flourish with the highest therefore 'tis not amiss we tender
our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his it will show
honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what
empty
poet what have you now to present unto him
painter nothing at this time but my visitation only i will
promise him an excellent piece
poet i must serve him so too tell him of an intent that's coming
toward him
painter good as the best promising is the very air o' th' time
it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller
for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or
testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that
makes it
enter timon from his cave
timon aside excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad
as is thyself
poet i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it
must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness
of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that
timon aside must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own
work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so i have
gold for thee
poet nay let's seek him
then do we sin against our own estate
when we may profit meet and come too late
painter true
when the day serves before black corner'd night
find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light
timon aside i'll meet you at the turn what a god's gold
that he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
than where swine feed
'tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam
settlest admired reverence in a slave
to thee be worship and thy saints for aye
be crownd with plagues that thee alone obey
fit i meet them advancing from his cave
poet hail worthy timon
timon have i once liv'd to see two honest men
poet sir
having often of your open bounty tasted
hearing you were retir'd your friends falln off
whose thankless natures o abhorred spirits
not all the whips of heaven are large enough
what to you
whose star like nobleness gave life and influence
to their whole being i am rapt and cannot cover
with any size of words
timon let it go naked men may see't the better
you that are honest by being what you are
make them best seen and known
painter he and myself
have travaild in the great show'r of your gifts
and sweetly felt it
timon ay you are honest men
painter we are hither come to offer you our service
can you eat roots and drink cold water no
both what we can do we'll do to do you service
timon y'are honest men y'have heard that i have gold
i am sure you have speak truth y'are honest men
painter so it is said my noble lord but therefore
came not my friend nor i
timon good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit
best in all athens th'art indeed the best
thou counterfeit'st most lively
timon e'en so sir as i say to to poet and for thy fiction
why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
that thou art even natural in thine art
but for all this my honest natur'd friends
i must needs say you have a little fault
marry 'tis not monstrous in you neither wish i
you take much pains to mend
both beseech your honour
to make it known to us
both most thankfully my lord
timon will you indeed
both doubt it not worthy lord
timon there's never a one of you but trusts a knave
that mightily deceives you
both do we my lord
timon ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
know his gross patchery love him feed him
keep in your bosom yet remain assur'd
painter i know not such my lord
poet nor i
timon look you i love you well i'll give you gold
rid me these villains from your companies
hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
confound them by some course and come to me
i'll give you gold enough
both name them my lord let's know them
timon you that way and you this but two in company
yet an arch villain keeps him company
to the painter if where thou art two villians shall not be
come not near him to the poet if thou wouldst not reside
but where one villain is then him abandon
hence pack there's gold you came for gold ye slaves
to the painter you have work for me there's payment hence
to the poet you are an alchemist make gold of that
out rascal dogs beats and drives them out
enter flavius and two senators
for he is set so only to himself
that nothing but himself which looks like man
is friendly with him
first senator bring us to his cave
it is our part and promise to th' athenians
to speak with timon
second senator at all times alike
men are not still the same 'twas time and griefs
that fram'd him thus time with his fairer hand
the former man may make him bring us to him
and chance it as it may
flavius here is his cave
peace and content be here lord timon timon
look out and speak to friends th' athenians
by two of their most reverend senate greet thee
speak to them noble timon
enter timon out of his cave
timon thou sun that comforts burn speak and be hang'd
be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue
consuming it with speaking
first senator worthy timon
timon of none but such as you and you of timon
first senator the senators of athens greet thee timon
timon i thank them and would send them back the plague
could i but catch it for them
first senator o forget
what we are sorry for ourselves in thee
entreat thee back to athens who have thought
on special dignities which vacant lie
for thy best use and wearing
second senator they confess
toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
which now the public body which doth seldom
play the recanter feeling in itself
a lack of timons aid hath sense withal
of it own fail restraining aid to timon
together with a recompense more fruitful
than their offence can weigh down by the dram
ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
and write in thee the figures of their love
ever to read them thine
timon you witch me in it
surprise me to the very brink of tears
lend me a fools heart and a womans eyes
first senator therefore so please thee to return with us
and of our athens thine and ours to take
the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
live with authority so soon we shall drive back
of alcibiades th' approaches wild
who like a boar too savage doth root up
his country's peace
second senator and shakes his threat'ning sword
first senator therefore timon
timon well sir i will therefore i will sir thus
if alcibiades kill my countrymen
let alcibiades know this of timon
that timon cares not but if he sack fair athens
and take our goodly aged men by th' beards
giving our holy virgins to the stain
of contumelious beastly mad braind war
then let him know and tell him timon speaks it
i cannot choose but tell him that i care not
and let him take't at worst for their knives care not
while you have throats to answer for myself
there's not a whittle in th' unruly camp
but i do prize it at my love before
the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you
to the protection of the prosperous gods
as thieves to keepers
flavius stay not alls in vain
it will be seen to morrow my long sickness
of health and living now begins to mend
and nothing brings me all things go live still
be alcibiades your plague you his
and last so long enough
first senator we speak in vain
timon but yet i love my country and am not
one that rejoices in the common wreck
as common bruit doth put it
timon commend me to my loving countrymen
first senator these words become your lips as they pass through
empty
second senator and enter in our ears like great triumphers
in their applauding gates
timon commend me to them
and tell them that to ease them of their griefs
their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
their pangs of love with other incident throes
in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them
i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades' wrath
first senator i like this well he will return again
timon i have a tree which grows here in my close
that mine own use invites me to cut down
and shortly must i fell it tell my friends
tell athens in the sequence of degree
from high to low throughout that whoso please
to stop affliction let him take his haste
and hang himself i pray you do my greeting
flavius trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
timon come not to me again but say to athens
timon hath made his everlasting mansion
upon the beached verge of the salt flood
who once a day with his embossed froth
the turbulent surge shall cover thither come
and let my gravestone be your oracle
lips let sour words go by and language end
graves only be mens works and death their gain
sun hide thy beams timon hath done his reign
exit timon into his cave
first senator his discontents are unremovably
coupled to nature
second senator our hope in him is dead let us return
and strain what other means is left unto us
in our dear peril
first senator it requires swift foot exeunt
before the walls of athens
enter two other senators with a messenger
first senator thou hast painfully discover'd are his files
as full as thy report
messenger i have spoke the least
besides his expedition promises
present approach
second senator we stand much hazard if they bring not timon
messenger i met a courier one mine ancient friend
yet our old love had a particular force
and made us speak like friends this man was riding
from alcibiades to timons cave
with letters of entreaty which imported
his fellowship i' th' cause against your city
in part for his sake mov'd
enter the other senators from timon
first senator here come our brothers
third senator no talk of timon nothing of him expect
doth choke the air with dust in and prepare
ours is the fall i fear our foes the snare exeunt
scene iii
the timons cave and a rude tomb seen
enter a soldier in the woods seeking timon
soldier by all description this should be the place
who's here speak ho no answer what is this
timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span
some beast rear'd this here does not live a man
i cannot read the character i'll take with wax
our captain hath in every figure skill
an ag'd interpreter though young in days
before proud athens he's set down by this
whose fall the mark of his ambition is exit
scene iv
before the walls of athens
trumpets sound enter alcibiades with his powers before athens
alcibiades sound to this coward and lascivious town
sound a parley the senators appear upon the walls
till now you have gone on and filld the time
with all licentious measure making your wills
the scope of justice till now myself and such
as slept within the shadow of your power
have wander'd with our travers'd arms and breath'd
our sufferance vainly now the time is flush
when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
cries of itself 'no more' now breathless wrong
and pursy insolence shall break his wind
with fear and horrid flight
first senator noble and young
when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
we sent to thee to give thy rages balm
to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
above their quantity
second senator so did we woo
by humble message and by promis'd means
we were not all unkind nor all deserve
the common stroke of war
first senator these walls of ours
were not erected by their hands from whom
you have receiv'd your griefs nor are they such
that these great tow'rs trophies and schools should fall
for private faults in them
second senator nor are they living
shame that they wanted cunning in excess
hath broke their hearts march noble lord
into our city with thy banners spread
by decimation and a tithed death
if thy revenges hunger for that food
which nature loathes take thou the destind tenth
and by the hazard of the spotted die
let die the spotted
first senator all have not offended
on those that are revenge crimes like lands
are not inherited then dear countryman
bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
spare thy athenian cradle and those kin
which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
with those that have offended like a shepherd
approach the fold and cull th' infected forth
but kill not all together
second senator what thou wilt
than hew to't with thy sword
first senator set but thy foot
against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
to say thou't enter friendly
second senator throw thy glove
or any token of thine honour else
that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
and not as our confusion all thy powers
have seald thy full desire
alcibiades then there's my glove
descend and open your uncharged ports
those enemies of timons and mine own
whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
fall and no more and to atone your fears
with my more noble meaning not a man
shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
of regular justice in your city's bounds
at heaviest answer
both 'tis most nobly spoken
alcibiades descend and keep your words
the senators descend and open the gates
enter a soldier as a messenger
soldier my noble general timon is dead
entomb'd upon the very hem o' th' sea
and on his grave stone this insculpture which
with wax i brought away whose soft impression
alcibiades reads the epitaph
'here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
seek not my name a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left
here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate
pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy
empty
these well express in thee thy latter spirits
though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs
scorndst our brains flow and those our droplets which
taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye
on thy low grave on faults forgiven dead
is noble timon of whose memory
hereafter more bring me into your city
and i will use the olive with my sword
make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
prescribe to other as each other's leech
let our drums strike exeunt

act 1 scene i
rome before the capitol
flourish enter the tribunes and senators aloft and then enter below
saturninus and his followers at one door and bassianus and his followers
at the other with drums and trumpets
defend the justice of my cause with arms
and countrymen my loving followers
plead my successive title with your swords
i am his first born son that was the last
that ware the imperial diadem of rome
then let my father's honours live in me
nor wrong mine age with this indignity
bassianus romans friends followers favourers of my right
if ever bassianus caesar's son
keep then this passage to the capitol
and suffer not dishonour to approach
the imperial seat to virtue consecrate
to justice continence and nobility
but let desert in pure election shine
and romans fight for freedom in your choice
enter marcus andronicus aloft with the crown
marcus princes that strive by factions and by friends
ambitiously for rule and empery
a special party have by common voice
in election for the roman empery
chosen andronicus surnamed pius
for many good and great deserts to rome
a nobler man a braver warrior
lives not this day within the city walls
he by the senate is accited home
from weary wars against the barbarous goths
that with his sons a terror to our foes
ten years are spent since first he undertook
this cause of rome and chastised with arms
our enemies' pride five times he hath returnd
bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons
in coffins from the field and at this day
to the monument of that andronici
done sacrifice of expiation
and slain the noblest prisoner of the goths
and now at last laden with honour's spoils
renowned titus flourishing in arms
let us entreat by honour of his name
whom worthily you would have now succeed
and in the capitol and senate's right
whom you pretend to honour and adore
that you withdraw you and abate your strength
dismiss your followers and as suitors should
plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
saturninus how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
in thy uprightness and integrity
and so i love and honour thee and thine
thy noble brother titus and his sons
and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
gracious lavinia rome's rich ornament
that i will here dismiss my loving friends
and to my fortunes and the people's favour
commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd
exeunt the soldiers of bassianus
i thank you all and here dismiss you all
and to the love and favour of my country
commit myself my person and the cause
exeunt the soldiers of saturninus
rome be as just and gracious unto me
as i am confident and kind to thee
open the gates and let me in
bassianus tribunes and me a poor competitor
flourish they go up into the senate house
captain romans make way the good andronicus
patron of virtue rome's best champion
successful in the battles that he fights
with honour and with fortune is returnd
from where he circumscribed with his sword
and brought to yoke the enemies of rome
sound drums and trumpets and then enter martius
and mutius two of titus' sons and then two men
bearing a coffin covered with black then lucius
and then tamora the queen of goths with her three
sons alarbus demetrius and chiron with aaron the
moor and others as many as can be then set down
the coffin and titus speaks
titus hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
lo as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
returns with precious lading to the bay
from whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage
cometh andronicus bound with laurel boughs
tears of true joy for his return to rome
thou great defender of this capitol
stand gracious to the rites that we intend
romans of five and twenty valiant sons
half of the number that king priam had
behold the poor remains alive and dead
these that survive let rome reward with love
these that i bring unto their latest home
with burial amongst their ancestors
titus unkind and careless of thine own
why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet
to hover on the dreadful shore of styx
make way to lay them by their brethren
they open the tomb
there greet in silence as the dead are wont
and sleep in peace slain in your country's wars
o sacred receptacle of my joys
sweet cell of virtue and nobility
that thou wilt never render to me more
lucius give us the proudest prisoner of the goths
that we may hew his limbs and on a pile
ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
before this earthy prison of their bones
that so the shadows be not unappeas'd
nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth
titus i give him you the noblest that survives
the eldest son of this distressed queen
victorious titus rue the tears i shed
a mother's tears in passion for her son
and if thy sons were ever dear to thee
o think my son to be as dear to me
sufficeth not that we are brought to rome
to beautify thy triumphs and return
captive to thee and to thy roman yoke
but must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
for valiant doings in their country's cause
were piety in thine it is in these
andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
draw near them then in being merciful
sweet mercy is nobility's true badge
thrice noble titus spare my first born son
titus patient yourself madam and pardon me
these are their brethren whom your goths beheld
alive and dead and for their brethren slain
to this your son is mark'd and die he must
t' appease their groaning shadows that are gone
lucius away with him and make a fire straight
and with our swords upon a pile of wood
let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd
exeunt titus' sons with alarbus
tamora o cruel irreligious piety
chiron was never scythia half so barbarous
demetrius oppose not scythia to ambitious rome
to tremble under titus' threat'ning look
then madam stand resolv'd but hope withal
the self same gods that arm'd the queen of troy
with opportunity of sharp revenge
upon the thracian tyrant in his tent
may favour tamora the queen of goths
when goths were goths and tamora was queen
to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
re enter lucius quintus martius and
lucius see lord and father how we have perform'd
our roman rites alarbus' limbs are lopp'd
and entrails feed the sacrificing fire
whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
and with loud 'larums welcome them to rome
titus let it be so and let andronicus
make this his latest farewell to their souls
sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb
rome's readiest champions repose you here in rest
secure from worldly chances and mishaps
here lurks no treason here no envy swells
here grow no damned drugs here are no storms
no noise but silence and eternal sleep
in peace and honour rest you here my sons
enter lavinia
lavinia in peace and honour live lord titus long
my noble lord and father live in fame
i render for my brethrens obsequies
and at thy feet i kneel with tears of joy
shed on this earth for thy return to rome
o bless me here with thy victorious hand
whose fortunes rome's best citizens applaud
titus kind rome that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
the cordial of mine age to glad my heart
lavinia live outlive thy father's days
and fame's eternal date for virtue's praise
re enter saturninus bassianus and attendants
marcus long live lord titus my beloved brother
gracious triumpher in the eyes of rome
titus thanks gentle tribune noble brother marcus
marcus and welcome nephews from successful wars
you that survive and you that sleep in fame
fair lords your fortunes are alike in all
that in your country's service drew your swords
but safer triumph is this funeral pomp
and triumphs over chance in honour's bed
titus andronicus the people of rome
whose friend in justice thou hast ever been
send thee by me their tribune and their trust
this pariament of white and spotless hue
and name thee in election for the empire
with these our late deceased emperor's sons
be candidatus then and put it on
and help to set a head on headless rome
than his that shakes for age and feebleness
what should i don this robe and trouble you
be chosen with proclamations to day
to morrow yield up rule resign my life
and set abroad new business for you all
rome i have been thy soldier forty years
and led my country's strength successfully
and buried one and twenty valiant sons
knighted in field slain manfully in arms
give me a staff of honour for mine age
but not a sceptre to control the world
upright he held it lords that held it last
marcus titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery
saturninus proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell
titus patience prince saturninus
saturninus romans do me right
patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not
till saturninus be rome's emperor
rather than rob me of the people's hearts
lucius proud saturnine interrupter of the good
that noble minded titus means to thee
titus content thee prince i will restore to thee
the people's hearts and wean them from themselves
bassianus andronicus i do not flatter thee
but honour thee and will do till i die
my faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
i will most thankful be and thanks to men
titus people of rome and people's tribunes here
i ask your voices and your suffrages
will ye bestow them friendly on andronicus
tribunes to gratify the good andronicus
and gratulate his safe return to rome
the people will accept whom he admits
titus tribunes i thank you and this suit i make
that you create our emperor's eldest son
lord saturnine whose virtues will i hope
and ripen justice in this commonweal
then if you will elect by my advice
crown him and say 'long live our emperor'
marcus with voices and applause of every sort
patricians and plebeians we create
lord saturninus rome's great emperor
and say 'long live our emperor saturnine'
a long flourish till they come down
saturninus titus andronicus for thy favours done
i give thee thanks in part of thy deserts
and will with deeds requite thy gentleness
and for an onset titus to advance
thy name and honourable family
lavinia will i make my emperess
rome's royal mistress mistress of my heart
and in the sacred pantheon her espouse
tell me andronicus doth this motion please thee
titus it doth my worthy lord and in this match
and here in sight of rome to saturnine
king and commander of our commonweal
the wide world's emperor do i consecrate
my sword my chariot and my prisoners
presents well worthy rome's imperious lord
receive them then the tribute that i owe
mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet
saturninus thanks noble titus father of my life
how proud i am of thee and of thy gifts
the least of these unspeakable deserts
romans forget your fealty to me
titus to tamora now madam are you prisoner to an emperor
to him that for your honour and your state
will use you nobly and your followers
saturninus aside a goodly lady trust me of the hue
that i would choose were i to choose anew
clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance
though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
princely shall be thy usage every way
rest on my word and let not discontent
daunt all your hopes madam he comforts you
can make you greater than the queen of goths
lavinia you are not displeas'd with this
lavinia not i my lord sith true nobility
warrants these words in princely courtesy
saturninus thanks sweet lavinia romans let us go
ransomless here we set our prisoners free

lucius my lord you are unjust and more than so
in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son

re enter aloft the emperor
with tamora and her two sons and aaron the moor
traitor restore lavinia to the emperor
lucius dead if you will but not to be his wife
that is another's lawful promis'd love exit
saturninus no titus no the emperor needs her not
nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
i'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once
thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons
was there none else in rome to make a stale
but saturnine full well andronicus
agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
that saidst i begg'd the empire at thy hands
titus o monstrous what reproachful words are these
saturninus but go thy ways go give that changing piece
to him that flourish'd for her with his sword
a valiant son in law thou shalt enjoy
one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
titus these words are razors to my wounded heart
saturninus and therefore lovely tamora queen of goths
that like the stately phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
dost overshine the gallant'st dames of rome
if thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice
behold i choose thee tamora for my bride
and will create thee emperess of rome
speak queen of goths dost thou applaud my choice
and here i swear by all the roman gods
and tapers burn so bright and everything
in readiness for hymenaeus stand
i will not re salute the streets of rome
or climb my palace till from forth this place
i lead espous'd my bride along with me
tamora and here in sight of heaven to rome i swear
if saturnine advance the queen of goths
she will a handmaid be to his desires
a loving nurse a mother to his youth
your noble emperor and his lovely bride
sent by the heavens for prince saturnine
whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered
there shall we consummate our spousal rites
exeunt all but titus
titus i am not bid to wait upon this bride
titus when wert thou wont to walk alone
dishonoured thus and challenged of wrongs
re enter marcus
marcus o titus see o see what thou hast done
in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son
titus no foolish tribune no no son of mine
nor thou nor these confederates in the deed
that hath dishonoured all our family
unworthy brother and unworthy sons
lucius but let us give him burial as becomes
give mutius burial with our bretheren
titus traitors away he rests not in this tomb
which i have sumptuously re edified
here none but soldiers and rome's servitors
repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
bury him where you can he comes not here
marcus my lord this is impiety in you
my nephew mutius' deeds do plead for him
he must be buried with his bretheren
quintus martius and shall or him we will accompany
titus 'and shall' what villain was it spake that word
titus what would you bury him in my despite
marcus no noble titus but entreat of thee
to pardon mutius and to bury him
titus marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
and with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
my foes i do repute you every one
so trouble me no more but get you gone
martius he is not with himself let us withdraw
quintus not i till mutius' bones be buried
marcus brother for in that name doth nature plead
quintus father and in that name doth nature speak
titus speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
marcus renowned titus more than half my soul
lucius dear father soul and substance of us all
marcus suffer thy brother marcus to inter
his noble nephew here in virtue's nest
that died in honour and lavinia's cause
thou art a roman be not barbarous
that slew himself and wise laertes' son
did graciously plead for his funerals
let not young mutius then that was thy joy
be barr'd his entrance here
titus rise marcus rise
the dismalst day is this that e'er i saw
to be dishonoured by my sons in rome
well bury him and bury me the next
they put mutius in the tomb
till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb
all kneeling no man shed tears for noble mutius
he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause
marcus my lord to step out of these dreary dumps
how comes it that the subtle queen of goths
is of a sudden thus advanc'd in rome
titus i know not marcus but i know it is
whether by device or no the heavens can tell
is she not then beholding to the man
marcus yes and will nobly him remunerate
flourish re enter the emperor tamora
and her two sons with the moor at one door
at the other door bassianus and lavinia with others
saturninus so bassianus you have play'd your prize
god give you joy sir of your gallant bride
bassianus and you of yours my lord i say no more
nor wish no less and so i take my leave
saturninus traitor if rome have law or we have power
bassianus rape call you it my lord to seize my own
my true betrothed love and now my wife
but let the laws of rome determine all
meanwhile am i possess'd of that is mine
saturninus 'tis good sir you are very short with us
but if we live we'll be as sharp with you
bassianus my lord what i have done as best i may
answer i must and shall do with my life
only thus much i give your grace to know
this noble gentleman lord titus here
is in opinion and in honour wrong'd
that in the rescue of lavinia
with his own hand did slay his youngest son
in zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath
to be controlld in that he frankly gave
receive him then to favour saturnine
that hath express'd himself in all his deeds
a father and a friend to thee and rome
'tis thou and those that have dishonoured me
rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
how i have lov'd and honoured saturnine
tamora my worthy lord if ever tamora
were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
then hear me speak indifferently for all
and at my suit sweet pardon what is past
saturninus what madam be dishonoured openly
and basely put it up without revenge
i should be author to dishonour you
but on mine honour dare i undertake
for good lord titus' innocence in all
whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
then at my suit look graciously on him
lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart
aside to saturninus my lord be ruld by me
be won at last
you are but newly planted in your throne
lest then the people and patricians too
upon a just survey take titus' part
and so supplant you for ingratitude
which rome reputes to be a heinous sin
yield at entreats and then let me alone
i'll find a day to massacre them all
and raze their faction and their family
the cruel father and his traitorous sons
and make them know what 'tis to let a queen
kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain
come come sweet emperor come andronicus
take up this good old man and cheer the heart
that dies in tempest of thy angry frown
saturninus rise titus rise my empress hath prevaild
titus i thank your majesty and her my lord
these words these looks infuse new life in me
tamora titus i am incorporate in rome
and must advise the emperor for his good
this day all quarrels die andronicus
and let it be mine honour good my lord
that i have reconcild your friends and you
for you prince bassianus i have pass'd
my word and promise to the emperor
that you will be more mild and tractable
and fear not lords and you lavinia
by my advice all humbled on your knees
lucius we do and vow to heaven and to his highness
that what we did was mildly as we might
tend'ring our sister's honour and our own
marcus that on mine honour here do i protest
saturninus away and talk not trouble us no more
tamora nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends

saturninus be it so titus and gramercy too
exeunt sound trumpets
act ii scene i
rome before the palace
enter aaron
aaron now climbeth tamora olympus' top
safe out of fortune's shot and sits aloft
secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash
as when the golden sun salutes the morn
and having gilt the ocean with his beams
gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
and overlooks the highest peering hills
so tamora
upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
hast prisoner held fett'red in amorous chains
and faster bound to aarons charming eyes
than is prometheus tied to caucasus
away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
to wait upon this new made emperess
to wait said i to wanton with this queen
this goddess this semiramis this nymph
this siren that will charm rome's saturnine
hullo what storm is this
enter chiron and demetrius braving
demetrius chiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge
and manners to intrude where i am grac'd
and may for aught thou knowest affected be
chiron demetrius thou dost over ween in all
and so in this to bear me down with braves
'tis not the difference of a year or two
makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
to serve and to deserve my mistress' grace
and that my sword upon thee shall approve
and plead my passions for lavinia's love
aaron aside clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the
empty
demetrius why boy although our mother unadvis'd
gave you a dancing rapier by your side
are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
go to have your lath glued within your sheath
chiron meanwhile sir with the little skill i have
full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare
demetrius ay boy grow ye so brave they draw
aaron coming forward why how now lords
so near the emperor's palace dare ye draw
and maintain such a quarrel openly
full well i wot the ground of all this grudge
i would not for a million of gold
the cause were known to them it most concerns
be so dishonoured in the court of rome
for shame put up
demetrius not i till i have sheath'd
my rapier in his bosom and withal
thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
that he hath breath'd in my dishonour here
chiron for that i am prepar'd and full resolv'd
foul spoken coward that thund'rest with thy tongue
and with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform
now by the gods that warlike goths adore
this pretty brabble will undo us all
why lords and think you not how dangerous
it is to jet upon a prince's right
what is lavinia then become so loose
or bassianus so degenerate
that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
without controlment justice or revenge
young lords beware an should the empress know
chiron i care not i knew she and all the world
i love lavinia more than all the world
demetrius youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
lavina is thine elder brother's hope
aaron why are ye mad or know ye not in rome
how furious and impatient they be
and cannot brook competitors in love
i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
by this device
would i propose to achieve her whom i love
aaron to achieve her how
demetrius why mak'st thou it so strange
she is a woman therefore may be woo'd
she is a woman therefore may be won
she is lavinia therefore must be lov'd
what man more water glideth by the mill
than wots the miller of and easy it is
of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
better than he have worn vulcans badge
aaron aside ay and as good as saturninus may
demetrius then why should he despair that knows to court it
with words fair looks and liberality
what hast not thou full often struck a doe
and borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose
aaron why then it seems some certain snatch or so
would serve your turns
chiron ay so the turn were served
aaron would you had hit it too
then should not we be tir'd with this ado
why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
to square for this would it offend you then
that both should speed
chiron faith not me
demetrius nor me so i were one
aaron for shame be friends and join for that you jar
'tis policy and stratagem must do
that what you cannot as you would achieve
you must perforce accomplish as you may
take this of me lucrece was not more chaste
than this lavinia bassianus' love
a speedier course than ling'ring languishment
must we pursue and i have found the path
my lords a solemn hunting is in hand
there will the lovely roman ladies troop
the forest walks are wide and spacious
fitted by kind for rape and villainy
single you thither then this dainty doe
and strike her home by force if not by words
this way or not at all stand you in hope
come come our empress with her sacred wit
to villainy and vengeance consecrate
will we acquaint with all what we intend
and she shall file our engines with advice
that will not suffer you to square yourselves
the emperor's court is like the house of fame
the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns
there serve your lust shadowed from heavens eye
and revel in lavinia's treasury
chiron thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
demetrius sit fas aut nefas till i find the stream
to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
scene ii
a forest near rome
enter titus andronicus and his three sons lucius quintus martius
making a noise with hounds and horns and marcus
titus the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
the fields are fragrant and the woods are green
uncouple here and let us make a bay
and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal
sons let it be your charge as it is ours
to attend the emperor's person carefully
i have been troubled in my sleep this night
but dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd
here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal
then enter saturninus tamora bassianus lavinia
chiron demetrius and their attendants
many good morrows to your majesty
madam to you as many and as good
saturninus and you have rung it lustily my lords
somewhat too early for new married ladies
bassianus lavinia how say you
lavinia i say no
i have been broad awake two hours and more
saturninus come on then horse and chariots let us have
and to our sport to tamora madam now shall ye see
our roman hunting
marcus i have dogs my lord
and climb the highest promontory top
titus and i have horse will follow where the game
makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain
demetrius chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground exeunt
scene iii
a lonely part of the forest
enter aaron alone with a bag of gold
aaron he that had wit would think that i had none
and never after to inherit it
let him that thinks of me so abjectly
know that this gold must coin a stratagem
which cunningly effected will beget
a very excellent piece of villainy
and so repose sweet gold for their unrest
hides the gold
that have their alms out of the empress' chest
enter tamora alone to the moor
when everything does make a gleeful boast
the birds chant melody on every bush
the snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun
the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
and make a chequer'd shadow on the ground
under their sweet shade aaron let us sit
and while the babbling echo mocks the hounds
replying shrilly to the well tund horns
as if a double hunt were heard at once
and after conflict such as was suppos'd
the wand'ring prince and dido once enjoyed
when with a happy storm they were surpris'd
and curtaind with a counsel keeping cave
we may each wreathed in the other's arms
our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
be unto us as is a nurse's song
of lullaby to bring her babe asleep
saturn is dominator over mine
what signifies my deadly standing eye
my silence and my cloudy melancholy
my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
even as an adder when she doth unroll
to do some fatal execution
no madam these are no venereal signs
vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
blood and revenge are hammering in my head
which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
this is the day of doom for bassianus
his philomel must lose her tongue to day
thy sons make pillage of her chastity
and wash their hands in bassianus' blood
seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee
and give the king this fatal plotted scroll
now question me no more we are espied
here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
enter bassianus and lavinia
tamora ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life
aaron no more great empress bassianus comes
be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be exit
bassianus who have we here rome's royal emperess
unfurnish'd of her well beseeming troop
or is it dian habited like her
who hath abandoned her holy groves
tamora saucy controller of my private steps
had i the pow'r that some say dian had
thy temples should be planted presently
with horns as was actaeons and the hounds
should drive upon thy new transformed limbs
unmannerly intruder as thou art
lavinia under your patience gentle emperess
'tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
and to be doubted that your moor and you
jove shield your husband from his hounds to day
'tis pity they should take him for a stag
bassianus believe me queen your swarth cimmerian
doth make your honour of his body's hue
spotted detested and abominable
why are you sequest'red from all your train
dismounted from your snow white goodly steed
and wand'red hither to an obscure plot
accompanied but with a barbarous moor
lavinia and being intercepted in your sport
great reason that my noble lord be rated
for sauciness i pray you let us hence
and let her joy her raven coloured love
this valley fits the purpose passing well
bassianus the king my brother shall have notice of this
lavinia ay for these slips have made him noted long
good king to be so mightily abused
tamora why i have patience to endure all this
demetrius how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
why doth your highness look so pale and wan
tamora have i not reason think you to look pale
these two have 'ticed me hither to this place
a barren detested vale you see it is
the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe
here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
they told me here at dead time of the night
a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
would make such fearful and confused cries
as any mortal body hearing it
should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
no sooner had they told this hellish tale
but straight they told me they would bind me here
unto the body of a dismal yew
and then they calld me foul adulteress
lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms
that ever ear did hear to such effect
and had you not by wondrous fortune come
this vengeance on me had they executed
revenge it as you love your mother's life
or be ye not henceforth calld my children
demetrius this is a witness that i am thy son
stabs bassianus
also stabs
lavinia ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora
for no name fits thy nature but thy own
tamora give me the poniard you shall know my boys
your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong
demetrius stay madam here is more belongs to her
first thrash the corn then after burn the straw
this minion stood upon her chastity
upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
and shall she carry this unto her grave
chiron an if she do i would i were an eunuch
drag hence her husband to some secret hole
and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
tamora but when ye have the honey we desire
let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
chiron i warrant you madam we will make that sure
come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
that nice preserved honesty of yours
tamora i will not hear her speak away with her
lavinia sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
demetrius listen fair madam let it be your glory
to see her tears but be your heart to them
as unrelenting flint to drops of rain
lavinia when did the tiger's young ones teach the dam
o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble
even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
to chiron do thou entreat her show a womans pity
chiron what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
lavinia 'tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
yet have i heard o could i find it now
the lion mov'd with pity did endure
to have his princely paws par'd all away
some say that ravens foster forlorn children
the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
o be to me though thy hard heart say no
tamora i know not what it means away with her
lavinia o let me teach thee for my father's sake
that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
tamora hadst thou in person ne'er offended me
even for his sake am i pitiless
remember boys i pour'd forth tears in vain
to save your brother from the sacrifice
but fierce andronicus would not relent
the worse to her the better lov'd of me
lavinia o tamora be calld a gentle queen
and with thine own hands kill me in this place
for 'tis not life that i have begg'd so long
poor i was slain when bassianus died
tamora what beg'st thou then fond woman let me go
lavinia 'tis present death i beg and one thing more
that womanhood denies my tongue to tell
o keep me from their worse than killing lust
where never mans eye may behold my body
do this and be a charitable murderer
tamora so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee
no let them satisfy their lust on thee
demetrius away for thou hast stay'd us here too long
lavinia no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature
the blot and enemy to our general name
confusion fall
chiron nay then i'll stop your mouth bring thou her husband
demetrius throws the body
of bassianus into the pit then exeunt
demetrius and chiron dragging off lavinia
tamora farewell my sons see that you make her sure
ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
till all the andronici be made away
now will i hence to seek my lovely moor
and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower exit
re enter aaron with two
aaron come on my lords the better foot before
straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit
where i espied the panther fast asleep
quintus my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes
martius and mine i promise you were it not for shame
well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile
falls into the pit
quintus what art thou fallen what subtle hole is this
whose mouth is covered with rude growing briers
as fresh as morning dew distilld on flowers
a very fatal place it seems to me
speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
martius o brother with the dismalst object hurt
that ever eye with sight made heart lament
aaron aside now will i fetch the king to find them here
that he thereby may have a likely guess
how these were they that made away his brother exit
martius why dost not comfort me and help me out
quintus i am surprised with an uncouth fear
a chilling sweat o'er runs my trembling joints
my heart suspects more than mine eye can see
martius to prove thou hast a true divining heart
aaron and thou look down into this den
and see a fearful sight of blood and death
quintus aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
will not permit mine eyes once to behold
the thing whereat it trembles by surmise
was i a child to fear i know not what
martius lord bassianus lies beray'd in blood
all on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb
in this detested dark blood drinking pit
quintus if it be dark how dost thou know 'tis he
martius upon his bloody finger he doth wear
a precious ring that lightens all this hole
which like a taper in some monument
doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks
so pale did shine the moon on pyramus
when he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood
o brother help me with thy fainting hand
if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
out of this fell devouring receptacle
as hateful as cocytus' misty mouth
quintus reach me thy hand that i may help thee out
or wanting strength to do thee so much good
i may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
martius nor i no strength to climb without thy help
quintus thy hand once more i will not loose again
till thou art here aloft or i below
thou canst not come to me i come to thee falls in
enter the emperor and aaron the moor
saturninus along with me i'll see what hole is here
and what he is that now is leapt into it
say who art thou that lately didst descend
martius the unhappy sons of old andronicus
brought hither in a most unlucky hour
to find thy brother bassianus dead
saturninus my brother dead i know thou dost but jest
he and his lady both are at the lodge
upon the north side of this pleasant chase
'tis not an hour since i left them there
martius we know not where you left them all alive
but out alas here have we found him dead
attendants titus andronicus and lucius
tamora where is my lord the king
saturninus here tamora though griev'd with killing grief
tamora where is thy brother bassianus
saturninus now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
poor bassianus here lies murdered
tamora then all too late i bring this fatal writ
the complot of this timeless tragedy
and wonder greatly that mans face can fold
she giveth saturnine a letter
saturninus reads 'an if we miss to meet him handsomely
sweet huntsman bassianus 'tis we mean
do thou so much as dig the grave for him
thou know'st our meaning look for thy reward
among the nettles at the elder tree
which overshades the mouth of that same pit
where we decreed to bury bassianus
do this and purchase us thy lasting friends'
this is the pit and this the elder tree
look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
that should have murdered bassianus here
aaron my gracious lord here is the bag of gold
saturninus to titus two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody
empty
have here bereft my brother of his life
sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
there let them bide until we have devis'd
tamora what are they in this pit o wondrous thing
how easily murder is discovered
titus high emperor upon my feeble knee
i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
that this fell fault of my accursed sons
accursed if the fault be prov'd in them
saturninus if it be prov'd you see it is apparent
who found this letter tamora was it you
tamora andronicus himself did take it up
for by my fathers' reverend tomb i vow
they shall be ready at your highness' will
to answer their suspicion with their lives
saturninus thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
some bring the murdered body some the murderers
let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
for by my soul were there worse end than death
that end upon them should be executed
tamora andronicus i will entreat the king
titus come lucius come stay not to talk with them exeunt
scene iv
another part of the forest
enter the empress' sons demetrius and chiron with lavinia
her hands cut off and her tongue cut out and ravish'd
demetrius so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee
chiron write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
chiron go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
demetrius she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
and so let's leave her to her silent walks
chiron an 'twere my cause i should go hang myself
demetrius if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
exeunt demetrius and chiron
wind horns enter marcus from hunting
marcus who is this my niece that flies away so fast
cousin a word where is your husband
if i do wake some planet strike me down
that i may slumber an eternal sleep
speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
hath lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
of her two branches those sweet ornaments
whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
and might not gain so great a happiness
as half thy love why dost not speak to me
alas a crimson river of warm blood
doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
coming and going with thy honey breath
but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee
and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame
and notwithstanding all this loss of blood
as from a conduit with three issuing spouts
yet do thy cheeks look red as titans face
blushing to be encount'red with a cloud
o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast
that i might rail at him to ease my mind
sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd
doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
fair philomel why she but lost her tongue
and in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind
but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met
and he hath cut those pretty fingers off
o had the monster seen those lily hands
tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
and make the silken strings delight to kiss them
he would not then have touch'd them for his life
or had he heard the heavenly harmony
which that sweet tongue hath made
he would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep
as cerberus at the thracian poet's feet
come let us go and make thy father blind
one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads
what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes
do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
o could our mourning case thy misery exeunt
act iii scene i
rome a street
enter the judges tribunes and senators with titus' two sons
martius and quintus bound passing on the stage to the place of execution
and titus going before pleading
for pity of mine age whose youth was spent
in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed
for all the frosty nights that i have watch'd
and for these bitter tears which now you see
filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
be pitiful to my condemned sons
whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought
for two and twenty sons i never wept
andronicus lieth down and the judges
pass by him with the prisoners and exeunt
for these tribunes in the dust i write
my heart's deep languor and my souls sad tears
let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite
my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush
o earth i will befriend thee more with rain
that shall distil from these two ancient urns
than youthful april shall with all his show'rs
in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow
and keep eternal spring time on thy face
so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood
enter lucius with his weapon drawn
o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men
unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
and let me say that never wept before
my tears are now prevailing orators
lucius o noble father you lament in vain
and you recount your sorrows to a stone
titus ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead
grave tribunes once more i entreat of you
lucius my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
titus why 'tis no matter man if they did hear
they would not mark me if they did mark
they would not pity me yet plead i must
and bootless unto them
therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones
yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
for that they will not intercept my tale
when i do weep they humbly at my feet
receive my tears and seem to weep with me
and were they but attired in grave weeds
rome could afford no tribunes like to these
a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
a stone is silent and offendeth not
and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn
lucius to rescue my two brothers from their death
for which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
my everlasting doom of banishment
titus o happy man they have befriended thee
why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive
that rome is but a wilderness of tigers
tigers must prey and rome affords no prey
but me and mine how happy art thou then
but who comes with our brother marcus here
enter marcus with lavinia
marcus titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
or if not so thy noble heart to break
i bring consuming sorrow to thine age
titus will it consume me let me see it then
marcus this was thy daughter
titus why marcus so she is
lucius ay me this object kills me
speak lavinia what accursed hand
hath made thee handless in thy father's sight
what fool hath added water to the sea
or brought a fagot to bright burning troy
my grief was at the height before thou cam'st
and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds
give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too
for they have fought for rome and all in vain
and they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life
and they have serv'd me to effectless use
now all the service i require of them
is that the one will help to cut the other
'tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands
for hands to do rome service is but vain
lucius speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee
marcus o that delightful engine of her thoughts
that blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
lucius o say thou for her who hath done this deed
marcus o thus i found her straying in the park
seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
that hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound
titus it was my dear and he that wounded her
hath hurt me more than had he killd me dead
for now i stand as one upon a rock
environd with a wilderness of sea
expecting ever when some envious surge
will in his brinish bowels swallow him
this way to death my wretched sons are gone
here stands my other son a banish'd man
and here my brother weeping at my woes
but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
is dear lavinia dearer than my soul
had i but seen thy picture in this plight
it would have madded me what shall i do
thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee
thy husband he is dead and for his death
thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this
look marcus ah son lucius look on her
when i did name her brothers then fresh tears
stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew
upon a gath'red lily almost withered
marcus perchance she weeps because they killd her husband
titus if they did kill thy husband then be joyful
because the law hath ta'en revenge on them
no no they would not do so foul a deed
witness the sorrow that their sister makes
gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips
or make some sign how i may do thee ease
shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius
and thou and i sit round about some fountain
looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
with miry slime left on them by a flood
and in the fountain shall we gaze so long
till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
and made a brine pit with our bitter tears
or shall we cut away our hands like thine
or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
pass the remainder of our hateful days
what shall we do let us that have our tongues
plot some device of further misery
lucius sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
marcus patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes
titus ah marcus marcus brother well i wot
thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
for thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own
lucius ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks
titus mark marcus mark i understand her signs
had she a tongue to speak now would she say
his napkin with his true tears all bewet
can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
o what a sympathy of woe is this
as far from help as limbo is from bliss
enter aaron the moor
aaron titus andronicus my lord the emperor
sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons
let marcus lucius or thyself old titus
or any one of you chop off your hand
will send thee hither both thy sons alive
and that shall be the ransom for their fault
titus o gracious emperor o gentle aaron
did ever raven sing so like a lark
that gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise
with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand
good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
lucius stay father for that noble hand of thine
that hath thrown down so many enemies
my youth can better spare my blood than you
and therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives
marcus which of your hands hath not defended rome
and rear'd aloft the bloody battle axe
writing destruction on the enemy's castle
o none of both but are of high desert
my hand hath been but idle let it serve
to ransom my two nephews from their death
then have i kept it to a worthy end
for fear they die before their pardon come
marcus my hand shall go
lucius by heaven it shall not go
titus sirs strive no more such with'red herbs as these
are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
lucius sweet father if i shall be thought thy son
let me redeem my brothers both from death
marcus and for our father's sake and mother's care
now let me show a brother's love to thee
lucius then i'll go fetch an axe
marcus but i will use the axe
exeunt lucius and marcus
titus come hither aaron i'll deceive them both
lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine
aaron aside if that be calld deceit i will be honest
and never whilst i live deceive men so
but i'll deceive you in another sort
and that you'll say ere half an hour pass
re enter lucius and marcus
titus now stay your strife what shall be is dispatch'd
good aaron give his majesty my hand
tell him it was a hand that warded him
from thousand dangers bid him bury it
more hath it merited that let it have
as for my sons say i account of them
as jewels purchas'd at an easy price
and yet dear too because i bought mine own
look by and by to have thy sons with thee
aside their heads i mean o how this villainy
doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
let fools do good and fair men call for grace
aaron will have his soul black like his face exit
titus o here i lift this one hand up to heaven
and bow this feeble ruin to the earth
if any power pities wretched tears
to that i call to lavinia what would'st thou kneel with me
or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
when they do hug him in their melting bosoms
marcus o brother speak with possibility
and do not break into these deep extremes
titus is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
then be my passions bottomless with them
marcus but yet let reason govern thy lament
titus if there were reason for these miseries
when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow
if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
threat'ning the welkin with his big swoln face
and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
she is the weeping welkin i the earth
then must my sea be moved with her sighs
then must my earth with her continual tears
become a deluge overflow'd and drownd
but like a drunkard must i vomit them
then give me leave for losers will have leave
to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
enter a messenger with two heads and a hand
messenger worthy andronicus ill art thou repaid
for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor
here are the heads of thy two noble sons
and here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
thy grief their sports thy resolution mock'd
more than remembrance of my father's death exit
marcus now let hot aetna cool in sicily
and be my heart an ever burning hell
these miseries are more than may be borne
to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
but sorrow flouted at is double death
lucius ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
and yet detested life not shrink thereat
that ever death should let life bear his name
lavinia kisses titus
marcus alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
as frozen water to a starved snake
titus when will this fearful slumber have an end
marcus now farewell flatt'ry die andronicus
thou dost not slumber see thy two sons' heads
thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here
thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
struck pale and bloodless and thy brother i
ah now no more will i control thy griefs
rent off thy silver hair thy other hand
gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
the closing up of our most wretched eyes
now is a time to storm why art thou still
titus ha ha ha
marcus why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour
titus why i have not another tear to shed
besides this sorrow is an enemy
and make them blind with tributary tears
then which way shall i find revenge's cave
for these two heads do seem to speak to me
and threat me i shall never come to bliss
till all these mischiefs be returnd again
even in their throats that have committed them
come let me see what task i have to do
you heavy people circle me about
that i may turn me to each one of you
the vow is made come brother take a head
and in this hand the other will i bear
and lavinia thou shalt be employ'd in this
bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
as for thee boy go get thee from my sight
thou art an exile and thou must not stay
hie to the goths and raise an army there
and if ye love me as i think you do
let's kiss and part for we have much to do
lucius farewell andronicus my noble father
the woefullst man that ever liv'd in rome
farewell proud rome till lucius come again
he leaves his pledges dearer than his life
farewell lavinia my noble sister
o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives
but in oblivion and hateful griefs
if lucius live he will requite your wrongs
beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen
now will i to the goths and raise a pow'r
to be reveng'd on rome and saturnine exit
scene ii
rome titus' house
a banquet
enter titus marcus lavinia and the boy young lucius
titus so so now sit and look you eat no more
than will preserve just so much strength in us
marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot
thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands
and cannot passionate our tenfold grief
with folded arms this poor right hand of mine
is left to tyrannize upon my breast
who when my heart all mad with misery
beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
then thus i thump it down
to lavinia thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
or get some little knife between thy teeth
and just against thy heart make thou a hole
that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
may run into that sink and soaking in
drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears
marcus fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay
such violent hands upon her tender life
why marcus no man should be mad but i
what violent hands can she lay on her life
ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
how troy was burnt and he made miserable
o handle not the theme to talk of hands
lest we remember still that we have none
fie fie how franticly i square my talk
as if we should forget we had no hands
come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this
here is no drink hark marcus what she says
i can interpret all her martyr'd signs
she says she drinks no other drink but tears
brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks
speechless complainer i will learn thy thought
in thy dumb action will i be as perfect
as begging hermits in their holy prayers
thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
but i of these will wrest an alphabet
and by still practice learn to know thy meaning
boy good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments
make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
marcus alas the tender boy in passion mov'd
doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness
titus peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
and tears will quickly melt thy life away
marcus strikes the dish with a knife
marcus at that that i have killd my lord a fly
titus out on thee murderer thou killst my heart
mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny
a deed of death done on the innocent
becomes not titus' brother get thee gone
i see thou art not for my company
marcus alas my lord i have but killd a fly
titus 'but' how if that fly had a father and mother
how would he hang his slender gilded wings
poor harmless fly
that with his pretty buzzing melody
came here to make us merry and thou hast killd him
marcus pardon me sir it was a black ill favour'd fly
like to the empress' moor therefore i killd him
titus o o o
then pardon me for reprehending thee
for thou hast done a charitable deed
give me thy knife i will insult on him
come hither purposely to poison me
there's for thyself and that's for tamora
ah sirrah
yet i think we are not brought so low
but that between us we can kill a fly
that comes in likeness of a coal black moor
marcus alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
he takes false shadows for true substances
titus come take away lavinia go with me
sad stories chanced in the times of old
come boy and go with me thy sight is young
and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle exeunt
act iv scene i
rome titus' garden
enter young lucius and lavinia running after him
and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm
enter titus and marcus
boy help grandsire help my aunt lavinia
good uncle marcus see how swift she comes
alas sweet aunt i know not what you mean
marcus stand by me lucius do not fear thine aunt
titus she loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
boy ay when my father was in rome she did
marcus what means my niece lavinia by these signs
titus fear her not lucius somewhat doth she mean
see lucius see how much she makes of thee
somewhither would she have thee go with her
read to her sons than she hath read to thee
sweet poetry and tully's orator
marcus canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
boy my lord i know not i nor can i guess
unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
for i have heard my grandsire say full oft
extremity of griefs would make men mad
and i have read that hecuba of troy
ran mad for sorrow that made me to fear
loves me as dear as e'er my mother did
and would not but in fury fright my youth
which made me down to throw my books and fly
causeless perhaps but pardon me sweet aunt
and madam if my uncle marcus go
i will most willingly attend your ladyship
marcus lucius i will lavinia turns over with her
stumps the books which lucius has let fall
titus how now lavinia marcus what means this
which is it girl of these open them boy
but thou art deeper read and better skilld
come and take choice of all my library
and so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
reveal the damnd contriver of this deed
why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
marcus i think she means that there were more than one
confederate in the fact ay more there was
or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
boy grandsire 'tis ovid's metamorphoses
my mother gave it me
marcus for love of her that's gone
perhaps she culld it from among the rest
titus soft so busily she turns the leaves help her
what would she find lavinia shall i read
this is the tragic tale of philomel
and treats of tereus' treason and his rape
and rape i fear was root of thy annoy
titus lavinia wert thou thus surpris'd sweet girl
ravish'd and wrong'd as philomela was
forc'd in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods
see see
ay such a place there is where we did hunt
o had we never never hunted there
patternd by that the poet here describes
by nature made for murders and for rapes
marcus o why should nature build so foul a den
titus give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends
what roman lord it was durst do the deed
or slunk not saturnine as tarquin erst
that left the camp to sin in lucrece' bed
marcus sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
apollo pallas jove or mercury
inspire me that i may this treason find
my lord look here look here lavinia
he writes his name with his
this sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
this after me i have writ my name
without the help of any hand at all
curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift
write thou good niece and here display at last
what god will have discovered for revenge
heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
that we may know the traitors and the truth
she takes the staff in her mouth
o do ye read my lord what she hath writ
titus 'stuprum chiron demetrius'
marcus what what the lustful sons of tamora
performers of this heinous bloody deed
titus magni dominator poli
tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
marcus o calm thee gentle lord although i know
there is enough written upon this earth
to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
my lord kneel down with me lavinia kneel
and kneel sweet boy the roman hector's hope
and swear with me as with the woeful fere
and father of that chaste dishonoured dame
lord junius brutus sware for lucrece' rape
that we will prosecute by good advice
mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths
and see their blood or die with this reproach
titus 'tis sure enough an you knew how
the dam will wake and if she wind ye once
she's with the lion deeply still in league
and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
and when he sleeps will she do what she list
you are a young huntsman marcus let alone
and come i will go get a leaf of brass
and with a gad of steel will write these words
and lay it by the angry northern wind
will blow these sands like sibyls leaves abroad
boy i say my lord that if i were a man
their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
for these base bondmen to the yoke of rome
marcus ay that's my boy thy father hath full oft
for his ungrateful country done the like
boy and uncle so will i an if i live
titus come go with me into mine armoury
lucius i'll fit thee and withal my boy
shall carry from me to the empress' sons
come come thou'lt do my message wilt thou not
boy ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire
titus no boy not so i'll teach thee another course
lavinia come marcus look to my house
lucius and i'll go brave it at the court
ay marry will we sir and we'll be waited on
exeunt titus lavinia and young lucius
marcus o heavens can you hear a good man groan
and not relent or not compassion him
that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
than foemens marks upon his batt'red shield
but yet so just that he will not revenge
revenge the heavens for old andronicus exit
scene ii
rome the palace
enter aaron demetrius and chiron at one door and at the other door
young lucius and another with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them
chiron demetrius here's the son of lucius
aaron ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
boy my lords with all the humbleness i may
i greet your honours from andronicus
aside and pray the roman gods confound you both
demetrius gramercy lovely lucius what's the news
boy aside that you are both decipher'd that's the news
for villains mark'd with rape may it please you
my grandsire well advis'd hath sent by me
the goodliest weapons of his armoury
the hope of rome for so he bid me say
and so i do and with his gifts present
your lordships that whenever you have need
you may be armed and appointed well
and so i leave you both aside like bloody villains
exeunt young lucius and attendant
demetrius what's here a scroll and written round about
let's see
reads 'integer vitae scelerisque purus
chiron o 'tis a verse in horace i know it well
i read it in the grammar long ago
aaron ay just a verse in horace right you have it
aside now what a thing it is to be an ass
here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt
and sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines
that wound beyond their feeling to the quick
but were our witty empress well afoot
she would applaud andronicus' conceit
and now young lords was't not a happy star
led us to rome strangers and more than so
captives to be advanced to this height
it did me good before the palace gate
to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing
demetrius but me more good to see so great a lord
basely insinuate and send us gifts
aaron had he not reason lord demetrius
did you not use his daughter very friendly
at such a bay by turn to serve our lust
chiron a charitable wish and full of love
aaron here lacks but your mother for to say amen
chiron and that would she for twenty thousand more
demetrius come let us go and pray to all the gods
for our beloved mother in her pains
aaron aside pray to the devils the gods have given us over
trumpets sound
demetrius why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus
demetrius soft who comes here
enter nurse with a blackamoor child
nurse good morrow lords
o tell me did you see aaron the moor
aaron well more or less or ne'er a whit at all
here aaron is and what with aaron now
nurse o gentle aaron we are all undone
now help or woe betide thee evermore
aaron why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
nurse o that which i would hide from heavens eye
our empress' shame and stately rome's disgrace
she is delivered lord she is delivered
aaron to whom
nurse i mean she is brought a bed
aaron well god give her good rest what hath he sent her
nurse a devil
aaron why then she is the devils dam
a joyful issue
here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
amongst the fair fac'd breeders of our clime
the empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
and bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point
aaron zounds ye whore is black so base a hue
sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
demetrius villain what hast thou done
aaron that which thou canst not undo
chiron thou hast undone our mother
demetrius and therein hellish dog thou hast undone her
woe to her chance and damnd her loathed choice
accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend
chiron it shall not live
aaron it shall not die
nurse aaron it must the mother wills it so
aaron what must it nurse then let no man but i
do execution on my flesh and blood
demetrius i'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point
aaron sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
takes the child from the nurse and draws
stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
now by the burning tapers of the sky
that shone so brightly when this boy was got
he dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
that touches this my first born son and heir
i tell you younglings not enceladus
with all his threat'ning band of typhons brood
shall seize this prey out of his father's hands
what what ye sanguine shallow hearted boys
ye white lim'd walls ye alehouse painted signs
coal black is better than another hue
in that it scorns to bear another hue
for all the water in the ocean
can never turn the swans black legs to white
although she lave them hourly in the flood
tell the empress from me i am of age
demetrius wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
aaron my mistress is my mistress this my self
the vigour and the picture of my youth
this before all the world do i prefer
this maugre all the world will i keep safe
or some of you shall smoke for it in rome
demetrius by this our mother is for ever sham'd
chiron rome will despise her for this foul escape
nurse the emperor in his rage will doom her death
aaron why there's the privilege your beauty bears
fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
the close enacts and counsels of thy heart
here's a young lad fram'd of another leer
look how the black slave smiles upon the father
as who should say 'old lad i am thine own'
he is your brother lords sensibly fed
of that self blood that first gave life to you
and from your womb where you imprisoned were
nay he is your brother by the surer side
although my seal be stamped in his face
nurse aaron what shall i say unto the empress
demetrius advise thee aaron what is to be done
and we will all subscribe to thy advice
save thou the child so we may all be safe
aaron then sit we down and let us all consult
my son and i will have the wind of you
keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
demetrius how many women saw this child of his
aaron why so brave lords when we join in league
i am a lamb but if you brave the moor
the chafed boar the mountain lioness
the ocean swells not so as aaron storms
but say again how many saw the child
nurse cornelia the midwife and myself
and no one else but the delivered empress
aaron the emperess the midwife and yourself
go to the empress tell her this i said he kills her
weeke weeke
so cries a pig prepared to the spit
demetrius what meanst thou aaron wherefore didst thou this
aaron o lord sir 'tis a deed of policy
shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
a long tongu'd babbling gossip no lords no
and now be it known to you my full intent
not far one muliteus my countryman
his child is like to her fair as you are
go pack with him and give the mother gold
and tell them both the circumstance of all
and how by this their child shall be advanc'd
and be received for the emperor's heir
and substituted in the place of mine
to calm this tempest whirling in the court
and let the emperor dandle him for his own
hark ye lords you see i have given her physic
and you must needs bestow her funeral
the fields are near and you are gallant grooms
this done see that you take no longer days
but send the midwife presently to me
the midwife and the nurse well made away
then let the ladies tattle what they please
chiron aaron i see thou wilt not trust the air
with secrets
demetrius for this care of tamora
exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the dead nurse
aaron now to the goths as swift as swallow flies
there to dispose this treasure in mine arms
and secretly to greet the empress' friends
come on you thick lipp'd slave i'll bear you hence
for it is you that puts us to our shifts
i'll make you feed on berries and on roots
and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
and cabin in a cave and bring you up
exit with the child
scene iii
rome a public place
enter titus bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them
with him marcus young lucius and other gentlemen
publius sempronius and caius with bows
titus come marcus come kinsmen this is the way
sir boy let me see your archery
look ye draw home enough and 'tis there straight
be you rememb'red marcus she's gone she's fled
sirs take you to your tools you cousins shall
go sound the ocean and cast your nets
happily you may catch her in the sea
yet there's as little justice as at land
no publius and sempronius you must do it
'tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
and pierce the inmost centre of the earth
then when you come to pluto's region
tell him it is for justice and for aid
and that it comes from old andronicus
shaken with sorrows in ungrateful rome
ah rome well well i made thee miserable
what time i threw the people's suffrages
on him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me
go get you gone and pray be careful all
and leave you not a man of war unsearch'd
this wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence
marcus o publius is not this a heavy case
to see thy noble uncle thus distract
publius therefore my lords it highly us concerns
by day and night t' attend him carefully
and feed his humour kindly as we may
till time beget some careful remedy
marcus kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
join with the goths and with revengeful war
take wreak on rome for this ingratitude
titus publius how now how now my masters
what have you met with her
publius no my good lord but pluto sends you word
if you will have revenge from hell you shall
marry for justice she is so employ'd
he thinks with jove in heaven or somewhere else
so that perforce you must needs stay a time
titus he doth me wrong to feed me with delays
i'll dive into the burning lake below
marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
no big bond men fram'd of the cyclops' size
but metal marcus steel to the very back
yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear
and sith there's no justice in earth nor hell
we will solicit heaven and move the gods
to send down justice for to wreak our wrongs
come to this gear you are a good archer marcus
he gives them the arrows
'ad martem' that's for myself
here boy 'to pallas' here 'to mercury'
'to saturn' caius not to saturnine
you were as good to shoot against the wind
to it boy marcus loose when i bid
of my word i have written to effect
there's not a god left unsolicited
marcus kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court
we will afflict the emperor in his pride
good boy in virgo's lap give it pallas
marcus my lord i aim a mile beyond the moon
your letter is with jupiter by this
titus ha ha
publius publius hast thou done
see see thou hast shot off one of taurus' horns
marcus this was the sport my lord when publius shot
the bull being galld gave aries such a knock
that down fell both the ram's horns in the court
she laugh'd and told the moor he should not choose
but give them to his master for a present
titus why there it goes god give his lordship joy
enter the clown with a basket and two pigeons in it
news news from heaven marcus the post is come
sirrah what tidings have you any letters
shall i have justice what says jupiter
clown ho the gibbet maker he says that he hath taken them down
again for the man must not be hang'd till the next week
clown alas sir i know not jupiter i never drank with him in all
my life
titus why villain art not thou the carrier
clown ay of my pigeons sir nothing else
titus why didst thou not come from heaven
clown from heaven alas sir i never came there god forbid i
should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days why i am
going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs to take up a matter
of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperals men
oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you
titus tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a
empty
clown nay truly sir i could never say grace in all my life
titus sirrah come hither make no more ado
but give your pigeons to the emperor
by me thou shalt have justice at his hands
hold hold meanwhile here's money for thy charges
give me pen and ink sirrah can you with a grace deliver up a
clown ay sir
titus then here is a supplication for you and when you come to
him at the first approach you must kneel then kiss his foot
then deliver up your pigeons and then look for your reward i'll
be at hand sir see you do it bravely
clown i warrant you sir let me alone
titus sirrah hast thou a knife come let me see it
here marcus fold it in the oration
for thou hast made it like a humble suppliant
knock at my door and tell me what he says
clown god be with you sir i will
titus come marcus let us go publius follow me exeunt
scene iv
rome before the palace
enter the emperor and the empress and her two sons demetrius and chiron
lords and others the emperor brings the arrows in his hand that titus
shot at him
saturninus why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen
troubled confronted thus and for the extent
of egal justice us'd in such contempt
my lords you know as know the mightful gods
however these disturbers of our peace
buzz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd
but even with law against the wilful sons
of old andronicus and what an if
his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits
shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
and now he writes to heaven for his redress
see here's 'to jove' and this 'to mercury'
this 'to apollo' this 'to the god of war'
sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome
what's this but libelling against the senate
and blazoning our unjustice every where
a goodly humour is it not my lords
as who would say in rome no justice were
but if i live his feigned ecstasies
but he and his shall know that justice lives
in saturninus' health whom if she sleep
he'll so awake as he in fury shall
cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives
tamora my gracious lord my lovely saturnine
lord of my life commander of my thoughts
calm thee and bear the faults of titus' age
th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart
than prosecute the meanest or the best
for these contempts aside why thus it shall become
high witted tamora to gloze with all
but titus i have touch'd thee to the quick
thy life blood out if aaron now be wise
then is all safe the anchor in the port
enter clown
how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
clown yes forsooth an your mistriship be emperial
clown 'tis he god and saint stephen give you godden i have
brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
saturninus reads the letter
saturninus go take him away and hang him presently
clown how much money must i have
tamora come sirrah you must be hang'd
clown hang'd by'r lady then i have brought up a neck to a fair
end exit guarded
saturninus despiteful and intolerable wrongs
i know from whence this same device proceeds
may this be borne as if his traitorous sons
that died by law for murder of our brother
have by my means been butchered wrongfully
go drag the villain hither by the hair
nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
for this proud mock i'll be thy slaughterman
sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great
in hope thyself should govern rome and me
what news with thee aemilius
aemilius arm my lords rome never had more cause
the goths have gathered head and with a power
of high resolved men bent to the spoil
they hither march amain under conduct
of lucius son to old andronicus
who threats in course of this revenge to do
as much as ever coriolanus did
saturninus is warlike lucius general of the goths
as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
ay now begins our sorrows to approach
'tis he the common people love so much
myself hath often heard them say
when i have walked like a private man
that lucius' banishment was wrongfully
and they have wish'd that lucius were their emperor
tamora why should you fear is not your city strong
saturninus ay but the citizens favour lucius
tamora king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it
the eagle suffers little birds to sing
and is not careful what they mean thereby
knowing that with the shadow of his wings
he can at pleasure stint their melody
even so mayest thou the giddy men of rome
then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
i will enchant the old andronicus
than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep
when as the one is wounded with the bait
the other rotted with delicious feed
saturninus but he will not entreat his son for us
tamora if tamora entreat him then he will
for i can smooth and fill his aged ears
with golden promises that were his heart
almost impregnable his old ears deaf
yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
say that the emperor requests a parley
of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting
even at his father's house the old andronicus
saturninus aemilius do this message honourably
and if he stand on hostage for his safety
bid him demand what pledge will please him best
aemilius your bidding shall i do effectually exit
tamora now will i to that old andronicus
and temper him with all the art i have
and now sweet emperor be blithe again
and bury all thy fear in my devices
saturninus then go successantly and plead to him
empty
act v scene i
plains near rome
enter lucius with an army of goths with drums and colours
lucius approved warriors and my faithful friends
i have received letters from great rome
and how desirous of our sight they are
therefore great lords be as your titles witness
imperious and impatient of your wrongs
and wherein rome hath done you any scath
let him make treble satisfaction
first goth brave slip sprung from the great andronicus
whose name was once our terror now our comfort
whose high exploits and honourable deeds
ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt
like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
led by their master to the flow'red fields
and be aveng'd on cursed tamora
all the goths and as he saith so say we all with him
lucius i humbly thank him and i thank you all
but who comes here led by a lusty goth
enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms
second goth renowned lucius from our troops i stray'd
to gaze upon a ruinous monastery
upon the wasted building suddenly
i heard a child cry underneath a wall
i made unto the noise when soon i heard
the crying babe controlld with this discourse
'peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
had nature lent thee but thy mother's look
villain thou mightst have been an emperor
but where the bull and cow are both milk white
peace villain peace' even thus he rates the babe
'for i must bear thee to a trusty goth
who when he knows thou art the empress' babe
will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake'
with this my weapon drawn i rush'd upon him
surpris'd him suddenly and brought him hither
to use as you think needful of the man
lucius o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil
that robb'd andronicus of his good hand
and here's the base fruit of her burning lust
say wall ey'd slave whither wouldst thou convey
this growing image of thy fiend like face
why dost not speak what deaf not a word
a halter soldiers hang him on this tree
and by his side his fruit of bastardy
aaron touch not the boy he is of royal blood
lucius too like the sire for ever being good
first hang the child that he may see it sprawl
get me a ladder
a ladder brought which aaron is made to climb
aaron lucius save the child
and bear it from me to the emperess
if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things
that highly may advantage thee to hear
if thou wilt not befall what may befall
i'll speak no more but 'vengeance rot you all'
lucius say on an if it please me which thou speak'st
aaron an if it please thee why assure thee lucius
'twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak
for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres
acts of black night abominable deeds
complots of mischief treason villainies
ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd
and this shall all be buried in my death
unless thou swear to me my child shall live
lucius tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live
lucius who should i swear by thou believest no god
that granted how canst thou believe an oath
aaron what if i do not as indeed i do not
yet for i know thou art religious
and hast a thing within thee called conscience
with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
which i have seen thee careful to observe
therefore i urge thy oath for that i know
an idiot holds his bauble for a god
to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow
by that same god what god soe'er it be
that thou adorest and hast in reverence
to save my boy to nourish and bring him up
or else i will discover nought to thee
lucius even by my god i swear to thee i will
aaron first know thou i begot him on the empress
lucius o most insatiate and luxurious woman
aaron tut lucius this was but a deed of charity
'twas her two sons that murdered bassianus
they cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
and cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou sawest
lucius o detestable villain callst thou that trimming
aaron why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and 'twas
trim sport for them which had the doing of it
lucius o barbarous beastly villains like thyself
aaron indeed i was their tutor to instruct them
that codding spirit had they from their mother
that bloody mind i think they learnd of me
as true a dog as ever fought at head
well let my deeds be witness of my worth
i traind thy brethren to that guileful hole
where the dead corpse of bassianus lay
i wrote the letter that thy father found
and hid the gold within that letter mentiond
confederate with the queen and her two sons
and what not done that thou hast cause to rue
i play'd the cheater for thy father's hand
and when i had it drew myself apart
and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
i pried me through the crevice of a wall
when for his hand he had his two sons' heads
beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily
that both mine eyes were rainy like to his
and when i told the empress of this sport
she swooned almost at my pleasing tale
goth what canst thou say all this and never blush
aaron ay like a black dog as the saying is
lucius art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
aaron ay that i had not done a thousand more
even now i curse the day and yet i think
few come within the compass of my curse
wherein i did not some notorious ill
as kill a man or else devise his death
ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
set deadly enmity between two friends
make poor mens cattle break their necks
set fire on barns and hay stacks in the night
and bid the owners quench them with their tears
oft have i digg'd up dead men from their graves
and set them upright at their dear friends' door
even when their sorrows almost was forgot
and on their skins as on the bark of trees
have with my knife carved in roman letters
tut i have done a thousand dreadful things
as willingly as one would kill a fly
and nothing grieves me heartily indeed
but that i cannot do ten thousand more
lucius bring down the devil for he must not die
so sweet a death as hanging presently
aaron if there be devils would i were a devil
to live and burn in everlasting fire
so i might have your company in hell
lucius sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
enter aemilius
goth my lord there is a messenger from rome
desires to be admitted to your presence
lucius let him come near
welcome aemilius what's the news from rome
aemilius lord lucius and you princes of the goths
the roman emperor greets you all by me
and for he understands you are in arms
willing you to demand your hostages
and they shall be immediately deliver'd
first goth what says our general
lucius aemilius let the emperor give his pledges
unto my father and my uncle marcus
and we will come march away exeunt
scene ii
rome before titus' house
enter tamora and her two sons demetrius and chiron disguised
i will encounter with andronicus
and say i am revenge sent from below
to join with him and right his heinous wrongs
knock at his study where they say he keeps
to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
tell him revenge is come to join with him
and work confusion on his enemies
they knock and titus opens his study door above
titus who doth molest my contemplation
that so my sad decrees may fly away
and all my study be to no effect
you are deceiv'd for what i mean to do
see here in bloody lines i have set down
and what is written shall be executed
tamora titus i am come to talk with thee
titus no not a word how can i grace my talk
wanting a hand to give it that accord
thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
titus i am not mad i know thee well enough
witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
witness these trenches made by grief and care
witness the tiring day and heavy night
witness all sorrow that i know thee well
for our proud empress mighty tamora
is not thy coming for my other hand
tamora know thou sad man i am not tamora
she is thy enemy and i thy friend
to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
come down and welcome me to this world's light
confer with me of murder and of death
there's not a hollow cave or lurking place
no vast obscurity or misty vale
where bloody murder or detested rape
can couch for fear but i will find them out
and in their ears tell them my dreadful name
titus art thou revenge and art thou sent to me
to be a torment to mine enemies
tamora i am therefore come down and welcome me
titus do me some service ere i come to thee
lo by thy side where rape and murder stands
now give some surance that thou art revenge
stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels
and then i'll come and be thy waggoner
and whirl along with thee about the globes
to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
and find out murderers in their guilty caves
and when thy car is loaden with their heads
i will dismount and by thy waggon wheel
trot like a servile footman all day long
even from hyperions rising in the east
until his very downfall in the sea
and day by day i'll do this heavy task
so thou destroy rapine and murder there
titus are they thy ministers what are they calld
tamora rape and murder therefore called so
'cause they take vengeance of such kind of men
titus good lord how like the empress' sons they are
and you the empress but we worldly men
have miserable mad mistaking eyes
o sweet revenge now do i come to thee
and if one arm's embracement will content thee
i will embrace thee in it by and by
whate'er i forge to feed his brain sick humours
do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
for now he firmly takes me for revenge
and being credulous in this mad thought
i'll make him send for lucius his son
and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure
i'll find some cunning practice out of hand
to scatter and disperse the giddy goths
or at the least make them his enemies
enter titus below
titus long have i been forlorn and all for thee
welcome dread fury to my woeful house
rapine and murder you are welcome too
how like the empress and her sons you are
well are you fitted had you but a moor
could not all hell afford you such a devil
for well i wot the empress never wags
but in her company there is a moor
it were convenient you had such a devil
but welcome as you are what shall we do
tamora what wouldst thou have us do andronicus
demetrius show me a murderer i'll deal with him
chiron show me a villain that hath done a rape
and i am sent to be reveng'd on him
tamora show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong
and i will be revenged on them all
titus look round about the wicked streets of rome
good murder stab him he's a murderer
go thou with him and when it is thy hap
to find another that is like to thee
good rapine stab him he is a ravisher
go thou with them and in the emperor's court
there is a queen attended by a moor
well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion
for up and down she doth resemble thee
i pray thee do on them some violent death
tamora well hast thou lessond us this shall we do
but would it please thee good andronicus
to send for lucius thy thrice valiant son
who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths
and bid him come and banquet at thy house
when he is here even at thy solemn feast
i will bring in the empress and her sons
the emperor himself and all thy foes
and at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel
what says andronicus to this device
titus marcus my brother 'tis sad titus calls
enter marcus
go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius
thou shalt inquire him out among the goths
bid him repair to me and bring with him
some of the chiefest princes of the goths

this do thou for my love and so let him
as he regards his aged father's life
marcus this will i do and soon return again exit
tamora now will i hence about thy business

titus nay nay let rape and murder stay with me

o villains chiron and demetrius
here stands the spring whom you have staind with mud
this goodly summer with your winter mix'd
two of her brothers were condemnd to death
my hand cut off and made a merry jest

than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
inhuman traitors you constraind and forc'd
what would you say if i should let you speak
villains for shame you could not beg for grace
hark wretches how i mean to martyr you
this one hand yet is left to cut your throats
the basin that receives your guilty blood
you know your mother means to feast with me
and calls herself revenge and thinks me mad
hark villains i will grind your bones to dust
and with your blood and it i'll make a paste
and of the paste a coffin i will rear
and make two pasties of your shameful heads
and bid that strumpet your unhallowed dam
like to the earth swallow her own increase
and this the banquet she shall surfeit on
for worse than philomel you us'd my daughter
and worse than progne i will be reveng'd
and now prepare your throats lavinia come
receive the blood and when that they are dead
let me go grind their bones to powder small
and with this hateful liquor temper it
and in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd
come come be every one officious
more stern and bloody than the centaurs' feast
he cuts their throats
empty
now bring them in for i will play the cook
and see them ready against their mother comes
exeunt bearing the dead bodies
scene iii
the court of titus' house
enter lucius marcus and the goths with aaron prisoner
lucius uncle marcus since 'tis my father's mind
that i repair to rome i am content
first goth and ours with thine befall what fortune will
lucius good uncle take you in this barbarous moor
this ravenous tiger this accursed devil
let him receive no sust'nance fetter him
till he be brought unto the empress' face
for testimony of her foul proceedings
and see the ambush of our friends be strong
aaron some devil whisper curses in my ear
and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
the venomous malice of my swelling heart
lucius away inhuman dog unhallowed slave
sirs help our uncle to convey him in
exeunt goths with aaron flourish within
the trumpets show the emperor is at hand
sound trumpets enter saturninus and
tamora with aemilius tribunes senators and others
lucius what boots it thee to can thyself a sun
marcus rome's emperor and nephew break the parle
these quarrels must be quietly debated
the feast is ready which the careful titus
hath ordaind to an honourable end
for peace for love for league and good to rome
please you therefore draw nigh and take your places
saturninus marcus we will
a table brought in the company sit down
like a cook placing the dishes and lavinia
with a veil over her face also young lucius and others
titus welcome my lord welcome dread queen
welcome ye warlike goths welcome lucius
and welcome all although the cheer be poor
'twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it
saturninus why art thou thus attir'd andronicus
titus because i would be sure to have all well
to entertain your highness and your empress
titus an if your highness knew my heart you were
my lord the emperor resolve me this
was it well done of rash virginius
to slay his daughter with his own right hand
because she was enforc'd staind and deflower'd
saturninus it was andronicus
titus your reason mighty lord
saturninus because the girl should not survive her shame
and by her presence still renew his sorrows
a pattern precedent and lively warrant
for me most wretched to perform the like
die die lavinia and thy shame with thee he kills her
and with thy shame thy father's sorrow die
saturninus what hast thou done unnatural and unkind
titus killd her for whom my tears have made me blind
i am as woeful as virginius was
and have a thousand times more cause than he
to do this outrage and it now is done
titus willt please you eat willt please your highness feed
tamora why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
titus not i 'twas chiron and demetrius
they ravish'd her and cut away her tongue
and they 'twas they that did her all this wrong
saturninus go fetch them hither to us presently
titus why there they are both baked in this pie
whereof their mother daintily hath fed
eating the flesh that she herself hath bred
he stabs the empress
saturninus die frantic wretch for this accursed deed
he stabs titus
lucius can the sons eye behold his father bleed
there's meed for meed death for a deadly deed
he stabs saturninus a great tumult lucius
marcus and their friends go up into the balcony
marcus you sad fac'd men people and sons of rome
by uproars sever'd as a flight of fowl
o let me teach you how to knit again
this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf
these broken limbs again into one body
lest rome herself be bane unto herself
and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to
like a forlorn and desperate castaway
do shameful execution on herself
but if my frosty signs and chaps of age
grave witnesses of true experience
to lucius speak rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor
when with his solemn tongue he did discourse
to love sick dido's sad attending ear
the story of that baleful burning night
when subtle greeks surpris'd king priam's troy
tell us what sinon hath bewitch'd our ears
or who hath brought the fatal engine in
that gives our troy our rome the civil wound
my heart is not compact of flint nor steel
but floods of tears will drown my oratory
and break my utt'rance even in the time
when it should move ye to attend me most
and force you to commiseration
here's rome's young captain let him tell the tale
while i stand by and weep to hear him speak
lucius then gracious auditory be it known to you
that chiron and the damnd demetrius
were they that murd'red our emperor's brother
for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
our father's tears despis'd and basely cozend
of that true hand that fought rome's quarrel out
and sent her enemies unto the grave
lastly myself unkindly banished
the gates shut on me and turnd weeping out
to beg relief among rome's enemies
who drownd their enmity in my true tears
and op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend
that have preserv'd her welfare in my blood
and from her bosom took the enemy's point
sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body
alas you know i am no vaunter i
my scars can witness dumb although they are
that my report is just and full of truth
but soft methinks i do digress too much
citing my worthless praise o pardon me
for when no friends are by men praise themselves
pointing to the child in an attendant's arms
of this was tamora delivered
the issue of an irreligious moor
chief architect and plotter of these woes
the villain is alive in titus' house
damnd as he is to witness this is true
now judge what cause had titus to revenge
these wrongs unspeakable past patience
or more than any living man could bear
have we done aught amiss show us wherein
and from the place where you behold us pleading
the poor remainder of andronici
will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves
and on the ragged stones beat forth our souls
and make a mutual closure of our house
speak romans speak and if you say we shall
lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall
aemilius come come thou reverend man of rome
lucius our emperor for well i know
the common voice do cry it shall be so
all lucius all hail rome's royal emperor
marcus go go into old titus' sorrowful house
and hither hale that misbelieving moor
to be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death
as punishment for his most wicked life exeunt some
attendants lucius marcus and the others descend
all lucius all hail rome's gracious governor
to heal rome's harms and wipe away her woe
but gentle people give me aim awhile
for nature puts me to a heavy task
stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips kisses titus
these sorrowful drops upon thy blood staind face
the last true duties of thy noble son
marcus tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
o were the sum of these that i should pay
countless and infinite yet would i pay them
lucius come hither boy come come come and learn of us
to melt in showers thy grandsire lov'd thee well
many a time he danc'd thee on his knee
sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
many a story hath he told to thee
and bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
and talk of them when he was dead and gone
when they were living warm'd themselves on thine
o now sweet boy give them their latest kiss
bid him farewell commit him to the grave
do them that kindness and take leave of them
boy o grandsire grandsire ev'n with all my heart
would i were dead so you did live again
o lord i cannot speak to him for weeping
my tears will choke me if i ope my mouth
re enter attendants with aaron
give sentence on the execrable wretch
that hath been breeder of these dire events
lucius set him breast deep in earth and famish him
there let him stand and rave and cry for food
if any one relieves or pities him
for the offence he dies this is our doom
some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth
aaron ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
i am no baby i that with base prayers
ten thousand worse than ever yet i did
would i perform if i might have my will
if one good deed in all my life i did
i do repent it from my very soul
lucius some loving friends convey the emperor hence
and give him burial in his father's grave
my father and lavinia shall forthwith
be closed in our household's monument
as for that ravenous tiger tamora
no mournful bell shall ring her burial
but throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey
her life was beastly and devoid of pity
and being dead let birds on her take pity exeunt

in troy there lies the scene from isles of greece
the princes orgillous their high blood chaf'd
have to the port of athens sent their ships
of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
put forth toward phrygia and their vow is made
to ransack troy within whose strong immures
the ravish'd helen menelaus' queen
with wanton paris sleeps and that's the quarrel
to tenedos they come
and the deep drawing barks do there disgorge
their war like fraughtage now on dardan plains
their brave pavilions priam's six gated city
dardan and tymbria helias chetas troien
and antenorides with massy staples
and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
sperr up the sons of troy
now expectation tickling skittish spirits
on one and other side troyan and greek
sets all on hazard and hither am i come
a prologue arm'd but not in confidence
in like conditions as our argument
to tell you fair beholders that our play
leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
beginning in the middle starting thence away
to what may be digested in a play
like or find fault do as your pleasures are
now good or bad 'tis but the chance of war
act i scene 1
troy before priam's palace
troilus call here my varlet i'll unarm again
why should i war without the walls of troy
that find such cruel battle here within
each troyan that is master of his heart
let him to field troilus alas hath none
pandarus will this gear ne'er be mended
troilus the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
but i am weaker than a womans tear
less valiant than the virgin in the night
and skilless as unpractis'd infancy
pandarus well i have told you enough of this for my part
i'll not meddle nor make no farther he that will have a cake
out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
pandarus ay to the leavening but here's yet in the word
'hereafter' the kneading the making of the cake the heating
of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too
or you may chance to burn your lips
troilus patience herself what goddess e'er she be
doth lesser blench at suff'rance than i do
at priam's royal table do i sit
and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts
so traitor then she comes when she is thence
look or any woman else
troilus i was about to tell thee when my heart
as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
lest hector or my father should perceive me
i have as when the sun doth light a storm
buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
pandarus an her hair were not somewhat darker than helens well
my part she is my kinswoman i would not as they term it
praise her but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as
i did i will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit but
troilus o pandarus i tell thee pandarus
when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd
reply not in how many fathoms deep
they lie indrench'd i tell thee i am mad
in cressid's love thou answer'st 'she is fair'
pourest in the open ulcer of my heart
handlest in thy discourse o that her hand
in whose comparison all whites are ink
writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tellst me
as true thou tellst me when i say i love her
but saying thus instead of oil and balm
thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
the knife that made it
troilus thou dost not speak so much
pandarus faith i'll not meddle in it let her be as she is if
she be fair 'tis the better for her an she be not she has the
mends in her own hands
troilus good pandarus how now pandarus
pandarus i have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of
her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but
small thanks for my labour
troilus what art thou angry pandarus what with me
helen an she were not kin to me she would be as fair a friday
as helen is on sunday but what care i i care not an she were a
blackamoor 'tis all one to me
troilus say i she is not fair
pandarus i do not care whether you do or no she's a fool to stay
behind her father let her to the greeks and so i'll tell her
the next time i see her for my part i'll meddle nor make no
more i' th' matter
troilus pandarus
troilus sweet pandarus
pandarus pray you speak no more to me i will leave all
as i found it and there an end exit sound alarum
troilus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
fools on both sides helen must needs be fair
when with your blood you daily paint her thus
i cannot fight upon this argument
it is too starv'd a subject for my sword
but pandarus o gods how do you plague me
and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
as she is stubborn chaste against all suit
tell me apollo for thy daphne's love
what cressid is what pandar and what we
her bed is india there she lies a pearl
between our ilium and where she resides
let it be calld the wild and wand'ring flood
ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar
our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
aeneas how now prince troilus wherefore not afield
troilus because not there this womans answer sorts
for womanish it is to be from thence
what news aeneas from the field to day
aeneas that paris is returned home and hurt
troilus by whom aeneas
aeneas troilus by menelaus
troilus let paris bleed 'tis but a scar to scorn
paris is gor'd with menelaus' horn alarum
troilus better at home if 'would i might' were 'may'
but to the sport abroad are you bound thither
aeneas in all swift haste
troilus come go we then together exeunt
act i scene 2
troy a street
enter cressida and her man alexander
cressida who were those went by
alexander queen hecuba and helen
alexander up to the eastern tower
whose height commands as subject all the vale
to see the battle hector whose patience
is as a virtue fix'd to day was mov'd
he chid andromache and struck his armourer
and like as there were husbandry in war
before the sun rose he was harness'd light
and to the field goes he where every flower
did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
cressida what was his cause of anger
alexander the noise goes this there is among the greeks
a lord of troyan blood nephew to hector
they call him ajax
cressida good and what of him
alexander they say he is a very man per se
and stands alone
cressida so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no
empty
particular additions he is as valiant as a lion churlish as the
bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded
humours that his valour is crush'd into folly his folly sauced
with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he
hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use or purblind
argus all eyes and no sight
empty
alexander they say he yesterday cop'd hector in the battle and
struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
kept hector fasting and waking
enter pandarus
cressida who comes here
alexander madam your uncle pandarus
cressida hector's a gallant man

pandarus true he was so i know the cause too he'll lay about
him today i can tell them that and there's troilus will not
come far behind him let them take heed of troilus i can tell
them that too
cressida what is he angry too
pandarus who troilus troilus is the better man of the two
cressida o jupiter there's no comparison
pandarus what not between troilus and hector do you know a man
cressida ay if i ever saw him before and knew him
pandarus well i say troilus is troilus
cressida then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector
pandarus no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees
cressida 'tis just to each of them he is himself
pandarus himself alas poor troilus i would he were
cressida so he is
pandarus condition i had gone barefoot to india
cressida he is not hector
well the gods are above time must friend or end well troilus
well i would my heart were in her body no hector is not a
better man than troilus
cressida excuse me
pandarus he is elder
cressida pardon me pardon me
pandarus th' other's not come to't you shall tell me another tale
when th' other's come to't hector shall not have his wit this
empty
pandarus nor his qualities
cressida no matter
pandarus nor his beauty
cressida 'twould not become him his owns better
pandarus you have no judgment niece helen herself swore th'
other day that troilus for a brown favour for so 'tis i must
confess not brown neither
cressida no but brown
pandarus faith to say truth brown and not brown
pandarus she prais'd his complexion above paris
cressida why paris hath colour enough
pandarus so he has
cressida then troilus should have too much if she prais'd him
above his complexion is higher than his he having colour
enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good
complexion i had as lief helens golden tongue had commended
troilus for a copper nose
pandarus i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris
pandarus nay i am sure she does she came to him th' other day
into the compass'd window and you know he has not past three or
four hairs on his chin
cressida indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total
pandarus why he is very young and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother hector
cressida is he so young a man and so old a lifter
pandarus but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and
cressida juno have mercy how came it cloven
pandarus why you know 'tis dimpled i think his smiling becomes
him better than any man in all phrygia
cressida o he smiles valiantly
pandarus does he not
cressida o yes an 'twere a cloud in autumn
pandarus why go to then but to prove to you that helen loves
empty
cressida troilus will stand to the proof if you'll prove it so
addle egg
cressida if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head you would eat chickens i' th' shell
pandarus i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
chin indeed she has a marvells white hand i must needs
empty
cressida without the rack
pandarus and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
cressida alas poor chin many a wart is richer
her eyes ran o'er
cressida with millstones
pandarus and cassandra laugh'd
cressida but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
eyes did her eyes run o'er too
pandarus and hector laugh'd
cressida at what was all this laughing
pandarus marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
empty
pandarus they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
empty
cressida what was his answer
pandarus quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin
and one of them is white'
cressida this is her question
pandarus that's true make no question of that 'two and fifty
hairs' quoth he 'and one white that white hair is my father
and all the rest are his sons' 'jupiter' quoth she 'which of
'pluck't out and give it him' but there was such laughing and
helen so blush'd and paris so chaf'd and all the rest so
laugh'd that it pass'd
cressida so let it now for it has been a great while going by
pandarus well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think ont
cressida so i do
pandarus i'll be sworn 'tis true he will weep you and 'twere a
man born in april

porridge after meat i could live and die in the eyes of troilus

exit pandarus
words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice
he offers in another's enterprise
but more in troilus thousand fold i see
than in the glass of pandar's praise may be
yet hold i off women are angels wooing
things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing
men prize the thing ungaind more than it is
that she was never yet that ever knew
love got so sweet as when desire did sue
therefore this maxim out of love i teach
achievement is command ungaind beseech
then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear exit
act i scene 3
the grecian camp before agamemnons tent
agamemnon princes
what grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks
the ample proposition that hope makes
in all designs begun on earth below
fails in the promis'd largeness checks and disasters
grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
infects the sound pine and diverts his grain
tortive and errant from his course of growth
that we come short of our suppose so far
that after seven years' siege yet troy walls stand
sith every action that hath gone before
whereof we have record trial did draw
bias and thwart not answering the aim
and that unbodied figure of the thought
that gave't surmised shape why then you princes
do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
and call them shames which are indeed nought else
to find persistive constancy in men
the fineness of which metal is not found
in fortune's love for then the bold and coward
the wise and fool the artist and unread
the hard and soft seem all affind and kin
but in the wind and tempest of her frown
distinction with a broad and powerful fan
puffing at all winnows the light away
and what hath mass or matter by itself
nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat
great agamemnon nestor shall apply
thy latest words in the reproof of chance
lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
upon her patient breast making their way
with those of nobler bulk
but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
the gentle thetis and anon behold
bounding between the two moist elements
like perseus' horse where's then the saucy boat
whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
co rivalld greatness either to harbour fled
or made a toast for neptune even so
doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
as rous'd with rage with rage doth sympathise
and with an accent tund in self same key
retorts to chiding fortune
ulysses agamemnon
thou great commander nerve and bone of greece
heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
in whom the tempers and the minds of all
should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks
the which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway
to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretch'd out life
i give to both your speeches which were such
as agamemnon and the hand of greece
should hold up high in brass and such again
as venerable nestor hatch'd in silver
should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree
on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears
to his experienc'd tongue yet let it please both
agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be't of less expect
that matter needless of importless burden
divide thy lips than we are confident
when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
we shall hear music wit and oracle
ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down
and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master
but for these instances
the specialty of rule hath been neglected
hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
when that the general is not like the hive
to whom the foragers shall all repair
what honey is expected degree being vizarded
th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
observe degree priority and place
insisture course proportion season form
office and custom in all line of order
in noble eminence enthrond and spher'd
amidst the other whose med'cinable eye
corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
and posts like the commandment of a king
sans check to good and bad but when the planets
in evil mixture to disorder wander
what plagues and what portents what mutiny
what raging of the sea shaking of earth
commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
the unity and married calm of states
quite from their fixture o when degree is shak'd
which is the ladder of all high designs
the enterprise is sick how could communities
degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
peaceful commerce from dividable shores
the primogenity and due of birth
prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
but by degree stand in authentic place
and hark what discord follows each thing melts
in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
and make a sop of all this solid globe
strength should be lord of imbecility
and the rude son should strike his father dead
force should be right or rather right and wrong
between whose endless jar justice resides
should lose their names and so should justice too
power into will will into appetite
and appetite an universal wolf
so doubly seconded with will and power
must make perforce an universal prey
and last eat up himself great agamemnon
this chaos when degree is suffocate
follows the choking
and this neglection of degree it is
that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
by him one step below he by the next
that next by him beneath so ever step
exampld by the first pace that is sick
of his superior grows to an envious fever
of pale and bloodless emulation
and 'tis this fever that keeps troy on foot
not her own sinews to end a tale of length
troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses
what is the remedy
ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns
the sinew and the forehand of our host
having his ear full of his airy fame
grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
lies mocking our designs with him patroclus
upon a lazy bed the livelong day
breaks scurril jests
which slanderer he imitation calls
he pageants us sometime great agamemnon
thy topless deputation he puts on
and like a strutting player whose conceit
lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
such to be pitied and o'er wrested seeming
he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd
would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff
the large achilles on his press'd bed lolling
from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
cries 'excellent 'tis agamemnon just
now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard
as he being drest to some oration'
that's done as near as the extremest ends
of parallels as like vulcan and his wife
'tis nestor right now play him me patroclus
arming to answer in a night alarm'
and then forsooth the faint defects of age
must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
and with a palsy fumbling on his gorget
shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
sir valour dies cries 'o enough patroclus
or give me ribs of steel i shall split all
in pleasure of my spleen' and in this fashion
severals and generals of grace exact
achievements plots orders preventions
excitements to the field or speech for truce
success or loss what is or is not serves
as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
nestor and in the imitation of these twain
who as ulysses says opinion crowns
with an imperial voice many are infect
ajax is grown self willd and bears his head
as broad achilles keeps his tent like him
makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
bold as an oracle and sets thersites
a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
to match us in comparisons with dirt
to weaken and discredit our exposure
how rank soever rounded in with danger
ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice
count wisdom as no member of the war
but that of hand the still and mental parts
that do contrive how many hands shall strike
when fitness calls them on and know by measure
of their observant toil the enemies' weight
why this hath not a finger's dignity
they call this bed work mapp'ry closet war
so that the ram that batters down the wall
for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise
they place before his hand that made the engine
by reason guide his execution
nestor let this be granted and achilles' horse
makes many thetis' sons tucket
agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus
menelaus from troy
enter aeneas
agamemnon what would you fore our tent
aeneas is this great agamemnons tent i pray you
agamemnon even this
do a fair message to his kingly eyes
agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles' an
fore all the greekish heads which with one voice
call agamemnon head and general
aeneas fair leave and large security how may
a stranger to those most imperial looks
know them from eyes of other mortals
agamemnon how
aeneas ay
and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
modest as morning when she coldly eyes
the youthful phoebus
which is that god in office guiding men
which is the high and mighty agamemnon
agamemnon this troyan scorns us or the men of troy
are ceremonious courtiers
aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
as bending angels that's their fame in peace
good arms strong joints true swords and jove's accord
nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas
peace troyan lay thy finger on thy lips
the worthiness of praise distains his worth
if that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth
but what the repining enemy commends
that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends
agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
aeneas ay greek that is my name
aeneas sir pardon 'tis for agamemnons ears
agamemnon he hears nought privately that comes from troy
aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper with him
i bring a trumpet to awake his ear
to set his sense on the attentive bent
and then to speak
agamemnon speak frankly as the wind
it is not agamemnons sleeping hour
that thou shalt know troyan he is awake
aeneas trumpet blow loud
send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
and every greek of mettle let him know
what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
sound trumpet
we have great agamemnon here in troy
a prince called hector priam is his father
who in this dull and long continued truce
is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet
if there be one among the fair'st of greece
that holds his honour higher than his ease
that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
that knows his valour and knows not his fear
that loves his mistress more than in confession
with truant vows to her own lips he loves
and dare avow her beauty and her worth
in other arms than hers to him this challenge
hector in view of troyans and of greeks
he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
than ever greek did couple in his arms
and will to morrow with his trumpet call
mid way between your tents and walls of troy
to rouse a grecian that is true in love
if any come hector shall honour him
if none he'll say in troy when he retires
the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
the splinter of a lance even so much
if none of them have soul in such a kind
we left them all at home but we are soldiers
and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
that means not hath not or is not in love
if then one is or hath or means to be
that one meets hector if none else i am he
nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man
when hector's grandsire suck'd he is old now
but if there be not in our grecian mould
to answer for his love tell him from me
i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
and meeting him will tell him that my lady
was fairer than his grandame and as chaste
as may be in the world his youth in flood
i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood
aeneas now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth
ulysses amen
to our pavilion shall i lead you first
achilles shall have word of this intent
so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent
yourself shall feast with us before you go
and find the welcome of a noble foe
exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
ulysses nestor
nestor what says ulysses
ulysses i have a young conception in my brain
nestor what is't
ulysses this 'tis
blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
that hath to this maturity blown up
in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
to overbulk us all
nestor well and how
ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends
relates in purpose only to achilles
nestor true the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
whose grossness little characters sum up
and in the publication make no strain
but that achilles were his brain as barren
as banks of libya though apollo knows
'tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment
ay with celerity find hector's purpose
pointing on him
nestor why 'tis most meet who may you else oppose
that can from hector bring those honours off
if not achilles though 't be a sportful combat
yet in this trial much opinion dwells
for here the troyans taste our dear'st repute
with their finst palate and trust to me ulysses
our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
in this vile action for the success
although particular shall give a scantling
and in such indexes although small pricks
to their subsequent volumes there is seen
the baby figure of the giant mas
of things to come at large it is suppos'd
he that meets hector issues from our choice
and choice being mutual act of all our souls
makes merit her election and doth boil
as 'twere from forth us all a man distilld
out of our virtues who miscarrying
to steel a strong opinion to themselves
which entertaind limbs are his instruments
in no less working than are swords and bows
directive by the limbs
ulysses give pardon to my speech
therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector
let us like merchants show our foulest wares
and think perchance they'll sell if not the lustre
of the better yet to show shall show the better
that ever hector and achilles meet
for both our honour and our shame in this
are dogg'd with two strange followers
nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they
ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector
were he not proud we all should wear with him
but he already is too insolent
and it were better parch in afric sun
than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
why then we do our main opinion crush
in taint of our best man no make a lott'ry
and by device let blockish ajax draw
the sort to fight with hector among ourselves
give him allowance for the better man
for that will physic the great myrmidon
who broils in loud applause and make him fall
his crest that prouder than blue iris bends
if the dull brainless ajax come safe off
yet go we under our opinion still
that we have better men but hit or miss
our project's life this shape of sense assumes
ajax employ'd plucks down achilles' plumes
nestor now ulysses i begin to relish thy advice
and i will give a taste thereof forthwith
to agamemnon go we to him straight
two curs shall tame each other pride alone
must tarre the mastiffs on as 'twere their bone exeunt
the grecian camp
enter ajax and thersites
ajax thersites
thersites agamemnon how if he had boils full an over generally
ajax thersites
thersites and those boils did run say so did not the general run
then were not that a botchy core

scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in
greece when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as
slow as another
thersites thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and
thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at
proserpina's beauty ay that thou bark'st at him
ajax mistress thersites
thersites thou shouldst strike him
ajax cobloaf
thersites he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a
sailor breaks a biscuit
ajax you whoreson cur strikes him
ajax thou stool for a witch
thersites ay do do thou sodden witted lord thou hast no more
brain than i have in mine elbows an assinico may tutor thee you
scurvy valiant ass thou art here but to thrash troyans and thou
art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian

thersites lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his
evasions have ears thus long i have bobb'd his brain more than
he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and
his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow this
in his head i'll tell you what i say of him
achilles what
thersites i say this ajax ajax offers to strike him
achilles nay good ajax

achilles will you set your wit to a fools
thersites no i warrant you the fools will shame it
patroclus good words thersites
achilles what's the quarrel
ajax i bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the
proclamation and he rails upon me
thersites i serve thee not
thersites i serve here voluntary
achilles your last service was suff'rance 'twas not voluntary no
man is beaten voluntary ajax was here the voluntary and you as
under an impress
thersites e'en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your
sinews or else there be liars hector shall have a great catch
an he knock out either of your brains 'a were as good crack a
fusty nut with no kernel

act ii scene 2
troy priam's palace
enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus
priam after so many hours lives speeches spent
'deliver helen and all damage else
as honour loss of time travail expense
wounds friends and what else dear that is consum'd
in hot digestion of this cormorant war
shall be struck off' hector what say you to't
hector though no man lesser fears the greeks than i
as far as toucheth my particular
yet dread priam
there is no lady of more softer bowels
more ready to cry out 'who knows what follows'
than hector is the wound of peace is surety
surety secure but modest doubt is calld
the beacon of the wise the tent that searches
to th' bottom of the worst let helen go
since the first sword was drawn about this question
every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours
if we have lost so many tenths of ours
had it our name the value of one ten
what merit's in that reason which denies
the yielding of her up
troilus fie fie my brother
weigh you the worth and honour of a king
so great as our dread father's in a scale
of common ounces will you with counters sum
the past proportion of his infinite
and buckle in a waist most fathomless
as fears and reasons fie for godly shame
helenus no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
you are so empty of them should not our father
bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
because your speech hath none that tells him so
troilus you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons
you know an enemy intends you harm
you know a sword employ'd is perilous
who marvels then when helenus beholds
a grecian and his sword if he do set
the very wings of reason to his heels
and fly like chidden mercury from jove
or like a star disorb'd nay if we talk of reason
let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts
with this cramm'd reason reason and respect
make livers pale and lustihood deject
the keeping
troilus what's aught but as 'tis valued
hector but value dwells not in particular will
it holds his estimate and dignity
as well wherein 'tis precious of itself
as in the prizer 'tis mad idolatry
to make the service greater than the god i
and the will dotes that is attributive
to what infectiously itself affects
troilus i take to day a wife and my election
is led on in the conduct of my will
my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
of will and judgment how may i avoid
although my will distaste what it elected
the wife i chose there can be no evasion
to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
we do not throw in unrespective sieve
because we now are full it was thought meet
paris should do some vengeance on the greeks
your breath with full consent benied his sails
the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
and did him service he touch'd the ports desir'd
and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness
wrinkles apollo's and makes stale the morning
is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships
and turnd crownd kings to merchants
if you'll avouch 'twas wisdom paris went
as you must needs for you all cried 'go go'
if you'll confess he brought home worthy prize
as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands
and cried 'inestimable' why do you now
the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
beggar the estimation which you priz'd
richer than sea and land o theft most base
that we have stoln what we do fear to keep
but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln
that in their country did them that disgrace
we fear to warrant in our native place
cassandra within cry troyans cry
priam what noise what shriek is this
troilus 'tis our mad sister i do know her voice
hector it is cassandra
enter cassandra raving
cassandra cry troyans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
and i will fill them with prophetic tears
hector peace sister peace
cassandra virgins and boys mid age and wrinkled eld
soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
add to my clamours let us pay betimes
a moiety of that mass of moan to come
troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand
our firebrand brother paris burns us all
cry troyans cry a helen and a woe
cry cry troy burns or else let helen go exit
hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains
of divination in our sister work
some touches of remorse or is your blood
so madly hot that no discourse of reason
nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
troilus why brother hector
we may not think the justness of each act
such and no other than event doth form it
nor once deject the courage of our minds
because cassandra's mad her brain sick raptures
cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
which hath our several honours all engag'd
to make it gracious for my private part
i am no more touch'd than all priam's sons
such things as might offend the weakest spleen
to fight for and maintain
paris else might the world convince of levity
as well my undertakings as your counsels
but i attest the gods your full consent
gave wings to my propension and cut of
all fears attending on so dire a project
for what alas can these my single arms
what propugnation is in one mans valour
this quarrel would excite yet i protest
were i alone to pass the difficulties
and had as ample power as i have will
paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
nor faint in the pursuit
priam paris you speak
like one besotted on your sweet delights
you have the honey still but these the gall
so to be valiant is no praise at all
the pleasures such a beauty brings with it
but i would have the soil of her fair rape
wip'd off in honourable keeping her
what treason were it to the ransack'd queen
disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
now to deliver her possession up
on terms of base compulsion can it be
that so degenerate a strain as this
should once set footing in your generous bosoms
without a heart to dare or sword to draw
when helen is defended nor none so noble
whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
where helen is the subject then i say
well may we fight for her whom we know well
the world's large spaces cannot parallel
hector paris and troilus you have both said well
and on the cause and question now in hand
have gloz'd but superficially not much
unfit to hear moral philosophy
the reasons you allege do more conduce
to the hot passion of distemp'red blood
than to make up a free determination
'twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
of any true decision nature craves
all dues be rend'red to their owners now
what nearer debt in all humanity
of nature be corrupted through affection
and that great minds of partial indulgence
to their benumbed wills resist the same
there is a law in each well order'd nation
to curb those raging appetites that are
most disobedient and refractory
if helen then be wife to sparta's king
as it is known she is these moral laws
of nature and of nations speak aloud
in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
but makes it much more heavy hector's opinion
is this in way of truth yet ne'er the less
my spritely brethren i propend to you
in resolution to keep helen still
for 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
upon our joint and several dignities
troilus why there you touch'd the life of our design
were it not glory that we more affected
i would not wish a drop of troyan blood
spent more in her defence but worthy hector
she is a theme of honour and renown
a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
whose present courage may beat down our foes
and fame in time to come canonize us
for i presume brave hector would not lose
so rich advantage of a promis'd glory
as smiles upon the forehead of this action
hector i am yours
you valiant offspring of great priamus
i have a roisting challenge sent amongst
the dull and factious nobles of the greeks
will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
i was advertis'd their great general slept
whilst emulation in the army crept
this i presume will wake him exeunt

agamemnon let it be known to him that we are here

let him be told so lest perchance he think
we dare not move the question of our place
or know not what we are
patroclus i shall say so to him exit
he is not sick
ajax yes lion sick sick of proud heart you may call it
melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head 'tis
pride but why why let him show us a cause a word my lord
takes agamemnon aside
nestor what moves ajax thus to bay at him
ulysses achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
nestorwho thersites
ulysses he
ulysses no you see he is his argument that has his argument
empty
nestor all the better their fraction is more our wish than their
faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite
ulysses the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie
re enter patroclus
here comes patroclus
nestor no achilles with him
ulysses the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs
patroclus achilles bids me say he is much sorry
if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
did move your greatness and this noble state
to call upon him he hopes it is no other
but for your health and your digestion sake
an after dinner's breath
agamemnon hear you patroclus
we are too well acquainted with these answers
but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn
much attribute he hath and much the reason
why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
not virtuously on his own part beheld
do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
are like to rot untasted go and tell him
we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
if you do say we think him over proud
and under honest in self assumption greater
here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
disguise the holy strength of their command
and underwrite in an observing kind
his humorous predominance yea watch
his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
the passage and whole carriage of this action
rode on his tide go tell him this and ad
that if he overhold his price so much
we'll none of him but let him like an engine
bring action hither this cannot go to war
a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
before a sleeping giant tell him so
patroclus i shall and bring his answer presently exit
agamemnon in second voice we'll not be satisfied
we come to speak with him ulysses enter you
exit ulysses
ajax what is he more than another
agamemnon no more than what he thinks he is
man than i am
agamemnon no question
ajax will you subscribe his thought and say he is
agamemnon no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise
no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable
ajax why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i know not
what pride is
agamemnon your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the
fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass
but in the deed devours the deed in the praise
re enter ulysses
ajax i do hate a proud man as i do hate the engend'ring of toads
nestor aside and yet he loves himself is't not strange
ulysses achilles will not to the field to morrow
agamemnon what's his excuse
ulysses he doth rely on none
but carries on the stream of his dispose
without observance or respect of any
agamemnon why will he not upon our fair request
untent his person and share the air with us
ulysses things small as nothing for request's sake only
he makes important possess'd he is with greatness
and speaks not to himself but with a pride
that quarrels at self breath imagind worth
holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
that 'twixt his mental and his active parts
kingdom'd achilles in commotion rages
he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
cry 'no recovery'
agamemnon let ajax go to him
dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
'tis said he holds you well and will be led
at your request a little from himself
ulysses o agamemnon let it not be so
we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes
when they go from achilles shall the proud lord
and never suffers matter of the world
enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve
and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd
of that we hold an idol more than he
no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
shall not so stale his palm nobly acquir'd
nor by my will assubjugate his merit
as amply titled as achilles is
by going to achilles
and add more coals to cancer when he burns
with entertaining great hyperion
this lord go to him jupiter forbid
and say in thunder 'achilles go to him'
nestor aside o this is well he rubs the vein of him
diomedes aside and how his silence drinks up this applause
ajax if i go to him with my armed fist i'll pash him o'er the
empty
agamemnon o no you shall not go
let me go to him
ulysses not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
ajax a paltry insolent fellow
nestor aside how he describes himself
ajax can he not be sociable
ulysses aside the raven chides blackness
ajax i'll let his humours blood
agamemnon aside he will be the physician that should be the
empty
ulysses aside wit would be out of fashion
ajax 'a should not bear it so 'a should eat's words first
shall pride carry it
nestor aside an 'twould you'd carry half
ulysses aside 'a would have ten shares
ajax i will knead him i'll make him supple
nestor aside he's not yet through warm force him with praises
pour in pour in his ambition is dry
ulysses to agamemnon my lord you feed too much on this dislike
diomedes you must prepare to fight without achilles
ulysses why 'tis this naming of him does him harm
here is a man but 'tis before his face
i will be silent
nestor wherefore should you so
he is not emulous as achilles is
ulysses know the whole world he is as valiant
ajax a whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus
would he were a troyan
ulysses if he were proud
diomedes or covetous of praise
ulysses ay or surly borne
diomedes or strange or self affected
ulysses thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck
fam'd be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
thrice fam'd beyond beyond all erudition
but he that disciplind thine arms to fight
and give him half and for thy vigour
bull bearing milo his addition yield
to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom
which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor
instructed by the antiquary times
he must he is he cannot but be wise
but pardon father nestor were your days
as green as ajax' and your brain so temper'd
but be as ajax
ajax shall i call you father
nestor ay my good son
diomedes be ruld by him lord ajax
ulysses there is no tarrying here the hart achilles
keeps thicket please it our great general
to call together all his state of war
fresh kings are come to troy to morrow
we must with all our main of power stand fast
and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best

troilus no pandarus i stalk about her door
like a strange soul upon the stygian banks
staying for waftage o be thou my charon
and give me swift transportance to these fields
where i may wallow in the lily beds
propos'd for the deserver o gentle pandar
from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
and fly with me to cressid
pandarus walk here i' th' orchard i'll bring her straight
troilus i am giddy expectation whirls me round
th' imaginary relish is so sweet
that it enchants my sense what will it be
when that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed
love's thrice repured nectar death i fear me
swooning destruction or some joy too fine
too subtle potent tund too sharp in sweetness
for the capacity of my ruder powers
i fear it much and i do fear besides
as doth a battle when they charge on heaps
the enemy flying
re enter pandarus
pandarus she's making her ready she'll come straight you must be
witty now she does so blush and fetches her wind so short as
if she were fray'd with a sprite i'll fetch her it is the
prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a new ta'en
sparrow exit
troilus even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
and all my powers do their bestowing lose
like vassalage at unawares encount'ring
the eye of majesty
re enter pandarus with cressida
pandarus come come what need you blush shame's a baby here she
is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me
what are you gone again you must be watch'd ere you be made
tame must you come your ways come your ways an you draw
backward we'll put you i' th' fills why do you not speak to
alas the day how loath you are to offend daylight an 'twere
dark you'd close sooner so so rub on and kiss the mistress
how now a kiss in fee farm build there carpenter the air is
sweet nay you shall fight your hearts out ere i part you the
falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i' th' river go to go
empty
troilus you have bereft me of all words lady
pandarus words pay no debts give her deeds but she'll bereave
you o' th' deeds too if she call your activity in question
interchangeably' come in come in i'll go get a fire
empty
cressida will you walk in my lord
troilus o cressid how often have i wish'd me thus
cressida wish'd my lord the gods grant o my lord
troilus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption
what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our
empty
cressida more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
cressida blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing
than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft
cures the worse
troilus o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's pageant
there is presented no monster
cressida nor nothing monstrous neither
troilus nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas
live in fire cat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our
mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any
the will is infinite and the execution confind that the desire
is boundless and the act a slave to limit
cressida they say all lovers swear more performance than they are
able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing
more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the
tenth part of one they that have the voice of lions and the act
of hares are they not monsters
troilus are there such such are not we praise us as we are
tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit
present we will not name desert before his birth and being
born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith
troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall
be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not
truer than troilus
cressida will you walk in my lord
re enter pandarus
pandarus what blushing still have you not done talking yet
cressida well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you
give him me be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it
troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm
empty
pandarus nay i'll give my word for her too our kindred though
they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won
they are burs i can tell you they'll stick where they are
empty
cressida boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
prince troilus i have lov'd you night and day
troilus why was my cressid then so hard to win
cressida hard to seem won but i was won my lord
with the first glance that ever pardon me
if i confess much you will play the tyrant
i love you now but till now not so much
but i might master it in faith i lie
my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
too headstrong for their mother see we fools
why have i blabb'd who shall be true to us
but though i lov'd you well i woo'd you not
and yet good faith i wish'd myself a man
or that we women had mens privilege
of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue
for in this rapture i shall surely speak
the thing i shall repent see see your silence
cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
my very soul of counsel stop my mouth
troilus and shall albeit sweet music issues thence
cressida my lord i do beseech you pardon me
'twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
i am asham'd o heavens what have i done
for this time will i take my leave my lord
troilus your leave sweet cressid
pandarus leave an you take leave till to morrow morning
cressida pray you content you
troilus what offends you lady
cressida sir mine own company
cressida let me go and try
i have a kind of self resides with you
but an unkind self that itself will leave
to be another's fool i would be gone
where is my wit i know not what i speak
troilus well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
cressida perchance my lord i show more craft than love
and fell so roundly to a large confession
to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above
troilus o that i thought it could be in a woman
as if it can i will presume in you
to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love
to keep her constancy in plight and youth
outliving beauty's outward with a mind
that doth renew swifter than blood decays
or that persuasion could but thus convince me
that my integrity and truth to you
of such a winnowed purity in love
how were i then uplifted but alas
i am as true as truth's simplicity
and simpler than the infancy of truth
cressida in that i'll war with you
troilus o virtuous fight
when right with right wars who shall be most right
true swains in love shall in the world to come
approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes
want similes truth tir'd with iteration
as true as steel as plantage to the moon
as sun to day as turtle to her mate
as iron to adamant as earth to th' centre
yet after all comparisons of truth
as truth's authentic author to be cited
'as true as troilus' shall crown up the verse
and sanctify the numbers
cressida prophet may you be
when time is old and hath forgot itself
when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy
and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up
and mighty states characterless are grated
to dusty nothing yet let memory
from false to false among false maids in love
upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'as false
as air as water wind or sandy earth
as fox to lamb or wolf to heifer's calf
yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
'as false as cressid'
pandarus go to a bargain made seal it seal it i'll be the
witness here i hold your hand here my cousins if ever you
prove false one to another since i have taken such pains to
bring you together let all pitiful goers between be calld to
the world's end after my name call them all pandars let all
constant men be troiluses all false women cressids and all
brokers between pandars say 'amen'
cressida amen
pandarus amen whereupon i will show you a chamber
and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters press it to death away
and cupid grant all tongue tied maidens here
bed chamber pander to provide this gear exeunt

i have abandond troy left my possession
incurr'd a traitor's name expos'd myself
from certain and possess'd conveniences

that time acquaintance custom and condition

agamemnon what wouldst thou of us troyan make demand
calchas you have a troyan prisoner calld antenor
yesterday took troy holds him very dear
desir'd my cressid in right great exchange
whom troy hath still denied but this antenor
i know is such a wrest in their affairs

give us a prince of blood a son of priam
in change of him let him be sent great princes
and he shall buy my daughter and her presence
shall quite strike off all service i have done
agamemnon let diomedes bear him
and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have
what he requests of us good diomed
furnish you fairly for this interchange
withal bring word if hector will to morrow
be answer'd in his challenge ajax is ready
diomedes this shall i undertake and 'tis a burden
which i am proud to bear
exeunt diomedes and calchas
ulysses achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent
please it our general pass strangely by him
as if he were forgot and princes all
lay negligent and loose regard upon him
i will come last 'tis like he'll question me
why such unplausive eyes are bent why turnd on him
if so i have derision med'cinable
to use between your strangeness and his pride
which his own will shall have desire to drink
to show itself but pride for supple knees
feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees
agamemnon we'll execute your purpose and put on
a form of strangeness as we pass along
so do each lord and either greet him not
or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
than if not look'd on i will lead the way
achilles what comes the general to speak with me
you know my mind i'll fight no more 'gainst troy
nestor would you my lord aught with the general
achilles no
nestor nothing my lord
agamemnon the better
exeunt agamemnon and nestor
achilles good day good day
menelaus how do you how do you exit
achilles what does the cuckold scorn me
ajax how now patroclus
ajax ha
achilles good morrow
ajax ay and good next day too exit
achilles what mean these fellows know they not achilles
patroclus they pass by strangely they were us'd to bend
to send their smiles before them to achilles
to come as humbly as they us'd to creep
to holy altars
achilles what am i poor of late
must fall out with men too what the declind is
he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
show not their mealy wings but to the summer
and not a man for being simply man
hath any honour but honour for those honours
that are without him as place riches and favour
prizes of accident as oft as merit
which when they fall as being slippery standers
doth one pluck down another and together
die in the fall but 'tis not so with me
fortune and i are friends i do enjoy
at ample point all that i did possess
save these mens looks who do methinks find out
something not worth in me such rich beholding
as they have often given here is ulysses
i'll interrupt his reading
how now ulysses
achilles what are you reading
ulysses a strange fellow here
writes me that man how dearly ever parted
how much in having or without or in
cannot make boast to have that which he hath
nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
as when his virtues shining upon others
heat them and they retort that heat again
to the first giver
the beauty that is borne here in the face
the bearer knows not but commends itself
to others' eyes nor doth the eye itself
that most pure spirit of sense behold itself
not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
salutes each other with each other's form
for speculation turns not to itself
till it hath travelld and is mirror'd there
where it may see itself this is not strange at all
it is familiar but at the author's drift
who in his circumstance expressly proves
that no man is the lord of anything
though in and of him there be much consisting
till he communicate his parts to others
nor doth he of himself know them for aught
till he behold them formed in th' applause
where th' are extended who like an arch reverb'rate
the voice again or like a gate of steel
his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this
and apprehended here immediately
th' unknown ajax heavens what a man is there
a very horse that has he knows not what
nature what things there are
most abject in regard and dear in use
what things again most dear in the esteem
and poor in worth now shall we see to morrow
an act that very chance doth throw upon him
while some men leave to do
how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall
whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
how one man eats into another's pride
while pride is fasting in his wantonness
to see these grecian lords why even already
they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder
as if his foot were on brave hector's breast
and great troy shrinking
as misers do by beggars neither gave to me
good word nor look what are my deeds forgot
ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back
wherein he puts alms for oblivion
a great siz'd monster of ingratitudes
those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
as fast as they are made forgot as soon
as done perseverance dear my lord
keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
in monumental mock'ry take the instant way
for honour travels in a strait so narrow
where one but goes abreast keep then the path
for emulation hath a thousand sons
that one by one pursue if you give way
or hedge aside from the direct forthright
like to an ent'red tide they all rush by
and leave you hindmost
or like a gallant horse falln in first rank
o'er run and trampled on then what they do in present
though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours
for time is like a fashionable host
that slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand
and with his arms out stretch'd as he would fly
grasps in the corner the welcome ever smiles
and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek
remuneration for the thing it was
for beauty wit
love friendship charity are subjects all
to envious and calumniating time
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
that all with one consent praise new born gawds
though they are made and moulded of things past
and give to dust that is a little gilt
more laud than gilt o'er dusted
the present eye praises the present object
then marvel not thou great and complete man
since things in motion sooner catch the eye
than what stirs not the cry went once on thee
and still it might and yet it may again
if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
and case thy reputation in thy tent
whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
and drave great mars to faction
achilles of this my privacy
ulysses but 'gainst your privacy
the reasons are more potent and heroical
'tis known achilles that you are in love
with one of priam's daughters
achilles ha known
ulysses is that a wonder
the providence that's in a watchful state
knows almost every grain of plutus' gold
finds bottom in th' uncomprehensive deeps
do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
there is a mystery with whom relation
durst never meddle in the soul of state
which hath an operation more divine
than breath or pen can give expressure to
all the commerce that you have had with troy
as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
and better would it fit achilles much
to throw down hector than polyxena
when fame shall in our island sound her trump
and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing
'great hector's sister did achilles win
but our great ajax bravely beat down him'
farewell my lord i as your lover speak
the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break exit
patroclus to this effect achilles have i mov'd you
a woman impudent and mannish grown
is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
they think my little stomach to the war
and your great love to me restrains you thus
sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid
shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
and like a dew drop from the lions mane
be shook to airy air
achilles shall ajax fight with hector
patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
achilles i see my reputation is at stake
patroclus o then beware
those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
omission to do what is necessary
seals a commission to a blank of danger
and danger like an ague subtly taints
even then when they sit idly in the sun
achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus
i'll send the fool to ajax and desire him
t' invite the troyan lords after the combat
an appetite that i am sick withal
to see great hector in his weeds of peace
to talk with him and to behold his visage
even to my full of view
enter thersites
a labour sav'd
thersites a wonder
achilles what
thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
thersites he must fight singly to morrow with hector and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in
saying nothing
achilles how can that be
thersites why 'a stalks up and down like a peacock a stride and a
stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her
brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic
regard as who should say 'there were wit in this head an
'twould out' and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as
undone for ever for if hector break not his neck i' th' combat
he'll break't himself in vainglory he knows not me i said 'good
morrow ajax' and he replies 'thanks agamemnon' what think you
of this man that takes me for the general he's grown a very land
fish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may
wear it on both sides like leather jerkin
achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites
thersites who i why he'll answer nobody he professes not
answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins
to me you shall see the pageant of ajax
achilles to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the valiant
ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarm'd to my
tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the
magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honour'd
captain general of the grecian army et cetera agamemnon do
empty
patroclus jove bless great ajax
thersites hum
thersites ha
patroclus who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his
empty
thersites hum
patroclus and to procure safe conduct from agamemnon
thersites agamemnon
patroclus ay my lord
thersites ha
patroclus what you say to't
patroclus your answer sir
thersites if to morrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it
will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he
has me
patroclus your answer sir
thersites fare ye well with all my heart
achilles why but he is not in this tune is he
thersites no but he's out a tune thus what music will be in him
when hector has knock'd out his brains i know not but i am sure
empty
achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
thersites let me carry another to his horse for that's the more
capable creature
achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd
and i myself see not the bottom of it
exeunt achilles and patroclus
thersites would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i
might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in a sheep than

paris deiphobus antenor diomedes the grecian and others with torches
paris see ho who is that there
deiphobus it is the lord aeneas
aeneas is the prince there in person
had i so good occasion to lie long
as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business
diomedes that's my mind too good morrow lord aeneas
paris a valiant greek aeneas take his hand
witness the process of your speech wherein
you told how diomed a whole week by days
did haunt you in the field
aeneas health to you valiant sir
during all question of the gentle truce
but when i meet you arm'd as black defiance
as heart can think or courage execute
our bloods are now in calm and so long health
but when contention and occasion meet
by jove i'll play the hunter for thy life
with all my force pursuit and policy
aeneas and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
with his face backward in humane gentleness
welcome to troy now by anchises' life
welcome indeed by venus' hand i swear
no man alive can love in such a sort
diomedes we sympathise jove let aeneas live
if to my sword his fate be not the glory
a thousand complete courses of the sun
but in mine emulous honour let him die
with every joint a wound and that to morrow
aeneas we know each other well
diomedeswe do and long to know each other worse
paris this is the most despitefulst gentle greeting
the noblest hateful love that e'er i heard of
aeneas i was sent for to the king but why i know not
paris his purpose meets you 'twas to bring this greek
to calchas' house and there to render him
for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid
let's have your company or if you please
haste there before us i constantly believe
or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
my brother troilus lodges there to night
rouse him and give him note of our approach
we shall be much unwelcome
aeneas that i assure you
troilus had rather troy were borne to greece
than cressid borne from troy
paris there is no help
the bitter disposition of the time
will have it so on lord we'll follow you
aeneas good morrow all exit with servant
paris and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true
who in your thoughts deserves fair helen best
myself or menelaus
diomedes both alike
he merits well to have her that doth seek her
not making any scruple of her soilure
with such a hell of pain and world of charge
and you as well to keep her that defend her
not palating the taste of her dishonour
with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
you like a lecher out of whorish loins
are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors
both merits pois'd each weighs nor less nor more
but he as he the heavier for a whore
paris you are too bitter to your country woman
diomedes she's bitter to her country hear me paris
for every false drop in her bawdy veins
a grecians life hath sunk for every scruple
a troyan hath been slain since she could speak
she hath not given so many good words breath
as for her greeks and troyans suff'red death
paris fair diomed you do as chapmen do
dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
but we in silence hold this virtue well
we'll not commend what we intend to sell
here lies our way exeunt

troy pandarus' house
pandarus be moderate be moderate
cressida why tell you me of moderation
the grief is fine full perfect that i taste
and violenteth in a sense as strong
as that which causeth it how can i moderate it
if i could temporize with my affections
or brew it to a weak and colder palate
the like allayment could i give my grief
my love admits no qualifying dross
enter troilus
pandarus here here here he comes ah sweet ducks
cressida o troilus troilus embracing him
pandarus what a pair of spectacles is here let me embrace too 'o
heart' as the goodly saying is
o heart heavy heart
why sigh'st thou without breaking
where he answers again
because thou canst not ease thy smart
there was never a truer rhyme let us cast away nothing for we
may live to have need of such a verse we see it we see it how
now lambs
troilus cressid i love thee in so straind a purity
that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy
more bright in zeal than the devotion which
cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
cressida have the gods envy
pandarus ay ay ay 'tis too plain a case
troilus a hateful truth
cressida what and from troilus too
troilus from troy and troilus
cressida is't possible
troilus and suddenly where injury of chance
puts back leave taking justles roughly by
all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows
we two that with so many thousand sighs
did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
with the rude brevity and discharge of one
injurious time now with a robber's haste
crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
as many farewells as be stars in heaven
with distinct breath and consignd kisses to them
he fumbles up into a loose adieu
and scants us with a single famish'd kiss
aeneas within my lord is the lady ready
troilus hark you are calld some say the genius so
cries 'come' to him that instantly must die
bid them have patience she shall come anon
pandarus where are my tears rain to lay this wind or my heart
will be blown up by th' root exit
cressida i must then to the grecians
troilus no remedy
cressida a woeful cressid 'mongst the merry greeks
troilus hear me my love be thou but true of heart
cressida i true how now what wicked deem is this
troilus nay we must use expostulation kindly
for it is parting from us
i speak not 'be thou true' as fearing thee
for i will throw my glove to death himself
that there's no maculation in thy heart
but 'be thou true' say i to fashion in
my sequent protestation be thou true
cressida o you shall be expos'd my lord to dangers
as infinite as imminent but i'll be true
troilus and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve
cressida and you this glove when shall i see you
troilus i will corrupt the grecian sentinels
to give thee nightly visitation
but yet be true
cressida o heavens 'be true' again
troilus hear why i speak it love
they're loving well compos'd with gifts of nature
and flowing o'er with arts and exercise
how novelties may move and parts with person
alas a kind of godly jealousy
which i beseech you call a virtuous sin
makes me afeard
cressida o heavens you love me not
troilus die i a villain then
in this i do not call your faith in question
nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant
but i can tell that in each grace of these
there lurks a still and dumb discoursive devil
that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted
cressida do you think i will
troilus no
but something may be done that we will not
when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
presuming on their changeful potency
aeneas within nay good my lord
troilus come kiss and let us part
paris within brother troilus
troilus good brother come you hither
and bring aeneas and the grecian with you

nestor and others
agamemnon here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
anticipating time with starting courage
give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy
thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air
and hale him hither
ajax thou trumpet there's my purse
now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
out swell the colic of puff aquilond
come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
thou blowest for hector trumpet sounds
ulysses no trumpet answers
achilles 'tis but early days
agamemnon is not yond diomed with calchas' daughter
ulysses 'tis he i ken the manner of his gait
he rises on the toe that spirit of his
in aspiration lifts him from the earth
agamemnon is this the lady cressid
diomedes even she
agamemnon most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady
nestor our general doth salute you with a kiss
ulysses yet is the kindness but particular
nestor and very courtly counsel i'll begin
so much for nestor
achilles i'll take that winter from your lips fair lady
achilles bids you welcome
menelaus i had good argument for kissing once
patroclus but that's no argument for kissing now
for thus popp'd paris in his hardiment
and parted thus you and your argument
ulysses o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
patroclus the first was menelaus' kiss this mine
kisses her again
patroclus kisses you
menelaus o this is trim
patroclus paris and i kiss evermore for him
menelaus i'll have my kiss sir lady by your leave
cressida in kissing do you render or receive
patroclus both take and give
cressida i'll make my match to live
therefore no kiss
menelaus i'll give you boot i'll give you three for one
cressida you are an odd man give even or give none
menelaus an odd man lady every man is odd
cressida no paris is not for you know 'tis true
that you are odd and he is even with you
menelaus you fillip me o' th' head
cressida no i'll be sworn
ulysses it were no match your nail against his horn
cressida you may
ulysses i do desire it
cressida why beg then
ulysses why then for venus' sake give me a kiss
when helen is a maid again and his
cressida i am your debtor claim it when 'tis due
ulysses never's my day and then a kiss of you
diomedes lady a word i'll bring you to your father
exit with cressida
ulysses fie fie upon her
there's language in her eye her cheek her lip
nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
at every joint and motive of her body
o these encounters so glib of tongue
that give a coasting welcome ere it comes
and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
to every ticklish reader set them down
for sluttish spoils of opportunity
all the troyans' trumpet
enter hector armed aeneas troilus paris helenus
and other trojans with attendants
agamemnon yonder comes the troop
aeneas hail all the state of greece what shall be done
to him that victory commands or do you purpose
a victor shall be known will you the knights
shall to the edge of all extremity
pursue each other or shall they be divided
hector bade ask
agamemnon which way would hector have it
aeneas he cares not he'll obey conditions
achilles 'tis done like hector but securely done
a little proudly and great deal misprizing
the knight oppos'd
aeneas if not achilles sir
what is your name
achilles if not achilles nothing
in the extremity of great and little
valour and pride excel themselves in hector
the one almost as infinite as all
the other blank as nothing weigh him well
and that which looks like pride is courtesy
this ajax is half made of hector's blood
in love whereof half hector stays at home
half heart half hand half hector comes to seek
this blended knight half troyan and half greek
re enter diomedes
agamemnon here is sir diomed go gentle knight
stand by our ajax as you and lord eneas
consent upon the order of their fight
so be it either to the uttermost
or else a breath the combatants being kin
half stints their strife before their strokes begin
ajax and hector enter the lists
ulysses they are oppos'd already
ulysses the youngest son of priam a true knight
not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
not soon provok'd nor being provok'd soon calm'd
his heart and hand both open and both free
for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
nor dignifies an impair thought with breath
manly as hector but more dangerous
to tender objects but he in heat of action
is more vindicative than jealous love
they call him troilus and on him erect
a second hope as fairly built as hector
thus says aeneas one that knows the youth
even to his inches and with private soul
did in great ilion thus translate him to me
alarum hector and ajax fight
agamemnon they are in action
troilus hector thou sleep'st
awake thee
agamemnon his blows are well dispos'd there ajax
trumpets cease
diomedes you must no more
aeneas princes enough so please you
ajax i am not warm yet let us fight again
diomedes as hector pleases
hector why then will i no more
a cousin german to great priam's seed
the obligation of our blood forbids
a gory emulation 'twixt us twain
were thy commixtion greek and troyan so
that thou could'st say 'this hand is grecian all
and this is troyan the sinews of this leg
all greek and this all troy my mother's blood
runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
bounds in my father's' by jove multipotent
wherein my sword had not impressure made
of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
be drained let me embrace thee ajax
by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
hector would have them fall upon him thus
cousin all honour to thee
ajax i thank thee hector
i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
a great addition earned in thy death
hector not neoptolemus so mirable
on whose bright crest fame with her loud'st oyes
cries 'this is he' could promise to himself
a thought of added honour torn from hector
aeneas there is expectance here from both the sides
what further you will do
hector we'll answer it
ajax if i might in entreaties find success
as seld i have the chance i would desire
my famous cousin to our grecian tents
diomedes 'tis agamemnons wish and great achilles
doth long to see unarm'd the valiant hector
hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me
and signify this loving interview
to the expecters of our troyan part
desire them home give me thy hand my cousin
agamemnon and the rest of the greeks come forward
ajax great agamemnon comes to meet us here
hector the worthiest of them tell me name by name
but for achilles my own searching eyes
shall find him by his large and portly size
agamemnonworthy all arms as welcome as to one
that would be rid of such an enemy
but that's no welcome understand more clear
what's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
but in this extant moment faith and troth
straind purely from all hollow bias drawing
bids thee with most divine integrity
from heart of very heart great hector welcome
hector i thank thee most imperious agamemnon
agamemnon to troilus my well fam'd lord of troy no less to you
menelaus let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
you brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
hector who must we answer
hector o you my lord by mars his gauntlet thanks
mock not that i affect the untraded oath
your quondam wife swears still by venus' glove
she's well but bade me not commend her to you
menelaus name her not now sir she's a deadly theme
hector o pardon i offend
nestor i have thou gallant troyan seen thee oft
labouring for destiny make cruel way
through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee
despising many forfeits and subduements
when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air
not letting it decline on the declined
that i have said to some my standers by
'lo jupiter is yonder dealing life'
and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath
when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in
like an olympian wrestling this have i seen
but this thy countenance still lock'd in steel
and once fought with him he was a soldier good
but by great mars the captain of us all
never like thee o let an old man embrace thee
and worthy warrior welcome to our tents
aeneas 'tis the old nestor
hector let me embrace thee good old chronicle
that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee
nestor i would my arms could match thee in contention
hector i would they could
nestor ha
by this white beard i'd fight with thee to morrow
well welcome welcome i have seen the time
ulysses i wonder now how yonder city stands
when we have here her base and pillar by us
hector i know your favour lord ulysses well
ah sir there's many a greek and troyan dead
since first i saw yourself and diomed
ulysses sir i foretold you then what would ensue
my prophecy is but half his journey yet
for yonder walls that pertly front your town
yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
must kiss their own feet
hector i must not believe you
there they stand yet and modestly i think
the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all
will one day end it
ulysses so to him we leave it
most gentle and most valiant hector welcome
after the general i beseech you next
to feast with me and see me at my tent
achilles i shall forestall thee lord ulysses thou
now hector i have fed mine eyes on thee
i have with exact view perus'd thee hector
and quoted joint by joint
achilles i am achilles
hector stand fair i pray thee let me look on thee
achilles behold thy fill
hector nay i have done already
achilles thou art too brief i will the second time
as i would buy thee view thee limb by limb
hector o like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er
but there's more in me than thou understand'st
why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
shall i destroy him whether there or there or there
that i may give the local wound a name
and make distinct the very breach whereout
hector's great spirit flew answer me heavens
hector it would discredit the blest gods proud man
to answer such a question stand again
think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
as to prenominate in nice conjecture
where thou wilt hit me dead
hector wert thou an oracle to tell me so
i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well
for i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
but by the forge that stithied mars his helm
i'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er and o'er
you wisest grecians pardon me this brag
his insolence draws folly from my lips
but i'll endeavour deeds to match these words
or may i never
and you achilles let these threats alone
till accident or purpose bring you to't
you may have every day enough of hector
if you have stomach the general state i fear
can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
hector i pray you let us see you in the field
we have had pelting wars since you refus'd
the grecians' cause
achilles dost thou entreat me hector
to night all friends
hector thy hand upon that match
agamemnon first all you peers of greece go to my tent
there in the full convive we afterwards
as hector's leisure and your bounties shall
concur together severally entreat him

ulysses at menelaus' tent most princely troilus
there diomed doth feast with him to night

but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
on the fair cressid
troilus shall i sweet lord be bound to you so much
after we part from agamemnons tent
to bring me thither
as gentle tell me of what honour was
this cressida in troy had she no lover there

diomedes farewell till then
cressida good night i prithee come exit diomedes
troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee
but with my heart the other eye doth see
ah poor our sex this fault in us i find
the error of our eye directs our mind
what error leads must err o then conclude
thersites a proof of strength she could not publish more
unless she said 'my mind is now turnd whore'
ulysses alls done my lord
troilus it is
ulysses why stay we then
troilus to make a recordation to my soul
of every syllable that here was spoke
but if i tell how these two did coact
shall i not lie in publishing a truth
an esperance so obstinately strong
that doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears
as if those organs had deceptious functions
created only to calumniate
was cressid here
ulysses i cannot conjure troyan
troilus she was not sure
ulysses most sure she was
troilus why my negation hath no taste of madness
troilus let it not be believ'd for womanhood
think we had mothers do not give advantage
to stubborn critics apt without a theme
for depravation to square the general sex
by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid
ulysses what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
troilus nothing at all unless that this were she
thersites will 'a swagger himself out ons own eyes
troilus this she no this is diomed's cressida
if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
if sanctimony be the god's delight
if there be rule in unity itself
this was not she o madness of discourse
that cause sets up with and against itself
bifold authority where reason can revolt
without perdition and loss assume all reason
without revolt this is and is not cressid
within my soul there doth conduce a fight
divides more wider than the sky and earth
and yet the spacious breadth of this division
admits no orifex for a point as subtle
as ariachne's broken woof to enter
instance o instance strong as pluto's gates
cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
instance o instance strong as heaven itself
the bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolv'd and loos'd
and with another knot five finger tied
the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
of her o'er eaten faith are bound to diomed
ulysses may worthy troilus be half attach'd
with that which here his passion doth express
troilus ay greek and that shall be divulged well
in characters as red as mars his heart
inflam'd with venus never did young man fancy
with so eternal and so fix'd a soul
hark greek as much as i do cressid love
that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm
were it a casque compos'd by vulcans skill
my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout
which shipmen do the hurricano call
constring'd in mass by the almighty sun
shall dizzy with more clamour neptune's ear
in his descent than shall my prompted sword
falling on diomed
thersites he'll tickle it for his concupy
let all untruths stand by thy stained name
and they'll seem glorious
ulysses o contain yourself
your passion draws ears hither
enter aeneas
aeneas i have been seeking you this hour my lord
hector by this is arming him in troy

troilus accept distracted thanks
exeunt troilus aeneas and ulysses
thersites would i could meet that rogue diomed i would croak like
a raven i would bode i would bode patroclus will give me
anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab lechery
lechery still wars and lechery nothing else holds fashion a

cassandra the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
they are polluted off'rings more abhorr'd
than spotted livers in the sacrifice
andromache o be persuaded do not count it holy
to hurt by being just it is as lawful
for we would give much to use violent thefts
and rob in the behalf of charity
cassandra it is the purpose that makes strong the vow

stealing and giving odour enough no more
'tis not so sweet now as it was before
o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
that notwithstanding thy capacity
receiveth as the sea nought enters there
of what validity and pitch soe'er
but falls into abatement and low price
even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical

with eye offending brine all this to season
a brother's dead love which she would keep fresh
and lasting in her sad remembrance
to pay this debt of love but to a brother
how will she love when the rich golden shaft
hath killd the flock of all affections else

captain it is perchance that you yourself were saved
viola o my poor brother and so perchance may he be
assure yourself after our ship did split
when you and those poor number saved with you
hung on our driving boat i saw your brother
most provident in peril bind himself
courage and hope both teaching him the practice
to a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea
where like arion on the dolphins back
i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
so long as i could see
mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope

captain and so is now or was so very late

viola what's she
captain a virtuous maid the daughter of a count
that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
who shortly also died for whose dear love
they say she hath abjur'd the company
and sight of men
viola o that i serv'd that lady
and might not be delivered to the world
till i had made mine own occasion mellow
what my estate is
captain that were hard to compass
because she will admit no kind of suit
viola there is a fair behaviour in thee captain
and though that nature with a beauteous wall
doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
i will believe thou hast a mind that suits
with this thy fair and outward character
i prithee and i'll pay thee bounteously
conceal me what i am and be my aid
for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent i'll serve this duke
it may be worth thy pains for i can sing
and speak to him in many sorts of music
that will allow me very worth his service
what else may hap to time i will commit
only shape thou silence to my wit
captain be you his eunuch and your mute i'll be
when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see

extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of
modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to

scene iv
enter duke viola curio and others
duke give me some music now good morrow friends
now good cesario but that piece of song
that old and antique song we heard last night
methought it did relieve my passion much
more than light airs and recollected terms
of these most brisk and giddy paced times
come but one verse
curio he is not here so please your lordship that should sing
duke who was it
curio feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady olivia's
father took much delight in he is about the house
duke seek him out and play the tune the while
exit curio music plays
come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
in the sweet pangs of it remember me
for such as i am all true lovers are
unstaid and skittish in all motions else
that is belov'd how dost thou like this tune
viola it gives a very echo to the seat
where love is thrond
duke thou dost speak masterly
my life upont young though thou art thine eye
hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
hath it not boy
viola a little by your favour
duke what kind of woman is't
duke she is not worth thee then what years i' faith
viola about your years my lord
duke too old by heaven let still the woman take
an elder than herself so wears she to him
so sways she level in her husband's heart
for boy however we do praise ourselves
our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
more longing wavering sooner lost and won
than womens are
duke then let thy love be younger than thyself
or thy affection cannot hold the bent
for women are as roses whose fair flow'r
being once display'd doth fall that very hour
viola and so they are alas that they are so
to die even when they to perfection grow
re enter curio and clown
duke o fellow come the song we had last night
mark it cesario it is old and plain
and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
do use to chant it it is silly sooth
and dallies with the innocence of love
like the old age
clown are you ready sir
duke ay prithee sing music
feste's song
come away come away death
and in sad cypress let me be laid
i am slain by a fair cruel maid
my shroud of white stuck all with yew
o prepare it
my part of death no one so true
did share it
not a flower not a flower sweet
on my black coffin let there be strown
not a friend not a friend greet
my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
lay me o where
sad true lover never find my grave
to weep there
duke there's for thy pains
clown no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir
duke i'll pay thy pleasure then
clown truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
duke give me now leave to leave thee
clown now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy
would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business
might be everything and their intent everywhere for that's it
that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewell
exit clown
duke let all the rest give place
exeunt curio and attendants
once more cesario
get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
tell her my love more noble than the world
the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her
tell her i hold as giddily as fortune
but 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
that nature pranks her in attracts my soul
viola but if she cannot love you sir
duke i cannot be so answer'd
viola sooth but you must
say that some lady as perhaps there is
hath for your love as great a pang of heart
you tell her so must she not then be answer'd
duke there is no womans sides
can bide the beating of so strong a passion
as love doth give my heart no womans heart
so big to hold so much they lack retention
alas their love may be calld appetite
no motion of the liver but the palate
that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
but mine is all as hungry as the sea
between that love a woman can bear me
and that i owe olivia
viola ay but i know
duke what dost thou know
viola too well what love women to men may owe
in faith they are as true of heart as we
my father had a daughter lov'd a man
as it might be perhaps were i a woman
i should your lordship
viola a blank my lord she never told her love
but let concealment like a worm i' th' bud
feed on her damask cheek she pind in thought
and with a green and yellow melancholy
she sat like patience on a monument
smiling at grief was not this love indeed
we men may say more swear more but indeed
our shows are more than will for still we prove
much in our vows but little in our love
viola i am all the daughters of my father's house
and all the brothers too and yet i know not
sir shall i to this lady
duke ay that's the theme
to her in haste give her this jewel say
my love can give no place bide no denay exeunt

caught with tickling
enter malvolio
malvolio 'tis but fortune all is fortune maria once told me she
did affect me and i have heard herself come thus near that
should she fancy it should be one of my complexion besides she
uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that
follows her what should i think ont
sir toby here's an overweening rogue
fabian o peace contemplation makes a rare turkey cock of him
how he jets under his advanc'd plumes
sir toby peace i say
malvolio to be count malvolio

fabian o peace now he's deeply in look how imagination blows
malvolio having been three months married to her sitting in my
empty
sir toby o for a stone bow to hit him in the eye
malvolio calling my officers about me in my branch'd velvet gown
having come from a day bed where i have left olivia sleeping
sir toby fire and brimstone
fabian o peace peace
malvolio and then to have the humour of state and after a demure
travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they
sir toby bolts and shackles
fabian o peace peace peace now now
malvolio seven of my people with an obedient start make out for
him i frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play
with my some rich jewel toby approaches curtsies there to me
sir toby shall this fellow live
fabian though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
malvolio i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile
with an austere regard of control
malvolio saying 'cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on your
niece give me this prerogative of speech'
sir toby what what
malvolio 'you must amend your drunkenness'
sir toby out scab
fabian nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot

foolish knight'
aguecheek that's me i warrant you
aguecheek i knew 'twas i for many do call me fool
malvolio what employment have we here
taking up the letter

sir toby o peace and the spirit of humours intimate reading
aloud to him
malvolio by my life this is my lady's hand these be her very
c's her u's and her t's and thus makes she her great p's it
is in contempt of question her hand
malvolio reads 'to the unknown belov'd this and my good
wishes' her very phrases by your leave wax soft and the
impressure her lucrece with which she uses to seal 'tis my lady
to whom should this be
fabian this wins him liver and all
malvolio reads
jove knows i love
but who
lips do not move
'no man must know' what follows the numbers alter'd
'no man must know' if this should be thee malvolio
sir toby marry hang thee brock
malvolio reads
'i may command where i adore
but silence like a lucrece knife
with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
m o a i doth sway my life'
fabian a fustian riddle
malvolio 'm o a i doth sway my life'
nay but first let me see let me see let me see
fabian what dish o' poison has she dress'd him
sir toby and with what wing the staniel checks at it
malvolio 'i may command where i adore' why she may command me i
serve her she is my lady why this is evident to any formal
capacity there is no obstruction in this and the end what
should that alphabetical position portend if i could make that
resemble something in me softly m o a i
fabian sowter will cry upont for all this though it be as rank
as a fox
malvolio m malvolio m why that begins my name
fabian did not i say he would work it out
the cur is excellent at faults
malvolio m but then there is no consonancy in the sequel that
suffers under probation a should follow but o does
fabian and o shall end i hope
sir toby ay or i'll cudgel him and make him cry 'o'
fabian ay an you had any eye behind you you might see more
detraction at your heels than fortunes before you

every reason excites to this that my lady loves me she did
commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being
cross garter'd and in this she manifests herself to my love and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her
yellow stockings and cross garter'd even with the swiftness of
putting on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a

first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow
stockings and 'tis a colour she abhors and cross garter'd a

viola save thee friend and thy music
clown no sir i live by the church
viola art thou a churchman
clown no such matter sir i do live by the church for i do live
at my house and my house doth stand by the church
viola so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar
dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor

clown you have said sir to see this age a sentence is but a
chev'ril glove to a good wit how quickly the wrong side may be
viola nay that's certain they that dally nicely with words may
quickly make them wanton
clown i would therefore my sister had had name sir
viola why man
clown why sir her name's a word and to dally with that word
might make my sister wanton but indeed words are very rascals
since bonds disgrac'd them
viola thy reason man
clown troth sir i can yield you none without words and words
viola i warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for nothing
clown not so sir i do care for something but in my conscience

clown no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she will keep
no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands
as pilchers are to herrings the husband's the bigger i am
indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words
clown foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it
shines everywhere i would be sorry sir but the fool should be
as oft with your master as with my mistress think i saw your
wisdom there

clown i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring a
cressida to this troilus
viola i understand you sir 'tis well begg'd
giving another coin
clown the matter i hope is not great sir begging but a beggar
cressida was a beggar my lady is within sir i will construe to
them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of
exit clown
viola this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
and to do that well craves a kind of wit
he must observe their mood on whom he jests
the quality of persons and the time
and like the haggard check at every feather
that comes before his eye this is a practice
as full of labour as a wise mans art
for folly that he wisely shows is fit

viola madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts
on his behalf
olivia o by your leave i pray you
i bade you never speak again of him
i had rather hear you to solicit that
than music from the spheres
viola dear lady
olivia give me leave beseech you i did send
after the last enchantment you did here
a ring in chase of you so did i abuse
myself my servant and i fear me you
under your hard construction must i sit
to force that on you in a shameful cunning
have you not set mine honour at the stake
and baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
that tyrannous heart can think to one of your receiving
enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
hides my heart so let me hear you speak
viola i pity you
olivia that's a degree to love
viola no not a grize for 'tis a vulgar proof
that very oft we pity enemies

olivia i would you were as i would have you be
viola would it be better madam than i am
i wish it might for now i am your fool
in the contempt and anger of his lip

cesario by the roses of the spring
by maidhood honour truth and every thing
i love thee so that maugre all thy pride
nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
do not extort thy reasons from this clause
for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause
love sought is good but given unsought is better
viola by innocence i swear and by my youth
i have one heart one bosom and one truth
and that no woman has nor never none
shall mistress be of it save i alone

exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in
your heart and brimstone in your liver you should then have
mint you should have bang'd the youth into dumbness this was
look'd for at your hand and this was baulk'd the double gilt of
this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now saild

icicle on dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some
laudable attempt either of valour or policy

being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
unguided and unfriended often prove
rough and unhospitable my willing love
set forth in your pursuit
sebastian my kind antonio
i can no other answer make but thanks
and thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns
are shuffld off with such uncurrent pay
but were my worth as is my conscience firm
you should find better dealing what's to do
shall we go see the reliques of this town
antonio to morrow sir best first go see your lodging
i pray you let us satisfy our eyes
with the memorials and the things of fame
that do renown this city
antonio would you'd pardon me
i do not without danger walk these streets
once in a sea fight 'gainst the count his galleys
i did some service of such note indeed
that were i ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd
sebastian belike you slew great number of his people
albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
might well have given us bloody argument
it might have since been answer'd in repaying
what we took from them which for traffic's sake
most of our city did only myself stood out
for which if i be lapsed in this place
i shall pay dear
sebastian do not then walk too open
antonio it doth not fit me hold sir here's my purse
is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet
whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
with viewing of the town there shall you have me
sebastian why i your purse
antonio haply your eye shall light upon some toy
you have desire to purchase and your store
i think is not for idle markets sir
sebastian i'll be your purse bearer and leave you for
an hour
sebastian i do remember exeunt
scene iv
olivia's garden
enter olivia and maria
olivia i have sent after him he says he'll come

where is malvolio
maria he's coming madam but in very strange manner
he is sure possess'd madam

how now malvolio
malvolio sweet lady ho ho
olivia smilst thou
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion

obstruction in the blood this cross gartering but what of that
if it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true
sonnet is 'please one and please all'
malvolio not black in my mind though yellow in my legs
it did come to his hands and commands shall be executed
i think we do know the sweet roman hand
olivia wilt thou go to bed malvolio

people have a special care of him i would not have him miscarry
for the half of my dowry
exeunt olivia and maria
malvolio o ho do you come near me now no worse man than sir
toby to look to me this concurs directly with the letter she
sends him on purpose that i may appear stubborn to him for she
incites me to that in the letter 'cast thy humble slough' says
tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick
of singularity' and consequently sets down the manner how as a
sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of
some sir of note and so forth i have lim'd her but it is
jove's doing and jove make me thankful and when she went away
now 'let this fellow be look'd to' 'fellow' not 'malvolio' nor
after my degree but 'fellow' why everything adheres together
that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle
no incredulous or unsafe circumstance what can be said nothing
hopes well jove not i is the doer of this and he is to be
empty

sir toby come we'll have him in a dark room and bound my niece

madmen but see but see
enter sir andrew
fabian more matter for a may morning
aguecheek here's the challenge read it i warrant there's vinegar
and pepper int
fabian is't so saucy
aguecheek ay is't i warrant him do but read
sir toby give me reads 'youth whatsoever thou art thou art
fabian good and valiant
sir toby reads 'wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why i do
call thee so for i will show thee no reason for't'
fabian a good note that keeps you from the blow of the law
sir toby reads 'thou com'st to the lady olivia and in my sight
she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not
the matter i challenge thee for'
fabian very brief and to exceeding good sense less
sir toby reads 'i will waylay thee going home where if it be
fabian good
sir toby 'thou killst me like a rogue and a villain'
fabian still you keep o' th' windy side of the law good
sir toby reads 'fare thee well and god have mercy upon one of
our souls he may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better
and so look to thyself thy friend as thou usest him and thy
sworn enemy
andrew aguecheek'
if this letter move him not his legs cannot i'll give't him
commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
sir toby go sir andrew scout me for him at the corner of the
orchard like a bum baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw
and as thou draw'st swear horrible for it comes to pass oft
that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd
off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would
have earnd him away
aguecheek nay let me alone for swearing exit
sir toby now will not i deliver his letter for the behaviour of
breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms
no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant
will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of
mouth set upon aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the
gentleman as know his youth will aptly receive it into a most
hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity this
will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the
look like cockatrices
fabian here he comes with your niece give them way till he take
leave and presently after him
sir toby i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a
empty
exeunt sir toby fabian and maria
olivia i have said too much unto a heart of stone
and laid mine honour too unchary out
there's something in me that reproves my fault
but such a headstrong potent fault it is
viola with the same haviour that your passion bears
goes on my master's griefs
olivia here wear this jewel for me 'tis my picture
refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
and i beseech you come again to morrow

opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can
furnish man withal
viola i pray you sir what is he
consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and
bodies hath he divorc'd three and his incensement at this moment
is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of
death and sepulchre hob nob is his word give't or take't
viola i will return again into the house and desire some conduct
of the lady i am no fighter i have heard of some kind of men
that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour
belike this is a man of that quirk

back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with
me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on
or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that's
certain or forswear to wear iron about you
viola this is as uncivil as strange i beseech you do me this

arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more

indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that
you could possibly have found in any part of illyria will you
walk towards him i will make your peace with him if i can

for's oath sake marry he hath better bethought him of his
quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of

lest that it make me so unsound a man
that i have done for you

scene iii
olivia's garden
sebastian this is the air that is the glorious sun
this pearl she gave me i do feelt and see't
and though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus
yet 'tis not madness where's antonio then
i could not find him at the elephant
yet there he was and there i found this credit
that he did range the town to seek me out
his counsel now might do me golden service
for though my soul disputes well with my sense
yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
so far exceed all instance all discourse
that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
to any other trust but that i am mad
or else the lady's mad yet if 'twere so
she could not sway her house command her followers
take and give back affairs and their dispatch
with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
that is deceivable but here the lady comes
enter olivia and priest
olivia blame not this haste of mine if you mean well
now go with me and with this holy man
into the chantry by there before him
and underneath that consecrated roof
plight me the fun assurance of your faith
that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
may live at peace he shall conceal it
what time we will our celebration keep
according to my birth what do you say
sebastian i'll follow this good man and go with you
and having sworn truth ever will be true
olivia then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
that they may fairly note this act of mine exeunt

empty
duke just the contrary the better for thy friends
clown no sir the worse
duke how can that be
clown marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me now my
foes tell me plainly i am an ass so that by my foes sir i
profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends i am abused
so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make
your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and
duke why this is excellent
clown by my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my
empty
duke thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold
clown but that it would be double dealing sir i would you could
make it another
duke o you give me ill counsel
clown put your grace in your pocket sir for this once and let
your flesh and blood obey it
there's another
clown primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying
is 'the third pays for all' the triplex sir is a good tripping
measure or the bells of saint bennet sir may put you in mind

duke you can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you
will let your lady know i am here to speak with her and bring
her along with you it may awake my bounty further
clown marry sir lullaby to your bounty till i come again i go
is the sin of covetousness but as you say sir let your bounty
take a nap i will awake it anon exit
enter antonio and officers
viola here comes the man sir that did rescue me
duke that face of his i do remember well
yet when i saw it last it was besmear'd
as black as vulcan in the smoke of war
a baubling vessel was he captain of
for shallow draught and bulk unprizable
with the most noble bottom of our fleet
that very envy and the tongue of los
cried fame and honour on him what's the matter
first officer orsino this is that antonio
that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy
and this is he that did the tiger board
when your young nephew titus lost his leg
here in the streets desperate of shame and state
in private brabble did we apprehend him
but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
i know not what 'twas but distraction
duke notable pirate thou salt water thief
what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
hast made thine enemies
antonio orsino noble sir
be pleas'd that i shake off these names you give me
antonio never yet was thief or pirate
orsino's enemy a witchcraft drew me hither
that most ingrateful boy there by your side
from the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
did i redeem a wreck past hope he was
his life i gave him and did thereto ad
my love without retention or restraint
all his in dedication for his sake
did i expose myself pure for his love
into the danger of this adverse town
where being apprehended his false cunning
not meaning to partake with me in danger
taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
and grew a twenty years removed thing
while one would wink denied me mine own purse
which i had recommended to his use
not half an hour before
viola how can this be
duke when came he to this town
no int'rim not a minute's vacancy
both day and night did we keep company
enter olivia and attendants
duke here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness
three months this youth hath tended upon me
but more of that anon take him aside
olivia what would my lord but that he may not have
wherein olivia may seem serviceable
viola madam
duke gracious olivia
olivia what do you say cesario good my lord
viola my lord would speak my duty hushes me
olivia if it be aught to the old tune my lord
it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
as howling after music
duke still so cruel
olivia still so constant lord
to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
my soul the faithfullst off'rings hath breath'd out
that e'er devotion tender'd what shall i do
olivia even what it please my lord that shall become him
duke why should i not had i the heart to do it
like to the egyptian thief at point of death
kill what i love a savage jealousy
that sometime savours nobly but hear me this
since you to non regardance cast my faith
that screws me from my true place in your favour
live you the marble breasted tyrant still
but this your minion whom i know you love
and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly

enter sebastian
sebastian i am sorry madam i have hurt your kinsman
but had it been the brother of my blood
i must have done no less with wit and safety
you throw a strange regard upon me and by that
i do perceive it hath offended you
pardon me sweet one even for the vows
we made each other but so late ago
a natural perspective that is and is not
sebastian antonio o my dear antonio
how have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me
since i have lost thee
antonio sebastian are you
sebastian fear'st thou that antonio
antonio how have you made division of yourself
an apple cleft in two is not more twin
than these two creatures which is sebastian
sebastian do i stand there i never had a brother
nor can there be that deity in my nature
of here and everywhere i had a sister
whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd
of charity what kin are you to me
what countryman what name what parentage
viola of messaline sebastian was my father
such a sebastian was my brother too
so went he suited to his watery tomb
you come to fright us
sebastian a spirit i am indeed
but am in that dimension grossly clad
which from the womb i did participate
were you a woman as the rest goes even
i should my tears let fall upon your cheek
and say 'thrice welcome drowned viola'
viola my father had a mole upon his brow
sebastian and so had mine
had numb'red thirteen years
sebastian o that record is lively in my soul
he finished indeed his mortal act
that day that made my sister thirteen years
viola if nothing lets to make us happy both
but this my masculine usurp'd attire
do not embrace me till each circumstance
of place time fortune do cohere and jump
that i am viola which to confirm
where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
i was preserv'd to serve this noble count
all the occurrence of my fortune since
hath been between this lady and this lord
sebastian to olivia so comes it lady you have been mistook
but nature to her bias drew in that
you would have been contracted to a maid
nor are you therein by my life deceiv'd
you are betroth'd both to a maid and man
if this be so as yet the glass seems true
i shall have share in this most happy wreck
to viola boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
thou never shouldst love woman like to me
viola and all those sayings will i overswear
and all those swearings keep as true in soul
as doth that orbed continent the fire
that severs day from night
duke give me thy hand
viola the captain that did bring me first on shore
hath my maid's garments he upon some action
is now in durance at malvolio's suit
a gentleman and follower of my lady's
olivia he shall enlarge him fetch malvolio hither
and yet alas now i remember me
they say poor gentleman he's much distract
re enter clown with a letter and fabian
a most extracting frenzy of mine own
how does he sirrah
clown truly madam he holds belzebub at the stave's end as well
as a man in his case may do has here writ a letter to you i
should have given 't you to day morning but as a madmans
epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are
empty
olivia opent and read it
clown look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the
madman reads madly 'by the lord madam '
clown no madam i do but read madness an your ladyship will have
it as it ought to be you must allow vox
olivia prithee read i' thy right wits
clown so i do madonna but to read his right wits is to read
thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
olivia to fabian read it you sirrah
fabian reads 'by the lord madam you wrong me and the world
shall know it though you have put me into darkness and given
your drunken cousin rule over me yet have i the benefit of my
induced me to the semblance i put on with the which i doubt not
but to do myself much right or you much shame think of me as you
please i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of
my injury
the madly us'd malvolio'
olivia did he write this
clown ay madam
duke this savours not much of distraction
olivia see him deliver'd fabian bring him hither
my lord so please you these things further thought on
to think me as well a sister as a wife
one day shall crown th' alliance ont so please you
here at my house and at my proper cost
duke madam i am most apt t' embrace your offer
to viola your master quits you and for your service done
empty
so much against the mettle of your sex
so far beneath your soft and tender breeding
here is my hand you shall from this time be
you master's mistress
olivia a sister you are she
re enter fabian with malvolio
duke is this the madman
olivia ay my lord this same
how now malvolio
malvolio madam you have done me wrong
notorious wrong
malvolio lady you have pray you peruse that letter
you must not now deny it is your hand
write from it if you can in hand or phrase
or say 'tis not your seal not your invention
you can say none of this well grant it then
and tell me in the modesty of honour
why you have given me such clear lights of favour
bade me come smiling and cross garter'd to you
to put on yellow stockings and to frown
and acting this in an obedient hope
why have you suffer'd me to be imprisond
kept in a dark house visited by the priest
and made the most notorious geck and gul
that e'er invention play'd on tell me why
olivia alas malvolio this is not my writing
though i confess much like the character
but out of question 'tis maria's hand
and now i do bethink me it was she
and in such forms which here were presuppos'd
upon thee in the letter prithee be content
this practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee
but when we know the grounds and authors of it
thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
of thine own cause
fabian good madam hear me speak
and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
taint the condition of this present hour
most freely i confess myself and toby
set this device against malvolio here
upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
we had conceiv'd against him maria writ
the letter at sir toby's great importance
in recompense whereof he hath married her
how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
olivia alas poor fool how have they baffld thee
clown why 'some are born great some achieve greatness and some
have greatness thrown upon them' i was one sir in this
interlude one sir topas sir but that's all one 'by the lord
fool i am not mad' but do you remember 'madam why laugh you
at such a barren rascal an you smile not he's gagg'd' and thus
the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
malvolio i'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you
empty
duke pursue him and entreat him to a peace
he hath not told us of the captain yet
when that is known and golden time convents
a solemn combination shall be made
of our dear souls meantime sweet sister
we will not part from hence cesario come
for so you shall be while you are a man
but when in other habits you are seen
orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen
clown sings
when that i was and a little tiny boy
with hey ho the wind and the rain
a foolish thing was but a toy
for the rain it raineth every day
but when i came to mans estate
with hey ho the wind and the rain
'gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
for the rain it raineth every day
with hey ho the wind and the rain
by swaggering could i never thrive
for the rain it raineth every day
but when i came unto my beds
with hey ho the wind and the rain
with toss pots still had drunken heads
for the rain it raineth every day
a great while ago the world begun
with hey ho the wind and the rain
and we'll strive to please you every day

verona milan the frontiers of mantua
act i scene i
verona an open place
enter valentine and proteus
valentine cease to persuade my loving proteus
were't not affection chains thy tender days
to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love
i rather would entreat thy company
to see the wonders of the world abroad
than living dully sluggardiz'd at home
wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
but since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein
even as i would when i to love begin
proteus wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu
some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
wish me partaker in thy happiness
when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
if ever danger do environ thee
commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
for i will be thy headsman valentine
valentine and on a love book pray for my success
proteus upon some book i love i'll pray for thee
valentine that's on some shallow story of deep love
proteus that's a deep story of a deeper love
for he was more than over shoes in love
valentine 'tis true for you are over boots in love
and yet you never swum the hellespont
proteus over the boots nay give me not the boots
valentine no i will not for it boots thee not
proteus what
valentine to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment's mirth
if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
if lost why then a grievous labour won
however but a folly bought with wit
or else a wit by folly vanquished
proteus so by your circumstance you call me fool
valentine so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove
proteus 'tis love you cavil at i am not love
valentine love is your master for he masters you
and he that is so yoked by a fool
proteus yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
the eating canker dwells so eating love
inhabits in the finest wits of all
valentine and writers say as the most forward bud
is eaten by the canker ere it blow
even so by love the young and tender wit
is turnd to folly blasting in the bud
losing his verdure even in the prime
and all the fair effects of future hopes
that art a votary to fond desire
once more adieu my father at the road
expects my coming there to see me shipp'd
proteus and thither will i bring thee valentine
valentine sweet proteus no now let us take our leave
to milan let me hear from thee by letters
of thy success in love and what news else
betideth here in absence of thy friend
and i likewise will visit thee with mine
valentine as much to you at home and so farewell
exit valentine
proteus he after honour hunts i after love
he leaves his friends to dignify them more
i leave myself my friends and all for love
thou julia thou hast metamorphis'd me
made me neglect my studies lose my time
war with good counsel set the world at nought
made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
speed sir proteus save you saw you my master
proteus but now he parted hence to embark for milan
speed twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
and i have play'd the sheep in losing him
proteus indeed a sheep doth very often stray
an if the shepherd be awhile away
speed you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and
i a sheep
proteus i do
proteus a silly answer and fitting well a sheep
speed this proves me still a sheep
proteus true and thy master a shepherd
speed nay that i can deny by a circumstance
proteus it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another
speed the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me
therefore i am no sheep
proteus the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for
thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a
empty
speed such another proof will make me cry 'baa'
proteus but dost thou hear gav'st thou my letter to julia
speed ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a lac'd
mutton and she a lac'd mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing
for my labour
proteus here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons
speed if the ground be overcharg'd you were best stick her
speed nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
empty
proteus you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold
speed from a pound to a pin fold it over and over
'tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover
proteus but what said she
speed nodding ay
proteus nod ay why that's 'noddy'
speed you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she
proteus and that set together is 'noddy'
speed now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for
your pains
proteus no no you shall have it for bearing the letter
speed well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you
proteus why sir how do you bear with me
speed marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the
word 'noddy' for my pains
proteus beshrew me but you have a quick wit
proteus come come open the matter in brief what said she
speed open your purse that the money and the matter may be both
at once delivered
proteus well sir here is for your pains what said she
speed truly sir i think you'll hardly win her
proteus why couldst thou perceive so much from her
speed sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so
much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to
me that brought your mind i fear she'll prove as hard to you in
hard as steel
proteus what said she nothing
speed no not so much as 'take this for thy pains' to testify
your bounty i thank you you have testernd me in requital
whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir
i'll commend you to my master
proteus go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
which cannot perish having thee aboard
being destind to a drier death on shore exit speed
i fear my julia would not deign my lines
receiving them from such a worthless post exit

verona the garden of julia's house
enter julia and lucetta
julia but say lucetta now we are alone
wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
lucetta ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
julia of all the fair resort of gentlemen
in thy opinion which is worthiest love
lucetta please you repeat their names i'll show my mind
according to my shallow simple skill
julia what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour
lucetta as of a knight well spoken neat and fine
but were i you he never should be mine
julia what think'st thou of the rich mercatio
lucetta well of his wealth but of himself so so
julia what think'st thou of the gentle proteus
julia how now what means this passion at his name
lucetta pardon dear madam 'tis a passing shame
that i unworthy body as i am
should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
julia why not on proteus as of all the rest
lucetta then thus of many good i think him best
julia your reason
lucetta i have no other but a womans reason
i think him so because i think him so
lucetta ay if you thought your love not cast away
julia why he of all the rest hath never mov'd me
lucetta yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye
julia his little speaking shows his love but small
lucetta fire that's closest kept burns most of all
julia they do not love that do not show their love
lucetta o they love least that let men know their love
julia i would i knew his mind
lucetta peruse this paper madam
lucetta that the contents will show
julia say say who gave it thee
lucetta sir valentine's page and sent i think from proteus
he would have given it you but i being in the way
did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray
julia now by my modesty a goodly broker
dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
to whisper and conspire against my youth
now trust me 'tis an office of great worth
there take the paper see it be returnd
or else return no more into my sight
lucetta to plead for love deserves more fee than hate
julia will ye be gone
lucetta that you may ruminate exit
julia and yet i would i had o'erlook'd the letter
it were a shame to call her back again
and pray her to a fault for which i chid her
what fool is she that knows i am a maid
since maids in modesty say 'no' to that
which they would have the profferer construe 'ay'
fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
and presently all humbled kiss the rod
how churlishly i chid lucetta hence
when willingly i would have had her here
how angerly i taught my brow to frown
when inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile
and ask remission for my folly past
what ho lucetta
re enter lucetta
lucetta what would your ladyship
julia is't near dinner time
lucetta i would it were
that you might kill your stomach on your meat
and not upon your maid
julia what is't that you took up so gingerly
julia why didst thou stoop then
lucetta to take a paper up that i let fall
julia and is that paper nothing
lucetta nothing concerning me
julia then let it lie for those that it concerns
lucetta madam it will not lie where it concerns
unless it have a false interpreter
julia some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
lucetta that i might sing it madam to a tune
julia as little by such toys as may be possible
best sing it to the tune of 'light o' love'
lucetta it is too heavy for so light a tune
julia heavy belike it hath some burden then
lucetta ay and melodious were it would you sing it
julia and why not you
lucetta i cannot reach so high
julia let's see your song lucetta withholds the letter
how now minion
and yet methinks i do not like this tune
julia you do not
lucetta no madam 'tis too sharp
julia you minion are too saucy
lucetta nay now you are too flat
and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
julia the mean is drownd with your unruly bass
lucetta indeed i bid the base for proteus
here is a coil with protestation tears the letter
go get you gone and let the papers lie
you would be fing'ring them to anger me
lucetta she makes it strange but she would be best pleas'd
to be so ang'red with another letter exit
julia nay would i were so ang'red with the same
o hateful hands to tear such loving words
injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
look here is writ 'kind julia' unkind julia
as in revenge of thy ingratitude
i throw thy name against the bruising stones
trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
and here is writ 'love wounded proteus'
poor wounded name my bosomas a bed
shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heald
and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss
but twice or thrice was 'proteus' written down
till i have found each letter in the letter
except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
unto a ragged fearful hanging rock
and throw it thence into the raging sea
lo here in one line is his name twice writ
'poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus
to the sweet julia' that i'll tear away
and yet i will not sith so prettily
he couples it to his complaining names
now kiss embrace contend do what you will
re enter lucetta
lucetta madam
dinner is ready and your father stays
julia well let us go
lucetta what shall these papers lie like tell tales here
julia if you respect them best to take them up
lucetta nay i was taken up for laying them down
yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
lucetta ay madam you may say what sights you see
i see things too although you judge i wink
julia come come willt please you go exeunt
scene iii
verona antonio's house
enter antonio and panthino
antonio tell me panthino what sad talk was that
wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
panthino 'twas of his nephew proteus your son
panthino he wond'red that your lordship
would suffer him to spend his youth at home
while other men of slender reputation
put forth their sons to seek preferment out
some to the wars to try their fortune there
some to discover islands far away
some to the studious universities
for any or for all these exercises
he said that proteus your son was meet
to let him spend his time no more at home
which would be great impeachment to his age
in having known no travel in his youth
antonio nor need'st thou much importune me to that
whereon this month i have been hammering
i have consider'd well his loss of time
and how he cannot be a perfect man
not being tried and tutor'd in the world
experience is by industry achiev'd
then tell me whither were i best to send him
panthino i think your lordship is not ignorant
how his companion youthful valentine
attends the emperor in his royal court
antonio i know it well
panthino 'twere good i think your lordship sent him thither
there shall he practise tilts and tournaments
hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
and be in eye of every exercise
antonio i like thy counsel well hast thou advis'd
and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it
the execution of it shall make known
even with the speediest expedition
i will dispatch him to the emperor's court
panthino to morrow may it please you don alphonso
with other gentlemen of good esteem
are journeying to salute the emperor
and to commend their service to his will
enter proteus
and in good time now will we break with him
proteus sweet love sweet lines sweet life
here is her hand the agent of her heart
here is her oath for love her honour's pawn
o that our fathers would applaud our loves
to seal our happiness with their consents
o heavenly julia
antonio how now what letter are you reading there
of commendations sent from valentine
deliver'd by a friend that came from him
antonio lend me the letter let me see what news
proteus there is no news my lord but that he writes
how happily he lives how well belov'd
and daily graced by the emperor
wishing me with him partner of his fortune
antonio and how stand you affected to his wish
proteus as one relying on your lordship's will
antonio my will is something sorted with his wish
muse not that i thus suddenly proceed
for what i will i will and there an end
i am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
with valentinus in the emperor's court
what maintenance he from his friends receives
like exhibition thou shalt have from me
to morrow be in readiness to go
excuse it not for i am peremptory
please you deliberate a day or two
antonio look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
no more of stay to morrow thou must go
come on panthino you shall be employ'd
to hasten on his expedition
exeunt antonio and panthino
proteus thus have i shunnd the fire for fear of burning
and drench'd me in the sea where i am drownd
i fear'd to show my father julia's letter
and with the vantage of mine own excuse
hath he excepted most against my love
o how this spring of love resembleth
the uncertain glory of an april day
which now shows all the beauty of the sun
and by an by a cloud takes all away
re enter panthino
panthino sir proteus your father calls for you
he is in haste therefore i pray you go
and yet a thousand times it answers 'no' exeunt
act ii scene i

enter valentine and speed
speed sir your glove
valentine not mine my gloves are on
speed why then this may be yours for this is but one
valentine ha let me see ay give it me it's mine
sweet ornament that decks a thing divine
speed calling madam silvia madam silvia
valentine how now sirrah
speed she is not within hearing sir
valentine why sir who bade you call her
speed your worship sir or else i mistook
valentine well you'll still be too forward
speed and yet i was last chidden for being too slow
valentine go to sir tell me do you know madam silvia
speed she that your worship loves
speed marry by these special marks first you have learnd like
sir proteus to wreath your arms like a malcontent to relish a
love song like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that
had the pestilence to sigh like a school boy that had lost his
a b c to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam
to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears
robbing to speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were
wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walk'd to
walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently
and now you are metamorphis'd with a mistress that when i look
on you i can hardly think you my master
valentine are all these things perceiv'd in me
speed they are all perceiv'd without ye
valentine without me they cannot
speed without you nay that's certain for without you were so
simple none else would but you are so without these follies
that these follies are within you and shine through you like the
water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
valentine but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia
speed she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
valentine hast thou observ'd that even she i mean
speed why sir i know her not
valentine dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet know'st
her not
speed is she not hard favour'd sir
valentine not so fair boy as well favour'd
speed sir i know that well enough
speed that she is not so fair as of you well favour'd
valentine i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour
empty
speed that's because the one is painted and the other out of all
empty
valentine how painted and how out of count
speed marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts
of her beauty
valentine how esteem'st thou me i account of her beauty
valentine how long hath she been deform'd
speed ever since you lov'd her
valentine i have lov'd her ever since i saw her and still
i see her beautiful
speed if you love her you cannot see her
valentine why
speed because love is blind o that you had mine eyes or your own
eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir
proteus for going ungarter'd
speed your own present folly and her passing deformity for he
being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being
in love cannot see to put on your hose
valentine belike boy then you are in love for last morning you
could not see to wipe my shoes
speed true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you you
swing'd me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you
for yours
valentine in conclusion i stand affected to her
valentine last night she enjoind me to write some lines to one
she loves
speed and have you
valentine i have
speed are they not lamely writ
valentine no boy but as well as i can do them
enter silvia
peace here she comes
speed aside o excellent motion o exceeding puppet
valentine madam and mistress a thousand good morrows
speed aside o give ye good ev'n
here's a million of manners
silvia sir valentine and servant to you two thousand
speed aside he should give her interest and she gives it him
valentine as you enjoind me i have writ your letter
unto the secret nameless friend of yours
which i was much unwilling to proceed in
but for my duty to your ladyship
valentine now trust me madam it came hardly off
for being ignorant to whom it goes
i writ at random very doubtfully
silvia perchance you think too much of so much pains
valentine no madam so it stead you i will write
please you command a thousand times as much
and yet
silvia a pretty period well i guess the sequel
and yet i will not name it and yet i care not
meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
speed aside and yet you will and yet another' yet'
valentine what means your ladyship do you not like it
silvia yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
but since unwillingly take them again

silvia a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
valentine 'tis indeed madam we thank the giver
valentine yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire sir thurio
borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks and spends what he
borrows kindly in your company
thurio sir if you spend word for word with me i shall make your
wit bankrupt
valentine i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words

appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words

of much good news
valentine my lord i will be thankful
to any happy messenger from thence
duke know ye don antonio your countryman
valentine ay my good lord i know the gentleman
to be of worth and worthy estimation
duke hath he not a son
valentine ay my good lord a son that well deserves
the honour and regard of such a father
duke you know him well
valentine i knew him as myself for from our infancy
we have convers'd and spent our hours together
and though myself have been an idle truant
omitting the sweet benefit of time
to clothe mine age with angel like perfection
made use and fair advantage of his days
his years but young but his experience old
his head unmellowed but his judgment ripe
and in a word for far behind his worth
comes all the praises that i now bestow
he is complete in feature and in mind
with all good grace to grace a gentleman
duke beshrew me sir but if he make this good
he is as worthy for an empress' love
well sir this gentleman is come to me
with commendation from great potentates
and here he means to spend his time awhile
i think 'tis no unwelcome news to you
valentine should i have wish'd a thing it had been he
duke welcome him then according to his worth
silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio
for valentine i need not cite him to it
i will send him hither to you presently exit duke
had come along with me but that his mistresss
did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks
silvia belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
upon some other pawn for fealty
valentine nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still
silvia nay then he should be blind and being blind
how could he see his way to seek out you
valentine why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes
thurio they say that love hath not an eye at all
upon a homely object love can wink exit thurio
enter proteus
silvia have done have done here comes the gentleman
valentine welcome dear proteus mistress i beseech you
confirm his welcome with some special favour
silvia his worth is warrant for his welcome hither
if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from
valentine mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
to be my fellow servant to your ladyship
proteus not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
to have a look of such a worthy mistress
valentine leave off discourse of disability
sweet lady entertain him for your servant
proteus my duty will i boast of nothing else
silvia and duty never yet did want his meed
servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
proteus i'll die on him that says so but yourself

thurio madam my lord your father would speak with you

when you have done we look to hear from you
proteus we'll both attend upon your ladyship
exeunt silvia and thurio
valentine now tell me how do all from whence you came
valentine and how do yours
proteus i left them all in health
valentine how does your lady and how thrives your love
proteus my tales of love were wont to weary you
i know you joy not in a love discourse
valentine ay proteus but that life is alter'd now
i have done penance for contemning love
whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
with bitter fasts with penitential groans
for in revenge of my contempt of love
love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes
and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow
o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord
and hath so humbled me as i confess
there is no woe to his correction
nor to his service no such joy on earth
now no discourse except it be of love
now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep
proteus enough i read your fortune in your eye
was this the idol that you worship so
valentine even she and is she not a heavenly saint
proteus no but she is an earthly paragon
valentine call her divine
proteus i will not flatter her
valentine o flatter me for love delights in praises
proteus when i was sick you gave me bitter pills
and i must minister the like to you
yet let her be a principality
sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
proteus except my mistress
valentine sweet except not any
except thou wilt except against my love
proteus have i not reason to prefer mine own
valentine and i will help thee to prefer her too
she shall be dignified with this high honour
to bear my lady's train lest the base earth
and of so great a favour growing proud
disdain to root the summer swelling flow'r
and make rough winter everlastingly
proteus why valentine what braggardism is this
valentine pardon me proteus all i can is nothing
to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
she is alone
proteus then let her alone
valentine not for the world why man she is mine own
as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
forgive me that i do not dream on thee
because thou seest me dote upon my love
my foolish rival that her father likes
only for his possessions are so huge
is gone with her along and i must after
for love thou know'st is full of jealousy
proteus but she loves you
with all the cunning manner of our flight
determind of how i must climb her window
the ladder made of cords and all the means
plotted and 'greed on for my happiness
good proteus go with me to my chamber
in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
proteus go on before i shall enquire you forth
i must unto the road to disembark
some necessaries that i needs must use
valentine will you make haste
proteus i will exit valentine
even as one heat another heat expels
or as one nail by strength drives out another
so the remembrance of my former love
is by a newer object quite forgotten
is it my mind or valentinus' praise
her true perfection or my false transgression
that makes me reasonless to reason thus
that i did love for now my love is thaw'd
which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire
bears no impression of the thing it was
methinks my zeal to valentine is cold
and that i love him not as i was wont
o but i love his lady too too much
and that's the reason i love him so little
how shall i dote on her with more advice
that thus without advice begin to love her
and that hath dazzled my reasons light
but when i look on her perfections
there is no reason but i shall be blind
if i can check my erring love i will
if not to compass her i'll use my skill exit

milan the duke's palace
proteus to leave my julia shall i be forsworn
to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn
to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn
and ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath
provokes me to this threefold perjury
love bade me swear and love bids me forswear
o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinnd
teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
at first i did adore a twinkling star
unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
and he wants wit that wants resolved will
to learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better
fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths
i cannot leave to love and yet i do
but there i leave to love where i should love
julia i lose and valentine i lose
if i lose them thus find i by their loss
for valentine myself for julia silvia
i to myself am dearer than a friend
for love is still most precious in itself
and silvia witness heaven that made her fair
shows julia but a swarthy ethiope
i will forget that julia is alive
rememb'ring that my love to her is dead
and valentine i'll hold an enemy
i cannot now prove constant to myself
without some treachery us'd to valentine
this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
to climb celestial silvia's chamber window
myself in counsel his competitor
now presently i'll give her father notice
of their disguising and pretended flight
who all enrag'd will banish valentine
for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding

scene vii
verona julia's house
enter julia and lucetta
julia counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me
and ev'n in kind love i do conjure thee
who art the table wherein all my thoughts
to lesson me and tell me some good mean
how with my honour i may undertake
a journey to my loving proteus
lucetta alas the way is wearisome and long
julia a true devoted pilgrim is not weary
to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly
and when the flight is made to one so dear
of such divine perfection as sir proteus
julia o know'st thou not his looks are my souls food
pity the dearth that i have pined in
by longing for that food so long a time
didst thou but know the inly touch of love
thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
as seek to quench the fire of love with words
lucetta i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
but qualify the fire's extreme rage
lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
the current that with gentle murmur glides
thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
but when his fair course is not hindered
he makes sweet music with th' enamelld stones
giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
and so by many winding nooks he strays
with willing sport to the wild ocean
then let me go and hinder not my course
and make a pastime of each weary step
till the last step have brought me to my love
and there i'll rest as after much turmoil
a blessed soul doth in elysium
lucetta but in what habit will you go along
julia not like a woman for i would prevent
the loose encounters of lascivious men
gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds
as may beseem some well reputed page
julia no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings
with twenty odd conceited true love knots
to be fantastic may become a youth
of greater time than i shall show to be
lucetta what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
julia that fits as well as 'tell me good my lord
what compass will you wear your farthingale'
why ev'n what fashion thou best likes lucetta
lucetta you must needs have them with a codpiece madam
lucetta a round hose madam now's not worth a pin
unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
julia lucetta as thou lov'st me let me have
what thou think'st meet and is most mannerly
but tell me wench how will the world repute me
for undertaking so unstaid a journey
i fear me it will make me scandaliz'd
lucetta if you think so then stay at home and go not
julia nay that i will not
if proteus like your journey when you come
no matter who's displeas'd when you are gone
i fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withal
julia that is the least lucetta of my fear
a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
and instances of infinite of love
warrant me welcome to my proteus
lucetta all these are servants to deceitful men
julia base men that use them to so base effect
his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
lucetta pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him
julia now as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong
to bear a hard opinion of his truth
only deserve my love by loving him
and presently go with me to my chamber
to furnish me upon my longing journey
all that is mine i leave at thy dispose
my goods my lands my reputation
only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
come answer not but to it presently
i am impatient of my tarriance exeunt
act iii scene i
milan the duke's palace
enter duke thurio and proteus
we have some secrets to confer about exit thurio
now tell me proteus what's your will with me
proteus my gracious lord that which i would discover
the law of friendship bids me to conceal
but when i call to mind your gracious favours
done to me undeserving as i am
my duty pricks me on to utter that
which else no worldly good should draw from me
know worthy prince sir valentine my friend
myself am one made privy to the plot
i know you have determind to bestow her
on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
and should she thus be stoln away from you
it would be much vexation to your age
thus for my duty's sake i rather chose
to cross my friend in his intended drift
than by concealing it heap on your head
a pack of sorrows which would press you down
duke proteus i thank thee for thine honest care
which to requite command me while i live
this love of theirs myself have often seen
haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep
and oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
sir valentine her company and my court
but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
and so unworthily disgrace the man
a rashness that i ever yet have shunnd
that which thyself hast now disclos'd to me
and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
i nightly lodge her in an upper tow'r
the key whereof myself have ever kept
and thence she cannot be convey'd away
proteus know noble lord they have devis'd a mean
how he her chamber window will ascend
and with a corded ladder fetch her down
and this way comes he with it presently
where if it please you you may intercept him
but good my lord do it so cunningly
that my discovery be not aimed at
for love of you not hate unto my friend
hath made me publisher of this pretence
duke upon mine honour he shall never know
that i had any light from thee of this
proteus adieu my lord sir valentine is coming exit
duke sir valentine whither away so fast
valentine please it your grace there is a messenger
that stays to bear my letters to my friends
and i am going to deliver them
duke be they of much import
valentine the tenour of them doth but signify
my health and happy being at your court
duke nay then no matter stay with me awhile
i am to break with thee of some affairs
'tis not unknown to thee that i have sought
to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter
valentine i know it well my lord and sure the match
were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
cannot your grace win her to fancy him
duke no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
nor fearing me as if i were her father
and may i say to thee this pride of hers
upon advice hath drawn my love from her
and where i thought the remnant of mine age
should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty
i now am full resolv'd to take a wife
and turn her out to who will take her in
then let her beauty be her wedding dow'r
for me and my possessions she esteems not
duke there is a lady in verona here
whom i affect but she is nice and coy
and nought esteems my aged eloquence
now therefore would i have thee to my tutor
for long agone i have forgot to court
besides the fashion of the time is chang'd
how and which way i may bestow myself
to be regarded in her sun bright eye
valentine win her with gifts if she respect not words
more than quick words do move a womans mind
duke but she did scorn a present that i sent her
valentine a woman sometime scorns what best contents her
send her another never give her o'er
for scorn at first makes after love the more
if she do frown 'tis not in hate of you
but rather to beget more love in you
if she do chide 'tis not to have you gone
for why the fools are mad if left alone
for 'get you gone' she doth not mean 'away'
flatter and praise commend extol their graces
though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces
that man that hath a tongue i say is no man
if with his tongue he cannot win a woman
duke but she i mean is promis'd by her friends
unto a youthful gentleman of worth
and kept severely from resort of men
that no man hath access by day to her
duke ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe
that no man hath recourse to her by night
valentine what lets but one may enter at her window
duke her chamber is aloft far from the ground
and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
without apparent hazard of his life
valentine why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
would serve to scale another hero's tow'r
duke now as thou art a gentleman of blood
advise me where i may have such a ladder
valentine when would you use it pray sir tell me that
duke this very night for love is like a child
that longs for everything that he can come by
valentine by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder
duke but hark thee i will go to her alone
how shall i best convey the ladder thither
valentine it will be light my lord that you may bear it
duke a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
valentine ay my good lord
duke then let me see thy cloak
i'll get me one of such another length
valentine why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
duke how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
what letter is this same what's here 'to silvia'
and here an engine fit for my proceeding
'my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly
and slaves they are to me that send them flying
o could their master come and go as lightly
himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
while i their king that thither them importune
do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them
because myself do want my servants' fortune
i curse myself for they are sent by me
what's here
'silvia this night i will enfranchise thee'
'tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose
why phaethon for thou art merops' son
wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
and with thy daring folly burn the world
wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
go base intruder over weening slave
bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
is privilege for thy departure hence
thank me for this more than for all the favours
which all too much i have bestow'd on thee
but if thou linger in my territories
longer than swiftest expedition
will give thee time to leave our royal court
by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
i ever bore my daughter or thyself
be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse
valentine and why not death rather than living torment
to die is to be banish'd from myself
and silvia is myself banish'd from her
is self from self a deadly banishment
what light is light if silvia be not seen
what joy is joy if silvia be not by
unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection
except i be by silvia in the night
unless i look on silvia in the day
there is no day for me to look upon
she is my essence and i leave to be
if i be not by her fair influence
foster'd illumind cherish'd kept alive
i fly not death to fly his deadly doom
tarry i here i but attend on death
but fly i hence i fly away from life
enter proteus and launce
launce so ho so ho
proteus what seest thou
launce him we go to find there's not a hair on 's head but 'tis a
empty
proteus valentine
valentine no
proteus who then his spirit
valentine neither
proteus what then
launce can nothing speak master shall i strike
proteus who wouldst thou strike
launce nothing
proteus villain forbear
launce why sir i'll strike nothing i pray you
proteus sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word
valentine my ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news
so much of bad already hath possess'd them
proteus then in dumb silence will i bury mine
valentine is silvia dead
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine indeed for sacred silvia
hath she forsworn me
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine if silvia have forsworn me
what is your news
launce sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
proteus that thou art banished o that's the news
valentine o i have fed upon this woe already
and now excess of it will make me surfeit
doth silvia know that i am banished
proteus ay ay and she hath offered to the doom
which unrevers'd stands in effectual force
a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd
with them upon her knees her humble self
wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
but neither bended knees pure hands held up
sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears
could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
but valentine if he be ta'en must die
besides her intercession chaf'd him so
when she for thy repeal was suppliant
that to close prison he commanded her
with many bitter threats of biding there
valentine no more unless the next word that thou speak'st
if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear
as ending anthem of my endless dolour
proteus cease to lament for that thou canst not help
and study help for that which thou lament'st
time is the nurse and breeder of all good
here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
besides thy staying will abridge thy life
hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that
and manage it against despairing thoughts
which being writ to me shall be deliver'd
even in the milk white bosom of thy love
the time now serves not to expostulate
come i'll convey thee through the city gate
and ere i part with thee confer at large
of all that may concern thy love affairs
as thou lov'st silvia though not for thyself
regard thy danger and along with me
valentine i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy
proteus go sirrah find him out come valentine
valentine o my dear silvia hapless valentine
exeunt valentine and proteus
launce i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to think
my master is a kind of a knave but that's all one if he be but
one knave he lives not now that knows me to be in love yet i am
in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor
who 'tis i love and yet 'tis a woman but what woman i will not
tell myself and yet 'tis a milkmaid yet 'tis not a maid for
maid and serves for wages she hath more qualities than a
water spaniel which is much in a bare christian here is the
cate log pulling out a paper of her condition 'inprimis she
can fetch and carry' why a horse can do no more nay a horse
cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a
jade 'item she can milk' look you a sweet virtue in a maid

scene ii
milan the duke's palace
enter duke and thurio
duke sir thurio fear not but that she will love you
now valentine is banish'd from her sight
thurio since his exile she hath despis'd me most
forsworn my company and raild at me
that i am desperate of obtaining her
duke this weak impress of love is as a figure
dissolves to water and doth lose his form
a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
and worthless valentine shall be forgot
enter proteus
how now sir proteus is your countryman
according to our proclamation gone
proteus gone my good lord
duke my daughter takes his going grievously
proteus a little time my lord will kill that grief
proteus the good conceit i hold of thee
for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
makes me the better to confer with thee
proteus longer than i prove loyal to your grace
let me not live to look upon your grace
duke thou know'st how willingly i would effect
the match between sir thurio and my daughter
proteus i do my lord
duke and also i think thou art not ignorant
proteus she did my lord when valentine was here
duke ay and perversely she persevers so
what might we do to make the girl forget
the love of valentine and love sir thurio
proteus the best way is to slander valentine
with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
three things that women highly hold in hate
duke ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate
proteus ay if his enemy deliver it
by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
duke then you must undertake to slander him
proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do
'tis an ill office for a gentleman
especially against his very friend
duke where your good word cannot advantage him
your slander never can endamage him
therefore the office is indifferent
being entreated to it by your friend
by aught that i can speak in his dispraise
she shall not long continue love to him
but say this weed her love from valentine
it follows not that she will love sir thurio
thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him
lest it should ravel and be good to none
you must provide to bottom it on me
which must be done by praising me as much
as you in worth dispraise sir valentine
because we know on valentine's report
you are already love's firm votary
and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
upon this warrant shall you have access
where you with silvia may confer at large
for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
and for your friend's sake will be glad of you
where you may temper her by your persuasion
to hate young valentine and love my friend
but you sir thurio are not sharp enough
you must lay lime to tangle her desires
by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
should be full fraught with serviceable vows
duke ay
much is the force of heaven bred poesy
proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty
you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
write till your ink be dry and with your tears
that may discover such integrity
for orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews
whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
make tigers tame and huge leviathans
forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
after your dire lamenting elegies
visit by night your lady's chamber window
with some sweet consort to their instruments
tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence
this or else nothing will inherit her
duke this discipline shows thou hast been in love
thurio and thy advice this night i'll put in practice
therefore sweet proteus my direction giver
let us into the city presently
to sort some gentlemen well skilld in music
i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
to give the onset to thy good advice
duke about it gentlemen
and afterward determine our proceedings
duke even now about it i will pardon you exeunt

act iv scene i
the frontiers of mantua a forest
enter certain outlaws
first outlaw fellows stand fast i see a passenger
second outlaw if there be ten shrink not but down with 'em
enter valentine and speed
if not we'll make you sit and rifle you
speed sir we are undone these are the villains
that all the travellers do fear so much
valentine my friends
first outlaw that's not so sir we are your enemies
second outlaw peace we'll hear him
third outlaw ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man
valentine then know that i have little wealth to lose
a man i am cross'd with adversity
of which if you should here disfurnish me
you take the sum and substance that i have
second outlaw whither travel you
valentine to verona
first outlaw whence came you
valentine from milan
third outlaw have you long sojournd there
valentine some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd
if crooked fortune had not thwarted me
valentine i was
second outlaw for what offence
valentine for that which now torments me to rehearse
i killd a man whose death i much repent
but yet i slew him manfully in fight
without false vantage or base treachery
first outlaw why ne'er repent it if it were done so
but were you banish'd for so small a fault
valentine i was and held me glad of such a doom
valentine my youthful travel therein made me happy
or else i often had been miserable
third outlaw by the bare scalp of robin hood's fat friar
this fellow were a king for our wild faction
first outlaw we'll have him sirs a word
speed master be one of them it's an honourable kind of thievery
valentine peace villain
second outlaw tell us this have you anything to take to
valentine nothing but my fortune
such as the fury of ungovernd youth
thrust from the company of awful men
myself was from verona banished
for practising to steal away a lady
an heir and near allied unto the duke
second outlaw and i from mantua for a gentleman
who in my mood i stabb'd unto the heart
first outlaw and i for such like petty crimes as these
but to the purpose for we cite our faults
and partly seeing you are beautified
with goodly shape and by your own report
a linguist and a man of such perfection
as we do in our quality much want
second outlaw indeed because you are a banish'd man
therefore above the rest we parley to you
are you content to be our general
to make a virtue of necessity
and live as we do in this wilderness
say 'ay' and be the captain of us all
we'll do thee homage and be ruld by thee
love thee as our commander and our king
first outlaw but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
second outlaw thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd
valentine i take your offer and will live with you
provided that you do no outrages
on silly women or poor passengers
third outlaw no we detest such vile base practices
and show thee all the treasure we have got
which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose exeunt
scene ii
milan outside the duke's palace under silvia's window
enter proteus
proteus already have i been false to valentine
and now i must be as unjust to thurio
under the colour of commending him
i have access my own love to prefer
to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
when i protest true loyalty to her
she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
when to her beauty i commend my vows
she bids me think how i have been forsworn
in breaking faith with julia whom i lov'd
and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
the least whereof would quell a lover's hope
yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love
enter thurio and musicians
but here comes thurio now must we to her window
and give some evening music to her ear
thurio how now sir proteus are you crept before us
proteus ay gentle thurio for you know that love
will creep in service where it cannot go
thurio ay but i hope sir that you love not here
proteus sir but i do or else i would be hence
thurio who silvia
thurio i thank you for your own now gentlemen
let's tune and to it lustily awhile
enter at a distance host and julia in boy's clothes
host now my young guest methinks you're allycholly i pray you
why is it
julia marry mine host because i cannot be merry
host come we'll have you merry i'll bring you where you shall
hear music and see the gentleman that you ask'd for
julia but shall i hear him speak
julia that will be music
host hark hark
julia is he among these
host ay but peace let's hear 'em
empty
who is silvia what is she
that all our swains commend her
holy fair and wise is she
the heaven such grace did lend her
is she kind as she is fair
for beauty lives with kindness
love doth to her eyes repair
to help him of his blindness
and being help'd inhabits there
then to silvia let us sing
that silvia is excelling
she excels each mortal thing
upon the dull earth dwelling
host how now are you sadder than you were before
how do you man the music likes you not
julia you mistake the musician likes me not
host why my pretty youth
julia he plays false father
host how out of tune on the strings
julia not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
empty
host you have a quick ear
host i perceive you delight not in music
julia not a whit when it jars so
host hark what fine change is in the music
julia ay that change is the spite
host you would have them always play but one thing
julia i would always have one play but one thing
but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on
often resort unto this gentlewoman
host i tell you what launce his man told me he lov'd her out of
julia where is launce
host gone to seek his dog which to morrow by his master's
command he must carry for a present to his lady
julia peace stand aside the company parts
proteus sir thurio fear not you i will so plead
that you shall say my cunning drift excels
thurio where meet we
proteus at saint gregory's well
thurio farewell exeunt thurio and musicians
proteus madam good ev'n to your ladyship
silvia i thank you for your music gentlemen
who is that that spake
proteus one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth
you would quickly learn to know him by his voice
silvia sir proteus as i take it
proteus sir proteus gentle lady and your servant
silvia what's your will
proteus that i may compass yours
that presently you hie you home to bed
thou subtle perjur'd false disloyal man
think'st thou i am so shallow so conceitless
to be seduced by thy flattery
that hast deceiv'd so many with thy vows
return return and make thy love amends
for me by this pale queen of night i swear
i am so far from granting thy request
that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit
even for this time i spend in talking to thee
proteus i grant sweet love that i did love a lady
but she is dead
julia aside 'twere false if i should speak it
for i am sure she is not buried
silvia say that she be yet valentine thy friend
survives to whom thyself art witness
i am betroth'd and art thou not asham'd
to wrong him with thy importunacy
silvia and so suppose am i for in his grave
assure thyself my love is buried
proteus sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
silvia go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
julia aside he heard not that
proteus madam if your heart be so obdurate
vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
the picture that is hanging in your chamber
for since the substance of your perfect self
is else devoted i am but a shadow
and to your shadow will i make true love
julia aside if 'twere a substance you would sure deceive it
and make it but a shadow as i am
silvia i am very loath to be your idol sir
but since your falsehood shall become you well
to worship shadows and adore false shapes
send to me in the morning and i'll send it
proteus as wretches have o'ernight
that wait for execution in the morn
exeunt proteus and silvia
julia host will you go

it is your pleasure to command me in
silvia o eglamour thou art a gentleman
think not i flatter for i swear i do not
valiant wise remorseful well accomplish'd
thou art not ignorant what dear good will
nor how my father would enforce me marry
vain thurio whom my very soul abhors
thyself hast lov'd and i have heard thee say
no grief did ever come so near thy heart
as when thy lady and thy true love died
upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity
sir eglamour i would to valentine
to mantua where i hear he makes abode
and for the ways are dangerous to pass
upon whose faith and honour i repose
urge not my father's anger eglamour
but think upon my grief a lady's grief
and on the justice of my flying hence
to keep me from a most unholy match
which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
i do desire thee even from a heart
as full of sorrows as the sea of sands
to bear me company and go with me
that i may venture to depart alone
eglamour madam i pity much your grievances
which since i know they virtuously are plac'd
i give consent to go along with you
recking as little what betideth me
as much i wish all good befortune you
when will you go

silvia good morrow kind sir eglamour exeunt
scene iv
under silvia's window
enter launce with his dog
launce when a mans servant shall play the cur with him look you
it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy one that i sav'd
from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and
precisely 'thus i would teach a dog' i was sent to deliver him
as a present to mistress silvia from my master and i came no
sooner into the dining chamber but he steps me to her trencher
and steals her capons leg o 'tis a foul thing when a cur
cannot keep himself in all companies i would have as one should
say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it
were a dog at all things if i had not had more wit than he to
take a fault upon me that he did i think verily he had been
hang'd for't sure as i live he had suffer'd for't you shall
gentleman like dogs under the duke's table he had not been
there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
him 'out with the dog' says one 'what cur is that' says
another 'whip him out' says the third 'hang him up' says the
duke i having been acquainted with the smell before knew it
was crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs
'friend' quoth i 'you mean to whip the dog' 'ay marry do i'
quoth he 'you do him the more wrong' quoth i twas i did the
thing you wot of' he makes me no more ado but whips me out of
i'll be sworn i have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
stoln otherwise he had been executed i have stood on the
pillory for geese he hath killd otherwise he had suffer'd
for't thou think'st not of this now nay i remember the trick
you serv'd me when i took my leave of madam silvia did not i bid
thee still mark me and do as i do when didst thou see me heave
up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale
didst thou ever see me do such a trick
enter proteus and julia in boy's clothes
and will employ thee in some service presently
julia in what you please i'll do what i can
proteusi hope thou wilt to launce how now you whoreson
empty
where have you been these two days loitering
launce marry sir i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me
proteus and what says she to my little jewel
launce marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish
thanks is good enough for such a present
launce no indeed did she not here have i brought him back
empty
proteus what didst thou offer her this from me
launce ay sir the other squirrel was stoln from me by the
hangmans boys in the market place and then i offer'd her mine
own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift
the greater
proteus go get thee hence and find my dog again
or ne'er return again into my sight
a slave that still an end turns me to shame
sebastian i have entertained thee
partly that i have need of such a youth
that can with some discretion do my business
for 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout
but chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour
which if my augury deceive me not
witness good bringing up fortune and truth
therefore know thou for this i entertain thee
deliver it to madam silvia
she lov'd me well deliver'd it to me
julia it seems you lov'd not her to leave her token
she is dead belike
proteus not so i think she lives
julia alas
proteus why dost thou cry 'alas'
julia i cannot choose
but pity her
julia because methinks that she lov'd you as well
as you do love your lady silvia
she dreams on him that has forgot her love
you dote on her that cares not for your love
'tis pity love should be so contrary
and thinking on it makes me cry 'alas'
proteus well give her that ring and therewithal
this letter that's her chamber tell my lady
i claim the promise for her heavenly picture
where thou shalt find me sad and solitary exit proteus
julia how many women would do such a message
alas poor proteus thou hast entertaind
a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
alas poor fool why do i pity him
that with his very heart despiseth me
because he loves her he despiseth me
because i love him i must pity him
this ring i gave him when he parted from me
and now am i unhappy messenger
to plead for that which i would not obtain
to carry that which i would have refus'd
to praise his faith which i would have disprais'd
i am my master's true confirmed love
but cannot be true servant to my master
unless i prove false traitor to myself
yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly
as heaven it knows i would not have him speed
gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean
to bring me where to speak with madam silvia
silvia what would you with her if that i be she
julia if you be she i do entreat your patience
to hear me speak the message i am sent on
silvia from whom
julia from my master sir proteus madam
silvia o he sends you for a picture
julia ay madam
go give your master this tell him from me
one julia that his changing thoughts forget
would better fit his chamber than this shadow
julia madam please you peruse this letter
pardon me madam i have unadvis'd
deliver'd you a paper that i should not
this is the letter to your ladyship
silvia i pray thee let me look on that again
julia it may not be good madam pardon me
i will not look upon your master's lines
i know they are stuff'd with protestations
and full of new found oaths which he wul break
as easily as i do tear his paper
julia madam he sends your ladyship this ring
silvia the more shame for him that he sends it me
for i have heard him say a thousand times
his julia gave it him at his departure
though his false finger have profand the ring
julia she thanks you
silvia what say'st thou
julia i thank you madam that you tender her
poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
silvia dost thou know her
julia almost as well as i do know myself
to think upon her woes i do protest
that i have wept a hundred several times
silvia belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her
silvia is she not passing fair
julia she hath been fairer madam than she is
when she did think my master lov'd her well
she in my judgment was as fair as you
but since she did neglect her looking glass
and threw her sun expelling mask away
the air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks
and pinch'd the lily tincture of her face
that now she is become as black as i
julia about my stature for at pentecost
when all our pageants of delight were play'd
our youth got me to play the womans part
and i was trimm'd in madam julia's gown
which served me as fit by all mens judgments
as if the garment had been made for me
therefore i know she is about my height
and at that time i made her weep a good
for i did play a lamentable part
for theseus' perjury and unjust flight
which i so lively acted with my tears
that my poor mistress moved therewithal
wept bitterly and would i might be dead
if i in thought felt not her very sorrow
silvia she is beholding to thee gentle youth
alas poor lady desolate and left
i weep myself to think upon thy words
here youth there is my purse i give thee this
farewell exit silvia with attendants
julia and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her
a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
i hope my master's suit will be but cold
since she respects my mistress' love so much
alas how love can trifle with itself
here is her picture let me see i think
if i had such a tire this face of mine
were full as lovely as is this of hers
unless i flatter with myself too much
her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
if that be all the difference in his love
i'll get me such a colour'd periwig
her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high
what should it be that he respects in her
but i can make respective in myself
if this fond love were not a blinded god
for 'tis thy rival o thou senseless form
thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd lov'd and ador'd
and were there sense in his idolatry
my substance should be statue in thy stead
i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake
that us'd me so or else by jove i vow
i should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
to make my master out of love with thee exit
act v scene i
enter eglamour
eglamour the sun begins to gild the western sky
and now it is about the very hour
that silvia at friar patrick's cell should meet me
she will not fail for lovers break not hours
unless it be to come before their time
so much they spur their expedition
enter silvia
see where she comes lady a happy evening
out at the postern by the abbey wall
i fear i am attended by some spies
eglamour fear not the forest is not three leagues off
if we recover that we are sure enough exeunt
scene ii
milan the duke's palace
enter thurio proteus and julia as sebastian
thurio sir proteus what says silvia to my suit
proteus o sir i find her milder than she was
thurio what that my leg is too long
proteus no that it is too little
thurio i'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
julia aside but love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes
thurio what says she to my face
proteus she says it is a fair one
thurio nay then the wanton lies my face is black
proteus but pearls are fair and the old saying is
black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes
for i had rather wink than look on them
thurio how likes she my discourse
proteus ill when you talk of war
thurio but well when i discourse of love and peace
julia aside but better indeed when you hold your peace
thurio what says she to my valour
proteus o sir she makes no doubt of that
julia aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice
thurio what says she to my birth
julia aside true from a gentleman to a fool
thurio considers she my possessions
proteus o ay and pities them
thurio wherefore
julia aside that such an ass should owe them
proteus that they are out by lease
julia here comes the duke
enter duke
duke how now sir proteus how now thurio
thurio not i
proteus nor i
duke saw you my daughter
proteus neither
duke why then
she's fled unto that peasant valentine
and eglamour is in her company
'tis true for friar lawrence met them both
as he in penance wander'd through the forest
but being mask'd he was not sure of it
besides she did intend confession
at patrick's cell this even and there she was not
these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
therefore i pray you stand not to discourse
but mount you presently and meet with me
upon the rising of the mountain foot
that leads toward mantua whither they are fled
dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me exit
that flies her fortune when it follows her
i'll after more to be reveng'd on eglamour
than for the love of reckless silvia exit
proteus and i will follow more for silvia's love
than hate of eglamour that goes with her exit
julia and i will follow more to cross that love
than hate for silvia that is gone for love exit
scene iii

first outlaw come come
be patient we must bring you to our captain
silvia a thousand more mischances than this one
have learnd me how to brook this patiently
second outlaw come bring her away
first outlaw where is the gentleman that was with her
second outlaw being nimble footed he hath outrun us
but moyses and valerius follow him
go thou with her to the west end of the wood
the thicket is beset he cannot 'scape
first outlaw come i must bring you to our captains cave
fear not he bears an honourable mind

silvia o valentine this i endure for thee exeunt
scene iv
another part of the forest
enter valentine
valentine how use doth breed a habit in a man
i better brook than flourishing peopled towns
here can i sit alone unseen of any
and to the nightingale's complaining notes
tune my distresses and record my woes
o thou that dost inhabit in my breast
leave not the mansion so long tenantless
lest growing ruinous the building fall
and leave no memory of what it was
repair me with thy presence silvia
what halloing and what stir is this to day
these are my mates that make their wills their law
have some unhappy passenger in chase
they love me well yet i have much to do
to keep them from uncivil outrages
withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here
steps aside
enter proteus silvia and julia as sebastian
proteus madam this service i have done for you
to hazard life and rescue you from him
that would have forc'd your honour and your love
vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
and less than this i am sure you cannot give
valentine aside how like a dream is this i see and hear
love lend me patience to forbear awhile
silvia o miserable unhappy that i am
proteus unhappy were you madam ere i came
silvia by thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy
julia aside and me when he approacheth to your presence
silvia had i been seized by a hungry lion
i would have been a breakfast to the beast
rather than have false proteus rescue me
o heaven be judge how i love valentine
whose life's as tender to me as my soul
and full as much for more there cannot be
i do detest false perjur'd proteus
proteus what dangerous action stood it next to death
would i not undergo for one calm look
o 'tis the curse in love and still approv'd
when women cannot love where they're belov'd
silvia when proteus cannot love where he's belov'd
read over julia's heart thy first best love
for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
descended into perjury to love me
and that's far worse than none better have none
than plural faith which is too much by one
thou counterfeit to thy true friend
proteus in love
who respects friend
silvia all men but proteus
proteus nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
can no way change you to a milder form
i'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end
silvia o heaven
proteus i'll force thee yield to my desire
valentine ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
thou friend of an ill fashion
proteus valentine
valentine thou common friend that's without faith or love
for such is a friend now treacherous man
thou hast beguild my hopes nought but mine eye
could have persuaded me now i dare not say
who should be trusted when one's own right hand
is perjured to the bosom proteus
i am sorry i must never trust thee more
but count the world a stranger for thy sake
the private wound is deepest o time most accurst
'mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
proteus my shame and guilt confounds me
forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow
be a sufficient ransom for offence
as e'er i did commit
valentine then i am paid
and once again i do receive thee honest
who by repentance is not satisfied
is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleas'd
by penitence th' eternals wrath's appeas'd
and that my love may appear plain and free
all that was mine in silvia i give thee
julia o me unhappy swoons
valentine why boy why wag how now
what's the matter look up speak
julia o good sir my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to madam
silvia which out of my neglect was never done
proteus where is that ring boy
julia here 'tis this is it
proteus how let me see why this is the ring i gave to julia
julia o cry you mercy sir i have mistook
this is the ring you sent to silvia
at my depart i gave this unto julia
julia and julia herself did give it me
and julia herself have brought it hither
proteus how julia
julia behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
and entertaind 'em deeply in her heart
how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
o proteus let this habit make thee blush
be thou asham'd that i have took upon me
in a disguise of love
it is the lesser blot modesty finds
women to change their shapes than men their minds
proteus than men their minds 'tis true o heaven were man
but constant he were perfect that one error
fills him with faults makes him run through all th' sins
inconstancy falls off ere it begins
what is in silvia's face but i may spy
more fresh in julia's with a constant eye
let me be blest to make this happy close
'twere pity two such friends should be long foes
proteus bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever
julia and i mine
enter outlaws with duke and thurio
outlaw a prize a prize a prize
valentine forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke
your grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd
banished valentine
thurio yonder is silvia and silvia's mine
valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death
come not within the measure of my wrath
do not name silvia thine if once again
verona shall not hold thee here she stands
take but possession of her with a touch
i dare thee but to breathe upon my love
thurio sir valentine i care not for her i
i hold him but a fool that will endanger
i claim her not and therefore she is thine
duke the more degenerate and base art thou
to make such means for her as thou hast done
and leave her on such slight conditions
now by the honour of my ancestry
i do applaud thy spirit valentine
and think thee worthy of an empress' love
know then i here forget all former griefs
cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
to which i thus subscribe sir valentine
thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd
take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserv'd her
valentine i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
i now beseech you for your daughter's sake
to grant one boon that i shall ask of you
duke i grant it for thine own whate'er it be
valentine these banish'd men that i have kept withal
are men endu'd with worthy qualities
and let them be recalld from their exile
they are reformed civil full of good
and fit for great employment worthy lord
duke thou hast prevaild i pardon them and thee
dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts
come let us go we will include all jars
with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
valentine and as we walk along i dare be bold
with our discourse to make your grace to smile
duke i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
valentine i warrant you my lord more grace than boy
duke what mean you by that saying
valentine please you i'll tell you as we pass along
that you will wonder what hath fortuned
come proteus 'tis your penance but to hear
the story of your loves discovered
that done our day of marriage shall be yours

archidamus if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the

as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your
empty
camillo i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to
pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
archidamus wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
camillo beseech you
archidamus verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we
cannot with such magnificence in so rare i know not what to
say we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses
unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot
praise us as little accuse us
camillo you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely
archidamus believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
traind together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt
them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now
since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society their encounters though not
personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts
letters loving embassies that they have seem'd to be together
though absent shook hands as over a vast and embrac'd as it
were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their
empty
matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young
prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that
ever came into my note
camillo i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a
gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old
hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man
archidamus would they else be content to die
camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire
archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live on

scene ii
sicilia the palace of leontes
enter leontes polixenes hermione mamillius camillo and attendants
polixenes nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden time as long again
and yet we should for perpetuity
go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
yet standing in rich place i multiply
with one 'we thank you' many thousands moe
that go before it
leontes stay your thanks a while
and pay them when you part
polixenes sir that's to morrow
i am questiond by my fears of what may chance
no sneaping winds at home to make us say
'this is put forth too truly' besides i have stay'd
to tire your royalty
leontes we are tougher brother
than you can put us to't
polixenes no longer stay
leontes one sev'night longer
polixenes very sooth to morrow
leontes we'll part the time betweens then and in that
polixenes press me not beseech you so
there is no tongue that moves none none i' th' world
so soon as yours could win me so it should now
were there necessity in your request although
'twere needful i denied it my affairs
do even drag me homeward which to hinder
were in your love a whip to me my stay
to you a charge and trouble to save both
farewell our brother
hermione i had thought sir to have held my peace until
you had drawn oaths from him not to stay you sir
charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
all in bohemia's well this satisfaction
the by gone day proclaim'd say this to him
he's beat from his best ward
leontes well said hermione
hermione to tell he longs to see his son were strong
but let him say so then and let him go
we'll thwack him hence with distaffs
to polixenes yet of your royal presence i'll
adventure the borrow of a week when at bohemia
you take my lord i'll give him my commission
to let him there a month behind the gest
prefix'd for's parting yet good deed leontes
i love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind
what lady she her lord you'll stay
polixenes no madam
polixenes i may not verily
hermione verily
you put me off with limber vows but i
though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with oaths
should yet say 'sir no going' verily
you shall not go a lady's 'verily' is
as potent as a lord's will go yet
force me to keep you as a prisoner
not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
my prisoner or my guest by your dread 'verily'
one of them you shall be
polixenes your guest then madam
to be your prisoner should import offending
which is for me less easy to commit
than you to punish
hermione not your gaoler then
but your kind hostess come i'll question you
of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
polixenes we were fair queen
two lads that thought there was no more behind
but such a day to morrow as to day
and to be boy eternal
hermione was not my lord
the verier wag o' th' two
polixenes we were as twinnd lambs that did frisk i' th' sun
and bleat the one at th' other what we chang'd
was innocence for innocence we knew not
that any did had we pursu'd that life
and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven
boldly 'not guilty' the imposition clear'd
hereditary ours
hermione by this we gather
you have tripp'd since
polixenes o my most sacred lady
temptations have since then been born to 's for
your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
of my young playfellow
hermione grace to boot
of this make no conclusion lest you say
your queen and i are devils yet go on
th' offences we have made you do we'll answer
if you first sinnd with us and that with us
you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
with any but with us
hermione he'll stay my lord
leontes at my request he would not
hermione my dearest thou never spok'st
to better purpose
hermione never
leontes never but once
hermione what have i twice said well when was't before
i prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's
as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
our praises are our wages you may ride's
with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
with spur we heat an acre but to th' goal
my last good deed was to entreat his stay
what was my first it has an elder sister
or i mistake you o would her name were grace
but once before i spoke to th' purpose when
nay let me have't i long
leontes why that was when
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
'i am yours for ever'
hermione 'tis grace indeed
why lo you now i have spoke to th' purpose twice
the one for ever earnd a royal husband
th' other for some while a friend
giving her hand to polixenes
leontes aside too hot too hot
i have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
but not for joy not joy this entertainment
may a free face put on derive a liberty
from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
and well become the agent 't may i grant
but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
as now they are and making practis'd smiles
as in a looking glass and then to sigh as 'twere
the mort o' th' deer o that is entertainment
art thou my boy
mamillius ay my good lord
leontes i' fecks
why that's my bawcock what hast smutch'd thy nose
they say it is a copy out of mine come captain
we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
are all calld neat still virginalling
upon his palm how now you wanton calf
mamillius yes if you will my lord
leontes thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have
to be full like me yet they say we are
almost as like as eggs women say so
that will say anything but were they false
as o'er dy'd blacks as wind as waters false
as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
no bourn 'twixt his and mine yet were it true
to say this boy were like me come sir page
most dear'st my collop can thy dam may't be
affection thy intention stabs the centre
thou dost make possible things not so held
communicat'st with dreams how can this be
with what's unreal thou coactive art
and fellow'st nothing then 'tis very credent
thou mayst co join with something and thou dost
and that beyond commission and i find it
and that to the infection of my brains
polixenes what means sicilia
hermione he something seems unsettled
polixenes how my lord
what cheer how is't with you best brother
hermione you look
as if you held a brow of much distraction
are you mov'd my lord
leontes no in good earnest
how sometimes nature will betray its folly
to harder bosoms looking on the lines
of my boy's face methoughts i did recoil
twenty three years and saw myself unbreech'd
in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzld
lest it should bite its master and so prove
as ornaments oft do too dangerous
how like methought i then was to this kernel
this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
will you take eggs for money
leontes you will why happy man be's dole my brother
are you so fond of your young prince as we
do seem to be of ours
polixenes if at home sir
he's all my exercise my mirth my matter
now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
my parasite my soldier statesman all
he makes a july's day short as december
and with his varying childness cures in me
leontes so stands this squire
offic'd with me we two will walk my lord
and leave you to your graver steps hermione
how thou lov'st us show in our brother's welcome
let what is dear in sicily be cheap
next to thyself and my young rover he's
apparent to my heart
hermione if you would seek us
we are yours i' th' garden shalls attend you there
be you beneath the sky aside i am angling now
though you perceive me not how i give line
go to go to
how she holds up the neb the bill to him
and arms her with the boldness of a wife
to her allowing husband
exeunt polixenes hermione and attendants
gone already
inch thick knee deep o'er head and ears a fork'd one
play too but so disgrac'd a part whose issue
will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
will be my knell go play boy play there have been
or i am much deceiv'd cuckolds ere now
and many a man there is even at this present
now while i speak this holds his wife by th' arm
that little thinks she has been sluic'd ins absence
and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
sir smile his neighbour nay there's comfort int
as mine against their will should all despair
that hath revolted wives the tenth of mankind
would hang themselves physic for't there's none
it is a bawdy planet that will strike
where 'tis predominant and 'tis pow'rfull think it
from east west north and south be it concluded
no barricado for a belly know't
it will let in and out the enemy
with bag and baggage many thousand ons
mamillius i am like you they say
leontes why that's some comfort
what camillo there
camillo ay my good lord
leontes go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
exit mamillius
camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
camillo you had much ado to make his anchor hold
when you cast out it still came home
camillo he would not stay at your petitions made
his business more material
leontes didst perceive it
aside they're here with me already whisp'ring rounding
'sicilia is a so forth' 'tis far gone
when i shall gust it last how came't camillo
that he did stay
camillo at the good queens entreaty
leontes 'at the queens' be't 'good' should be pertinent
by any understanding pate but thine
for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
more than the common blocks not noted is't
but of the finer natures by some severals
of head piece extraordinary lower messes
perchance are to this business purblind say
camillo business my lord i think most understand
bohemia stays here longer
leontes ha
leontes ay but why
camillo to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistress
leontes satisfy
th' entreaties of your mistress satisfy
let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo
with all the nearest things to my heart as well
my chamber councils wherein priest like thou
hast cleans'd my bosom i from thee departed
deceiv'd in thy integrity deceiv'd
in that which seems so
camillo be it forbid my lord
leontes to bide upont thou art not honest or
if thou inclinst that way thou art a coward
which hoxes honesty behind restraining
from course requir'd or else thou must be counted
a servant grafted in my serious trust
and therein negligent or else a fool
and tak'st it all for jest
camillo my gracious lord
i may be negligent foolish and fearful
in every one of these no man is free
but that his negligence his folly fear
among the infinite doings of the world
sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord
if ever i were wilfull negligent
it was my folly if industriously
not weighing well the end if ever fearful
to do a thing where i the issue doubted
whereof the execution did cry out
against the non performance 'twas a fear
which oft infects the wisest these my lord
are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
is never free of but beseech your grace
be plainer with me let me know my trespass
by its own visage if i then deny it
leontes ha' not you seen camillo
but that's past doubt you have or your eye glass
is thicker than a cuckold's horn or heard
for to a vision so apparent rumour
cannot be mute or thought for cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think
my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
or else be impudently negative
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
as rank as any flax wench that puts to
before her troth plight say't and justify't
camillo i would not be a stander by to hear
my sovereign mistress clouded so without
my present vengeance taken shrew my heart
you never spoke what did become you less
than this which to reiterate were sin
as deep as that though true
leontes is whispering nothing
kissing with inside lip stopping the career
of laughter with a sigh a note infallible
of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot
skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
why then the world and all that's int is nothing
the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
if this be nothing
camillo good my lord be cur'd
of this diseas'd opinion and betimes
for 'tis most dangerous
leontes say it be 'tis true
camillo no no my lord
leontes it is you lie you lie
i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
inclining to them both were my wife's liver
infected as her life she would not live
the running of one glass
camillo who does her
leontes why he that wears her like her medal hanging
about his neck bohemia who if i
had servants true about me that bare eyes
to see alike mine honour as their profits
which should undo more doing ay and thou
his cupbearer whom i from meaner form
have bench'd and rear'd to worship who mayst see
plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
how i am galld mightst bespice a cup
to give mine enemy a lasting wink
which draught to me were cordial
camillo sir my lord
i could do this and that with no rash potion
maliciously like poison but i cannot
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
so sovereignly being honourable
i have lov'd thee
leontes make that thy question and go rot
dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
to appoint myself in this vexation sully
the purity and whiteness of my sheets
which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
give scandal to the blood o' th' prince my son
who i do think is mine and love as mine
without ripe moving to 't would i do this
could man so blench
camillo i must believe you sir
i do and will fetch off bohemia for't
provided that when he's remov'd your highness
will take again your queen as yours at first
even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing
known and allied to yours
leontes thou dost advise me
even so as i mine own course have set down
i'll give no blemish to her honour none
camillo my lord
go then and with a countenance as clear
as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
and with your queen i am his cupbearer
if from me he have wholesome beverage
leontes this is all
do't and thou hast the one half of my heart
do't not thou split'st thine own
camillo i'll do't my lord
leontes i will seem friendly as thou hast advis'd me exit
camillo o miserable lady but for me
what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
of good polixenes and my ground to do't
is the obedience to a master one
all that are his so too to do this deed
promotion follows if i could find example
of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourish'd after i'd not do't but since
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
let villainy itself forswear't i must
forsake the court to do't or no is certain
to me a break neck happy star reign now
here comes bohemia
polixenes this is strange methinks
my favour here begins to warp not speak
good day camillo
camillo hail most royal sir
polixenes what is the news i' th' court
camillo none rare my lord
polixenes the king hath on him such a countenance
as he had lost some province and a region
lov'd as he loves himself even now i met him
wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling
a lip of much contempt speeds from me
so leaves me to consider what is breeding
that changes thus his manners
camillo i dare not know my lord
polixenes how dare not do not do you know and dare not
be intelligent to me 'tis thereabouts
for to yourself what you do know you must
and cannot say you dare not good camillo
which shows me mine chang'd too for i must be
a party in this alteration finding
myself thus alter'd with't
camillo there is a sickness
which puts some of us in distemper but
i cannot name the disease and it is caught
of you that yet are well
polixenes how caught of me
make me not sighted like the basilisk
by my regard but killd none so camillo
as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
clerk like experienc'd which no less adorns
our gentry than our parents' noble names
in whose success we are gentle i beseech you
if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
thereof to be inform'd imprisont not
in ignorant concealment
camillo i may not answer
i must be answer'd dost thou hear camillo
i conjure thee by all the parts of man
which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
is not this suit of mine that thou declare
what incidency thou dost guess of harm
is creeping toward me how far off how near
which way to be prevented if to be
if not how best to bear it
camillo sir i will tell you
that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel
which must be ev'n as swiftly followed as
i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
cry lost and so goodnight
polixenes on good camillo
camillo i am appointed him to murder you
polixenes by whom camillo
camillo by the king
polixenes for what
as he had seen 't or been an instrument
to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen
empty
polixenes o then my best blood turn
to an infected jelly and my name
be yok'd with his that did betray the best
turn then my freshest reputation to
a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
where i arrive and my approach be shunnd
that e'er was heard or read
camillo swear his thought over
by each particular star in heaven and
by all their influences you may as well
forbid the sea for to obey the moon
as or by oath remove or counsel shake
the fabric of his folly whose foundation
is pild upon his faith and will continue
the standing of his body
camillo i know not but i am sure 'tis safer to
avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born
if therefore you dare trust my honesty
that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
shall bear along impawnd away to night
your followers i will whisper to the business
and will by twos and threes at several posterns
clear them o' th' city for myself i'll put
my fortunes to your service which are here
for by the honour of my parents i
have utt'red truth which if you seek to prove
i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
than one condemnd by the king's own mouth thereon
his execution sworn
polixenes i do believe thee
i saw his heart ins face give me thy hand
be pilot to me and thy places shall
still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
two days ago this jealousy
is for a precious creature as she's rare
must it be great and as his persons mighty
must it be violent and as he does conceive
he is dishonour'd by a man which ever
profess'd to him why his revenges must
in that be made more bitter fear o'ershades me
good expedition be my friend and comfort
the gracious queen part of this theme but nothing
i will respect thee as a father if
thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid
camillo it is in mine authority to command
the keys of all the posterns please your highness
to take the urgent hour come sir away exeunt
act ii scene i
sicilia the palace of leontes
enter hermione mamillius and ladies
hermione take the boy to you he so troubles me
first lady come my gracious lord

mamillius no i'll none of you
first lady why my sweet lord
mamillius you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
i were a baby still i love you better
second lady and why so my lord
mamillius not for because
your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
too much hair there but in a semicircle
or a half moon made with a pen
second lady who taught't this
mamillius i learnd it out of womens faces pray now
what colour are your eyebrows
first lady blue my lord
mamillius nay that's a mock i have seen a lady's nose
that has been blue but not her eyebrows
first lady hark ye
present our services to a fine new prince
one of these days and then you'd wanton with us
if we would have you
second lady she is spread of late
into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
hermione what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now
i am for you again pray you sit by us
and tells a tale
mamillius merry or sad shallt be
mamillius a sad tale's best for winter i have one
of sprites and goblins
hermione let's have that good sir
come on sit down come on and do your best
to fright me with your sprites you're pow'rfull at it
mamillius there was a man
hermione nay come sit down then on
mamillius dwelt by a churchyard i will tell it softly
yond crickets shall not hear it
and give't me in mine ear
enter leontes antigonus lords and others
leontes he met there his train camillo with him
first lord behind the tuft of pines i met them never
saw i men scour so on their way i ey'd them
even to their ships
leontes how blest am i
in my just censure in my true opinion
alack for lesser knowledge how accurs'd
a spider steep'd and one may drink depart
and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
is not infected but if one present
th' abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known
how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
with violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider
camillo was his help in this his pander
there is a plot against my life my crown
alls true that is mistrusted that false villain
he has discover'd my design and i
remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick
for them to play at will how came the posterns
so easily open
first lord by his great authority
which often hath no less prevaild than so
on your command
leontes i know't too well
give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him
have too much blood in him
hermione what is this sport
leontes bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
away with him and let her sport herself
mamillius is led out
with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes
has made thee swell thus
hermione but i'd say he had not
and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying
leontes you my lords
look on her mark her well be but about
to say 'she is a goodly lady' and
the justice of your hearts will thereto ad
'tis pity she's not honest honourable'
praise her but for this her without door form
which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
that calumny doth use o i am out
virtue itself these shrugs these hum's and ha's
when you have said she's goodly come between
ere you can say she's honest but be't known
from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
she's an adultress
hermione should a villain say so
the most replenish'd villain in the world
he were as much more villain you my lord
do but mistake
polixenes for leontes o thou thing
which i'll not call a creature of thy place
lest barbarism making me the precedent
should a like language use to all degrees
and mannerly distinguishment leave out
betwixt the prince and beggar i have said
she's an adultress i have said with whom
more she's a traitor and camillo is
a federary with her and one that knows
but with her most vile principal that she's
a bed swerver even as bad as those
that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy
to this their late escape
hermione no by my life
privy to none of this how will this grieve you
when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
you thus have publish'd me gentle my lord
you scarce can right me throughly then to say
leontes no if i mistake
in those foundations which i build upon
the centre is not big enough to bear
a school boy's top away with her to prison
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
but that he speaks
hermione there's some ill planet reigns
i must be patient till the heavens look
with an aspect more favourable good my lords
commonly are the want of which vain dew
perchance shall dry your pities but i have
that honourable grief lodg'd here which burns
worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords
with thoughts so qualified as your charities
shall best instruct you measure me and so
the king's will be perform'd
leontes to the guard shall i be heard
hermione who is't that goes with me beseech your highness
my plight requires it do not weep good fools
there is no cause when you shall know your mistress
has deserv'd prison then abound in tears
as i come out this action i now go on
is for my better grace adieu my lord
i never wish'd to see you sorry now
i trust i shall my women come you have leave
leontes go do our bidding hence
exeunt hermione guarded and ladies
antigonus be certain what you do sir lest your justice
prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
yourself your queen your son
first lord for her my lord
i dare my life lay down and will do't sir
please you t' accept it that the queen is spotless
i' th' eyes of heaven and to you i mean
in this which you accuse her
antigonus if it prove
i lodge my wife i'll go in couples with her
than when i feel and see her no farther trust her
for every inch of woman in the world
ay every dram of womans flesh is false
if she be
leontes hold your peaces
first lord good my lord
antigonus it is for you we speak not for ourselves
you are abus'd and by some putter on
i would land damn him be she honour flaw'd
i have three daughters the eldest is eleven
the second and the third nine and some five
if this prove true they'll pay for 't by mine honour
i'll geld 'em all fourteen they shall not see
to bring false generations they are co heirs
and i had rather glib myself than they
should not produce fair issue
leontes cease no more
as is a dead mans nose but i do see't and feelt
as you feel doing thus and see withal
the instruments that feel
antigonus if it be so
we need no grave to bury honesty
there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
of the whole dungy earth
leontes what lack i credit
first lord i had rather you did lack than i my lord
to have her honour true than your suspicion
be blam'd for't how you might
leontes why what need we
commune with you of this but rather follow
our forceful instigation our prerogative
calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
imparts this which if you or stupified
or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
relish a truth like us inform yourselves
the loss the gain the ord'ring ont is all
properly ours
antigonus and i wish my liege
you had only in your silent judgment tried it
without more overture
leontes how could that be
either thou art most ignorant by age
or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight
added to their familiarity
that lack'd sight only nought for approbation
but only seeing all other circumstances
made up to th' deed doth push on this proceeding
yet for a greater confirmation
for in an act of this importance 'twere
most piteous to be wild i have dispatch'd in post
to sacred delphos to apollo's temple
cleomenes and dion whom you know
of stuff'd sufficiency now from the oracle
shall stop or spur me have i done well
first lord well done my lord
leontes though i am satisfied and need no more
than what i know yet shall the oracle
give rest to th' minds of others such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to th' truth so have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confind
lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
we are to speak in public for this business
will raise us all
antigonus aside to laughter as i take it
if the good truth were known
empty
scene ii

emilia now be you blest for it
i'll to the queen please you come something nearer
gaoler madam if't please the queen to send the babe
i know not what i shall incur to pass it
paulina you need not fear it sir
this child was prisoner to the womb and is
by law and process of great nature thence

the anger of the king nor guilty of
if any be the trespass of the queen
gaoler i do believe it
paulina do not you fear upon mine honour i
will stand betwixt you and danger exeunt
sicilia the palace of leontes
enter leontes antigonus lords and servants
leontes nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness
to bear the matter thus mere weakness if
the cause were not in being part o' th' cause
she th' adultress for the harlot king
is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
and level of my brain plot proof but she
i can hook to me say that she were gone
might come to me again who's there
first servant my lord
leontes how does the boy
first servant he took good rest to night
'tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd
leontes to see his nobleness
conceiving the dishonour of his mother
he straight declind droop'd took it deeply
fastend and fix'd the shame ont in himself
and downright languish'd leave me solely go
see how he fares exit servant fie fie no thought of him
the very thought of my revenges that way
recoil upon me in himself too mighty
and in his parties his alliance let him be
until a time may serve for present vengeance
take it on her camillo and polixenes
laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
they should not laugh if i could reach them nor
enter paulina with a child
first lord you must not enter
paulina nay rather good my lords be second to me
fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
than the queens life a gracious innocent soul
more free than he is jealous
antigonus that's enough
second servant madam he hath not slept to night commanded
none should come at him
i come to bring him sleep 'tis such as you
that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
at each his needless heavings such as you
nourish the cause of his awaking i
do come with words as medicinal as true
honest as either to purge him of that humour
that presses him from sleep
leontes what noise there ho
paulina no noise my lord but needful conference
leontes how
away with that audacious lady antigonus
i charg'd thee that she should not come about me
i knew she would
antigonus i told her so my lord
on your displeasure's peril and on mine
she should not visit you
leontes what canst not rule her
paulina from all dishonesty he can in this
commit me for committing honour trust it
he shall not rule me
antigonus la you now you hear
when she will take the rein i let her run
but she'll not stumble
paulina good my liege i come
and i beseech you hear me who professes
myself your loyal servant your physician
your most obedient counsellor yet that dares
than such as most seem yours i say i come
from your good queen
leontes good queen
paulina good queen my lord good queen i say good queen
and would by combat make her good so were i
a man the worst about you
leontes force her hence
paulina let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
first hand me on mine own accord i'll off
for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
here 'tis commends it to your blessing
laying down the child
leontes out
a mankind witch hence with her out o' door
a most intelligencing bawd
paulina not so
i am as ignorant in that as you
in so entitling me and no less honest
as this world goes to pass for honest
leontes traitors
will you not push her out give her the bastard
to antigonus thou dotard thou art woman tir'd unroosted
by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard
take't up i say give't to thy crone
paulina for ever
unvenerable be thy hands if thou
tak'st up the princess by that forced baseness
leontes he dreads his wife
paulina so i would you did then 'twere past all doubt
you'd call your children yours
leontes a nest of traitors
antigonus i am none by this good light
paulina nor i nor any
but one that's here and that's himself for he
the sacred honour of himself his queens
his hopeful sons his babe's betrays to slander
for as the case now stands it is a curse
he cannot be compelld to 't once remove
the root of his opinion which is rotten
as ever oak or stone was sound
leontes a callat
of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
and now baits me this brat is none of mine
it is the issue of polixenes
hence with it and together with the dam
paulina it is yours
and might we lay th' old proverb to your charge
so like you 'tis the worse behold my lords
although the print be little the whole matter
and copy of the father eye nose lip
the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley
the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles
the very mould and frame of hand nail finger
and thou good goddess nature which hast made it
the ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colours
no yellow int lest she suspect as he does
her children not her husband's
leontes a gross hag
and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd
that wilt not stay her tongue
antigonus hang all the husbands
that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself
hardly one subject
paulina a most unworthy and unnatural lord
can do no more
leontes i'll ha' thee burnt
paulina i care not
it is an heretic that makes the fire
not she which burns int i'll not call you tyrant
but this most cruel usage of your queen
not able to produce more accusation
than your own weak hing'd fancy something savours
yea scandalous to the world
leontes on your allegiance
out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant
where were her life she durst not call me so
if she did know me one away with her
paulina i pray you do not push me i'll be gone
look to your babe my lord 'tis yours jove send her
a better guiding spirit what needs these hands
you that are thus so tender o'er his follies
so so farewell we are gone exit
leontes thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
my child away with't even thou that hast
a heart so tender o'er it take it hence
and see it instantly consum'd with fire
even thou and none but thou take it up straight
within this hour bring me word 'tis done
and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life
with that thou else callst thine if thou refuse
the bastard brains with these my proper hands
shall i dash out go take it to the fire
for thou set'st on thy wife
antigonus i did not sir
these lords my noble fellows if they please
can clear me int
lords we can my royal liege
he is not guilty of her coming hither
leontes you're liars all
we have always truly serv'd you and beseech
so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
as recompense of our dear services
past and to come that you do change this purpose
which being so horrible so bloody must
lead on to some foul issue we all kneel
leontes i am a feather for each wind that blows
shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
and call me father better burn it now
it shall not neither to antigonus you sir come you hither
you that have been so tenderly officious
with lady margery your midwife there
to save this bastard's life for 'tis a bastard
so sure as this beard's grey what will you adventure
to save this brat's life
antigonus anything my lord
that my ability may undergo
and nobleness impose at least thus much
to save the innocent anything possible
leontes it shall be possible swear by this sword
thou wilt perform my bidding
antigonus i will my lord
leontes mark and perform it seest thou for the fail
of any point int shall not only be
death to thyself but to thy lewd tongu'd wife
whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee
as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
to some remote and desert place quite out
of our dominions and that there thou leave it
without more mercy to it own protection
and favour of the climate as by strange fortune
it came to us i do in justice charge thee
on thy souls peril and thy body's torture
that thou commend it strangely to some place
where chance may nurse or end it take it up
antigonus i swear to do this though a present death
some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
to be thy nurses wolves and bears they say
casting their savageness aside have done
like offices of pity sir be prosperous
in more than this deed does require and blessing
against this cruelty fight on thy side
poor thing condemnd to loss exit with the child
leontes no i'll not rear
another's issue
servant please your highness posts
from those you sent to th' oracle are come
an hour since cleomenes and dion
being well arriv'd from delphos are both landed
hasting to th' court
first lord so please you sir their speed
hath been beyond account
leontes twenty three days
they have been absent 'tis good speed foretells
the truth of this appear prepare you lords
summon a session that we may arraign
our most disloyal lady for as she hath
been publicly accus'd so shall she have
a just and open trial while she lives
my heart will be a burden to me leave me
and think upon my bidding exeunt
act iii scene i
sicilia on the road to the capital
cleomenes the climate's delicate the air most sweet
fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
the common praise it bears
dion i shall report
for most it caught me the celestial habits
methinks i so should term them and the reverence
of the grave wearers o the sacrifice
how ceremonious solemn and unearthly
it was i' th' off'ring
and the ear deaf'ning voice o' th' oracle
kin to jove's thunder so surpris'd my sense
that i was nothing
dion if th' event o' th' journey
prove as successful to the queen o be't so
as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
the time is worth the use ont
cleomenes great apollo
turn all to th' best these proclamations
i little like
dion the violent carriage of it
will clear or end the business when the oracle
thus by apollo's great divine seald up
shall the contents discover something rare
even then will rush to knowledge go fresh horses
and gracious be the issue exeunt
scene ii
sicilia a court of justice
leontes this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried
the daughter of a king our wife and one
of us too much belov'd let us be clear'd
of being tyrannous since we so openly
proceed in justice which shall have due course
even to the guilt or the purgation
produce the prisoner
officer it is his highness' pleasure that the queen
enter hermione as to her trial paulina and ladies
empty
leontes read the indictment
officer reads 'hermione queen to the worthy leontes king of
sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in
committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia and
conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by
circumstances partly laid open thou hermione contrary to the
for their better safety to fly away by night'
hermione since what i am to say must be but that
which contradicts my accusation and
the testimony on my part no other
but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
to say 'not guilty' mine integrity
being counted falsehood shall as i express it
be so receiv'd but thus if pow'rs divine
behold our human actions as they do
false accusation blush and tyranny
tremble at patience you my lord best know
who least will seem to do so my past life
hath been as continent as chaste as true
as i am now unhappy which is more
than history can pattern though devis'd
and play'd to take spectators for behold me
a fellow of the royal bed which owe
a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
to prate and talk for life and honour fore
who please to come and hear for life i prize it
as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour
'tis a derivative from me to mine
and only that i stand for i appeal
to your own conscience sir before polixenes
came to your court how i was in your grace
how merited to be so since he came
with what encounter so uncurrent i
the bound of honour or in act or will
that way inclining hard'ned be the hearts
of all that hear me and my near'st of kin
cry fie upon my grave
leontes i ne'er heard yet
that any of these bolder vices wanted
less impudence to gainsay what they did
than to perform it first
hermione that's true enough
leontes you will not own it
hermione more than mistress of
which comes to me in name of fault i must not
at all acknowledge for polixenes
with whom i am accus'd i do confess
i lov'd him as in honour he requir'd
with such a kind of love as might become
a lady like me with a love even such
so and no other as yourself commanded
both disobedience and ingratitude
to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
ever since it could speak from an infant freely
that it was yours now for conspiracy
i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd
for me to try how all i know of it
is that camillo was an honest man
and why he left your court the gods themselves
wotting no more than i are ignorant
what you have underta'en to do ins absence
hermione sir
you speak a language that i understand not
my life stands in the level of your dreams
which i'll lay down
leontes your actions are my dreams
you had a bastard by polixenes
and i but dream'd it as you were past all shame
those of your fact are so so past all truth
thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
no father owning it which is indeed
more criminal in thee than it so thou
shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
look for no less than death
hermione sir spare your threats
the bug which you would fright me with i seek
to me can life be no commodity
the crown and comfort of my life your favour
but know not how it went my second joy
and first fruits of my body from his presence
i am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort
starr'd most unluckily is from my breast
the innocent milk in it most innocent mouth
hald out to murder myself on every post
proclaim'd a strumpet with immodest hatred
the child bed privilege denied which 'longs
to women of all fashion lastly hurried
i have got strength of limit now my liege
tell me what blessings i have here alive
that i should fear to die therefore proceed
but yet hear this mistake me not no life
i prize it not a straw but for mine honour
which i would free if i shall be condemnd
upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
but what your jealousies awake i tell you
'tis rigour and not law your honours all
apollo be my judge
first lord this your request
is altogether just therefore bring forth
and in apollo's name his oracle
exeunt certain officers
hermione the emperor of russia was my father
o that he were alive and here beholding
his daughter's trial that he did but see
the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
re enter officers with cleomenes and dion
officer you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
that you cleomenes and dion have
been both at delphos and from thence have brought
this seald up oracle by the hand deliver'd
of great apollo's priest and that since then
you have not dar'd to break the holy seal
nor read the secrets int
cleomenes dion all this we swear
officer reads 'hermione is chaste polixenes blameless
camillo a true subject leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent
babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir if
that which is lost be not found'
lords now blessed be the great apollo
hermione praised
leontes hast thou read truth
officer ay my lord even so
as it is here set down
the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood
enter a servant
servant my lord the king the king
leontes what is the business
servant o sir i shall be hated to report it
the prince your son with mere conceit and fear
of the queens speed is gone
leontes how gone
servant is dead
do strike at my injustice hermione swoons
how now there
paulina this news is mortal to the queen look down
and see what death is doing
leontes take her hence
her heart is but o'ercharg'd she will recover
i have too much believ'd mine own suspicion
beseech you tenderly apply to her
some remedies for life
apollo pardon
my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle
i'll reconcile me to polixenes
new woo my queen recall the good camillo
whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy
for being transported by my jealousies
to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose
camillo for the minister to poison
my friend polixenes which had been done
my swift command though i with death and with
reward did threaten and encourage him
not doing it and being done he most humane
and filld with honour to my kingly guest
unclasp'd my practice quit his fortunes here
which you knew great and to the certain hazard
of all incertainties himself commended
no richer than his honour how he glisters
thorough my rust and how his piety
re enter paulina
paulina woe the while
o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
break too
first lord what fit is this good lady
paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me
what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
in leads or oils what old or newer torture
must i receive whose every word deserves
together working with thy jealousies
fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
for girls of nine o think what they have done
and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it
that thou betray'dst polixenes 'twas nothing
that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
and damnable ingrateful nor was't much
thou wouldst have poisond good camillo's honour
more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon
the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
to be or none or little though a devil
would have shed water out of fire ere done't
nor is't directly laid to thee the death
of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no
when i have said cry 'woe' the queen the queen
the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance
for't not dropp'd down yet
first lord the higher pow'rs forbid
paulina i say she's dead i'll swear't if word nor oath
prevail not go and see if you can bring
tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you
as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
to nothing but despair a thousand knees
ten thousand years together naked fasting
upon a barren mountain and still winter
in storm perpetual could not move the gods
to look that way thou wert
leontes go on go on
thou canst not speak too much i have deserv'd
all tongues to talk their bitt'rest
howe'er the business goes you have made fault
i' th' boldness of your speech
paulina i am sorry for't
all faults i make when i shall come to know them
i do repent alas i have show'd too much
the rashness of a woman he is touch'd
to th' noble heart what's gone and what's past help
should be past grief do not receive affliction
at my petition i beseech you rather
of what you should forget now good my liege
sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
the love i bore your queen lo fool again
i'll speak of her no more nor of your children
i'll not remember you of my own lord
who is lost too take your patience to you
and i'll say nothing
leontes thou didst speak but well
when most the truth which i receive much better
to the dead bodies of my queen and son
one grave shall be for both upon them shall
the causes of their death appear unto
our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit
the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
shall be my recreation so long as nature
will bear up with this exercise so long
i daily vow to use it come and lead me
to these sorrows exeunt
bohemia the sea coast
enter antigonus with the child and a mariner
antigonus thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
the deserts of bohemia
mariner ay my lord and fear
we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
and threaten present blusters in my conscience
the heavens with that we have in hand are angry
and frown upon 's
look to thy bark i'll not be long before
i call upon thee
mariner make your best haste and go not
too far i' th' land 'tis like to be loud weather
besides this place is famous for the creatures
of prey that keep upont
antigonus go thou away
i'll follow instantly
mariner i am glad at heart
antigonus come poor babe
i have heard but not believ'd the spirits o' th' dead
may walk again if such thing be thy mother
appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream
so like a waking to me comes a creature
sometimes her head on one side some another
i never saw a vessel of like sorrow
so filld and so becoming in pure white robes
like very sanctity she did approach
and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
became two spouts the fury spent anon
did this break from her 'good antigonus
since fate against thy better disposition
hath made thy person for the thrower out
of my poor babe according to thine oath
places remote enough are in bohemia
there weep and leave it crying and for the babe
is counted lost for ever perdita
put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see
thy wife paulina more' so with shrieks
she melted into air affrighted much
i did in time collect myself and thought
this was so and no slumber dreams are toys
yet for this once yea superstitiously
i will be squar'd by this i do believe
hermione hath suffer'd death and that
apollo would this being indeed the issue
either for life or death upon the earth
of its right father blossom speed thee well
laying down the child
there lie and there thy character there these
laying down a bundle
which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
and still rest thine the storm begins poor wretch
that for thy mother's fault art thus expos'd
to loss and what may follow weep i cannot
to be by oath enjoind to this farewell
the day frowns more and more thou'rt like to have
a lullaby too rough i never saw

empty

see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon
swallowed with yeast and froth as you'd thrust a cork into a
hogshead and then for the land service to see how the bear tore
out his shoulder bone how he cried to me for help and said his
to see how the sea flap dragond it but first how the poor
souls roared and the sea mock'd them and how the poor gentleman
roared and the bear mock'd him both roaring louder than the sea
or weather
shepherd name of mercy when was this boy
clown now now i have not wink'd since i saw these sights the
men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dind on the
gentleman he's at it now
shepherd would i had been by to have help'd the old man

a squire's child look thee here take up take up boy opent

enter time the chorus
time i that please some try all both joy and terror
of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
now take upon me in the name of time
to use my wings impute it not a crime
to me or my swift passage that i slide
of that wide gap since it is in my pow'r
to o'erthrow law and in one self born hour
to plant and o'erwhelm custom let me pass
the same i am ere ancient'st order was
or what is now receiv'd i witness to
the times that brought them in so shall i do
to th' freshest things now reigning and make stale
the glistering of this present as my tale
now seems to it your patience this allowing
as you had slept between leontes leaving
th' effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
that he shuts up himself imagine me
gentle spectators that i now may be
in fair bohemia and remember well
i mentiond a son o' th' king's which florizel
i now name to you and with speed so pace
to speak of perdita now grown in grace
equal with wond'ring what of her ensues
be known when 'tis brought forth a shepherd's daughter
and what to her adheres which follows after
is th' argument of time of this allow
if ever you have spent time worse ere now
if never yet that time himself doth say
he wishes earnestly you never may exit
scene ii
bohemia the palace of polixenes
enter polixenes and camillo
a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this
camillo it is fifteen years since i saw my country though i have
for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones
there besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me
to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to
think so which is another spur to my departure
polixenes as thou lov'st me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy
services by leaving me now the need i have of thee thine own
goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want
sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or
take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i
have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the
heaping friendships of that fatal country sicilia prithee
speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance
of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my
brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are
even now to be afresh lamented say to me when saw'st thou the
not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have
approved their virtues
camillo sir it is three days since i saw the prince what his
happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i have missingly
noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent
to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared
polixenes i have considered so much camillo and with some care
so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his
removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is
that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
camillo i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of
most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be
thought to begin from such a cottage
polixenes that's likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the
angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the
place where we will not appearing what we are have some
question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of
empty
camillo i willingly obey your command
polixenes my best camillo we must disguise ourselves

tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was
certainly whipt out of the court

court they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no
autolycus vices i would say sir i know this man well he hath
been since an ape bearer then a process server a bailiff then

of heart that way and that he knew i warrant him
clown how do you now

scene iv
bohemia the shepherd's cottage
enter florizel and perdita
florizel these your unusual weeds to each part of you
do give a life no shepherdess but flora
peering in aprils front this your sheep shearing
is as a meeting of the petty gods
perdita sir my gracious lord
to chide at your extremes it not becomes me
o pardon that i name them your high self
the gracious mark o' th' land you have obscur'd
with a swains wearing and me poor lowly maid
most goddess like prank'd up but that our feasts
in every mess have folly and the feeders
digest it with a custom i should blush
to see you so attir'd swoon i think
florizel i bless the time
when my good falcon made her flight across
thy father's ground
perdita now jove afford you cause
to me the difference forges dread your greatness
hath not been us'd to fear even now i tremble
to think your father by some accident
should pass this way as you did o the fates
how would he look to see his work so noble
should i in these my borrowed flaunts behold
the sternness of his presence
florizel apprehend
nothing but jollity the gods themselves
humbling their deities to love have taken
the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter
became a bull and bellow'd the green neptune
a ram and bleated and the fire rob'd god
golden apollo a poor humble swain
were never for a piece of beauty rarer
nor in a way so chaste since my desires
run not before mine honour nor my lusts
burn hotter than my faith
perdita o but sir
your resolution cannot hold when 'tis
oppos'd as it must be by th' pow'r of the king
one of these two must be necessities
which then will speak that you must change this purpose
florizel thou dearest perdita
with these forc'd thoughts i prithee darken not
the mirth o' th' feast or i'll be thine my fair
or not my father's for i cannot be
mine own nor anything to any if
i be not thine to this i am most constant
though destiny say no be merry gentle
strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
that you behold the while your guests are coming
of celebration of that nuptial which
we two have sworn shall come
perdita o lady fortune
stand you auspicious
florizel see your guests approach
address yourself to entertain them sprightly
and let's be red with mirth
enter shepherd with polixenes and camillo disguised
clown mopsa dorcas with others
this day she was both pantler butler cook
both dame and servant welcom'd all serv'd all
would sing her song and dance her turn now here
at upper end o' th' table now i' th' middle
on his shoulder and his her face o' fire
with labour and the thing she took to quench it
she would to each one sip you are retired
as if you were a feasted one and not
the hostess of the meeting pray you bid
a way to make us better friends more known
come quench your blushes and present yourself
that which you are mistress o' th' feast come on
and bid us welcome to your sheep shearing
as your good flock shall prosper
perdita to polixenes sir welcome
it is my father's will i should take on me
the hostess ship o' th' day to camillo
you're welcome sir
for you there's rosemary and rue these keep
seeming and savour all the winter long
grace and remembrance be to you both
and welcome to our shearing
polixenes shepherdess
a fair one are you well you fit our ages
with flow'rs of winter
perdita sir the year growing ancient
not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors
which some call nature's bastards of that kind
our rustic gardens barren and i care not
to get slips of them
polixenes wherefore gentle maiden
do you neglect them
perdita for i have heard it said
there is an art which in their piedness shares
with great creating nature
yet nature is made better by no mean
but nature makes that mean so over that art
which you say adds to nature is an art
that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
a gentler scion to the wildest stock
and make conceive a bark of baser kind
by bud of nobler race this is an art
which does mend nature change it rather but
the art itself is nature
polixenes then make your garden rich in gillyvors
and do not call them bastards
perdita i'll not put
the dibble in earth to set one slip of them
no more than were i painted i would wish
this youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
desire to breed by me here's flow'rs for you
hot lavender mints savory marjoram
the marigold that goes to bed wi' th' sun
of middle summer and i think they are given
to men of middle age y'are very welcome
camillo i should leave grazing were i of your flock
and only live by gazing
perdita out alas
you'd be so lean that blasts of january
would blow you through and through now my fair'st friend
i would i had some flow'rs o' th' spring that might
become your time of day and yours and yours
your maidenheads growing o proserpina
from the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall
from dis's waggon daffodils
that come before the swallow dares and take
the winds of march with beauty violets dim
but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyes
or cytherea's breath pale primroses
that die unmarried ere they can behold
bright phoebus in his strength a malady
the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
the flow'r de luce being one o these i lack
to make you garlands of and my sweet friend
to strew him o'er and o'er
florizel what like a corse
perdita no like a bank for love to lie and play on
not like a corse or if not to be buried
but quick and in mine arms come take your flow'rs
methinks i play as i have seen them do
does change my disposition
florizel what you do
still betters what is done when you speak sweet
i'd have you do it ever when you sing
i'd have you buy and sell so so give alms
pray so and for the ord'ring your affairs
to sing them too when you do dance i wish you
a wave o' th' sea that you might ever do
nothing but that move still still so
so singular in each particular
crowns what you are doing in the present deeds
that all your acts are queens
perdita o doricles
your praises are too large but that your youth
and the true blood which peeps fairly through't
do plainly give you out an unstaind shepherd
with wisdom i might fear my doricles
you woo'd me the false way
as little skill to fear as i have purpose
to put you to't but come our dance i pray
your hand my perdita so turtles pair
that never mean to part
perdita i'll swear for 'em
polixenes this is the prettiest low born lass that ever
ran on the green sward nothing she does or seems
but smacks of something greater than herself
too noble for this place
that makes her blood look out good sooth she is
the queen of curds and cream
clown come on strike up
dorcas mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
to mend her kissing with
mopsa now in good time
clown not a word a word we stand upon our manners
come strike up music
here a dance of shepherds and shepherdesses
which dances with your daughter
shepherd they call him doricles and boasts himself
to have a worthy feeding but i have it
upon his own report and i believe it
he looks like sooth he says he loves my daughter
i think so too for never gaz'd the moon
upon the water as he'll stand and read
as 'twere my daughter's eyes and to be plain
i think there is not half a kiss to choose
polixenes she dances featly
shepherd so she does any thing though i report it
that should be silent if young doricles
do light upon her she shall bring him that
which he not dreams of
enter a servant
servant o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you
would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe
could not move you he sings several tunes faster than you'll
ears grew to his tunes
clown he could never come better he shall come in i love a
ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set
down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably
servant he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner
can so fit his customers with gloves he has the prettiest
love songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with
such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings 'jump her and thump
her' and where some stretch mouth'd rascal would as it were
maid to answer 'whoop do me no harm good man puts him off
slights him with 'whoop do me no harm good man'
polixenes this is a brave fellow
clown believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow
has he any unbraided wares
servant he hath ribbons of all the colours i' th' rainbow points
more than all the lawyers in bohemia can learnedly handle though
they come to him by th' gross inkles caddisses cambrics
lawns why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses you
sleeve hand and the work about the square ont
clown prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
perdita forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words ins tunes
exit servant
clown you have of these pedlars that have more in them than you'd
think sister
perdita ay good brother or go about to think

perfume for a lady's chamber
golden quoifs and stomachers
for my lads to give their dears
pins and poking sticks of steel
what maids lack from head to heel
come buy of me come come buy come buy
come buy
clown if i were not in love with mopsa thou shouldst take no
money of me but being enthralld as i am it will also be the
bondage of certain ribbons and gloves
mopsa i was promis'd them against the feast but they come not too
late now
dorcas he hath promis'd you more than that or there be liars
mopsa he hath paid you all he promis'd you may be he has paid you
more which will shame you to give him again
plackets where they should bear their faces is there not
milking time when you are going to bed or kiln hole to whistle
off these secrets but you must be tittle tattling before all our
guests 'tis well they are whisp'ring clammer your tongues and
not a word more
mopsa i have done come you promis'd me a tawdry lace and a pair
of sweet gloves
clown have i not told thee how i was cozend by the way and lost
all my money

empty
clown what hast here ballads
mopsa pray now buy some i love a ballad in print a life for
then we are sure they are true
autolycus here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's wife
was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a burden and how she
mopsa is it true think you
autolycus very true and but a month old
dorcas bless me from marrying a usurer
autolycus here's the midwife's name to't one mistress taleporter

carry lies abroad
mopsa pray you now buy it
clown come on lay it by and let's first see moe ballads we'll

coast on wednesday the fourscore of april forty thousand fathom
above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of
maids it was thought she was a woman and was turnd into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that lov'd her
the ballad is very pitiful and as true
dorcas is it true too think you
autolycus five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my
pack will hold
clown lay it by too another
mopsa let's have some merry ones
autolycus why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune
of 'two maids wooing a man' there's scarce a maid westward but
she sings it 'tis in request i can tell you
mopsa can both sing it if thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear
'tis in three parts
dorcas we had the tune ont a month ago

re enter servant
servant master there is three carters three shepherds three
neat herds three swineherds that have made themselves all men
of hair they call themselves saltiers and they have dance which
the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not
int but they themselves are o' th' mind if it be not too rough
for some that know little but bowling it will please
shepherd away we'll none ont here has been too much homely
foolery already i know sir we weary you
polixenes you weary those that refresh us pray let's see these
four threes of herdsmen
servant one three of them by their own report sir hath danc'd
before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve
foot and a half by th' squier
shepherd leave your prating since these good men are pleas'd let
them come in but quickly now
here a dance of twelve satyrs
polixenes to shepherd o father you'll know more of that
empty
to camillo is it not too far gone 'tis time to part them
he's simple and tells much to florizel how now fair
empty
your heart is full of something that does take
your mind from feasting sooth when i was young
and handed love as you do i was wont
the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
to her acceptance you have let him go
and nothing marted with him if your lass
interpretation should abuse and call this
your lack of love or bounty you were straited
for a reply at least if you make a care
of happy holding her
florizel old sir i know
she prizes not such trifles as these are
up in my heart which i have given already
but not deliver'd o hear me breathe my life
before this ancient sir whom it should seem
hath sometime lov'd i take thy hand this hand
as soft as dove's down and as white as it
or ethiopians tooth or the fannd snow that's bolted
by th' northern blasts twice o'er
polixenes what follows this
how prettily the young swain seems to wash
but to your protestation let me hear
what you profess
florizel do and be witness to't
polixenes and this my neighbour too
florizel and he and more
than he and men the earth the heavens and all
that were i crownd the most imperial monarch
thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth
that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
without her love for her employ them all
commend them and condemn them to her service
or to their own perdition
polixenes fairly offer'd
camillo this shows a sound affection
shepherd but my daughter
say you the like to him
perdita i cannot speak
so well nothing so well no nor mean better
the purity of his
shepherd take hands a bargain
and friends unknown you shall bear witness to't
i give my daughter to him and will make
her portion equal his
florizel o that must be
i' th' virtue of your daughter one being dead
i shall have more than you can dream of yet
enough then for your wonder but come on
shepherd come your hand
and daughter yours
polixenes soft swain awhile beseech you
have you a father
florizel i have but what of him
polixenes knows he of this
florizel he neither does nor shall
polixenes methinks a father
is at the nuptial of his son a guest
is not your father grown incapable
of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
with age and alt'ring rheums can he speak hear
know man from man dispute his own estate
lies he not bed rid and again does nothing
but what he did being childish
florizel no good sir
he has his health and ampler strength indeed
than most have of his age
you offer him if this be so a wrong
something unfilial reason my son
should choose himself a wife but as good reason
the father all whose joy is nothing else
but fair posterity should hold some counsel
in such a business
florizel i yield all this
but for some other reasons my grave sir
which 'tis not fit you know i not acquaint
polixenes let him know't
florizel he shall not
polixenes prithee let him
florizel no he must not
shepherd let him my son he shall not need to grieve
at knowing of thy choice
florizel come come he must not
mark our contract
polixenes discovering himself mark your divorce young sir
to be acknowledg'd thou a sceptre's heir
that thus affects a sheep hook thou old traitor
i am sorry that by hanging thee i can but
shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece
of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
the royal fool thou cop'st with
shepherd o my heart
polixenes i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made
more homely than thy state for thee fond boy
that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession
not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
farre than deucalion off mark thou my words
follow us to the court thou churl for this time
though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
that makes himself but for our honour therein
these rural latches to his entrance open
or hoop his body more with thy embraces
i will devise a death as cruel for thee
as thou art tender to't exit
perdita even here undone
i was not much afeard for once or twice
i was about to speak and tell him plainly
the self same sun that shines upon his court
hides not his visage from our cottage but
i told you what would come of this beseech you
of your own state take care this dream of mine
being now awake i'll queen it no inch farther
but milk my ewes and weep
camillo why how now father
speak ere thou diest
shepherd i cannot speak nor think
nor dare to know that which i know to florizel o sir
you have undone a man of fourscore three
to die upon the bed my father died
to lie close by his honest bones but now
some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
where no priest shovels in dust to perdita o cursed wretch
that knew'st this was the prince and wouldst adventure
to mingle faith with him undone undone
if i might die within this hour i have liv'd
to die when i desire exit
florizel why look you so upon me
but nothing alt'red what i was i am
more straining on for plucking back not following
my leash unwillingly
camillo gracious my lord
you know your father's temper at this time
he will allow no speech which i do guess
you do not purpose to him and as hardly
will he endure your sight as yet i fear
then till the fury of his highness settle
florizel i not purpose it
i think camillo
camillo even he my lord
perdita how often have i told you 'twould be thus
how often said my dignity would last
but till 'twere known
florizel it cannot fail but by
the violation of my faith and then
let nature crush the sides o' th' earth together
from my succession wipe me father i
am heir to my affection
camillo be advis'd
florizel i am and by my fancy if my reason
will thereto be obedient i have reason
if not my senses better pleas'd with madness
do bid it welcome
camillo this is desperate sir
florizel so call it but it does fulfil my vow
not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
be thereat gleand for all the sun sees or
the close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
to this my fair belov'd therefore i pray you
as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend
when he shall miss me as in faith i mean not
to see him any more cast your good counsels
upon his passion let myself and fortune
and so deliver i am put to sea
with her who here i cannot hold on shore
and most opportune to her need i have
a vessel rides fast by but not prepar'd
for this design what course i mean to hold
shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
concern me the reporting
camillo o my lord
i would your spirit were easier for advice
florizel hark perdita takes her aside
to camillo i'll hear you by and by
camillo he's irremovable
resolv'd for flight now were i happy if
his going i could frame to serve my turn
save him from danger do him love and honour
purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
and that unhappy king my master whom
i so much thirst to see
i am so fraught with curious business that
i leave out ceremony
camillo sir i think
you have heard of my poor services i' th' love
that i have borne your father
florizel very nobly
have you deserv'd it is my father's music
to speak your deeds not little of his care
to have them recompens'd as thought on
if you may please to think i love the king
and through him what's nearest to him which is
your gracious self embrace but my direction
if your more ponderous and settled project
may suffer alteration on mine honour
i'll point you where you shall have such receiving
as shall become your highness where you may
enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
there's no disjunction to be made but by
and with my best endeavours in your absence
your discontenting father strive to qualify
and bring him up to liking
florizel how camillo
may this almost a miracle be done
that i may call thee something more than man
and after that trust to thee
camillo have you thought on
a place whereto you'll go
but as th' unthought on accident is guilty
to what we wildly do so we profess
ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
of every wind that blows
camillo then list to me
this follows if you will not change your purpose
but undergo this flight make for sicilia
and there present yourself and your fair princess
for so i see she must be fore leontes
the partner of your bed methinks i see
leontes opening his free arms and weeping
his welcomes forth asks thee there 'son forgiveness'
as 'twere i' th' father's person kisses the hands
of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him
'twixt his unkindness and his kindness th' one
he chides to hell and bids the other grow
faster than thought or time
florizel worthy camillo
hold up before him
camillo sent by the king your father
to greet him and to give him comforts sir
the manner of your bearing towards him with
what you as from your father shall deliver
things known betwixt us three i'll write you down
the which shall point you forth at every sitting
what you must say that he shall not perceive
but that you have your father's bosom there
florizel i am bound to you
there is some sap in this
camillo a course more promising
than a wild dedication of yourselves
to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain
to miseries enough no hope to help you
but as you shake off one to take another
nothing so certain as your anchors who
do their best office if they can but stay you
prosperity's the very bond of love
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
affliction alters
perdita one of these is true
i think affliction may subdue the cheek
but not take in the mind
camillo yea say you so
there shall not at your father's house these seven years
be born another such
she is as forward of her breeding as
she is i' th' rear o' our birth
camillo i cannot say 'tis pity
she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
to most that teach
perdita your pardon sir for this
i'll blush you thanks
florizel my prettiest perdita
but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
the medicine of our house how shall we do
we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son
nor shall appear in sicilia
camillo my lord
fear none of this i think you know my fortunes
do all lie there it shall be so my care
to have you royally appointed as if
the scene you play were mine for instance sir
that you may know you shall not want one word
re enter autolycus
autolycus ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his sworn
brother a very simple gentleman i have sold all my trumpery
not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch
table book ballad knife tape glove shoe tie bracelet
horn ring to keep my pack from fasting they throng who should
buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a
benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was
best in picture and what i saw to my good use i rememb'red my
love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the
herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might
have pinch'd a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a
codpiece of a purse i would have fild keys off that hung in
chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring
the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy i pick'd and
cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come
in with whoobub against his daughter and the king's son and
the whole army
camillo florizel and perdita come forward
camillo nay but my letters by this means being there
so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
florizel and those that you'll procure from king leontes
camillo shall satisfy your father
perdita happy be you
all that you speak shows fair
camillo seeing autolycus who have we here
nothing may give us aid
autolycus aside if they have overheard me now why hanging
camillo how now good fellow why shak'st thou so
fear not man here's no harm intended to thee
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir
camillo why be so still here's nobody will steal that from thee
yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange
therefore discase thee instantly thou must think there's a
necessity int and change garments with this gentleman though
some boot giving money
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir aside i know ye well
empty
camillo nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half flay'd
empty
autolycus are you in camest sir aside i smell the trick

florizel dispatch i prithee
autolycus indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with conscience
camillo unbuckle unbuckle
florizel and autolycus exchange garments
fortunate mistress let my prophecy
come home to ye you must retire yourself
into some covert take your sweetheart's hat
and pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face
dismantle you and as you can disliken
the truth of your own seeming that you may
for i do fear eyes over to shipboard
perdita i see the play so lies
that i must bear a part
camillo no remedy
have you done there
florizel should i now meet my father
he would not call me son
camillo nay you shall have no hat
giving it to perdita
come lady come farewell my friend
florizel o perdita what have we twain forgot
pray you a word they converse apart
camillo aside what i do next shall be to tell the king
of this escape and whither they are bound
wherein my hope is i shall so prevail
to force him after in whose company
i shall re view sicilia for whose sight
i have a womans longing
florizel fortune speed us
camillo the swifter speed the better
exeunt florizel perdita and camillo
autolycus i understand the business i hear it to have an open
ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a
cut purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for
th' other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth
thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot
is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive
at us and we may do anything extempore the prince himself is
clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to
acquaint the king withal i would not do't i hold it the more
knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my

none must know but the king and which he shall know within this
hour if i may come to th' speech of him
autolycus age thou hast lost thy labour
shepherd why sir
autolycus the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new
ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou be'st
capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of
shepherd so 'tis said sir about his son that should have
married a shepherd's daughter
autolycus if that shepherd be not in hand fast let him fly the
curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the
back of man the heart of monster
clown think you so sir
autolycus not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and
vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though
remov'd fifty times shall all come under the hangman which
sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his
daughter come into grace some say he shall be stond but that
death is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a

against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon
him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but
what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be
smild at their offences being so capital tell me for you seem
to be honest plain men what you have to the king being
something gently consider'd i'll bring you where he is aboard
tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs
and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here
clown he seems to be of great authority close with him give him
gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led
by the nose with gold show the inside of your purse to the
outside of his hand and no more ado remember stond and flay'd

strange sights he must know 'tis none of your daughter nor my
sister we are gone else sir i will give you as much as this

think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they
have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for
being so far officious for i am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't to him will i present them there
may be matter in it exit
act v scene i
sicilia the palace of leontes
enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and others
a saint like sorrow no fault could you make
which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down
more penitence than done trespass at the last
do as the heavens have done forget your evil
with them forgive yourself
leontes whilst i remember
her and her virtues i cannot forget
my blemishes in them and so still think of
the wrong i did myself which was so much
destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
bred his hopes out of
paulina true too true my lord
if one by one you wedded all the world
or from the all that are took something good
to make a perfect woman she you killd
would be unparalleld
leontes i think so killd
she i killd i did so but thou strik'st me
upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
say so but seldom
cleomenes not at all good lady
you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit and grac'd
your kindness better
paulina you are one of those
would have him wed again
dion if you would not so
of his most sovereign name consider little
what dangers by his highness' fail of issue
may drop upon his kingdom and devour
incertain lookers on what were more holy
than to rejoice the former queen is well
what holier than for royalty's repair
for present comfort and for future good
to bless the bed of majesty again
with a sweet fellow to't
respecting her that's gone besides the gods
will have fulfilld their secret purposes
for has not the divine apollo said
is't not the tenour of his oracle
that king leontes shall not have an heir
till his lost child be found which that it shall
is all as monstrous to our human reason
as my antigonus to break his grave
and come again to me who on my life
my lord should to the heavens be contrary
oppose against their wills to leontes care not for issue
the crown will find an heir great alexander
left his to th' worthiest so his successor
was like to be the best
leontes good paulina
who hast the memory of hermione
i know in honour o that ever i
had squar'd me to thy counsel then even now
have taken treasure from her lips
paulina and left them
more rich for what they yielded
leontes thou speak'st truth
no more such wives therefore no wife one worse
and better us'd would make her sainted spirit
again possess her corpse and on this stage
where we offend her now appear soul vex'd
and begin 'why to me'
she had just cause
leontes she had and would incense me
to murder her i married
paulina i should so
were i the ghost that walk'd i'd bid you mark
her eye and tell me for what dull part int
you chose her then i'd shriek that even your ears
should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd
should be 'remember mine'
and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
i'll have no wife paulina
paulina will you swear
never to marry but by my free leave
leontes never paulina so be blest my spirit
paulina then good my lords bear witness to his oath
cleomenes you tempt him over much
paulina unless another
as like hermione as is her picture
cleomenes good madam
paulina i have done
yet if my lord will marry if you will sir
no remedy but you will give me the office
to choose you a queen she shall not be so young
as was your former but she shall be such
as walk'd your first queens ghost it should take joy
to see her in your arms
leontes my true paulina
paulina that
shall be when your first queens again in breath
never till then
enter a gentleman
gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel
son of polixenes with his princess she
the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
to your high presence
leontes what with him he comes not
so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
'tis not a visitation fram'd but forc'd
by need and accident what train
gentleman but few
and those but mean
leontes his princess say you with him
gentleman ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
that e'er the sun shone bright on
paulina o hermione
above a better gone so must thy grave
give way to what's seen now sir you yourself
have said and writ so but your writing now
is colder than that theme 'she had not been
nor was not to be equalld' thus your verse
flow'd with her beauty once 'tis shrewdly ebb'd
to say you have seen a better
gentleman pardon madam
the one i have almost forgot your pardon
will have your tongue too this is a creature
would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
of all professors else make proselytes
of who she but bid follow
paulina how not women
gentleman women will love her that she is a woman
more worth than any man men that she is
the rarest of all women
leontes go cleomenes
bring them to our embracement exeunt
still 'tis strange
he thus should steal upon us
paulina had our prince
jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd
well with this lord there was not full a month
between their births
leontes prithee no more cease thou know'st
he dies to me again when talk'd of sure
will bring me to consider that which may
unfurnish me of reason
re enter cleomenes with florizel perdita and
empty
they are come
your mother was most true to wedlock prince
for she did print your royal father off
conceiving you were i but twenty one
your father's image is so hit in you
as i did him and speak of something wildly
by us perform'd before most dearly welcome
and your fair princess goddess o alas
i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth
might thus have stood begetting wonder as
you gracious couple do and then i lost
all mine own folly the society
amity too of your brave father whom
though bearing misery i desire my life
florizel by his command
have i here touch'd sicilia and from him
give you all greetings that a king at friend
can send his brother and but infirmity
which waits upon worn times hath something seiz'd
his wish'd ability he had himself
the lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
measur'd to look upon you whom he loves
he bade me say so more than all the sceptres
leontes o my brother
good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir
afresh within me and these thy offices
so rarely kind are as interpreters
of my behind hand slackness welcome hither
as is the spring to th' earth and hath he too
expos'd this paragon to th' fearful usage
at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune
to greet a man not worth her pains much less
florizel good my lord
she came from libya
leontes where the warlike smalus
that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and lov'd
florizel most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence
a prosperous south wind friendly we have cross'd
to execute the charge my father gave me
for visiting your highness my best train
who for bohemia bend to signify
not only my success in libya sir
but my arrival and my wife's in safety
here where we are
leontes the blessed gods
purge all infection from our air whilst you
do climate here you have a holy father
a graceful gentleman against whose person
so sacred as it is i have done sin
have left me issueless and your father's blest
as he from heaven merits it with you
worthy his goodness what might i have been
might i a son and daughter now have look'd on
such goodly things as you
enter a lord
lord most noble sir
that which i shall report will bear no credit
were not the proof so nigh please you great sir
desires you to attach his son who has
his dignity and duty both cast off
fled from his father from his hopes and with
a shepherd's daughter
leontes where's bohemia speak
lord here in your city i now came from him
i speak amazedly and it becomes
my marvel and my message to your court
whiles he was hast'ning in the chase it seems
the father of this seeming lady and
her brother having both their country quitted
with this young prince
florizel camillo has betray'd me
whose honour and whose honesty till now
endur'd all weathers
lord lay't so to his charge
he's with the king your father
leontes who camillo
has these poor men in question never saw i
wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
forswear themselves as often as they speak
bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
with divers deaths in death
perdita o my poor father
the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
our contract celebrated
leontes you are married
the stars i see will kiss the valleys first
the odds for high and low's alike
leontes my lord
is this the daughter of a king
florizel she is
when once she is my wife
leontes that 'once' i see by your good father's speed
will come on very slowly i am sorry
most sorry you have broken from his liking
your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
that you might well enjoy her
florizel dear look up
though fortune visible an enemy
should chase us with my father pow'r no jot
hath she to change our loves beseech you sir
remember since you ow'd no more to time
than i do now with thought of such affections
step forth mine advocate at your request
leontes would he do so i'd beg your precious mistress
which he counts but a trifle
paulina sir my liege
your eye hath too much youth int not a month
fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
than what you look on now
leontes i thought of her
even in these looks i made to florizel but your petition
is yet unanswer'd i will to your father
i am friend to them and you upon which errand
i now go toward him therefore follow me
and mark what way i make come good my lord exeunt
scene ii
sicilia before the palace of leontes
enter autolycus and a gentleman
autolycus beseech you sir were you present at this relation
first gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the
old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after
only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child
autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it
first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the
changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of
admiration they seem'd almost with staring on one another to
tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness
language in their very gesture they look'd as they had heard of
a world ransom'd or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder
appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but
the extremity of the one it must needs be
enter another gentleman
here comes a gentleman that happily knows more the news rogero
second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilld
the king's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out
within this hour that ballad makers cannot be able to express it
enter another gentleman
here comes the lady paulina's steward he can deliver you more
how goes it now sir this news which is calld true is so like
king found his heir
third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance that which you hear you'll swear you see there is
such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermione's her
jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with
it which they know to be his character the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness
which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences
proclaim her with all certainty to be the king's daughter did
second gentleman no
third gentleman then you have lost a sight which was to be seen
cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown
another so and in such manner that it seem'd sorrow wept to take
leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up
of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour
our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries 'o thy
his son in law then again worries he his daughter with clipping
her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a
weather bitten conduit of many kings' reigns i never heard of
such another encounter which lames report to follow it and
undoes description to do it
second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried
hence the child
third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to
rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was
has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but
a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers
third gentleman wreck'd the same instant of their master's death
and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments
which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was
found but o the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was
fought in paulina she had one eye declind for the loss of her
husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilld she
as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be
in danger of losing
first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes for by such was it acted
third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that
which angld for mine eyes caught the water though not the
fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the
manner how she came to't bravely confess'd and lamented by the
king how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign
bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most
marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all
the world could have seent the woe had been universal
first gentleman are they returned to the court
third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mother's statue
which is in the keeping of paulina a piece many years in doing
and now newly perform'd by that rare italian master julio
romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into
his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is
one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with
all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend
to sup
second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in
hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since
the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we
thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of
access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our
exeunt gentlemen
autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me would
preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son
aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i
know not what but he at that time over fond of the shepherd's
daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much
sea sick and himself little better extremity of weather
continuing this mystery remained undiscover'd but 'tis all one
to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not
enter shepherd and clown
here come those i have done good to against my will and already
appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
shepherd come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born
clown you are well met sir you denied to fight with me this
other day because i was no gentleman born see you these
clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman
born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give
autolycus i know you are now sir a gentleman born
clown ay and have been so any time these four hours
shepherd and so have i boy
clown so you have but i was a gentleman born before my father
for the king's son took me by the hand and calld me brother and
then the two kings calld my father brother and then the prince
my brother and the princess my sister calld my father father
and so we wept and there was the first gentleman like tears that
ever we shed
clown ay or else 'twere hard luck being in so preposterous
estate as we are
autolycus i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i
have committed to your worship and to give me your good report
to the prince my master
shepherd prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
empty
clown thou wilt amend thy life
autolycus ay an it like your good worship
honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia
shepherd you may say it but not swear it
clown not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and franklins
say it i'll swear it
shepherd how if it be false son
clown if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in
the behalf of his friend and i'll swear to the prince thou art a
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i
know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
fellow of thy hands
autolycus i will prove so sir to my power
clown ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder
how thou dar'st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow
trust me not hark the kings and the princes our kindred are
going to see the queens picture come follow us we'll be thy
good masters exeunt

you have paid home but that you have vouchsaf'd
with your crownd brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
it is a surplus of your grace which never
leontes o paulina
we honour you with trouble but we came
to see the statue of our queen your gallery
have we pass'd through not without much content
in many singularities but we saw not
that which my daughter came to look upon
the statue of her mother
paulina as she liv'd peerless
so her dead likeness i do well believe
or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
lonely apart but here it is prepare
to see the life as lively mock'd as ever
still sleep mock'd death behold and say 'tis well
paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione
standing like a statue
i like your silence it the more shows off
your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
comes it not something near
chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
thou art hermione or rather thou art she
in thy not chiding for she was as tender
as infancy and grace but yet paulina
hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
so aged as this seems
polixenes o not by much
paulina so much the more our carver's excellence
which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
leontes as now she might have done
so much to my good comfort as it is
now piercing to my soul o thus she stood
even with such life of majesty warm life
as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her
i am asham'd does not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone than it o royal piece
there's magic in thy majesty which has
my evils conjur'd to remembrance and
standing like stone with thee
perdita and give me leave
and do not say 'tis superstition that
i kneel and then implore her blessing lady
dear queen that ended when i but began
give me that hand of yours to kiss
paulina o patience
the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's
not dry
which sixteen winters cannot blow away
so many summers dry scarce any joy
did ever so long live no sorrow
but killd itself much sooner
polixenes dear my brother
let him that was the cause of this have pow'r
to take off so much grief from you as he
will piece up in himself
paulina indeed my lord
would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine
i'd not have show'd it
leontes do not draw the curtain
paulina no longer shall you gaze ont lest your fancy
may think anon it moves
leontes let be let be
would i were dead but that methinks already
what was he that did make it see my lord
would you not deem it breath'd and that those veins
polixenes masterly done
the very life seems warm upon her lip
leontes the fixture of her eye has motion int
as we are mock'd with art
paulina i'll draw the curtain
my lord's almost so far transported that
he'll think anon it lives
leontes o sweet paulina
make me to think so twenty years together
the pleasure of that madness let 't alone
paulina i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you but
i could afflict you farther
leontes do paulina
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort still methinks
there is an air comes from her what fine chisel
could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
for i will kiss her
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
with oily painting shall i draw the curtain
leontes no not these twenty years
perdita so long could i
stand by a looker on
paulina either forbear
quit presently the chapel or resolve you
for more amazement if you can behold it
and take you by the hand but then you'll think
which i protest against i am assisted
by wicked powers
leontes what you can make her do
i am content to look on what to speak
i am content to hear for 'tis as easy
to make her speak as move
paulina it is requir'd
you do awake your faith then all stand still
i am about let them depart
leontes proceed
no foot shall stir
paulina music awake her strike music
'tis time descend be stone no more approach
strike all that look upon with marvel come
i'll fill your grave up stir nay come away
bequeath to death your numbness for from him
dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs
start not her actions shall be holy as
you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
until you see her die again for then
you kill her double nay present your hand
when she was young you woo'd her now in age
is she become the suitor
leontes o she's warm
if this be magic let it be an art
lawful as eating
camillo she hangs about his neck
if she pertain to life let her speak too
polixenes ay and make it manifest where she has liv'd
or how stoln from the dead
paulina that she is living
were it but told you should be hooted at
like an old tale but it appears she lives
though yet she speak not mark a little while
please you to interpose fair madam kneel
our perdita is found
hermione you gods look down
and from your sacred vials pour your graces
upon my daughter's head tell me mine own
where hast thou been preserv'd where liv'd how found
thy father's court for thou shalt hear that i
knowing by paulina that the oracle
gave hope thou wast in being have preserv'd
myself to see the issue
lest they desire upon this push to trouble
your joys with like relation go together
you precious winners all your exultation
partake to every one i an old turtle
will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
my mate that's never to be found again
lament till i am lost
leontes o peace paulina
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
and made betweens by vows thou hast found mine
but how is to be questiond for i saw her
as i thought dead and have in vain said many
a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far
for him i partly know his mind to find thee
an honourable husband come camillo
and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
is richly noted and here justified
by us a pair of kings let's from this place
that e'er i put between your holy looks
my ill suspicion this your son in law
and son unto the king whom heavens directing
is troth plight to your daughter good paulina
lead us from hence where we may leisurely
each one demand and answer to his part
perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
we were dissever'd hastily lead away exeunt
the end
a lover's complaint
by william shakespeare
from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
a plaintful story from a sist'ring vale
my spirits t'attend this double voice accorded
and down i laid to list the sad tuned tale
ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain
which fortified her visage from the sun
whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
the carcase of a beauty spent and done
time had not scythed all that youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage
some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age
oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
which on it had conceited characters
laund'ring the silken figures in the brine
and often reading what contents it bears
as often shrieking undistinguished woe
in clamours of all size both high and low
sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride
as they did batt'ry to the spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
to th' orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right on anon their gazes lend
to every place at once and nowhere fixed
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride
for some untucked descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
some in her threaden fillet still did bide
and true to bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided in loose negligence
a thousand favours from a maund she drew
of amber crystal and of beaded jet
upon whose weeping margent she was set
like usury applying wet to wet
or monarchs' hands that lets not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
of folded schedules had she many a one
which she perused sighed tore and gave the flood
cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone
bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood
enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy
these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
and often kissed and often 'gan to tear
cried 'o false blood thou register of lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seemed more black and damned here
this said in top of rage the lines she rents
big discontents so breaking their contents
a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
of court of city and had let go by
the swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
and privileged by age desires to know
in brief the grounds and motives of her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
and comely distant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance with his hearing to divide
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
'tis promised in the charity of age
'father' she says 'though in me you behold
the injury of many a blasting hour
let it not tell your judgement i am old
not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower
fresh to myself if i had self applied
love to myself and to no love beside
a youthful suit it was to gain my grace
o one by nature's outwards so commended
that maidens' eyes stuck over all his face
love lacked a dwelling and made him her place
and when in his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged and newly deified
'his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
and every light occasion of the wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
for on his visage was in little drawn
what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn
'small show of man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but to appear
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
whose bare out bragged the web it seemed to wear
yet showed his visage by that cost more dear
and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
for maiden tongued he was and thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such a storm
as oft 'twixt may and april is to see
when winds breathe sweet unruly though they be
his rudeness so with his authorized youth
did livery falseness in a pride of truth
'well could he ride and often men would say
that horse his mettle from his rider takes
what rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes
and controversy hence a question takes
whether the horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by th' well doing steed
'but quickly on this side the verdict went
his real habitude gave life and grace
to appertainings and to ornament
accomplished in himself not in his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
pierced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so on the tip of his subduing tongue
all kind of arguments and question deep
all replication prompt and reason strong
for his advantage still did wake and sleep
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
he had the dialect and different skill
catching all passions in his craft of will
'that he did in the general bosom reign
to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
in personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitched ere he desire have granted
and dialogued for him what he would say
asked their own wills and made their wills obey
'many there were that did his picture get
to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
like fools that in th' imagination set
the goodly objects which abroad they find
and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have that never touched his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
my woeful self that did in freedom stand
and was my own fee simple not in part
what with his art in youth and youth in art
threw my affections in his charmed power
reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
demand of him nor being desired yielded
finding myself in honour so forbid
with safest distance i mine honour shielded
experience for me many bulwarks builded
of proofs new bleeding which remained the foil
of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunned by precedent
the destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples 'gainst her own content
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
for when we rage advice is often seen
by blunting us to make our wills more keen
'nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
that we must curb it upon others' proof
to be forbod the sweets that seems so good
for fear of harms that preach in our behoof
o appetite from judgement stand aloof
the one a palate hath that needs will taste
'for further i could say this mans untrue
and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
heard where his plants in others' orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
thought characters and words merely but art
and bastards of his foul adulterate heart
'and long upon these terms i held my city
till thus he 'gan besiege me gentle maid
and be not of my holy vows afraid
that's to ye sworn to none was ever said
for feasts of love i have been called unto
till now did ne'er invite nor never woo
'all my offences that abroad you see
are errors of the blood none of the mind
love made them not with acture they may be
where neither party is nor true nor kind
they sought their shame that so their shame did find
by how much of me their reproach contains
'among the many that mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed
or my affection put to th' smallest teen
or any of my leisures ever charmed
harm have i done to them but ne'er was harmed
kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
and reigned commanding in his monarchy
'look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
of grief and blushes aptly understood
in bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood
effects of terror and dear modesty
encamped in hearts but fighting outwardly
'and lo behold these talents of their hair
with twisted metal amorously empleached
i have receiv'd from many a several fair
their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched
and deep brained sonnets that did amplify
each stone's dear nature worth and quality
'the diamond why 'twas beautiful and hard
whereto his invised properties did tend
the deep green em'rald in whose fresh regard
weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
the heaven hued sapphire and the opal blend
with objects manifold each several stone
with wit well blazoned smiled or made some moan
of pensived and subdued desires the tender
nature hath charged me that i hoard them not
but yield them up where i myself must render
that is to you my origin and ender
for these of force must your oblations be
since i their altar you enpatron me
'o then advance of yours that phraseless hand
whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
take all these similes to your own command
what me your minister for you obeys
works under you and to your audit comes
their distract parcels in combined sums
'lo this device was sent me from a nun
or sister sanctified of holiest note
which late her noble suit in court did shun
whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
but kept cold distance and did thence remove
'but o my sweet what labour is't to leave
the thing we have not mast'ring what not strives
playing the place which did no form receive
playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
she that her fame so to herself contrives
the scars of battle scapeth by the flight
and makes her absence valiant not her might
'o pardon me in that my boast is true
the accident which brought me to her eye
and now she would the caged cloister fly
religious love put out religions eye
not to be tempted would she be immured
and now to tempt all liberty procured
'how mighty then you are o hear me tell
the broken bosoms that to me belong
have emptied all their fountains in my well
and mine i pour your ocean all among
i strong o'er them and you o'er me being strong
as compound love to physic your cold breast
'my parts had pow'r to charm a sacred nun
who disciplined ay dieted in grace
believed her eyes when they t'assail begun
all vows and consecrations giving place
o most potential love vow bond nor space
in thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
for thou art all and all things else are thine
'when thou impressest what are precepts worth
how coldly those impediments stand forth
of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
love's arms are peace 'gainst rule 'gainst sense 'gainst shame
and sweetens in the suff'ring pangs it bears
the aloes of all forces shocks and fears
'now all these hearts that do on mine depend
feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
and supplicant their sighs to your extend
to leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine
and credent soul to that strong bonded oath
that shall prefer and undertake my troth
'this said his wat'ry eyes he did dismount
whose sights till then were levelled on my face
each cheek a river running from a fount
with brinish current downward flowed apace
o how the channel to the stream gave grace
who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
that flame through water which their hue encloses
in the small orb of one particular tear
but with the inundation of the eyes
what rocky heart to water will not wear
what breast so cold that is not warmed here
o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
both fire from hence and chill extincture hath
'for lo his passion but an art of craft
even there resolved my reason into tears
there my white stole of chastity i daffed
appear to him as he to me appears
all melting though our drops this diff'rence bore
his poisoned me and mine did him restore
'in him a plenitude of subtle matter
applied to cautels all strange forms receives
of burning blushes or of weeping water
or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
in either's aptness as it best deceives
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
'that not a heart which in his level came
could scape the hail of his all hurting aim
showing fair nature is both kind and tame
and veiled in them did win whom he would maim
against the thing he sought he would exclaim
when he most burned in heart wished luxury
he preached pure maid and praised cold chastity
'thus merely with the garment of a grace
the naked and concealed fiend he covered
which like a cherubin above them hovered
who young and simple would not be so lovered
ay me i fell and yet do question make
what i should do again for such a sake
'o that infected moisture of his eye
o that false fire which in his cheek so glowed
o that forced thunder from his heart did fly
o that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed
o all that borrowed motion seeming owed
and new pervert a reconciled maid'
