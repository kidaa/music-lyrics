feed'st thy light's flame self substantial fuel
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
shall sum count make old excuse'
disdains tillage thy husbandry
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
then how when nature calls thee gone
hideous winter confounds him there
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
resembling strong youth his middle age
music hear why hear'st thou music sadly
resembling sire child happy mother
thou no form thee hast left behind
shame deny thou bear'st love any
as thy presence gracious kind
without this folly age cold decay
when do count clock tells time
since sweets beauties do themselves forsake
find no determination then were
not from stars do judgement pluck
as truth beauty shall together thrive
cheered checked even by self same sky
but wherefore do not mightier way
neither inward worth nor outward fair
fresh numbers number all graces
shall compare thee summer's day
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest his shade
do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time
womans face nature's own hand painted
by addition thee defeated
sun moon earth sea's rich gems
glass shall not persuade am old
bearing thy heart which will keep so chary
perfect ceremony love's rite
mine eye hath played painter hath stelled
are windows breast where through sun
but as marigold at suns eye
lord love whom vassalage
puts apparel tattered loving
intend zealous pilgrimage thee
how can then return happy plight
so flatter swart complexioned night
featured him him friends possessed
when sessions sweet silent thought
sad account fore bemoaned moan
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
if thou survive well contented day
dearer birth than this his love had brought
ugly rack his celestial face
why didst thou promise such beauteous day
th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
authorizing thy trespass compare
let confess two must twain
nor thou public kindness honour
or any these all or all or more
how can muse want subject invent
he calls thee let him bring forth
our dear love lose name single one
take all loves love yea take them all
yet love knows greater grief
beauteous thou art therefore assailed
thou hast her not all grief
both find each other lose both twain
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
if dull substance flesh were thought
but so much earth water wrought
tender embassy love thee
mine eye heart are at mortal war
by their verdict determined
painted banquet bids heart
how careful was when took way
within gentle closure breast
scarcely greet sun thine eye
how heavy do journey way
which heavily he answers groan
when swift extremity can seem but slow
so am as rich whose blessed key
make some special instant special blest
poorly imitated after
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
die themselves sweet roses do not so
broils root out work masonry
sweet love renew thy force not said
come daily banks when they see
whilst sovereign watch clock
god forbid made first slave
what will doth belong
even five hundred courses sun
as waves make towards pebbled shore
feeds rarities nature's truth
so far from home into deeds pry
sin self love possesseth all mine eye
mine own self love quite contrary read
all those beauties whereof now he's king
when have seen by time's fell hand defaced
ruin hath taught thus ruminate
against wrackful siege batt'ring days
tired all these restful death cry
simple truth miscalled simplicity
steal dead seeming his living hue
thus his cheek map days outworn
making no summer another's green
but those same tongues give thee so thine own
thou art blamed shall not thy defect
yet this thy praise cannot so thy praise
hand writ love so
o lest world should task recite
name buried where body
as after sunset fadeth west
but contented when fell arrest
coward conquest wretch's knife
doubting filching age will steal his treasure
why verse so barren new pride
so all best dressing old words new
mouthed graves will give thee memory
so oft have invoked thee muse
others' works thou dost but mend style
deserves travail worthier pen
o how faint when do write
or being wrecked am worthless boat
though once gone all world must die
grant thou wert not married muse
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
self being extant well might show
who says most which can say more
such counterpart shall fame his wit
unlettered clerk still cry amen
was proud full sail his great verse
as victors silence cannot boast
riches where deserving
when thou shalt disposed set light
injuries self do
set form upon desired change
then hate when thou wilt if ever now
but onset come so shall taste
wherein finds joy above rest
but do thy worst steal thy self away
o what happy title do find
therefore cannot know thy change
they have power hurt will do none
but if flower base infection meet
making lascivious comments thy sport
some say thy fault youth some wantonness
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
teeming autumn big rich increase
from have been absent spring
they were but sweet but figures delight
lily condemned thy hand
100
if time have any wrinkle graven there
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say

our dates are brief therefore admire
124
which works leases short numbered hours
have not seen dwellers form favour
126
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
upon blessed wood whose motion sounds
making dead wood more blest than living lips
past reason hated as swallowed bait
coral far more red than her lips red
mistress when she walks treads ground
say they err dare not so bold
knowing thy heart torment disdain
suit thy pity every part
him self thee am forsaken
self am mortgaged thy will
so him lose through unkind abuse
shall will others seem right gracious
swear thy blind soul was thy 'will
nothing something sweet thee
why eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
do believe her though know she lies
age love loves not have years told
what need'st thou wound cunning when thy might
tongue tied patience too much disdain
mad slanderers by mad ears believed
nor taste nor smell desire invited
hate sin grounded sinful loving
thy pity may deserve pitied
follow which flies before her face
which two spirits do suggest still
guess one angel another's hell
was used giving gentle doom
sinful earth these rebel powers array
within fed without rich no more
hath left desperate now approve
which have no correspondence true sight
sun self sees not till heaven clears
nay if thou lour'st do not spend
insufficiency heart sway
others thou shouldst not abhor state
soul doth tell body he may
but thou art twice forsworn love swearing
or made them swear against thing they see
grew seeting bath which yet men prove
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand

rosalind then there were two cousins laid up when one should
celia hem them away
by this kind chase should hate him father hated his
rosalind uncle
as do trust am not then dear uncle
rosalind so was when highness took his dukedom
celia did not then entreat have her stay
speak people they pity her
greatness word die
celia no hath not rosalind lacks then love
rosalind why whither shall go
because am more than common tall
therefore look call ganymede
devise fittest time safest way
more free from peril than envious court
wears yet precious jewel his head
being native burghers this desert city
upon brook brawls along this wood

so soon as spare cassius he reads much
rather tell thee what fear'd
casca why there was crown offered him being offered him

there was more foolery yet if could remember
cassius so he now execution

welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
cassius but what cicero shall sound him
brutus o name him not let us not break him
if he improve them may well stretch so far
o then could come by caesar's spirit
which so appearing common eyes

bears glasses elephants holes
metellus caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
let not our looks put our purposes

see his shipwreck his commonweals

nor would noble mother much more
aaron away say
this discord's ground music would not please
chiron aaron thousand deaths
though bassianus emperor's brother
demetrius aaron thou hast hit
affect so must resolve
many unfrequented plots there are
but wishes' height advance both
per styga per manes vehor exeunt
all court may echo noise
promised grace hunter's peal
will rouse proudest panther chase
bury so much gold under tree
tamora lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad
let us sit down mark their yellowing noise
aaron madam though venus govern desires
hark tamora empress soul
which dreads not yet their lives' destruction
see general hunting this forest
are singled forth try thy experiments
if foul desire had not conducted
enter chiron demetrius
when they show'd this abhorred pit
leave this miserable death
chiron this struck home show strength
painted hope braves mightiness
lavinia o tamora thou bearest womans face
yet every mother breeds not sons alike
nothing so kind but something pitiful
therefore away her use her as will
tumble into some loathsome pit
this hole where aaron bid us hide him
titus' sons quintus martius
upon whose leaves are drops new shed blood
from this unhallow'd blood stained hole
o tell who ne'er till now
shows ragged entrails this pit
this deep pit poor bassianus' grave
into this gaping hollow earth
re enter tamora
pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
o tamora was ever heard
some never heard torturing pain them
titus did lord yet let their bail
fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
demetrius see how signs tokens she can scrowl
if do dream would all wealth would wake
bubbling fountain stirr'd wind
shall speak thee shall say 'tis so
could have better sew'd than philomel
such sight will blind father's eye
titus hear grave fathers noble tribunes stay
because they died honour's lofty bed
summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still
tribunes hear not no man by
who though they cannot answer distress
rises
from these devourers banished
titus faint hearted boy arise look upon her
bootless prayer have they been held up
where sweet melodious bird sung
who marks waxing tide grow wave by wave
now behold thy lively body so
perchance because she knows them innocent
how they are staind meadows yet not dry
make us wonder'd at time come
her brother which said thee
send king he same
shall not sent hand will serve turn
aaron nay come agree whose hand shall go along
titus agree between will spare hand
he cuts off titus' hand
aaron go andronicus thy hand
do then dear heart heaven shall hear our prayers
then into limits could bind woes
why bowels cannot hide her woes
woe think upon thy woes
where life hath no more interest but breathe
even stony image cold numb
would usurp upon wat'ry eyes
swear unto soul right wrongs
exeunt all but lucius
make proud saturnine his emperess
as will revenge these bitter woes ours
when thy poor heart beats outrageous beating
titus how now has sorrow made thee dote already
if marcus did not name word hands
nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make sign
what dost thou strike at marcus thy knife
buzz lamenting doings air
flattering myself as if were moor
i'll thy closet go read thee
follows everywhere know not why
ah boy cornelia never more care
although lord know noble aunt
some book there she desires see
titus lucius what book she tosseth so
marcus see brother see note how she quotes leaves
unless gods delight tragedies
staff guides feet mouth
guides stumps writes
arm minds infants exclaims
but if hunt these bear whelps then beware
where's our lesson then boy what say
presents intend send them both
marcus attend him his ecstasy
he hath some message deliver us
gratify honourable youth
non eget mauri iaculis nec arcu'
but let her rest her unrest awhile
demetrius would had thousand roman dames
chiron belike joy emperor hath son
what dost thou wrap fumble thy arms
nurse joyless dismal black sorrowful issue
aaron villain have done thy mother
nurse give sword shall soon dispatch
nor great alcides nor god war
keep mine own excuse how she can
chiron blush think upon this ignomy
he enfranchised come light
they sit
two may keep counsel when third's away
his wife but yesternight was brought bed
pointing nurse
herself hers are highly bound thee
warrior command camp
terras astrea reliquit
pray deliver him this petition
kinsmen then may go pipe justice
vengeance traitor saturnine
pull her out acheron by heels
'ad jovem' that's here 'ad apollinem'
titus now masters draw they shoot o well said lucius
who should find them but empress' villain
titus but what says jupiter ask thee
marcus why sir as fit as can serve
supplication
when thou hast given emperor
an emperor rome thus overborne

shall no shelter these outrages
rather comfort his distressed plight
tamora empress am but yonder sits emperor
shall endure this monstrous villainy
enter nuntius aemilius
these tidings nip hang head
will revolt from succour him
words more sweet yet more dangerous
aemilius go thou before our ambassador
pluck proud lucius from warlike goths
which signifies what hate they bear their emperor
bold us we'll follow where thou lead'st
as earnestly did fix mine eye
they never do beget coal black calf
this pearl pleas'd empress' eye
sight vex father's soul withal
thy child shall live will see nourish'd
aaron swear he shall then will begin
keeps oath which by god he swears
which thou shalt hear anon
as sure card as ever won set
wherein had no stroke mischief
tidings gave twenty kisses
accuse some innocent forswear myself
'let not sorrow die though am dead'
but torment bitter tongue
he craves parley at father's house
tamora thus this strange sad habiliment
trick make ope door
tamora if thou didst know thou wouldst talk
am revenge sent from th' infernal kingdom
revenge which makes foul offender quake
provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
tamora these are ministers come
tamora this closing him fits his lunacy
see here he comes must ply theme
would represent our queen aright
when thou find'st man that's thyself
they have been violent mine
them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
feast at house he shall feast them
him
lay complot betray thy foes
titus fie publius fie thou art too much deceiv'd
stop close their mouths let them not speak word
killd her husband vile fault
whiles lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
this feast have bid her
make this banquet which wish may prove
his child arms an attendant
fear emperor means no good us

'tis true 'tis true witness knife's sharp point

nor can utter all our bitter grief
they were ravished our sister

1609
upon her head platted hive straw
seasoned woe had pelleted tears
mind sight distractedly commixed
which one by one she river threw
sleided silk feat affectedly
sometime blusterer ruffle knew
if from him there may aught applied
'but woe too early attended
what's sweet do do will aptly find
if best were as was or best without
proud subjection noble by sway
came additions yet their purposed trim
young old sexes both enchanted
lands mansions theirs thought assigned
'yet did not as some equals did
put by past perils her way
though reason weep cry thy last
have suffering youth some feeling pity
so much less shame remains
paled pearls rubies red as blood
annexions fair gems enriched
'lo all these trophies affections hot
hallowed sighs burning lungs did raise
spend her living eternal love
upon moment did her force subdue
must victory us all congest
stale example when thou wilt inflame
lending soft audience sweet design
'o father what hell witchcraft lies
shook off sober guards civil fears
or turn white swoon at tragic shows
th' unexperient gave tempter place
would yet again betray fore betrayed
