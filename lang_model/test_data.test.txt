chorus
with a gift of gab and tryin to hook up with the hookers
i had family but i was way too wild
y'knahmean where do niggaz go when we die
no one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
and in my mind's eye i see this place the players go in fast
and street passion every ghetto needs a thug mansion
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
dear momma dont cry your baby boy's doin good
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
niggaz need a spot where we can kick it
so much pressure in this life of mine i cry at times
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
aint no place i'd rather be
they'd rather see us locked in chains please explain
the deadly places slingin drugs in thug's mansion
tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven so come home

and the streets is death row i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
a soldier dies but once
bitches is bad mouth cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
tonight's the night i get in some shit dr dre
picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
goin insane never die live eternal who shall i fear
back in the days we played practical jokes on
and though i been around clowning with the underground
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
i'm down to the e n d
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
smiling face to hide the trace of heat
i'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
hey nigga can i lay low cook some ya yo
pour some liquor on the curb for my homies that deserve it
as i slang another ounce i wish it was a kilo
i pack a pistol in my pocket ready on my glock

bustin guns i had no remorse as a teen
tryin to freeze time that's why i ice the face of my watch
spendin my nights all alone
hopin i get through to you
this was the place of our first date
oh how i miss her touch
she saved for someone else
'bout someone i love so much
stuck sitting you left me there waiting for you
but i cannot stand the feeling without you

have you ever ever ever ever loved
there was a time i had her heart
chorus
to say how i feel to do what i need to do
and how can i look up to the way
just out to break your heart
take it from me
has it not occurred to you that it may be someone else
tonight was the night
my lady you shot your arrow
caressing your skin
chorus
the way you looked it cant be found
i did what i could you know i tried
it's time to make this story end
now the well has run dry
to make you want to run away from my love
you made the choice to creep
was it something i said
what the hell do you want from me
you aint got no game
it's like inch by inch and step by step
chorus
if i hit 'em high hit 'em high hit 'em high
deadshot aim as free throws keep comin down like rain
with hang time like a coat hanger
every step i take shakes the ground
if the refs get political dribble like bob dole
we're speed ballin on the fastbreak just like the pony express
while you abandon your ship we take your championship
