[50 Cent Verse]
I'm not gon' waste your time talkin' about shit that you know
I'm so hood that even when i try to hide it, it shows
I be grindin' girl i'm focused i be gettin' my dough
You know if it aint the flow then it come from the O's
Plus a nigga like a pimp when it come to the hoes
Every hood every city all the gangstaz know
Front on me and you be gettin' hit up fo sho
I make it hot when its 20 motherfuckin' below
See with me in V.I.P you can twist and blow
When the champagne finished baby order some more
Keep her eye on ya close while you out on the floor
The way you move i have a nigga straight sniffin' some ??smoke??
If you ready to roll shorty we could just roll
When you ready to go i be ready to go uh oh
See everything i do, i do on the low uh oh
So when we do our thing nobody will know uh oh

[50 Cent Verse]
Now look i know you into the shiny things
The platinum chains and the diamond rings
The 24 inch chrome on the range
I see you in your projects buy your window payin'
Now shorty me and you we came up the same
The fact before rap i ain't have a thing
I hustled got my weed up now im sittin' on change
I mean i got money out that ass mayne
When niggaz get to beefin' i be laffin'
Cuz i can send my homiez through to blast 'um
Stick him with the ?? or just slash 'um
Now fool are you crazy thats what we ask 'um
But back with me n you, you shorty decide a thang
First its off with the bra then its the G-string uh oh
We leave it up to me then we do it my way uh oh
And get straight to it skip the four play uh oh
