
I pull more beeps than the beep at the premier of Pocohantas
Word is born, I am the baddest
And all you honies out there, word is born, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't no Barnum and Bailey show, I don't get down wit the clowns
So why don't you and your friends, get wit me and my friends
But don't bring your ass buying you ain't got no ends
Word is born, it don't stopstop,stop,stop...
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop

[Q-Tip]
You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you a cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jub rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto, rise on the top
You know we come back and do the hop
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop
This is how it is, we do the hop
