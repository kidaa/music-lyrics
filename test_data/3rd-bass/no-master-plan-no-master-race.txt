Set to decide, who's on the inside track
but you slack and so another dive
and you lounge - but who's shoes would you be in?
Wake up, it's time to respect the Nubian
flag of a people, fightin every day
for their own say, so children can go out to play
And stray from the tyranny, while blood is drippin B
I ain't no flapjack, don't bother flippin me
I stick to this, so say this while you're grazin
Original man's a black man, said by a caucasian
Watchin a culture be stolen from Asia
Whether minor or major, science I swayed y'all
with lingo, some people don't think so
When do you stop sayin - that's the way things go?
Time to manifest the quest that's hard to digest
The companies are frontin Pete, why don't they divest
and invest in freedom, but they scheme on a brother
Stealin trunk jewelry that's MILES undercover
So discover as a people, we have to take our place
There is no master plan because there is no master race

	";No ghetto, no master race.."; 3X
	";Let both sides, unite, in peace..";

Science for seasons, years and days
A preacher follows his prejudice, the drummer plays
off the evils of men, love bones and flesh
A brother's keeper keeps puttin peace to rest
Question props and the prophets agreed, ya heed
Dust to dust, herbs yieldin seeds of
creation of cultures to street sound
You get run around but I run the booty down
No master plan, the masses all struggle
Slug movements bungle, our serpent is subtle
Hatred born in diversity of culture spoke
Ignorance got the last straw, the camel's broke
Change up wisdom wise and stick to tools
One called slavemaster's son by a poor fool
I ain't the hypocrite fit with the two-face
There's no master plan, there's no master race

	";No ghetto, no master race.."; 3X
	";Let both sides, unite, in peace..";

[MC Serch]
The creators creations are put to side
You see one wants greed and then slide
into that all-about-me frame of mind
And keep the truth away from the blind
You gotta find out who is who and who built this place
I play spy and try to destroy the race
We go the wrong way, the wrong play master
The same people that got the +Gas Face+ last year
Tears shed as another head gets put to bed
Paradise is a paradox, the devil's ridin sleds
over skulls, that dulls all the truth
It's the reason why we need to raise the roof
to look to the heavens as the master's one plan
We stand to help the birth, of just one man
The master's plan, the master's race shackled to a shelf
in a book that you need to find for yourself
I stand accused, but never abuse the Sunday
cause when I'm gone I'll only go one way

	";No ghetto, no master race.."; 3X
	";Let both sides, unite, in peace..";

[Pete Nice]
I ain't a master, no I'm not superior
So why you tryin to play one as inferior
Fears in hearts of the ignorant belligerents
Ever since those convinced of lost innocence
Got off the tip slippin sticks and stones
Homes are broken or fractured like bones
Who holds your soul as the master your dollar spent
Evidence of dictators gone hellbent
In times of old the races vicked power many places
Seperate races in segregated spaces
Back in the day you turned your backs on
Deals in doom, so now the deally lays the cracks on
Sold more then sold forth from South to North
Swingin low on supremacy's corpse
Of course not steppin out of place is in place
Question those on the question of race

	";No ghetto, no master race.."; 3X
	";Let both sides, unite, in peace..";
	";Both sides begin anew the quest for peace..";
