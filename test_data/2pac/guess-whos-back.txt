Guess who's back? 

[2Pac] 
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got 
two minutes to bounce, and every second counts 
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet 
My trickery's more slippery when wet 
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip 
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit 
Everybody's got a mic now, its like a hobby 
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin to rob me 
And little man wants to be a rap, star 
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car 
It ain't easy, sleazy even 
Deceivin those we, believe in 
No benefits, just tricks and chicks 
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick 
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left 
And if I find that the track sound def 
I catch wreck till I lose my breath 
That's how it goes in the land of broke 
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough 
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why? 
I say, "Hi," and try to stay high 
Life's a mess don't stress, test.. of givin 
but be thankful that you're livin.. blessed 
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied 
by Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact 
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at? 
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back 

[Chorus: repeat 4X] 

"Yes I'm back" - [Special Ed] 
"Tupac is" .. back!! 

[2Pac] 
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got 
one minute to bounce, and every second counts 
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin hits, bustin flicks 
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six 
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes 
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date 
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break 
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black take 
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race 
But if ya got a black face, its a rat race 
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes 
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits 
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME? 
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me 
Givin up the roughness, justice 
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits 
And guess who's back? No longer trapped 
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact 
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip 
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back? 

[Chorus 1.5X] 

"Yes I'm back, cause I never did front" - [cut 'n' scratched]
