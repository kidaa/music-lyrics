feat. Nate Dogg, YGD Tha Top Dawg 

You probably crooked as the last trick 
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch? 
Thinking I had her but she had me in the long run 
Its just my luck I'm stuck fuckin with wrong one, uh 
Wise decisions based on lies we living 
Skandalous times is games like my religion 
You could be rolling with a thug 
Instead you with this sweet scrub 
Looking for some love 
In every club, I see you standing like you want it 
Well baby if ya got it better flaunt it 
Let the liquor help you get up on it 
I'm still tipsy from last night 
Bumpin in walls as I pause 
Addicted to the fast life 
I try to holler but you tell me you're taken 
Sayin you ain't impressed with the money I'm make 
Guess its true what they telling me 
Fresh out of jail lights hell for a black celebrity 
So thats the reason why I call 
And maybe you with it 
Fantasies of the sweatin 
Can I hit it? hahaha 
Addicted to the things you do 
Its still true what I'm saying Boo 
Cause this is All About U 

Every other city we go 
Every other video 
its all about you 
No matter where I go 
I see the same hoe 
[repeat] 

I'll make a promise if ya go with me 
Just let me know, I'll have you hollering 
My name out before I leave 
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga 
I only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers 
I love niggas 
Cause we coming from the same place 
Witness me holler at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes 
How can I tell her I'm a playa 
And I don't even care 
Creep though 
Weed smokes in the air 
Everywhere I go, its all about the groupie hoes 
waiting for niggas at the end of every show 
I just seen ya in my friends video 
Never put you on my friends so here we go 
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm going through 
It's All About U 
Yeah nigga, its All About U 

[Chorus 2X] 

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu? 
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew 
Every other city we go and every video 
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe 
You think it's all about you? 
Well, boo, I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too 
You couldn't hold me back 
It'll take a fatter track, a lyrical attack 
Or perhaps it was a visual bluff 
When I started to snaps all your ? 
Straight in control 
?Flows are full? 
Why hold a cold stroll? 
Coldest set 
I told you I'm as gold 
And that's gold diggin 
Cold diggin a ? 
I slide in easily 
Try a grizzly 
Sluts know the cuts 
I came to fuck 
Try skeezin me 
Runnin up in this 
It's like ? when I bring ya the most 
I fuck a bitch from the West coast 

[Chorus 4X] 

You know what I'm saying? 
Every other city we go 
I see the same hoes 
In the studio, that kickin it in the video 
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs 
But you's a groupie baby, and don't look surprised 
I can see it in your eyes, that you ain't nothing but a trick 
Hanging with us, for some superstar dick 
Want an autograph placed on her napkin 
After she asks "Ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin?" 
She know whats crackin 
Peep shows like Luke 
From the limos, down to the Lexus coupes 
We be flossin, and all females love that 
Especially when you're dope, platinum, and your own ? 
So when I met you 
I really didn't have to say much 
Cause me alone 
Just made you want to taste and touch 
Don't be trippin if I run up in you and your whole crew 
I'ma still let you know girl, that it's all about you
