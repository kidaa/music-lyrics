Troublesome nigga
[chorus plays in background]
Troublesome 19-muthafuckin-96 westside
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
can you picture my specific plan
to be the man in this wicked land,underhanded hits are planned
scams are plotted over grams and rocks
when undercover agents die by the random shots
we all die in the end, so the feds we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
me, a born leader, never leave the block without my my heata
got me a dog get nigga Mobb bitch nigga eata
what could they do to me that little brat
shit them niggas shot me and still terrified, I'll get their ass
how can I show you how I feel inside
we outlawz motherfuckas can't kill my pride
niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after im gone
cause they fear me in physical form let it be known
I'm troublesome

[chorus]
tra la la la la la all ya niggas die [several times]

trouble shit
gutter ways my mentality is ghetto
we're guerillas in this criminal war, we all rebels
death before dishonor bet on bomb on them first niggas do
we came for murder, pullin' up in a herse
westside was the war cry bustin' all freely screaming fuck
all ya'll niggas in Swahili
pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
release me to care of my heartless strap
say my name three times like Candyman
bet I roll on your ass like an avalance
a soul survivor, learned to get high and pull drive bys
burned my folks, can't control my nine
hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
picture me lettin this chump survive
redin' up on his ass when I'm doped and died
cause I'm troublesome

[chorus]

murder murder my mind states shit ain't change since my last rhyme
the crime rate ain't decline
niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
tell me young nigga never learned a thang
dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
sniffed a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
afraid to sleep in havin' of crazy dreams
vivid pictures of my enemies and family times
God to forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
need to take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
did the best I could, raised in insanity
or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
cause I'm troublesome
