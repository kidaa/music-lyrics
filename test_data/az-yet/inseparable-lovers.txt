[Rick Cousin & J. Scott]

Inseparable lovers,
from the start I really want to know what's going on in my heart
Hey, I've got this feeling that you will be mine,
all mine until the end of time
As I go along, I can feel you keep me going strong
Each and every day as I go my way
My love is all for you and it's here to stay
I've been waiting, I've been waiting

Why baby, do you make me feel that way
I'm glad I got you in my love today
I'll never doubt your love will stay
You love will stay always

I'm hanging on just like a child, said I've been with you for quite a while
Please girl, understand me
Oh my love is not demanding, and I will not ever leave you
Ever leave you No, No, No, No, No
Real love with good intentions
Girl won't you share my visions
My visions of a perfect love
Just like the ones from up above
My perfect angel, listen
I have but one conviction
You were the change and I plead guilty
I plead guilty
You love hit me

[CHORUS]

Inseparable, love will never go away
Inseparable, love will always be here to stay

[CHORUS]
