Missy Elliott:
Aaliyah Aaliyah
Wake up
You've just now entered
Into the next level
The new world of funk aha
As we do it one time
Creeping through the fog
Who dat y'all
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
Creeping through the fog
Who dat y'all
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H

Aaliyah:
I've got the beats
For da streets
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
Everything I make
Is so unique hey
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
Say hey if you down with me
Hey L-I-Y-A-H
If you step to me
There's no need
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H

Missy Elliott:
Creeping through the fog
Who dat y'all
Damn she be the bomb, damn
Say what
Creeping through the fog
Who dat y'all
Dang, damn she be da bomb
Creeping through the fog
Who dat y'all

Wake up
