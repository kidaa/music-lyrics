First chapter
You stole my heart away from me
Made me believe true love could be
We were so close you changed my life
How could a love so strong not go right

Where do we go from here
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
The way you looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end

Time to close the book to this story
I don't want to read it no more
Time to close the book to this story
Another writer will come along, I'm sure

Final chapter
I say goodbye, I made you cry
I did what I could, you know I tried
There's no more to say, so I'll go my way
You know that it hurts me
But that's the price we pay

Where do we go from here
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
When I looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end

Time to close the book to this story
I don't want to read it no more
Time to close the book to this story
Another writer will come along, I'm sure
