aw Randy Ran what's up. we talkin bout girlies
If you think your wrong, then you know your right
gettin into my buisness, just aint satisfied
better stop dippin girl
it dont become of you
you got too much time on your hand oh baby
If your lovin me
keep on lovin me
dont let this silly girl distract you from me
all she wants is
to get you away from me, dont fall into that trap
He said, she said, we said, we dont need it
he said , she said , we said we dont need it. hook
I know you want me
but you cant have me
my love is tied up with my girl right now
you told her you saw me
just the other day, kickin it with the invisible woman
How could you try such a silly willy game
the two of us we're not havin it no way
my sweet heart is my only lover
dont play me like a sho nuff fool nooooo
aw kevon here they come talkin that mess
wait a minute, can I say somethin,
the girlie aint got no buisness in my buisness
that's right
