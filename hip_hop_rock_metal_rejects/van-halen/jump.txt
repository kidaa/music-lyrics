I get up, and nothing gets me down 
You got it tough
I've seen the toughest around 
And I know, baby, just how you feel 
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real 

Oh can't you see me standing here 
I've got my back against the record machine 
I ain't the worst that you've seen 
Oh can't you see what I mean 

Might as well jump, jump
Might as well jump 
Go ahead, and jump, jump
Go ahead, and jump 

Ah-oh
Hey you
Who said that
Baby how you been 
You say you don't know, you won't know
Until you begin 

Well can't you see me standing here 
I've got my back against the record machine 
I ain't the worst that you've seen 
Oh can't you see what I mean 

Might as well jump, jump 
Go ahead, and jump 
Might as well jump, jump 
Go ahead, and jump, jump 

Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead, and jump 
Get it and jump, jump
Go ahead, and jump 
Jump, jump, jump, jump
