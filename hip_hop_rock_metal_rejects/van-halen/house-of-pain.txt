Say you're gonna leave me cause I only tie you up 
I always love you tender
But you only like it rough 
Woman, where you going
Why you're leaving me again 
Gonna pack your bags, and leave this house of pain 

Heartaches all around me, how many times we tried 
Said she tried to leave me
But her hands were always tied 
If I had it all to do I'd do it just the same 
Gonna fix it so you never leave this house of pain
