Drop dead legs, pretty smile,  
hurts my head, gets me wild.  
Dig that steam, giant butt,  
makes me scream, I get nuh-nuh-nothing but the shakes over you  
And nothing else could ever do.  

You know that you want it.  
I know what it is.  
You know that you want it, baby,  
When the night is through, will I still be loving you  

Dig those moves, vam-pire  
set me loose, get it higher.  
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop  
nice white teeth, Betty Boop.  
Set it cool real heavy.  
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready.
