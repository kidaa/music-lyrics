Ahhh...
Ahhh...
Doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
