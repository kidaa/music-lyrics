Heart's filthy lesson 
There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies
Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes

It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon dead ears

Heart's filthy lesson
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future [x2]
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies [x2]
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy
Paddy oh Paddy, 
I think I've lost my way
Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave
Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson
I'm already x3
Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson
Will you carry me
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss 2
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson

Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson

What a fantastic death abyss
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
