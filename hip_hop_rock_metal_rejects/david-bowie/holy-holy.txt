Listen day
Let me lie low
Lie low with you
To be alive
My oh my
Slowly
We get good and holy
Helping one another
Just a righteous brother
Night time
Gimme back the night time
I don't wanna be angel
Just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
An' let go of me
Listen lady
Let me lie low
Lie low with you
To be alive
My oh my
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
An' let go of me
