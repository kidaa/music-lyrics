Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that
everything is real,
anybodys' point of of view
Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life
I knew you found your sight
and nothing would be quite the same
Please help me
Who can I be now?
You found me
Who can I be?
Felled apart, you found me
Now can I be now?
You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real?
[somebody real]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
If it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Some-one has to see, uhh,
row for him and me
Some-one, might as well be you
Up in Heaven, any angel
writes a special game to play
Oh-ho, could we, could we make a star
to snatch their angels, boy
Made you row, boy, every day
Please help me
Who can I be now?
You found me
Who can I be?
Felled apart, you found me
Now can I be now?
You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be?
Who can I be now?
You found me
Who can I be?
Felled upon, you found me
Now can I be now?
You found me
No-o-ow can I, can I be real?
Can I be real?
Can I be real?
Can I be?
[Who] can I be?
Oh babe, babe
[Now] Yeah, can I be [now]?
You found me
[Now] can I be free?
Can I...
