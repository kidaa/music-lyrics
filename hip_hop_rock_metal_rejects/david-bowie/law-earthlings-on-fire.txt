I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire 

[CHORUS]
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 

In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

[CHORUS]
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire 
Oh I get a little bit afraid

Sometimes

I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty 

Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge
