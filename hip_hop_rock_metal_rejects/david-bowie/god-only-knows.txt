Brian Wilson/Tony Asher 
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows
What I'd be without you...
J. Ferrar/P. Robinson
I've seen so many smiling faces today
But just what lies behind them I can't see
I've lived my life in many places it seems
Now I just don't know where I want to be
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more
The years have opened up a canyon it seems
A canyon deep and wide that I can't cross
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes
I learned that every game must have a lost
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more
Don't be afraid to tell me that things are not the same
I'm older now and wiser
I know how things can change
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more...
