Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time

All the flowers so
From the gallery
with the hymns of night
Singing "come to me"
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time

Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my [x3]
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away oh ho

[Repeat]
