Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile 
as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that 
he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[CHORUS x2]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation 
as a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like 
a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night 
as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right 
as a rock & roll star
