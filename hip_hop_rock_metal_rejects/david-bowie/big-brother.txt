Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal

He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, 
then we can really begin

Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

[CHORUS]
Someone to claim us, someone to follow

Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo

Someone to fool us, someone like you 
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square

But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

[CHORUS 3 times]

We want you Big Brother
