you got crazy legs
     you got amazin' hair
    you got rings on your fingers
  and your hair's hot red
       you got wit from my tongue
  name on the sun
     i got you goin' to my breast
       'cause you're 
the only one
     who uses school for pleasure
you make me act real gone
  you make me troll along
    i have to ravish your capsule
     suck you dry
     feel the teeth in your bones
you give head with my own
i give
 up, i'm your whore
[ . . . ]
here all together
velvet goldmine
you stroke me like the rain
snake it, take it
but the princess you must stay
velvet goldmine
naked on your chain
i'll be your king volcano
writhe for you again and again
my velvet goldmine
you're my tricks, my trip
 i'll be your masters yet
i'll chop your hair off for kicks
   you'll make me jump to my feet
so when you give me your hand, give me your sound
let my sea wash your face
       i'm
 fallin', i can't stand
 put your mink on
velvet goldmine
you stroke me like the rain
snake it, take it
but the princess you must stay
velvet goldmine
naked on your chain
i'll be your king volcano
writhe for you again and again
my velvet go
ldmine

a lot of these lyrics are probably slightly wrong.  brackets indicate
a lyric i could not decipher for the life of me.  perhaps they're best
left uninterpreted.
