Rick Davies
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places we have
Where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look over the town
Then you think about all of the strange things
Circulating 'round
CHORUS
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy with all that's going down
All the people have got their problems
That ain't no bad news
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it takes you right up
And sometimes down again
CHORUS
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I got the love of a hootchy-cootchy woman
She's a-callin' from inside
She's a-callin' from inside
She's talkin' to you, too
What the woman really wants
You can give her somethin' too
CHORUS
