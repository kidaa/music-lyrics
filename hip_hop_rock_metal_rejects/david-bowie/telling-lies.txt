Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

[CHORUS]
Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies
Ooh, ah, visionary
Ooh, ah, missionary
Telling lies
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
Telling lies
Ooh, ah, visionary
Ooh, ah, missionary
Telling lies
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
Telling lies...

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You'll come to me in tears and rain
I'm your future, 
I'm tomorrow, I'm the end
