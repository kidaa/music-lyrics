White boys falling on the fires of night
I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell
Flesh punks burning 
in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell
I'd rather be inside you

[CHORUS 1 twice]
Tell the truth [x3]
We prick you we prick you we prick you
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I ***you
we wish you well, we wish you well
Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing 
when the nightmare comes
I wish you well, I wish you well
Wanna come quick and die

[CHORUS 1 twice]

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
Toys, toys, little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun 
Even if you disagree

[CHORUS 1 twice]
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
even if you disagree, even if you disagree
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
