[REFRAIN]
Nowhere
Shampoo
TV
Come back
Boy's own
Slim tie
Showdown
Can't stop

Where do we go from here
There's something in the sky
Shining in the light
Spinning and far away

[CHORUS]
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Looking for satellites 
Looking for satellites

Where do we go to now
There's nothing in our eyes
As lonely as a moon
Misty and far away

[CHORUS]
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Looking satellites 
Looking satellites 

Where do we go from here
