You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you any more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while ya look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
Ya stay for a while, then you pick up and go
{Chorus 1}
That's how you show
your love for me
That's how you show
your love for me
You're like
{Chorus 2}
Here today,
gone tomorrow
Each time you call,
you leave a little sorrow
You're like
{chorus 2}
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Givin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's 'xactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace
{chorus 1}
{chorus 2}

Oooh-huh
Oh-ho
Here today,

Hmmm, like
You're like
{chorus 2}
{chorus 2}
Yeah
Here today
Here today but gone tomorrow
