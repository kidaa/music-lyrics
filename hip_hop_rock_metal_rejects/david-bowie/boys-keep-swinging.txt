heaven loves ya
 the clouds smile for ya
 nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
 clothes always fit ya
 life is the pop of a cherry when you're a boy
 when you're a boy
   you can where a uniform
 when you're a boy
   other boys check you out
 you get a girl
   these are your favorite things
 when you're a boy
 boys
 boys
 boys
 boys keep swinging
 boys always work it out
 unpage the colors
 unfurl the flag
 love just kissed you hello when you're a boy
 they'll never clone ya
 you're always first on the line when you're a boy
 when you're a boy
   you can buy a home of your own
 when you're a boy
   learn to drive and everything
 you get a girl
   you'll get your share
 when you're a boy.
