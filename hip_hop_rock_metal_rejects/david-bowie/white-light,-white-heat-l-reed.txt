{Verse 1}
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my brain
[White light] White light gonna make me feel so insane
[White  heat] White shapin' them down to my toes
[White light] White light's got a nana, goodness knows
{Verse 2}
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my mind
[White light] White light is surely gonna make me blind
[White  heat] White shaping way down to my toes
[White light] White light could kill me now, goodness knows
{Chorus}
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White heat
Oh, Oh, White heat
{verse 1}
[White light] White light has got it now, goodness knows
{verse 2}
{chorus}
{chorus}
White light's a-flashin'
White light
Don't feel sorry
What's that sound, what's that sound,
don't turn on, be deader alive
No feelin'
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
[Oh, oh, oh, oh] here she comes
[Oh, oh, oh, oh]
[Ah, ah, ah, ah]
