There's A Sound It's Heard Across The Land
It's Heard Across The Sea
You'll Only Hear It If You Listen With Your Heart
And One Day Hope To Be Free
To Hear The Sound Of Freedom Many Gave Their Lives
They Fought For You And Me
Those Memories Will Always Live Inside Us
Now It's Our Time To Be Free

Where The Eagles Fly I Will Soon Be There
If You Want To Come Along With Me My Friend
Say The Words And You'll Be Free
From The Mountains To The Sea
We'll Fight For Freedom Again

So Ring Out Loud For All The World To Hear
From Sea To Shining Sea
Let Freedom Ring And Every Man Be King
To Live As One Through The Years

Where The Eagles Fly I Will Soon Be There
If You Want To Come Along With Me My Friend
Say The Words And You'll Be Free
From The Mountains To The Sea
We'll Fight For Freedom Again

Now's The Time We All Must Stand Together
So Raise Your Hands Show Them We Are Strong
Side By Side The Fight Goes On Forever
Marching To The Battle With This Song

Where The Eagles Fly I Will Soon Be There
If You Want To Come Along With Me My Friend
Say The Words And You'll Be Free
From The Mountains To The Sea
We'll Fight For Freedom Again
