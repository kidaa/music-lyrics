When They Come I'll Be Ready
I Hear Their Voices Inside
The Stars In The Heavens Are Moving
Soon They Will Align
Thor God Of Thunder
Let Me Die With A Sword In My Hand

Raise Your Hands
Swords In The Wind
Brothers Of Metal Together Again
With Blood In Our Voices We Ride
We'll Fight Until We Win
Or We'll Fight Until We Die

Gods Of Thunder, Fire And Rain
Cut Into The Earth Till' None Shall Remain
Sons Of Demons I Command You To Fly
Ride Up From Hell Into The Sky
We'll Fight Until We Die
