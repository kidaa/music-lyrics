See My Chariot Run To Your Ships I'll Drive You Back To The Sea
You Came Here For Gold The Wall Will Not Hold
This Day Was Promised To Me
The Gods Are My Shield My Fate Has Been Sealed
Lightning And Javelins Fly 
Soon Many Will Fall We Are Storming The Wall
Stones Fall Snow From The Sky

We Will Pay With Our Glory In The Fire Of Battle
Zeus Today Is Mine
Killing All In My Way Like Sheep And Like Cattle
Smashing Skulls Of All Who Defy

I Spare Not The Hammer I Spare Not The Sword
This Day Will Ring With My Name
None Have To Chase Me Let He Who Will Face Me
Kill Me Or Die By The Sword
