So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
