The Oath Of The Gods This Day Was Fulfilled
In The Heat Of The Battle Hector Was Killed
See Him Patroclus Down In The Dust
Rejoice In His Death My Symbol Of Trust

A Dozen Highborn Youths Have Been Killed
Cutting Their Throats Their Blood Was All Spilled
Their Bodies Set At The Foot Of Your Fire
With Oxen Sheep And Two Of Your Hounds

Your Funeral Pyre High Off The Ground
Hectors Body Dragged Three Times Around
I Will Carry The Torch To Your Funeral Pyre
I Will Ask Of The Wind To Send High Your Fire

Hectors Blood Will Not Be Washed From My Body
Until Your Body Is Burned
A Prophecy Spoken A Promise Fulfilled
More Blood Will Be Spilled More Will Be Killed
