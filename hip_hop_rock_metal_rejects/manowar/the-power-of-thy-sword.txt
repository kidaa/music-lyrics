Lord Of Battle I Pray On Bended Knee Conquest By The Rising Sun
I'll Wait For Thy Command With Flame And Blood At Hand
Glory And A Broken Sword
I'm The Master Of The World I Have No Fear Of Man Or Beast
Born Inside The Soul Of The World
Riding Hard Breaking Bone With Steel And Stone
Eternal Might I Was Born To Wield

Let Us Drink To The Battles We've Lived And We've Fought
Celebrate The Pain And Havoc We Have Wrought
Great Heroes Charge Into The Fight
From The North To The South In The Black Of Night

The Clash Of Honor Calls To Stand When Others Fall
Gods Of War Feel The Power Of My Sword

Drink To The Battles We've Lived And We've Fought
Celebrate The Pain And Havoc We Have Wrought
Great Heroes Charge Into The Fight
From The North To The South In The Black Of Night

Fierce Is My Blade Fierce Is My Hate
Born To Die In Battle I Laugh At My Fate
Now Pay In Blood When Your Blood Has Been Spilled
You're Never Forgiven Death Is Fulfilled

The Clash Of Honor Calls To Stand When Others Fall
Gods Of War Feel The Power Of My Sword

The Clash Of Honor Calls
I Will Stand When Others Fall.
Open Magic Doors
They Will Know The Power Of My Sword

There Is Blood On My Hands There Is Blood In My Eyes
With Blood In My Voice I Scream As You Die
Thirsting For Vengeance And Mounds Of The Slain
Shaking The Forest Onto The Plain

Fierce Is My Blade Fierce Is My Hate
Born To Die In Battle I Laugh At My Fate
Now Pay In Blood When Your Blood Has Been Spilled
You're Never Forgiven
Death Is Fulfilled

The Clash Of Honor Calls
To Stand When Others Fall
Gods Of War Feel The Power Of My Sword
They Will Know The Power Of My Sword
