Hands Of Doom Are Reaching Out To Crush All Infidels Who Stray
Time To Know The Pain But No Time To Run Within
And These Hands You See Before You Will End The Light Of Day
Your Ashes Will Be Cast Into The Wind
Your Bloods Upon The Soil Your Body Fed To Wolves
Not One Of You Will Be Left Alive
Hear The Sound, Pounding, And The Army Of The Night
By The Hammer Of Thor You Now Shall Die

Tonight We Strike There Is Thunder In The Sky
Together We'll Fight Some Of Us Will Die
We'll Always Remember That We Made A Stand
And Many Will Die By My Hand!

We Are High Atop A Mountain With Hammers In The Wind
Lusting For Blood And Death Again
In A Flash Of Lightning Strike
Now The House Of Death Invites You, Body And Soul To Come Within

I See The Fear You Have Inside You Can Run But Never Hide
I Will Hunt You Down And Tare You Limb From Limb
Nothing Shall Remain Not Your Memory, Your Name
It Will Be As Though You Never Ever Lived

Tonight We Strike There Is Thunder In The Sky
Together We'll Fight Some Of Us Will Die
We'll Always Remember That We Made A Stand
Many Will Die By My Hand!

They Will Die....

High Atop A Mountain With Hammers In The Wind

Nothing Shall Remain Not Your Memory, Your Name
It Will Be As Though You Never Ever Lived

Tonight We Strike There Is Thunder In The Sky
Together We'll Fight And Some Of Us Will Die
But We'll Always Remember That We Made A Stand
And Many Will Die By My Hand
They Will Die, By My Hand......They Will Die...
