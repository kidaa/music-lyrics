Here Inside The Walls Of Troy The Gods Weigh My Fate
From This Day Do I Abstain To A Memory Of Hate
To Pay For All The Blood That Spilled The Many Thousands I Did Kill
No Walls Can Contain The Gods Almighty Will
I Hear The Silent Voices I Cannot Hide
The Gods Leave No Choices So We All Must Die
Oh Achilles Let Thy Arrows Fly
Into The Wind Where Eagles Cross The Sky
Today My Mortal Blood Will Mix With Sand
It Was Foretold I Will Die By Thy Hand
Into Hades My Soul Descend
