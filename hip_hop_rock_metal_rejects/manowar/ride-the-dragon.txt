Demons Blood And Dragon Fire Falling On My Wings

Racing To The Battle In The Sky
Ancient Gods Are Calling Me I Hear Them When They Sing
Of All The Heroes Who Wait For Me To Die
Beneath A Cloak Of Magic Ill Meet Them In The Air
I Am Invisible I Move Without A Sound
They Look But Cannot Find Me They Think That Im Not There
With A Spell I Send Them Crashing To The Ground

Wait For Me Dragon Well Meet In The Sky
By Fire And Magic I Am Sworn
Hell Is Calling We Cannot Be Denied
Fly To The Blackness Of The Storm
We Must Die To Be Reborn

I Wear A Sacred Talisman I Make A Secret Sign
Now Welcome Me Into This Wicked Wind
On The Journey Of A Shaman A Dragon I Must Ride
The Gates Of Hell Are Open Let Me In

Rule In Hell Or Serve In Heaven Choose An Altar Or Throne
All Commandments And Laws Of Man Disown
Now Eat The Fruit Of Knowledge To One Ye Atone
Into The Fire With Your Soul

Wait For Me Dragon Well Meet In The Sky
By Fire And Magic I Am Sworn
Hell Is Calling We Cannot Be Denied
Fly To The Blackness Of The Storm
We Must Die To Be Reborn
