I Surrender My Soul Odin Hear My Call
One Day I'll Sit Beside Your Throne In Valhalla's Great Hall
Like So Many Before Me I'll Die With Honor And Pride
The Right Of A Warrior Forever To Fight By Your Side
Send A Sign Raise The Sail Wave A Last Goodbye
Destiny Is Calling Immortality Be Mine

Call The Witch To Cast The Runes, Weave A Magic Spell
We Who Die In Battle Are Born Not For Heaven Not For Hell

We Are Sons Of Odin The Fire We Burn Inside
Is The Legacy Of Warrior Kings Who Reign Above In The Sky

I Will Lead The Charge My Sword Into The Wind
Sons Of Odin Fight To Die And Live Again
Viking Ships Cross The Sea, In Cold Wind, And Rain
Sail Into The Black Of Night Magic Stars Our Guiding Light

Today The Blood Of Battle Upon My Weapons Will Never Dry
Many I'll Send Into The Ground Laughing As They Die.

We Are Sons Of Odin The Fire We Burn Inside
Is The Legacy Of Warrior Kings Who Reign Above In The Sky

I Will Lead The Charge My Sword Into The Wind
Sons Of Odin Fight To Die And Live Again
Viking Ships Cross The Sea, In Cold Wind, And Rain
Sail Into The Black Of Night Magic Stars Our Guiding Light

Place My Body On A Ship And Burn It In The Sea
Let My Spirit Rise Valkries Carry Me
Take Me To Valhalla Where My Brothers Wait For Me
Fire Burning To The Sky My Spirit Will Never Die

I Will Lead The Charge My Sword Into The Wind
Sons Of Odin Fight To Die And Live Again
Viking Ships Cross The Sea, In Cold Wind, And Rain
Sail Into The Black Of Night Magic Stars Our Guiding Light
