When They See Us They Will Run For Their Lives
To The End They Will Pay For Their Lies
So Long Did We Wait Now We Are Home
Here Once Again There's A Battle To Fight
Gathered Together For The Sound And The Might
So Long Did We Wait Now We Are Home

Now We Will Fight For The Kingdom Fighting With Steel
Kill All Of Them Their Blood Is Our Seal
Fight Till The Last Of The Enemy Is Dead
Ride Through Their Blood That We Gladly Have Shed

I Now Issue The Call Are You Ready To Fight
Fight All Together As One For The Right To Be Free Once Again
Tonight We Will Win

I Can See By The Look That You Have In Your Eyes
You Came Here For Metal To Fight And To Die
Defenders Of Steel Now We Are Home

Fight For The Kingdom Bound For Glory
Armed With A Heart Of Steel
I Swear By The Brothers Who Stand Before Me
To No Man Shall I Kneel
Their Blood Is Upon My Steel
Blood Is Upon My Steel

Fight For The Kingdom Fighting With Steel
Kill All Of Them Their Blood Is Our Seal
Fight Till The Last Of The Enemy Is Dead
Ride Through Their Blood That We Gladly Have Shed

I Now Issue The Call Are You Ready To Fight
Fight All Together As One For The Right To Be Free Once Again
Tonight We Will Win

I Can See By The Look That You Have In Your Eyes
You Came Here For Metal To Fight And To Die
Defenders Of Steel Now We Are Home

Fight For The Kingdom Bound For Glory
Armed With A Heart Of Steel
I Swear By The Brothers Who Stand Before Me
To No Man Shall I Kneel
Their Blood Is Upon My Steel
