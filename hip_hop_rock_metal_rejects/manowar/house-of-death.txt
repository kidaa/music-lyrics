Blood And Thunder Mix With Rain
Into The Kingdom Of Darkness Again
Lightning Flash, My Body In Flames
All Shall Knee At The Sound Of My Name
My Path Is Set I Live With No Regret
I Am Sworn To Kill Never To Forget
No Road Back I Never Will Return
Into The Fire Of Hell I Will Burn And Die
Die! Die! Die!
Into The House Of Death
Die! Die!
Into The Fire Of Hell

Army Of The Heavens
My Army Waits In Hell
To Battle On The Earth
For All The Souls Who Fell

I Will Not Go Unto My Death Alone
Seven Gates To Pass Until I Reach My Home
Across The Bridge Of Death
Beyond The Gates Of Light
Into The Heart Of Darkness
Into The Black Of Night
No Road Back I Never Will Return
Into The Fire Of Hell I Will Burn And Die
Die! Die! Die!
Into The House Of Death
Die! Die!
Into The Fire Of Hell

Unto To The Darkness
I Commend My Soul
Never Shall I Repent
Never Shall I Be Saved

I'll Go Into The House Of Death
Before My Last Breath
My Enemies All Shall Die

Die! Die! Die!
Into The House Of Death
Die! Die!
Into The Fire Of Hell
