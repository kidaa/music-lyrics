I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said,  Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear 
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
