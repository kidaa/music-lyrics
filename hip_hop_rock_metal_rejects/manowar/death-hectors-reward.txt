Cowards In The Grip Of Fear No Valor To Uphold
Cut Into The Earth With Honor Long Been Sold
For All Shall Come To Know Me As They Fall Unto Their Knees
Zeus The Thunderer Control My Destiny

When The Cards Of Life Were Dealt My Hand A Ruthless Fate
To Avenge And Bringeth Fury Hector Feel My Hate
A Bloodbath I Was Born To Bring By Birth I'm An Assassin
To Cut The Cord Of Life And Death Ties To Earth Unfasten

Blood And Fire Death And Hate
Your Body I Will Desecrate Dogs And Vultures Eat Your Flesh
The Hall Of Hades Waits
Kill

Hectors Blood Lies On The Battlefield His Body's Mangled Wounds
The Gods Who Once Protected Him Are Now His Gods Of Doom
Like A Tower Standing Tall Steadfast In Direction
I Fall Upon You Bringing Death The Gods Give No Protection
Coward In The Grip Of Fear No Valor To Uphold
Cut Into The Earth With Honor Long Been Sold
For All Shall Come To Know Me As They Fall Unto Their Knees
Zeus The Thunderer
Control My Destiny

Blood And Fire Death And Hate
Your Body I Will Desecrate Dogs And Vultures Eat Your Flesh
The Hall Of Hades Waits
Die
