We Have Come From The Ashes Of The Burning Away
Pouring Blood In The Fire On The Altar Of Pain
Led Into Temptation Now The Black Gods Align
Here There Is No Salvation And Your Blood Is My Wine
Here's A World That Is Waiting Between The Living And The Dead
Here The Flesh And Its Pleasure Are Eternally Wed
All Is All For The Taking
For A Life Or A Lie
At The End Of The Breaking I'll Be Watching You Die

Crawl To The Silence Renounce And Deny
The Stars And The Numbers Foretold Of This Time
To The Words And The Wisdom Too The Promise Of Lies
By Their Anger And Fury
The Strong Will Survive
