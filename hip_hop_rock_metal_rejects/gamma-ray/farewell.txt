Music / Lyrics: Schlchter
Do you remember
How we used to play like kids in the sun
Nowadays, there's no light to see
And we're feeling cold
So the time has come
To say farewell my friends
My fate is calling loud
Now I know - it can get tough
And I don't you know where I'll be tomorrow
Do you - do you wanna know it
I don't care about it
Somebody said that we could never ever die
Oh what a lie
You will see the light again
We'll all be free someday:
I know - 'cause united we stand
Goodbye my friends, I'm leaving you today
My quest is hard, but I must be on my way
Now, don't ask why
Goodbye dear friends
Solo: Dirk
Don't you try and stop me
All I know is: I have to go!
There'll be no sense in my life at all
If I stay
You will never see it - you will never find it
Oh yes I will!
Someone will take my place if I DIE!
An old man said:
Some years ago; they've tried it all before
Some men of honour left
And searched for that land
They did not return.  Now it's up to you
To play a better game - remember
When you're out there
Don't look back at all
Goodbye my firends, I'm leaving you today
The quest is hard,
I hope I'll find a way home one day
Good my friends, I'm leaving you today
The quest is hard
I know I find a way home one day
You will see the light of day
We'll all be free again
All that's left to say is FAREWELL
