Music / Lyics: Hansen
Somewhere in the desert of the void
Beyond the wall
We're the last survivors
We're the ones who'll never fall
Men inside the circle leave the night!
Darkness al around us
Not a single beam of light
All we have is our faith
Waiting for the fight
The time has come to break the outer wall
Grab your heart I'll show you the way
Hold you head up high
High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free
Men inside the cirlce
Tell me what you feel and see
Delusions of reality
The mirror of your dreams
Hold you ground
And I'll show you the way
Now hold your head up high
Chorus / Solo: Kai / Dirk / Kai / Dirk
And when the cracks appear upon the wall
We know the moments here to see it fall
and as the sunlight appears again in our sky
no wall, no more, no more will darken our life
Melody: Both / Dirk / Chorus
