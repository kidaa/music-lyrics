Someone is out there he's watching what I do
From far in the distance, his eyes everywhere
I look around me, there's noone that I see
But still I feel someone's controlling my mind

Save your breath and run
You can't escape the one

Time has come, the world lies dying
Our faith has gone, our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise, cry for freedom
Killing pain, a million lies,
Dethrone tyranny

Forces of evil, they never surrender
Sooner or later the dark aera comes

Crying man on the run
He's searching for freedom but there will be none

Time has come, the world lies dying
Our faith has gone, our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise, cry for freedom
Killing pain, a million lies,
Dethrone tyranny

And as the world is dying slowly in our hands
We'll ask for reasons until the bitter end

Who brings us all the sadness
Who brings us all the fear
Who spreads disease and misery
And steals our destiny

A poisoned heart of anger
Sowing the seeds of pain
All see the darkened skyline
And feel the deadly reign

Time has come, the world lies dying
Our faith has gone, our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise, cry for freedom
Killing pain, a million lies,
To hell with tyranny
