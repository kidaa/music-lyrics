Music/ Lyircs: Hansen
Come to plague me, rape and take me
Freeze me up, freeze me up.
Politician, inquisition freeze 'em up.
Freeze 'em up, freeze 'em up.
They're closing in, the iron round.
They hold the share in hand.
To strangulate your way to live,
The norm always wins in the end.
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken,
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken.
Tomorrow it will be taken.
Law and order, wall and border,
Freeze me up, freeze me up.
Automatic, democratics, freeze 'em up.
Freeze 'em up, freeze 'em up.
No parole on your housewall,
So nice and clean - our land.
And though they crash the hammer down
Resistance lives on in the end.
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken,
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken.
Tomorrow it will be taken.
They sneak around, they spy your mind
Your unborn child's a number on their way into the grey.
Insanity, they steal your dreams.
They promise everything but they betray
Day after day.
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken,
Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken.
Tomorrow it will be taken.
