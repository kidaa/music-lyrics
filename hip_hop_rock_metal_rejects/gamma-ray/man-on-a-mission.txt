Music / Lyrics: Hansen
I'm a man on a mission
And my deligence won't wait
There are supersonic killers in the sky
Everything you do will be analyzed,
They control every step of your life
Well, mankind has gone to a high extreme
To the dark side on the way
All I see is a masquerade
And the termination waits
Oh, I've seen the faces of a million leaving here
Abandoned times and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing near
The mystery of fear is just about to clear
What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let out hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
>From the neverending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again
So we travel on at the speed of light
And the gods will light our way
Gotta change our part in the masterplan
For another break in the race
And the trumpet sound will soon be heard
As the dead in mind awake
And the joyful saints will guide us
On the onward fight that we take
Oh, I've seen a million
Leaving right away from here
Abondoned times and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing neart
The mystery of hear is just about to clear
Chorus
Take my hand and you will see
The mirror of your destiny
So many came to read the signs,
To understand their meaning
Now I see it's you and me,
So try to understand
And wee will walk the road of life
Together hand in hand
I do not dare, I do not dare
But something's calling me
For those who dared could not break free
The one who will succeed,
I wonder, is it me?
Solo: Kai
Give us a chance to live
Give us a chance to die
Give us a chance to be free
Without fire from the sky
Give us a chance to love
Give us a chance to hate
Give us a chance, before you kill us all
Before you kill us, kill us all
Before you kill us, before you kill us all
Before you kill us
