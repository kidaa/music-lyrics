In a land, far beyond the sun
Rules the darkness, faceless magician
Black towers which raise into the sky
Castle of stones, shadows passing by
Blood is covering the mighty walls
Of those who lost their skin and bones
No one ever saw the light
Oh, slaves of the night
There's a young man, chained on a stake
Lifeless body, he has no strenght to break
His shirt is bloody, his head is hanging down
Decides to die, the ruler took his crown
The wind howles through the emptiness
A different sound as in the past
Screaming echoes in the lanes
Oh, victims of the pain
The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
White winged horse, such a powerful force
Gallops through the sky to break the chains
The winged horse lands by the one
It snorts and stamps, the escape has just begun
The chains are broken, silence fills the place
He backs the horse with his last ounce of strenght
The white horse rears and spreads its wings
To reach for the sky and search for the kings
The one will lead to win at last
Oh, rulers of the past
The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
White winged horse, such a powerful force
Gallops through the sky to free the land
The white horse rears and spreads its wings
To reach for the sky and search for the kings
The one will lead to win at last
Oh, rulers of the past
SOLO: Henjo / Kai / Henjo / both / Henjo
The kings return they're armed with mighty swords
To retake the land and banish evil thoughts
They fight against the shadows, capture souls of the dark might
Dethrone the evil ruler to bring sun into the night
The battle takes a heavy toll
But they achieve what they're fighting for
Now the land is free again
Oh, no more blood and pain
The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
White winged horse, such a powerful force
Gallops through the sky to free the land
But still at night when darkness rules again
Whispering shadows creeping through the lanes
Evil creatures of the expelled magician
Oh, it's a fight you'll never win
