On wings of tomorrow we're coming to fly
Erasing the sorrow and this is the place where you die
We're shaking the chains off the world of today
We're coming to get you no matter what you're gonna say

This is the time of the ending
It's the dawn of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise, we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And you know it's gonna be - we're screaming

This is illumination - we are
We are illuminates - beware
This is illumination - we are
We are illuminates

We live inside society, our presence is unknown
We plot and we manipulate you to which way to go
Illumination comes across the world to bring an end
Intimidating silent force that puts us in command

This is the dawn of the ending
It's the time of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise, we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And we know it's gonna be - forever

This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates - Beware
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates

In the darkness, we shall await
Prepare for changes, to seal your fate

This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates - Beware
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates
