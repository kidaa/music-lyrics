Lead us not into temptation as we grow in fear
Free your mind from all frustrations as they're drawing near
Take your time, live in sin, choose your alibis
Work all day, die in pain, you're a sacrifice

They're gonna send you down to hell
And put your body on a shelf

This is the island of damnation,
Where all your dreams are gonna fall
Your mind is screaming for salvation
And then your world is gonna blow
Down in the fire below
Below

Silent tears are running down my face into the night
As I'm getting closer to my heart that's full of fright

They lead me down a steep hell spire
And burn my body in the fire

This is the island of damnation,
Where all your dreams are gonna fall
My mind is screaming for salvation
My heart is torn apart and thrown
Into the fire below
Below

They're gonna send you down to hell
And put your body on a shelf

This is the island of damnation,
Where all your dreams are gonna fall
My mind is screaming for salvation
My heart is torn apart and thrown
Into the fire below

The fire below
Go down, to nowhere, go down, down
They take you to Hell
Into the fire
They're taking you down
Into the fire
The fire below
