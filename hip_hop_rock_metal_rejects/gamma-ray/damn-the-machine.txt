Damn the Machine
Drilling in the center of my mind
One evil dream
The annihilation of mankind

The stern-faced leaders in their temple of doom
Creating nightmares made for me and for you

Damn the machine
The enemy is stalking in the void
One evil dream
The engine's running faster to destroy

Here come the raiders they're invading us all
We stand in silence with our backs to the wall

Once I believed in the voice of a god
The god of creation is gone

A call from the heart to the god of love
Send us an angel, a sign from above
All of the damned and a silent scream
Save us and damn the machine

The curse - fortold in prophecies is haunting us now
The world - a creeping agony and there's no way out

Caught in illusions I'm screaming in pain
The demon is corroding my brain

A call from the heart to the god of love
Send us an angel, a sign from above
All of the damned and a silent scream
Save us and damn the machine
