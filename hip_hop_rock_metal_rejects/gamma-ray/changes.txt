Lyrics: Hansen, Wessel
I need a new direction
Another thought to serve me right
My mind has got an infection
Where nothing can disturb me,
Where I am free, where I'm forever set
Maybe it's not important
If we are dead or alive.
I never ever wanna listen to the sirens
I'm alive, still alive.
Who says: we are not guilty
I say: we never know the way it goes
Chorus:
Changes - all around me, all inside my head
Changes - changing face, still remaining mad.
Changes -in all day routine.
Hard to enjoy the good times,
Decay is what I feel
God, it's makin' me porous, vanish in haze,
I wonder, wonder if I'm real.
Newflash - under the new regulations
Non-conformity will be punished by law.
Relax - and don't forget to unplug your TV set!
Sigh no more!
For you, you are not guilty,
No, no, you're not responsible at all.
Chorus:
Changes - all around me, all inside my head
Changes - changing face, still remaining mad.
Changes - changing systems, still insane.
Changes - but the madness will remain.
Who is the man who says I'm never gonna die?
It's a lie, it's a lie!
And who is the man who says, I never have a sigh?
It's a lie, it's a lie!
Oppression, resistance
We will never change our way,
The island in my mind is growin'
More and more, day after day.
Changes - all around me now, all inside me now
Changes - wanna cry no more, sigh no more.
