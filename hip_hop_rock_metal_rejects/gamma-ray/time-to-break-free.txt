Music / Lyrics: Hansen
Where will you be tomorrow?
Really I don't care
I have seen the future, rising everywhere
Look into the mirror, tell me what you see
Piece by piece you'll vanish
Until you disappear!
Now I'm doing what I say
No more fooling anyway
Beyond this hell, there is a better life to lead
You're all undone, emotionless
It's not the way for me
Now I know there's a better way
Let my heart ride out for a brighter day
Now it's time to breathe in the open air
With a mind so free, anyway
It's time for a change...
It's time to break free!
Had enough of fooling, had enough of lies
Hypocrisy, inriguing, right before my eyes
Had enough of hound dogs, barking all the time
I agree with Elvis, you ain't no friend of mine
Apart from this there is a better life I know
You're all undone, emotionless
It's time for me to go
Chorus / Solo: Kai / Both / Kai
Now I know there's a better way
Let my heart fly free towards a better day
Now it's time to breathe, it's the only way,
let my mind ride out, anyway...
Now I know, there's a better way
Let my heart ride out for a better day
Now it's time to breathe in the open air
With a mind so free, anyway
It's time to break free!
It's time to be me, FREE.
