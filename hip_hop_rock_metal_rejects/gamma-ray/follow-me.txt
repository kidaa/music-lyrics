Will you follow me into the light
The fortress of wisdom, a star shining bright
The garden of heavenly sin
A kingdom of beauty to please you within

Where do we go from here
Leaving our memories behind
It's time to free your mind

Hey you!
I'll make your dreams come true
I can take you anywhere
Just call on me and I'll be there

Follow me
And I will guarantee
Your life will never be the same
Hear me callin', won't you follow me

Will you follow me into the fight
You smile as you die when you're close to the light
Your dreams will be lost in the haze
Your innocence dying in so many ways

Where do we go from here
Leaving our dreams far behind
To fight the final fight

Hey you!
I'll make your dreams come true
I can take you anywhere
Just call on me and I'll be there

Follow me
Satisfaction guaranteed
We'll be in perfect harmony
So follow me, follow me

Where do we go from here
Reaching our destiny's end
And nothing will remain

Follow me
To the land of make believe
Close your eyes I will be there
And I can take you anywhere

Sacrifice
At the gates of paradise
It's a world full of illusions
By the masters of confusion, follow me...

Will you still follow me...
