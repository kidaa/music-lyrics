Music / Lyrics: Rubach
Hello my name is Mr. Know-It-All
My sweet home is deep down in your soul
Let me introduce you to the final call
Salvation is calling for you
Life is just a fairytale
Narrated by a lunatic for man
The hope is clouded by eternal haze
Tell me what you mean?
Do you think about ambition?
Why don't you scream? - oh yeah
Don't you realize - what you criticize
Now remove yourself - away from here
Salvation's calling - salvation's calling
The walls are falling - salvation's calling now!
Hey, you think that you blown it all
Your life, you can't enjoy it to the full
Whhen all your dreams are fading
To eternal black
You're lost in the twilight
Now, what d'you mean
What do you think about ambition?
Go out and scream, oh yueah
Realize not criticize
Remove yourself away from here
Remove yourself away from here
Chorus
Follow you instinct
Never follow your illusions
Just remember from all your troubles
There is a way out
Turn around and see yourself
Beyond your horizons
There's an outcry in the void
There is a way out from here
Solo: Both / Kai / Dirk
Goodbye my friend
It's time to leave you on your own
Get going to find out your own way
Believe in what you're doing
Cos I'm in your head
You can't hesitate anymore
Don't think about existance
Just move your ass - be yourself
Now realize - not criticize
Now move yourself - take your chance
Chorus
