Lyrics: Hansen
Do you think there's a chance
For this world to live in unity as one?
I can try to believe
But I feel it's like a view into the sun.
Blinded by the light everything will look so fine
But still I feel the rays are burning my soul.
So you say you believe
We can change the world together if we try.
I know we won't change.
When it comes to the point
Do you think we reach an aim that is too high?
I know we don't arrange.
But I know we're all the same
When the final curtain falls
And the sings on the way
Are leading us home
Chorus:
When I'm one with the world
I am one with my mind
Forget all the fury there's no need to cry
There's a place we all go, salvation to find
There's freedom to come
When I'm one with the world and my mind.
Do you feel, do you know?
There's an answer to the question when you're gone.
You're not alone.
You will see, we will see
Is there nothing or a better place to go?
We can't go wrong.
There are echoes in the wind
And they say don't be afraid
'cos the signs on the way
Are leading us home
Chorus
