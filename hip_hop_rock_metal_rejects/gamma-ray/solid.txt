Leaving the planet, we're coming to burn
Fight for the nation, we know there will be no return
Interstellarian, galactical wars
Now we are feeling we got no...
We got no remorse

Stellarian fighters are ready to strike
She alien vessels are burning tonight

So glorious we'll fly like the eagle in the sky
And I know it's gonna be victory

We're solid - erasing the alien planet
We're solid - erasing the alien planet

The alien tyrants will knock at your door
They come for a reason and they will be coming for more
- yes, they will -
No conversation, agreements to make
Eyes that are gleaming are twisting and sealing your fate
Now it's the time for us all to strike back
All systems prepare for the final attack

So glorious we'll fly like the eagle in the sky
And I know it's gonna be victory

We're solid - erasing the alien planet
We're solid - erasing the alien planet

We're solid
We're solid

So glorious we'll fly like the eagle in the sky
And I know it's gonna be victory

We're solid - erasing the alien planet
We're solid - erasing the alien planet
We're solid
We're solid
