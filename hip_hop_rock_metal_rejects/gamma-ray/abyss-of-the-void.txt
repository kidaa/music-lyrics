Music / Lyrics: Hansen
Now I must go
I'll wait for you to follow
No turning back
But there's a light
I've seen it all
Riding through never fall
When all is done
We must be one
I will return
The saviour is calling
He's riding through the night
The only, the holy
Returning from the light
We fall to the ground and we pray
'Cause he's the only one
No demons left in this world
Since he has won
Oh hear what I say...
All men come
To see the king of the world
The time has come for everyone
The saviour stands for all of us
Now praise the one who'll destroy
The evil abyss of the void
His armour
Still shining
Though it's torn from fight
The brave man, redeemer
He brought us back to life
Oh yes he did
Now fall to the ground and pray
'Cause he will come
No demons left in this world
Since he has won
Now, listen to what I say...
All men come
To see the land of the free
The time has come for everyone
The saviour stands for all of us
Now praise the one who'll destroy
The evil abyss of the void
His armour, still shining
Though it's torn from fight
The brave man, he battled
On through the night
His eyes they were gleaming like fire
And he's prepared he's the one
The young man
He raises his head
Up to the land
In the sun
Wherever my spirit may fly
Up to this heavenly fight
I know
That I will return from a mission
Beyond our skies - now
