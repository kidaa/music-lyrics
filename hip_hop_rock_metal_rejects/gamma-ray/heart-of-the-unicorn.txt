Masters are relentless, torture is for slaves
Money, greed and power drives you to obey
Temperature is rising, shakes me to the core
Blood and domination, victims of the law

When bloody angels spread their wings

We're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead

I see the demons rising, beyond their sleeping void
Deep and down the masters take them to the light
Their piercing rays are blazing, obliterating fast
All dreams are torn to pieces, vaporized at last

When bloody angels spread their wings

We're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead

I scan the dead horizon, illuminated curse
In squished imagination, catastrophies unfurl
Beyond the cataclysm, a dream of Unicorns
The purest heart in heaven, stabbed by poisoned thorns

Bloody angels, searing with fire-turn to dust

All through the millenniums, I've seen the writing on the wall
Into our oblivion, we are the riders on the storm

We're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead

Beware - all dead
No light - all dead
No dreams - all dead
No life - you're dead
