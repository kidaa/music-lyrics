Music / Lyrics: Hansen
One time in life is all I need, to satisfy my senses
Delusions of reality are tearing your defenses
I never tried to catch the rainbow,
But in the end I have a dream...
All of the damned will be wearing the corwn
It's hard to believe as your world's going down
You won't understand why
They served you so well
You won't understand
Why the hopeless are marching through hell
So all you see around you now
Is falling down defenseless
A free life is our only need, for life is only rented
I see a face on my mirror on the wall,
And I don't know what it can be
I see a face inside the rainbow
At the end of the dream,
The face in the rainbow is me
All of the damned will be wearing the crown
It's hard to believe as your world turns around
No, you won't understand why
They served you so well
It's hard to believe
While the hopeless are marching through hell
Solo: Kai/ Both/ Kai
I never thought I catch the rainbow
But in the end it's all a dream
I see a face in my mirror
At the end of the dream
The face in the mirror is me
'Cause all of the damned
Will be wearing the crown
It's hard to forsee
As the world turns around
No, you won't understand why
They served you so well
It's hard to believe
While the hopeless are marching through hell
