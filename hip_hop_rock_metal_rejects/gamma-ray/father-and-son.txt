Music: Schlachter,
Lyrics: Scheepers, Schlachter
Did you ever want to worry
Did you ever wanna have a doubt?
You wanted the best for me,
Somehow things went wrong.
And i tore us apart.
Did you ever think it was easy,
Thought my time was running out
Tried it how I wanted tto
Though you did not agree
But I was calling you - calling repeat
Chorus:
Father, you can't hide, it's time to lose the pride - some day.
Take a look and see, I'm blue as I can be.
In former days you made your own way,
You found on easy way of life.
But I'll be never satisfied to work from nine till five.
I'm heading for more-
I remember what you've said
But I know I won't regret
When I try to break the rules
I'm searching for my way, my own way
Chorus:
Father, you can't hide your feelings deep inside - oh no
There's a better way for you and me today.
I can't stand it anymore - it's only you and me,
We have to talk and see.
How things are gonna be, but all I want is peace
Father, Father, Father -
Chorus:
Father, now it's time, we ain't losin' our minds any more
It seems so long ago, fate will bring us hope!
