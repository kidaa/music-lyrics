Where will I go now it's all over
Where will I be now all is said and done
Here comes the time, prepare for justice
Seems like my final journey has begun

Riding on the wind, there's only one place left to go
Take me to my afterlife, high up or down below

Heaven or Hell - where do we go when we are leaving
Heaven or Hell - whatever comes to set us free
Heaven or Hell - I've gone a long way and I see there's no wishing well
The choice is made, it's heaven or hell

I'm not the one who was expected
So I'll return and be from heaven sent
I'm gonna get myself elected
And now I wanna be the president -  Viva el Presidente 

Master of the damned I'll be the savior of you all
Take me as a holy god to save you from the fall

Heaven or Hell - where is my final destination
Heaven or Hell - whatever comes to set us free
Heaven or Hell - we've gone a long way and we'll see there is no wishing well
The choice is made, it's heaven or hell

Master of the damned, I'll be the savior of you all
I'm your revelation I'm a walking miracle

Heaven or Hell - what is our final destination
Heaven or Hell - where do we go from here
Heaven or Hell - we've gone a long way and we see there is no wishing well
The choice is made, it's heaven or hell

Heaven or hell
It's heaven or hell
There's no wishing well
It's heaven or hell
