Father can you hear me, did you talk to Mother Earth
What did they say, what did they see ,now ... Is it time for your
rebirth ?
Open up the silent center of your mind,
I now want to know the future of your kind
In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods return to fight, for the future in their lives
In the valley of the kings
Mother can you hear me, did you talk to Father Moon
I don't want to leave my brothers in this temple of their doom
Open up the silent center of your mind
I now want to know the future of your kind
In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings
In the valley of the kings
Ra vite, Deus sanktus, Ra vite
Ra vite, revertate, Ra vite
SOLOS : Kai / both / Kai / Henjo
Oh Mother Earth do you believe there is a place for us to go
Come set us free again and let us fly away and give us hope
There'll be a time for us to fly to our thrones up in the sky
In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings
In the valley of the kings
