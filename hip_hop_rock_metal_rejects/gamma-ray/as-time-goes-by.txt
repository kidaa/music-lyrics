Music & lyrics: Hansen, Sielck
Do you believe in justice
Or so-called co-existence?
What's wrong with politicians?
They give their best for you
The economic's growin'
Some tiny holes above
A little radiation
Wake up this planet fades
Bridge:
You are not watching, you're part of the show
You lost the first prize a long time ago.
Prechours:
WAR - somebody's always starts again
HATE - we're getting closer to the end
Chorus:
As time goes by
We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free
As time goes by.
Do you believe in money?
Do you believe in guns?
Do you trust the press, babe?
You'd better judge yourself.
Bridge - prechorus - chorus
The missiles are launching, the tanks are rollin'
The guns are blazing, the sky turns black!
Prechorus
Chorus:
As time goes by
We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free
As time goes by
We're getting closer to the end of our ability
As time goes by
Is there a place to run for shelter in a high tech war
As time goes by
Can you believe and trust in God
To help you from above.
