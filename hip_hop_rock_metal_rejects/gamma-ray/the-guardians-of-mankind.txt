For no one to see, for no one to hear
They fight for our souls without any fear
When injustice is done they open their gates
To maintain balance between good and bad
And as the winds of freedom blows they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate
CHORUS
The guardians of Mankind are losin' their faith
'Cause malice and falseness spread over the human race
If guardians of Mankind won't shelter our souls
The rulers of darkness will soon gain control
Don't try to deceive, don't try to play false
'Cause losin' their favour will be the end of all
And as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate
CHORUS
SOLO: Henjo / both / Henjo / both
And as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate
The guardians of Mankind are losin' their faith
'Cause malice and falseness spread over the human race
Guardians of Mankind are losin' their faith
'Cause malice and falseness spread over the human race
If guardians of Mankind won't shelter our souls
The rulers of darkness will soon gain control
