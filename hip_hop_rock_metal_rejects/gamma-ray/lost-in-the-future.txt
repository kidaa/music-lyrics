Music: Schlchter / Lyrics: Hansen
Atomic fallout scans the sky
 Another place where people die
 And with a massive final punch
  We left a world of pain
  And now pollutions everywhere
Another death is in the air
A million people left alone
  Down in their desperate, blackened homes
Tomorrow there'll be no sun
 Hanging high up in the sky
 Tomorrow all dead and gone
And I wish that I could fly
  We are lost, in the future, we are lost
In a dream we can't control
No way
So tell me now computer god
 We plug our lives into machines
And as they're guiding our dreams
  We're individually lost
  As we are nailed to our cross
 Tomorrow there'll be a sun
 Hanging high up in the sky
 Tomorrow I'm dead and gone
 Oh I wish that I could fly
  We are lost, in the future, we are lost
  It's a nightmare, we are lost
 In the future, we are lost
 In a dream we'll never see
 Solo: Both/Henjo/Kai/Both
  Our hearts live forever
  In dreams are alive
 Forever and ever
 We're riding the sky
Solo: Henjo
 All hope is lost, but nothing gained
  We're crying again
 Is this the end?
Lost, in the future, we are lost
  It's a nightmare, we are lost
 In the future, we are lost
In a dream we can't control
  We're lost, so lost
  We're lost, so lost
 We all are lost!
