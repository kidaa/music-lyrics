Music/Lyrics: Hansen
Time has passed in the modern world
Where the madmen live and speak their word.
Life in hand they deal with god.
Put a trademark sign up on everyone.
God bless the children, freedom is their word.
Freedom freedom 'til they learn to obey.
Don't fear the liars, reason is their name.
Reason, reason, play a silly game.
Where will the children go tomorrow?
Is anybody there to claim
That he understands our human game?
We can make a prophecy,
Oh we can't say what is going to be.
Where are we going, and what is our aim?
Freedom, freedom, locked inside our brains
So many answers, reason is their name,
Reason, reasonm, the question will remain,
Where will the children go tomorrow?
Hey you, where do you go? --- Heading for tomorrow
Hey you, where do you go? --- Heading for tomorrow
Hey you, where do you go? --- Heading for tomorrow
Hey you, where do you go!
When we are born, tell me what is our aim?
And what will be when society fails?
we are heading for tomorrow, we don't know if we are near.
When we are gone, tell me what will remain?
And what will be when society fails?
We are heading for tomorrow but we don't know if we're near.
