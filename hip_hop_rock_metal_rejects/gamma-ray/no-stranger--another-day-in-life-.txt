I see a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why I'm so down and so lonely
No one will understand why
There's a voice in my head and I know it's the only
I see the children play, with fire in their eyes
And when the day begins
..Another day in life
CHORUS
I'm standing tall 'cause I won't fall
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
I see horizons in my sky
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
Days full of joy
Are divin' down the pain
Into the sun, a mother's son
Is just about to fly
I see the morning come, with fire in my eyes
And when the day begins
..Another day in life
CHORUS
SOLO: Kai / both
I see the morning come, with fire in the sky
And now the day begins
..another day in life
I'm standing tall 'cause I won't fall
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
I see horizons in my sky
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
No,no, I'm no stranger to myself
