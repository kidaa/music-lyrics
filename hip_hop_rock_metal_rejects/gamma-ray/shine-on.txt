Music: Schlchter / Lyrics: Hansen
 We drive, we drive, were riding on through the universe
Weve come to reach our destination planet earth
  We come, we run, you cannot see us, flying in our
 spaceships, shooting cross the sky
  We explore and we all know what this is about
 for us all
 So many light years we have travelled far from home
  Someday well be there I know
 Shine on, Rising star
We travelled such a long way
 But still you seem so far
 Shine on, Rising star
for our belief in unity at heart
Rising Star
Come on and shine
 Living was torture and dying release
A declining world, no future, no hope
We were passing the point of no return
 So many light years, still we travel on and on
And someday we will call you home
 Shine on, Rising Star
 Diamond in the distance, still you seem so far
 Shine on, Rising Star
  Forever light the darkness in our hearts
  Rising Star, Rising Star
 Salvation, Damnation
We crawl across the sky with pain
  Forever we will fly
  Out in the darkness
Theres a never ending light
 Solo: Both
 Still we are far away
 But well be there one day
  Someday we will call you home
 Shine on, Rising Star
We travelled such a long way
 but still you seem so far
 Shine on, Rising Star
 Forever light the darkness
  in our hearts
  Rising Star, Rising Star
 Shadows in the darkness, so far away from home
 Standing all alone, noone there beside me
 Shadows all around, so far away from home
  I know Im not alone, it seems were lost in space and time
  Shine on
Shine on now, and warm the tears
  weve shed through years
  Its our prison, final reason for the freedom
 and the glory that we feel
  Are you for real ?
 Shine on, Rising Star
  Diamond in the distance
 Still you seem so far
 Shine on, Rising Star
 Forever light the darkness
  in our hearts
  Rising Star, Rising Star
 Shine on, Rising Star
  Come on and shine for us
Shine on, Shine forever more
Shine on, Our survival
  Rising Star, the last chance for us all
 The only hope for future and a home
 For us all
 For us all
 Come on and shine, Rising Star
