I was lost, had no reason
I was blind, saw no treason
I was devastated, couldn't take no more
Man infuriated, raging thunderstorm

Where's it gone, the golden future
Where's it now, the dream come true
All we are, eternal sinners
Hiding in their darkened room

And I hear the cry of an eagle
Out in the heavens he will not obey
I hear the cry of an eagle
Riding on wings of tomorrow
that take me away

I was scared, for a lifetime
I've been had, nuclear crime
Is this never ending, grand catastrophy
Here I am ascending, from this misery

Where's it now, your golden future
Where's it gone, your dream come true
All I see, immortal sinners
Rising fear, I'm leaving you

And I hear the cry of an eagle
Out in the heavens he will not obey
I'm riding the sky like an eagle
Follow the sunrise on wings that will take me away

Faster, faster to the light, in this world too many fights
Devastation, termination, leave the world for recreation

Out in my dreamworld there's a better place to be
Cause all this world is full of lies
Breaking chains that hold me down I fly up to the sun
Another place, another life

I'm riding the sky like an eagle
Out in the heavens I will not obey
I'm riding the sky like an eagle
Follow the sunrise on wings that will take me away
Away...
