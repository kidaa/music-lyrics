I'm trapped in a castle of illusions out in space
No more illusions
Out on a journey on a mission for the human race
Terrified I had to realize that I've been talking to the gods of fire
I got nowhere to stand, 'cause I'm a running man to get away
All that I see is the years...somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
Tomorrow, I'll see it, another day's rise, right before my eyes
Been sinking in sorrow, but now I'm gonna rise
No more reasons why
I'm a watcher in the dark, I'm so cold inside my heart
I'm a temple in the storm and I'm bound to be reborn
Take me down to the underground, let me see the gods of fire
'Cause I know where they live and I know where they stand,
Another reason there to leave
Take me down, take me down, take me to the underground
I wanna meet the gods of fire
And all of their intentions is the center of it all
All that I see is the years...somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
Now that I know I've got to get away...somewhere out in space
I wanna know how to get away
Time for deliverance is now
And as the sun appeared up in the sky
I saw another day that's drifting by
I saw my people cry a million tears
Into eternity they disappeared
SOLO: Kai / both / both left & right / Kai / both
Now it's time to say goodbye or we will sink in sorrow
No, we don't know the reason why, another day, tomorrow
Oh, I thank you for giving me hope
Oh, follow me into a new life
All that I see is the years
Now all that I see is the tears
All that I see is the years...somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
Now all that I see is the fear...somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
I wanna know how to get away - time for deliverance
I wanna know how to get away - time for deliverance
Come set me free, just set me free - time for deliverance
Just let me go
I wanna get away, get away
Somewhere out in space
