On the edge of the rainbow
Where eagles learn to fly
All of our dreams, they seemed so clear
Into the morning
Into the light of dawn
We're flying higher than before

And when I see the light
that's shining from your eyes
Even brighter than before
We're riding the wind
to reach the golden dawn
We have done it all before

Here I stand
Call on you again
But my heart is filled with fear
Like an eternal flame
Our love will remain
As we sail the lake of tears

Sometimes I wonder
You're so close but you're so far
Seems life will never be the same
Sigh for the morning
To find the light of day
Dream of fortune fades away

Here I stand
Call on you again
But my heart is filled with fear
Like an eternal flame
Our love will remain
As we sail the lake of tears

Here I stand
Call on you again
But my heart is filled with fear
Like an eternal flame
Our love will remain
As we sail the lake...
Here I stand
Call on you again
But my heart is filled with fear
All the tears that I've cried
For the love of my life
As I sailed the lake of tears
Like an eternal flame
Our love will remain
As we sail the lake of tears
