Was my change night?
I don't give up the fight
I can not believe
That you're gone, that you're lost
Seems like you are slill around me
My tears are burning
There is no bang deep inside your heart,
Now...forever gone
And I feel so alone
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Someone to believe in you
I saw you falling
And I saw you drowning
Down in your despair
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
I'm the one believing you
Anytime you need me
My private passion play
I died a little today
My private passion play
It wasn't me, it wasn't you, you need
Someone to believe in you
Was my change right
Oh I, I don't give up thie fight
Believing you
My private passion pay
I died a little today
My private passion play
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Someone to believe in you
Stop searching for the Iie of your live
Throw the needle away
You know it ain't too late
In the middle of the run
In the middle of the run
I saw you lying down on the floor
With all the age in your veins
Don't push your life away
In the middle of the run
In the middle of the run
Was my change right?
