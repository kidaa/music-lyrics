Tears on your pillow
A scream flies through the night
And tries to find the way out of the game
And won't return
Tears for the moonchild
On and on
Sunset covers everything in silence
Can't you see that all the
Seven angels raise their trumpets
And blare out in the night
Tears for the misery
Holding on
Your thousand lies will tear you in the darkness
Can't you see that all the
Seven angels raise their trumpets
And blare out in the night
Plagues poor down to prosecute
Your kingdom's cometh will be done
Heal all the world you sinner
Heal all the world you liar
You got to move, you got to pray,
Messiah
You got to change, no time to waste
Judas
Plagues poor down to prosecute
Plagues poor down to damn your roots
Tooth for tooth, eye for eye, you have to stay
One for all and all for me, obey
Heal all the world you sinner
Heal all the world you liar
Tears for the blinded eyes
Too blind to see
That all the good-ones die by seeded anger
In empty hearts
Pray for his mercy
Too late to stay
The fallen angel leads you into blackness
Can't you see that all the
Seven angels raise their trumpets
And blare out in the night
Take a look at the sky just before you die
Now you will pay the price for your wasted live
Plagues poor down to prosecute
Plagues poor down to damn your roots
Touch the flame of the fire and hope to die
Feel the heat of the glow and burn your soul
Heal all the world you sinner
Heal all the world you liar
You got to move, you got to pray,
Messiah
You got to change, now it's too late, goodbye
Heal all the world you sinner
Heal all the world you liar
You got to move, you got to pray,
Messiah
You got to change, now it's too late, goodbye
Heal all the world.
Heal all the world.
I wanna change it, you've got my live back
Send me back again
I wanna change it, 'cause I have the faith
I wanna change it, 'cause I have the faith
