Alert
Remember
Burn the flag, the flag, the flag
Hypnotized
Control spiritual riots
Get the hag, the flag, the flag
Sacrilege
Obey your mental leader
Kill your idols now
Find another way to hang on without
And you take another breath
And then you blow it all out
Get the banner down
ALERT, ALERT, ALERT, ALERT
Break the chains, the chains, the chains
Obsequies
You fight the regime's terror
You fight the fiame, the flame, the flame
Ritualised
You'll never get the badge off
Kill your idols now
ALERT, ALERT, ALERT, ALEF.T
You move like a machine
You're to dwell
You man without a mission
Hear the lie, the lie, the lie
Of the bomb
You lead it by a whistle
Kill your idols now...
