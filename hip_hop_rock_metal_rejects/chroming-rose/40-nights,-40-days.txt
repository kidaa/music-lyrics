Bow down, look at me
Have mercy upon me
Hallowed be thy name
These walls I have to climb
These wars have to fight
Don't lead into temptation
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
I step around, for you and me
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
I can't move and I can't hide
I feel the pain deep inside
All these visions of a past life
Take all my pride away
Purify my soul today
And deliver me from evil
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
I slep around, for you and me
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
Lead me to your paradise
Forever and all eternity
I'm just a man, a simple man
I'm trespassing on my way
Back home to your wisdom
I won't struggle in despair
I don't look back, don't run away
Is there anybody out there?
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
I step around, for you and me
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
Heal my wounds, heal my pain
Lead me on your way to paradise
40 NIGHTS, 40 DAYS
The day will come
When I close my eyes
Forever and all eternity
