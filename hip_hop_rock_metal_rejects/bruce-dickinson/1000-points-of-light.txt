You can sail in the desert with a ship of fools
You can smuggle in Moses and his book of rules 
But you can't take mother and give her back her son
Hey what kind of freedom is bought with a gun...CHORUS:
People like to build their own prison walls
When they're afraid to look inside 
A thousand points of light
are the muzzle flashes in the night
And the freedoms you profess to hold 
Won't bring the dead back from the cold...

Political speeches they are lying in the mud
Nothing else matters but money and blood
Tyranny of freedom is do what you like
There's a world gone crazy, cause it can't say no.

[Sample of George Bush:]
"What is it that produces the light?
 What is it that makes these thousand points of light shine?
 What is it that will make America a kinder and gentler nation?
 Perhaps I should ask who, who is it?"

SOLO

There should be time for love
But there's too much room for hate
Too much sliding of the truth
Too much abuse of wasted youth

There should be time for love
and a time for living to
Had enough of media lies
Had enough of your alibis

REPEAT CHORUS
