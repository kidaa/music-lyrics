When I was younger I thought 
that to kill, or be killed was a thing 
to be proud of 
Victim of change, prisoner of hope, 
hanged by the neck on the end of a rope 
I don't know... 
I don't care... 

Oh, one of the damned 
Oh, part of the plan 

Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more 
Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more 

Now taking both sides at a time, on the front line 
You can join in the fear 
Share in the bloodshed 
Investing your money in guns, the infinite fun 
of the warlord you saved 
From the rusty grave 

Oh, one of the damned 
Oh, part of the plan 

Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more 
Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more 

Oh, one of the damned 
Oh, part of the plan 

Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more 
Cry oh, oh, oh, the gods of war 
They howl and cry for more
