I've been down at the crazy house
I've been playing with the cat and the mouse
I've been down, I've been down
I've seen the crazy people running around

Shoot all the clowns
Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down

Welcome to the circus where I fool around
I got the killer smile, I'm a killer clown
Cover up your face, you've been found out
You laugh when there's nothing to smile about

Shoot all the clowns
Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down 

CHORUS:
Shoot, shoot, shoot all the clowns x2

Wanna gimme money, well you better get ready
I'm a certified friend of John Paul Getty
I'm a fat stargazer, I'm an all night raver
I'm an anything you wannabe, If I can get your sympathy

Welcome to the circus, I'm a killer clown
Welcome to the circus, Hey gather round

Two sides to life, two sides to fun
The one who does it and the one who gets done

Shoot all the clowns
Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down, Shoot 'em down 

REPEAT CHORUS
