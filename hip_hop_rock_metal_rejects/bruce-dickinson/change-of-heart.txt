Here I sit, alone at a window 
The rain falls down 
On the class in the cold 

All my life, I've been waiting for a moment 
It never came, maybe never will 
Ah, sometimes I don't know 

Those days are gone 
Lord I hide where I just can't say 
I'm still there, catching your tears 
As they fall to the ground 

You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 
You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 

Trees are bare, the earth it is hard 
I wait for winter, soft winter and snow 

Those days are gone 
Now I hide where I just can't say 
I'll be there, catching your tears 
Before they fall to the ground 

You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 
You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 

And I know, wherever you go 
I'll be around, yeah 
I'll be there, catching your tears 
Before they fall to the ground, yeah 

Those days are gone 
Now I hide where I just can't say 
I'm still there, watching your tears 
As they fall to the ground 

You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 
You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 

You, you're walking away 
You couldn't stay 
You need a change of heart 
Oh, oh child. 
You need a change of heart 
Change of heart 
Change of heart
