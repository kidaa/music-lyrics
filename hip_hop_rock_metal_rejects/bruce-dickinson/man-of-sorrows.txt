Here, in a church, a small boy is kneeling
He prays to a God he does not know, he cannot feel
All of his sins of childhood he will remember
He will not cry, tears he will not cry

Man of sorrows, I wont see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about? 
Is your journey over - has it just begun? 

Vision of a new world from the ashes of the old
do what thou wilt!, he screams from his cursed soul
A tortured seer, a prophet of our emptiness
Wondering why, wondering why...

Man of sorrows, I wont see your face
I wont see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about? 
Is your journey over - has it just begun? 

A man of sorrows, racked
With thoughts that dare not speak their name
Trapped inside a body, made to feel only guilt and shame
His anger all his life - i hate myself!, he cried
do what thou wilt!
do what thou wilt!, he cried

Man of sorrows, I wont see your face
I wont see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about? 
Is your journey over - has it just begun? 

Man of sorrows, I wont see your face
I wont see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about? 
Is your journey over - has it just begun? 
Has it just begun?
