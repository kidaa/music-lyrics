There's a secret that we all share 
In the darkest hours of the night 
You can swear on the bible... 
Cut the throat of your rival 

Oh, oh, 
I've been taking my life in my hand 
And I'm making new plans, yeah... 
Now I'm starting my life on my own 
In the virgin unknown... 


Hell...Hell no... 
Oh were do we belong? 
In this place, where we fight, 
Oh were do we belong? 


There's a place in the misty air 
Not a million miles from here 
You can make it your own place 
You can change your own face 

Oh, oh, 
I've been taking my life in my hand 
And I'm making new plans, yeah... 
Now I'm starting my life on my own 
In the virgin unknown... 


Hell...Hell no... 
Oh were do we belong? 
In this place, where we fight, 
Oh were do we belong? 


Hell...Hell no... 
Oh were do we belong? 
In this place, where we fight, 
Oh were do we belong? 


If you can't really say what you don't really know, 
then you don't really know what you can't really say 
If you can't really say what you don't really know, 
then you don't really know what you can't really say 
If you can't really say what you don't really know, 
then you don't really know what you can't really say 
If you can't really say what you don't really know, 
then you don't really know what you can't really say 


Screaming out hell no 
Shouting out hell no 
On his knees shouting hell no 
Defiant as hell no 
On the street singing hell no 
On his knees hell no 
Still shouting out hell no 
Screaming Hell no, hell no, one, two, three, four 


Hell...Hell no... 
Oh were do we belong? 
In this place, where we fight, 
Oh were do we belong? 

Hell...Hell no... 
Oh were do we belong? 
In this place, where we fight, 
Oh were do we belong?
