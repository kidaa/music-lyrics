There's a sinister game that children play 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
When they get to the end of each schoolday 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 

They spend their lives getting ready for the kill...Ha! 

Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back 
Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back 

Who remembers the names of fallen heroes 
Hey, hey, Hey, hey 
Who remembers today to fly their flags 
Hey, hey, Hey, hey 

I couldn't say I loved you like I did before...Ha! 

Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back 
Laughing in the hiding bush 

It's the laughing attack 
The joker is back 
He's wild in the pack 
The joker is back 
Laughing in the hiding gonna kick him in the bush, yeah 

Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back 
Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back 

Laughing in the hiding bush 
He's wild in the pack 
Laughing in the hiding bush 
The joker is back
