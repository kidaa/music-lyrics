Always let you down 
Always fooled around 
Always stealing your own way 

Life just seems too short 
Life lived in the dirt 
Kicked in the teeth 
Is what you meant to say 

Fighting battles, never fired a shot 

When you step into the fire 
You're gonna get burned 
Hide all the money you saved 
Money won't pay 
For the trouble you caused 
Troubles coming back for more 

Living on the edge 
A blind man kneels on broken glass 
Building the bars of his own case 

Running circles till you drop 
Hating life until it stops 
Kicked in the teeth 
Is what you meant to say 

Fighting battles, never fired a shot 

When you step into the fire 
You're gonna get burned 
Hide all the money you saved 
Money won't pay 
For the trouble you caused 
Troubles coming back for more 

When you step into the fire 
You're gonna get burned 
Hide all the money you saved 
Money won't pay 
For the trouble you caused 
Troubles coming back for...more
