We all have secret lives 
In our secret rooms, 
Living in our movies, 
humming our own tunes 

Living life in camera, 
When the night is closing down, 
Sliding into darkness, 
You could be like me 

Where are you going? 
What are you doing? 
Why are you looking at the cameras eye? 
Where are you staying? 
Why are you leaving? 
We watch you breathing through the cameras eye 

We all make-up our faces 
The make-up of the clown, 
Happy leaving traces, 
Of our childish background, 

Pointing at the sky, 
We can watch the stars 
You think you're all alone, 
But you never are... 

Where are you going? 
What are you doing? 
Why are you looking at the cameras eye? 
Where are you staying? 
Why are you leaving? 
We watch you breathing through the cameras eye 

They ain't watching you, they ain't watching you now 
They ain't watching you, they ain't watching you now 

They ain't watching you, they ain't watching you now 
They ain't watching you, they ain't watching you now 

Where are you going? 
What are you doing? 
Why are you looking at the cameras eye? 
Political sleazes, 
Sexual divas, 
We watch your heart beating through the cameras eye 

Where are you going? 
What are you doing? 
Why are you looking at the cameras eye? 
Political sleazes, 
Sexual divas, 
We watch your heart beating through the cameras eye
