Stand at the ocean and hold out your hands history's callin' your name
questions of ages are at your command for answers is why you came
And now your searching for clues of a civilization
buried in time victim of early demise
The City is lost we search for Atlantis whatever the cost
The City is lost child of the sea for eternity tossed The City is lost
Erotic creatures and people of science fertile abundant plain
circular islands mountainous shadows exploding in fiery rain
And now your searching for clues of a civilization
buried in time victim of early demise
The City is lost we search for Atlantis whatever the cost
The City is lost child of the sea for eternity tossed The City is lost
Survivors escaping disaster sailing to far away lands
brought knowledge of pyramids, physics and flight
the proof is beneath ancient sand
And now your searching for clues of a civilization
buried in time victim of early demise
The City is lost we search for Atlantis whatever the cost
The City is lost child of the sea for eternity tossed The City is lost
