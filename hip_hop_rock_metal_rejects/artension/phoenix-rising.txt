Awake but you're asleep you're drawn into the light
you know it's clear this time, the greates fear's within your mind
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see I see a phoenix rising
Does the dark appeal to you, in everything you say and do
you should learn the reason why
I know your tears can't hide you as you walk among the night
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see
I see a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the fire
Phoenix risin' soarin' ever higher
Madness never sleeps, withdrawn into your mind
sometimes life is unkind us you drift between the lines
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see
I see a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the fire
Phoenix risin' soarin' ever higher
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see
I see a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the fire
Phoenix risin' soarin' ever higher
