Packed their bags and left that day one way ticket to outer space
mohtership has sailed away blinded by the comets fall
Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue
Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
no one told them it all was a lie he said take my hand and together we'll fly
senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate
Coins of silver for toils to pay, made the potion and drank their lives away
mothership did not come through, blinded by the comet Hale
Don't be fooled by men who say"my new religion is the only way"
mother's love is there for you put your faith in what is real
Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue
Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
no one told them it all was a lie he said take my hand and together we'll fly
senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate
Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue
Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
no one told them it all was a lie he said take my hand and together we'll fly
senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate
