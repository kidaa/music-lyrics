Pleasure is pain, in my arms once again
knowing that you can never be mine
divided by mountains of circumstance
no other way on earth our love stood a chance
I never knew how hard life could be
without you forever beside me
I was so blind, but now I can see
it was never meant to be
Your love is forbidden love
your sweet love is forbidden love
Poisonous flower fruit of the vine
the heart of your heartbeat closer to mine
divided by seasons barely alive
there's no way this love could ever survive
I never knew how hard life could be
without you forever beside me
I was so blind, but now I can see
it was never meant to be
Your love is forbidden love
your sweet love is forbidden love
I never knew how hard life could be
without you forever beside me
I was so blind, but now I can see
it was never meant to be
Your love is forbidden love
your sweet love is forbidden love
