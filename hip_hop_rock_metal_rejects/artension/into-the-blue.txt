Born on the wings of a dream into the morning they fly
there's no place that they'd rather be above the clouds so high
Light years are days the bravest of hearts lead the way
while loved ones on earth are praying"Come back to me"
So far from home exploring dimensions unknown
questions of man the answers are at your command
Light years away the Final frontier, outer space?
Are we alone or is this our destiny?
Into the blue our future, it rides beside you we look to the sky
and stare at our fate eye to eye into the blue our future is riding with you
we look to the sky staring fate in the eye into the blue
Born on the wings of a dream into the morning they fly
there's no place that they'd rather be above the clouds so high
Light years are days the bravest of hearts lead the way
while loved ones on earth are praying"Come back to me"
Into the blue our future, it rides beside you we look to the sky
and stare at our fate eye to eye into the blue our future is riding with you
we look to the sky staring fate in the eye into the blue
