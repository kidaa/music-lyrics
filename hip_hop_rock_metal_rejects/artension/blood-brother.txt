Lost inside emotion, searching for myself
came across a memory of me as someone else
Didn't recognize me, Didn't know what to do
in another lifetime I could have been you
Blood Brother, look into the rising sun
Blood Brother, two lives become as one
Distant generations I smoke to peace with you
regression to a past time and place we both knew
Didn't recognize me, Didn't know what to do
in another lifetime I could have been you
Blood Brother, look into the rising sun
Blood Brother, two lives become as one
Blood Brother, look into the rising sun
Blood Brother, two lives become as one
