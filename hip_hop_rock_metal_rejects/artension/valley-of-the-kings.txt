Desert sand, Modern man searching for answers to the mysteries
far away night become day unlock the secrets of their lives
And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
after all this time, oh victim of the crime
they fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is done
Forever sleep their souls to keep entombed in dark shadows for all time
shifting sand the hands of man disturbing the peace of sacred land
And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
They left a curse for you nothing you can do
they fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is done
They fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is done
