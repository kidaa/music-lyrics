There's no way you can see it
I'm acting like everything's cool
But, hell, I'm about to burst
Got two delicate options
Either I zip of the venom
Or else I will die of thirst
Down, going down to my inner revolution
Revolution inside
Got a nice little conflict
A riot inside my head
I'm at war with myself all alone
My eyes tell you nothing
But I'm closing in on myself
And it scares me to the bone
Down, going down to my inner revolution
Revolution inside
