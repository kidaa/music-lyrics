This guy Michael, he's a real good friend of mine
We've known each other a small eternity by now
He dresses sharp, smokes cigars and drinks good wine
An regular guy who won't make you raise an eyebrow
But, hey now, hey now, hey, now
Michael has a symptom
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Michael and the syndrome
Michael's also a splendid photographer
But don't be fooled by this... should I say normality
When you least expect it the most bizarre things might occur
His brain is stuffed with endless weird ingenuity
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Michael has a symptom
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Michael and the syndrome
The wrong word at the wrong time to the wrong person
Cracked up a million times for this uncensored, verbal outlet
He simply doesn't care as long as he is having fun
Could Michael suffer from the syndrome called Tourette?
