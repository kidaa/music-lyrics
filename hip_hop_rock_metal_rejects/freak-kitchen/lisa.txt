Wonder what you're doin'
Wonder how you're doin'
Wonder what you're sayin'
I wonder what you're thinking
I wish you were here
How did we get here?
I am lonely prayin'
Where have you been?
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows
'Cos the trees won't talk
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows...
I can't let you go
Still you have to go
Who do you let in?
I wonder what you're thinkin'
Now what have I done wrong?
You're the one who's wrong!
Does he touch your skin?
Is he better than me?
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows
'Cos the trees won't talk
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows...
We must be together
You and I together
Sweet insomnia
I see it all so clear
Now you'll sleep forever
Now you're mine forever...
