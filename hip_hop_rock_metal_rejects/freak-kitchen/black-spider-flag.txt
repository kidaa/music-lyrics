Nice place to live?
I am not so sure...
A nation of denial
Scared and insecure
That rotten smell
Of ignorance
See the little people
Dance the swastika dance
Edelweiss, oh edelweiss
What's happening?
The black spider flag waves again
Edelweiss, oh edelweiss
What's happening?
The black spider flag raves again
You have learned real well
To indoctrinate
Puppet Neanderthals
Raised on hate
Let's climb the Alps
Of conservatism
See the little people
Propose a toast to racism
Edelweiss, oh edelweiss
What's happening?
The black spider flag waves again
Edelweiss, oh edelweiss
What's happening?
The black spider flag raves again
