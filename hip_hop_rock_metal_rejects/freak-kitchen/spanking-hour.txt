Sanity takes a vacation
You're on your own from now on
Exploring the cracks inside you
Primitive mind...
One step towards separation
One step towards confrontation
Exploring the cracks inside you
Primitive mind...
I'll stun your resistance
I'll drown you in lies
Your waiting is over
Tear it, tear it, agonize
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking's on your mind
I'll stun your resistance
I'll drown you in lies
Sweet tender hatred
Rip it, rip it, agonize
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking's on your mind
