That junkie logic is bound to fail
We`ve heard it al before
You defend yourself with tooth and nail
But never fight the downward spiral war
Here we go again
When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There`s no way a starving sole like yours would last
Heroin Breakfast
Every time you`re getting back on track
And at leest feel semi-well
You take a collarfull litle something
With side-effects from hell
Hell!
Here we go again
When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There`s no way a starving sole like yours would last

Here we go again, here we go
Here we go again
When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past - here we go again
There`s no way a starving sole like yours would last

When everything is said and everything is done
