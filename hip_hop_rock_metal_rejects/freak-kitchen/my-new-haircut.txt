Another beautiful shitty day
I wanna throw my life away
I wish the sun would stop to shine
But it seems the son of a bitch is here to stay
Won't you spare me your ugly smile
And let me be miserable for a while
Damn I wasn't born in Liverpool
Don't you just love my depressing style?
I am so proud of my haircut
I am so proud of what I've become
I really like my new haircut
I am so proud of what I've become
Another hotel room to wreck
Another million dollar check
Another article about The Beatles clones
Gonna break that reporter's neck
Another person to insult
Another gig ends in tumult
Then disappear on a holiday to India
And start a psychedelic cult
I am so proud of my haircut
I am so proud of what I've become
I really like my new haircut
I am so proud of what I've become
