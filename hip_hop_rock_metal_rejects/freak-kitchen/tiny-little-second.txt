65 long years
A day from his pension
One lousy day
He took his usual route
When two crackheads went paranoid
And blew him all away
Tiny little second
So tiny, but it'll change your life forever
Tiny little second
So tiny, but it'll change your life forever
She studies bio chemistry
And works part-time
In a local bar
She spilled a beer in someone's lap
And got raped behind the counter
While some white trash stole her car
Tiny little second
So tiny, but it'll change your life forever
Tiny little second
So tiny, but it'll change your life forever
