Waking up in pieces
On Monday noon
I'm a burdon to myself
Gonna to crack real soon
My armour, my shield
The food for my greed
I thought I knew when it was time to quit
But only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy
Thought I made mistakes
That I had a full view
If you had your doubts
I'd beat the hell out of you
Your cheering smiles
Were hatred in disguise
You didn't dare to pay the price
But it was only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy
