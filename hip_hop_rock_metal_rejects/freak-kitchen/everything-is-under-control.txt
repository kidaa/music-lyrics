Try to piece it all together
Try to make it all make sense
Strange, my fingers seem electric
Everything is under control...
My teeth are falling out here
My lips glow in the dark
Strange, or is it paranoia?
Everything is under control...
There's something wrong with your car
There's something wrong with my head
Maybe we took this too far
Maybe we're already dead
There's something wrong with this place
There's something wrong with this bed
Don't recognize your face
Maybe we're already dead
I can't remember nothing
I can't remember who I am
Strange, the mean hallucinations
Everything is under control...
There's something wrong with your car
There's something wrong with my head
Maybe we took this too far
Maybe we're already dead
There's something wrong with this place
There's something wrong with this bed
Don't recognize your face
Maybe we're already dead
Everything is under control...
