I've walked around in circles far too long, but I know
That if I never told you I was wrong, you would go
And take my baby girl away from me for good
Still, this inflamed situation only gets worse when you say no...
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
Don't understand the accusations that I read, not a word
Don't know what's going on inside your head, it's absurd
But I ain't gonna let you do a single thing you threatened to
The fact that I'm the father to our child has not occurred to you?
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
Seven Days in June is all I want
I will never let you down
I promise I will never let you down...
