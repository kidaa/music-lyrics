I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I'm a pill, I'm a powder
I'm a needle in your vain
I flush your shitty life down the drain
I am God in your asshole
I'm gonna save the nation
I am chemical salvation
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I'm a trigger happy finger
I am the stain of your brain
And I spit your pathetic life down the drain
I am a slit throat
I am a stab in your gut
And I don't discriminate who I cut
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
It sure amazes me
The dumbness of humanity
I take one good, mad piss
At the walls of insanity
Call me fear, call me hatred
Call me intolerance
Call me monsieur ignorance
Call me what the hell you will
'Cos I am here to stay
As long as your head is full of clay
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
