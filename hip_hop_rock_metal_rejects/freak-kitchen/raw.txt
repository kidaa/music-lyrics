Six AM, just woke up drunk
There's a woman by my side
Who is she and where am I ?
And why are my hands tied ?
Well, I don't even care, I don't even care
As long as I had fun
Now I'm pissing alcohol
And my brain's well-done
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw
I like it
Raw
I want it
Raw
She said Let's go for breakfast-hunting
So we went for a ride
Sunday morning, the stores were closed
But she was open wide
She said Do you wanna play, do you wanna play?
I couldn't find reason good enough to say no
Before I knew, I was lying there
And some parts began to grow
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw
I like it
Raw
I want it
Raw
I tried everything from crack to psychoanalysis
Even tried to shoot myself, but I always somehow missed
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw
