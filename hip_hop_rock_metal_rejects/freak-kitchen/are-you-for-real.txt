Hey, I like the colour of your skin
Hey, I like the teeth you're wearin'
You look so good in those mellow lips
And those remade hips
Hey, I see you've got a brand new nose
And the silicone that you expose
Goes so well with your extended hair
And the eyebrows you wear
Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ?
Hey, I like the words your mouth can say
And the attitude you got today
Gee, the way you've learned to move
You're much improved
Hey, I see you got new fingernails
Great looks, never fails
You're almost sincere when you start to squeal
Miss sex appeal
Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ?
What's the smell ? There's something dead in here
Something rotten that won't disappear
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to be unkind
But it's your MIND
Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ?
