Got the will of a jellyfish
I merely float around
My state of mind, my mental health
Is everything but sound
Never asleep, never awake
Living in a haze
Used to be downright concerned
This brain has seen better days
Don't give a damn 'bout anything
Rape, murder, child abuse or ethnic cleansing
Do you remember me?
This wasn't supposed to be...
Focus on the most trivial things
Stuck in the daily grind
The urban life is killing me
Where can I buy some peace of mind?
Don't give a damn 'bout anything
Rape, murder, child abuse or ethnic cleansing
Do you remember me?
This wasn't supposed to be...
Slap me in the face 'til I wake up
Slap me in the face 'til I wake up
I suffer from an o.d of indifference
So slap me in the face 'til I wake up
