Fill my empty soul
Take away the pain
or
Suck out the last drop
And drown it in the rain
I can not feel the way you feel
I can not love the way you love
And you call me twisted...
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
I lost the point somewhere, somehow
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
Rape my common sense
Feed me my tomorrow
or
Smoke my agony
And get high on my sorrow
I can not feel the way you feel
I can not love the way you love
And you call me twisted...
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
I lost the point somewhere, somehow
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
