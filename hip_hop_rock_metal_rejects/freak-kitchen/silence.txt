How are you doing? Are you ok?
Lovely day to get blown away
While God and cancer sing a duet
Hey, your neighbour's a paedophile
Crackheads and Nazis, Amen - Sieg Hail
Are we having a good time yet?
Rip out my eyes, I am finished to see
Drill in my brain, won't you ventilate me
Cut off my head, instant therapy...
Silence!
Applause - Laughter - Suicide
One pill too many, your wife just died
Where's my copy of Kind of Blue?
The sound of blood, the fragile smell
Dig this jacket, the strait model?
Lock me up now, before I hurt you
Rip out my eyes, I am finished to see
Drill in my brain, won't you ventilate me
Cut off my head, instant therapy...
Silence!
Janet's coffee enema and exorcism diet
Civil wars, Mc Donald's and H.I.V
Earthquakes, starvation, cut to commercial
Another boring tragedy
We are lost, we are all so blase
Cynical and fucked-up, depressed to the bone
A world full of zombies, feeding on self-hatred
Armed and all alone
