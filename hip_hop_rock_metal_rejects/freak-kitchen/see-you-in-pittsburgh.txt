You can not see your misery
But you are climbing on the misery-tree
You broadcast filth, you bring us pain
We sow a tumor in your brain
Turn on your TV, what do you see?
You're trapped inside our philosophy
Hallucinations becoming real
A fair price for the shit you deal
I don't know you...
I'm not your private toy-maniac
Well, well, well, I'll be paying you back
Don't know exactly just what to do
Maybe I'll die, but first I'm killing you
I don't know you
I don't want to
I'll see you in Pittsburgh
Long live the New Flesh
I can not see my misery
I guess I'm climbing up that misery-tree
But it's my life, it's my Swiss army-knife
Do as I want, I'll cut my self free
I don't know you
I don't want to
I'll see you in Pittsburgh
Long live the New Flesh
