Used to be so judgmental
God, I miss my naivety Life was a lot easier back then
My nose was too close to see
When you're getting older you're getting wiser
Well, I consider it a crock of shit
You live and learn and still you make the same mistakes
Almost beginning to accept it
My objectivity is like a curse
Gentle and diplomatic to the core
Look at everything from every angle
I smile when you would start a war...
Bull, bull, bull is all I say
Bull, bull, bull most everyday
Bull, bull, bull is like super glue
Bull, bull, bull, sad but true...
You're full of bull too!
Folks, I have come to the conclusion
Since we always follow the same pattern
Could the human race be bound to fuck up
We're so extremely slow to learn
But, hey, let's look at the bright side
You and me know ignorance is bliss
And I'm just a freaky musician
So you might as well forget all this...
Bull, bull, bull is all I say
Bull, bull, bull most everyday
Bull, bull, bull is like super glue
Bull, bull, bull, sad but true
You're full of bull too!
