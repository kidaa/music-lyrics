Tiny fingers from afar
Born to sow your push-up bra
Billions spent on your new campaign
The greater the profit, the greater the pain
Hey Mister
That nose of yours seems to grow
Hey Mister
I got to know
How about the kid down in Olongapo?
I got to know
I hate your stinking logo
Hey Mister
You sinister Pinocchio
Hey Mister
I got to know
How about the kid down in Olongapo?
I got to know
I hate your stinking logo
Spare me your attempts to charity
I smell business strategy
