Do you think you could bear it?
Would you put up with the mess
Today's kids do?
All the shit that surround us
How would you make love if fist-fucking was All you knew?
Hope you will make it
Hope you can take it
Life ain't no picnic
I wish I had a mental survival kit
I'm losing it, I'm freakin' out, I'm going insane
Drowning in a sea of guilt and pain
Everyone's a victim on this stinking planet
Do my best to swim on the sinking planet
Hope you will make it
Hope you can take it
Life ain't no picnic...
The information overkill
The twisted ideals
The expense of anxiety
Exploit us and drug us
Blunt us for good
Rip us off what is left of our dignity
I'm losing it, I'm freakin' out, I'm going insane
Drowning in a sea of guilt and pain
Everyone's a victim on this stinking planet
Do my best to swim on the sinking planet
Open up and swallow...
Haven't we bent over long enough?
