Shut up, I've heard enough
Daddy's boy, a well-dressed clown
Why don't you kill yourself
The stock market just went down
I've been much too passive much too long
Looked the other way
When something was wrong
Beg to differ, hate to disagree
But you stink fat hypocrisy
So quietly, I refuse to hum along
I don't believe in your philosophy
Materialistic rivalry
So quietly, I refuse to hum along
I refuse
Sure thing, you got a groovy car
The leather seats are so sublime
Let me set you free
I'll wreck it for you anytime
Raise your middle fingers in the air
Screw your cell-phones
Show me that you care
Beg to differ, hate to disagree
But you stink fat hypocrisy
So quietly, I refuse to hum along
I don't believe in your philosophy
Materialistic rivalry
So quietly, I refuse to hum along
I refuse
Your blind belief in new technology
Your way of life don't mean shit to me
Quietly, I refuse to hum along
A fancy suit is happiness to you
The symbolism of a polished shoe
Quietly, I refuse to hum along
