Who are you to tell me what to see?
Who are you to tell me who to be?
Who are you to tell me what to read?
Who are you to tell me what I need?
You fucking hypocrites
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - Lie Freedom
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie -
Kiss freedom goodbye
Who are you to treat me like a moron?
What version of the truth am I supposed to rely on?
Turn it all around 'till it don't make sense
Deny it ever happened is your best defense
You fucking hypocrites
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - Lie Freedom
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie -
Kiss freedom goodbye
Indoctrinated from the day you start to wallow
They shove it down your throat and expect you to swallow
Freedom is a product you don't have to strive for
Just go around the corner and pick up some more
You fucking hypocrites
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - Lie Freedom
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie - I tell you
Freedom's a lie, yeah a lie, yeah a lie -
Kiss freedom goodbye
