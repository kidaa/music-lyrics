We have to be prepared to
Protect our privacy
The wife and kids all carry guns
A family army
Got fired, girlfriend dumped you?
Loosing hair, got a Willie too small?
Just choose the right caliber
And go bezerk in your local mall
Come to Trigger Paradise
One more human sacrifice
A worthless sacrifice...
Don't interfere, we worship our Gun God here
So insecure, you don't dare to challenge us or
Restrict our right... got bullets for you to bite
So don't interfere, as we worship our... Gun God
Aggression always lurking
The rabble just makes you sick
Then your kid guns down his best friend
Preach that middle class panic
Come to Trigger Paradise
One more human sacrifice
A worthless sacrifice...
Don't interfere, we worship our Gun God here
So insecure, you don't dare to challenge us or
Restrict our right... got bullets for you to bite
So don't interfere, as we worship our... Gun God
