Everyone looks at her
She only looks at me
The waiter introduces us to each other
This woman's a delicacy
My eyes lick her body
She smells oh so nice
I wanna eat her all up
A taste of paradise
Appetize, Appetize,
Appetize, Appetizer
I am a simple man
And I've got simple needs
I'm starving to see what she's hiding inside
Hungry for her dirty deeds
A one way conversation
Her eyes say it all
We both know what we want tonight
I feel my stomach call
Appetize, Appetize,
Appetize, Appetizer
