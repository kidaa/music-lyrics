It's so easy to criticize
When you live your life with blind-folded eyes
You're so scared that you can't relate
To the world outside, and your fear leads to hate
Hate
It's so cushy to kick back
And take the easy way out
You think you're God's gift to mankind
I say you're blind
Blind
You've invented a world of your own
Where your narrow mind lives all alone
Buy more guns, call it patriotism
Your ignorance turns into racism
Racism
Its so cushy to kick back
And take the easy way out
You think you're God's gift to mankind I say your blind
Blind
