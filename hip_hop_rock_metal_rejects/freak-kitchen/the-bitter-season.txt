The bitter season's here
The lies, the pain, the fear
And you'll see inside of me
You've never seen before
The bitter season's here
Won't shed a single tear
Wish you would turn around
And walk right out that door
My face is whipped by rain
The wind eases the pain
But when the silence comes I pray that you'll be gone
The bitter season's here
This time I see it clear
But it took me years and years
To see what was going on
Look into my eyes...
Give me the days we had
And make 'em last forever
And I will cry for you
If you will cry for me
I've met eternity
Brother insanity
It was too late for us
A long, long time ago
The bitter season's here
The lies, the pain, the fear
Got to be movin'
But where I just don't know
Look into my eyes...
Give me the days we had
And make 'em last forever
And I will cry for you
If you will cry for me
