A neighbour stole my VCR
Can't afford to fill up my car
It's been a while since I paid the rent
I wonder where that money went
Fox & Scully just disappeared
Well, I could always sit here and grow a beard
Broke a rib trying to find the bed
The lights are out and the phone is dead
Or is it my head
Entertain me, entertain me
Make me laugh 'til I hit the floor
Entertain me, entertain me
Crack a joke 'til I can't take no more
My girl is gone and so's the cat
The junk I eat is making me fat
The virus-scan fucked up last night
While I was jerking off to a neat website
Spent my bucks on apathy
Precious, precious enemy
The landlord's dog just ate my shoe
My buddy's busy sniffin' glue
I'm thinking about you
Entertain me, entertain me
Make me laugh 'til I hit the floor
Entertain me, entertain me
Slip for me 'til I can't take no more
Take your hypocritic pointers
And shove 'm up your ass
Don't need your condescending attitude
Find somebody else to harass
