Hey, what's going on?
Drool before I'm gone
Waste some precious time, you know
Sure I'm looking good
Don't you think I would?
I got Cindy Crawford's video
Go and get the blow
I know where to go
Coolest place you ever seen
Maybe we can dance
In a bathroom romance
To a ballad of East 17
Try some ecstasy
Get as dumb as me
Read even Sting's a fan
Rave 'til the end
Invent another trend:
Mandela joins the Ku Klux Klan
Any way the wind blow
I swallow everything!
Any way the winds blow
I'll sing the words you sing!
That is how the story goes
Consume 'til I get sick!
Any way the winds blow
Proud to be plastic!
Prozac with tea
One happy family
Still remember how to laugh
Dad gets Mommy wet
With porno on the Net
My brother spits his guts in half
I don't really care
Gotta do my hair
To get Eddie Vedder's autograph
I am V.I.P
You can come with me
Just get another pair of shoes
We can rob a bar
Then we steal a car
Smoke someone and we'll be news
Show me you're romantic
Let me your chick
Shoot some dude to prove you're mine
Show me you're romantic
Let me your chick
Send shivers down my teenage spine
Any way the wind blow
I swallow everything!
Any way the winds blow
I'll sing the words you sing!
That is how the story goes
Consume 'til I get sick!
Any way the winds blow
Proud to be plastic!
