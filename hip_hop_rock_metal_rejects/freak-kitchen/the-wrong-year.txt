This is the wrong year
This is the wrong year
Believe me, I'm sincere
We could use some help here
This is the wrong year
The planet's state's a bloody mess
You and I could not care less
Bored we look the other way
The more we learn the less we know
Our way of life just has to go
It's about to ricochet
Do we get what we deserve?
This is the wrong year
This is the wrong year
Believe me, I'm sincere
We could use some help here
This is the wrong year
Simple fact: first we fry
We don't act: well, then we die
A global abscess hard to ignore
Tomorrow is a little late
Can you afford to wait?
Indolent we consume some more
We need to cut Tellus some slack
Endangered species won't come back
And we will all pay for sure
Do we get what we deserve?
