Hurry! Hurry!
I know you can do it
Faster! Faster!
Never mind that bleeding from your nose
Busy! Busy!
Always under pressure
Rush it! Rush it!
Shoot another climber overdose
Dive into the Burn Out Trap
You don't need to take this crap
Snap! Snap!
Or stay true to yourself
Snap! Snap!
Or stay true to yourself
Blackout! Blackout!
Too much of everything
Routine! Routine!
Dance to the corporate bullets
Failure! Failure!
You're never good enough
Push it! Push it!
Far beyond your limits
Fall into the Burn Out Trap
We don't need to take this crap
Snap! Snap!
Or stay true to yourself
Snap! Snap!
Or stay true to yourself
