Them calories just gotta go
Stopped eating a year ago
I'm so thin you will not spot me sideways
I wanna be a supermodel
I wanna look like I'm dead
I wanna be somebody's product
I'm beautiful and give good head
Working on a trendy pose
Cover the pimples on my nose
Saving up to fix the cheek-bones in my face
I wanna be a supermodel
I wanna look like I'm dead
I wanna be somebody's product
I'm beautiful and give good head
Striving for that Third World Look
Skinny is trendy with a matching doek
Gee, I'm looking forward to
United Colors of Benetton's Kosovo Collection
My mom and dad think I am ready
They say I'm God's gift to men
I'll throw a super model party
Tomorrow morning I'll be ten
