His chest is pretty hairy
He's got a breath from hell
If you lost your head, he'll find it
A perfect sense of smell
When push comes to shove
Unconditional love
Is his way to sweat things out
When you think they're coming
To take it all away
Shithead's gonna save the day
Shithead's gonna save the day
He's everything but fussy
Any crap will do
He'll wreck your backyard in a second
Mess up your furniture too
When push comes to shove
Unconditional love
Is his way to sweat things out
When you think they're coming
To take it all away
Shithead's gonna save the day
Shithead's gonna save the day
Shithead is a true companion
He'll guard your precious thermos
You can use him as a cover
To hide your special purpose
