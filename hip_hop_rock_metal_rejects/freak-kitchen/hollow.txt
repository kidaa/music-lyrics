Constant ringing inside me ears
Little demons inside my head
Static caught between my teeth
Outta focus, my thoughts in shreds
I don't know what to say to you
I don't know what the hell to do
This damn town is killing me
Maybe that's what I want it to
Hollow
I'm feeling so hollow
There's nothing inside me
I wonder who I am, this body is
Hollow
Everyday is always the same
Only got my self to blame
Can't go on, but I can't go back
So lethargic I forget my name
Something is missing, but I don't know what
If this is hell, I'm here to rot
Feels so empty inside of me
Got to fill this hole I got
Hollow
I'm feeling so hollow
There's nothing inside me
I wonder who I am, this body is
Hollow
