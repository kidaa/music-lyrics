You think you're so strong
Living in your outside
Pathetic aestetic world
The pieces of your puzzle
Fit just right
Every once in a while
But when it comes to
Real life you're kind of weak
Let's say your strength
Doesn't fit in to reality
Let's say your expectations
Of the growing man
They're just not for real this time
The truth you're living without
Has a real good time at your mind
The truth you're living without
Push you down and leave you behind
When your pride's so strong
There's nothing that
Could break your cage
Your perspective is refilled
The people you love and
The city that you were born in
Their loving ain't endless
But even though you
Stand alone with your sins
The lovely smiles
Are quite useless
Ugly pain, laughing at your brain
Driving you insane, driving you insane
The truth you're living without
Is having a real good time at your mind
The truth you're living without
Push you down and leave you behind
