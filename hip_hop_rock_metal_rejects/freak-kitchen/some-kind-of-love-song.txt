This is some kind of love song
I can't find the words, I was born wrong
Girl, I've been trying for so long
This is some kind of love song
I'd like to kiss you, but I'm much too shy
My lips ain't working, no matter how I try
I'd like to whisper sweet words in your ear
But when I'm trying you pretend you don't hear
You say I have to play unplugged
Just like they do on MTV
Well, I got six strings on my guitar, girl
But I need electricity
This is some kind of love song
I can't find the words, I was born wrong
Girl, I've been trying for so long
This is some kind of love song
Rented a limo to pick you up from work
But you didn't see me, I felt like a jerk
I bought you flowers so you would be impressed
Then you're allergic, well, I should have guessed
Then I made dinner to surprise you
But when you got here you already ate
Then I invited you to the movie
My car freaked out, and I was late
De Niro had to wait...
This is some kind of love song
I can't find the words, I was born wrong
Girl, I've been trying for so long
This is some kind of love song
