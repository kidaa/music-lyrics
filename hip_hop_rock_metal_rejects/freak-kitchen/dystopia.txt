How many died? How many were injured?
Is this the grossest the you ever heard?
Maybe someone is gonna fry on death row?
We need to know, we need to know
Who can we hang for irresponsibility?
Where is the fucker who's in charge of security?
We need a scapegoat, and we need it now
Get it somehow, get it somehow
I ain't heading for Dystopia
There's no way you can drag me to Dystopia
I ain't heading for Dystopia
There's no way you can drag me to Dystopia
Have we got pictures of all the deceased?
It's getting even better:
The numbers just increased
Make sure it's bloody when we're on the air
We really care, we really care
The more details, the better off we'll be
We never stop, you have the right to see
It's our duty and we serve it well
Let's go to hell, let's go to hell
I ain't heading for Dystopia
There's no way you can drag me to Dystopia
I ain't heading for Dystopia
There's no way you can drag me to Dystopia
If it don't bleed, it don't lead
If it don't bleed, it don't lead
I ain't heading for Dystopia...
