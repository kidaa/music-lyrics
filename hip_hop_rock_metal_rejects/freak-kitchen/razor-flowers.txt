You should know better, and so should I
That rapid tongue brings out my Evil Eye
So, here we are now, it's like a curse
I see you shaking, hyper ventilating
A blow without a warning
This can't get any worse
You must remember to forget you ever knew me
You must remember to forget I was ever by your side
Remember to forget you ever got the razor flowers
Self-esteem is running low
Ran out of good times much too long ago
Those lying pictures on our shelf
I pray that someday you begin to feel
All your wounds heal
I loathe my stinking self
You must remember to forget you ever knew me
You must remember to forget I was ever by your side
Remember to forget you ever got the razor flowers
Don't trust my charming smile
The Razor Flowers
Will only bloom a while...
