Trying hard to keep my cool
Trying hard to forgive
But I've been pushed around too long
Drained on my will to live
Don't provoke me, I'm a desperate man
You don't wanna know, where I'm gonna go
You don't wanna see, the ugly side of me
Let it all come down, burn it to the ground
You don't wanna see, the ugly side of me
Rigid mind, hollow soul
Never thought it'd come to this
Years of scorn just makes you numb
You've kissed your last Judas kiss
Don't provoke me, I'm a desperate man
You don't wanna know, where I'm gonna go
You don't wanna see, the ugly side of me
Let it all come down, burn it to the ground
You don't wanna see, the ugly side of me
Causing damage to protect myself
My stinking pride has never
Done me any good
Always defensive, I'm not strong enough
To show my weakness,
Though I wish to God I could
Don't provoke me
Don't provoke me
I'm a desperate man
