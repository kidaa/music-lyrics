I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan
Healthy
Start the day with yoga
Live in harmony
Then purge the guts real good
And have some oriental tea
Then I stroll into the garden
Where I'm working nude
You see, I grow my own plants
Yeah, I'm a healthy dude
I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan
Healthy
Live by my carrot
I'll save you from decay
Think de-caffeinated
Throw your cigarettes away
I'm a vegetarian
And you should be one too
And sound mind in sound body
I know what best for you
I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan
Yoghurt
Then one day it happened
The healthy man got sick
He ate all kinds of herbs
But they wouldn't do the trick
The healthy man got desperate
But no one gave a fuck
He took one step too far
And got run over by a truck
He was so healthy, he was the healthy man
He ate a lot of greens, he was a yoghurt-fan
He was so healthy, he was the healthy man
He ate a lot of beans, but no one gave a damn
