I'd be happy to humiliate myself
I'd be happy to bend over just to be somebody
Be somebody
Be somebody
I'd do anything for ten seconds of fame
I'd be happy to bend over just to be somebody
Be somebody
Be somebody
Fly me to some tropical island today
Where I can tempt your brains away
Lock me in a bunker for a year or two
The tabloids love it and so do you
That's entertainment!
That's entertainment!
I'd be happy to humiliate myself
I'd be happy to bend over just to be somebody
Be somebody
Be somebody
I'd do anything for ten seconds of fame
I'd be happy to bend over just to be somebody
Be somebody
Be somebody
Young, old, singles, husbands and wives
I give meaning to your worthless lives
And when it's all over and I leave your TV
Half the country will need therapy
That's entertainment!
That's entertainment!
