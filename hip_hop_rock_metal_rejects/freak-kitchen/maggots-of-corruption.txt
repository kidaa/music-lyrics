I used to be a man of dignity
A man of my word
You could depend on me
It hurts so fine
When you cross that line
The point of no return
I used to preach strict morality
An ethical man
Complete credibility
You try and try
Then Greed comes by
And you crash and burn
I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots
We crawl through your weak pathetic brain
We thrive on your guilt
We thrive on your pain
Hideous crimes
For nickels and dimes
We corrupt your soul
I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots...
