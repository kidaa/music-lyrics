They never tell you face to face
They are the one and only race
They always smile and are polite
They go through life in black and white Hey!
They close their eyes and all is bliss
They always scent a prejudice
They cannot spell hypocrisy
They're everywhere , they're you and me

chorus
How did we become
such hateful little people?
How did we become
the scab that we are?
Is it coming through
hateful little people?
How did we become
the scab that we are?
I hate you, hate
You hate me, hate
Hate ourselves, hate
-Chorus- x2 Hey!x3
