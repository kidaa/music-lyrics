Good evening and welcome
Would you like an aperitif?
May we recommend
The Disinformation Beef?
We do our very utmost
To meet all your demands
Just sit back and enjoy
While we wash our dirty hands
Feed your hungry eye...
Propaganda pie
Have a slice of lie
Propaganda pie
We serve the only version
The daily six o clock buffet
We edit your dinner
Cut the improper parts away
Special flavorings
Make sure you stay obedient
Nothing is more efficient
Than a tampered ingredient
Try!
The propaganda pie
Have a slice of lie
Propaganda pie
How about some desert?
More manipulated wine?
We got the most delicious cake
To send shivers down your spine
It's got a funny smack
And the icing is malign...
Try!
The propaganda pie
Have a slice of lie
