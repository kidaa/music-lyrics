I can hear me now
telling me it's my life
I can hear me now
telling me I'm okay at least until the sun goes down
I can hear me now
talking to all my tears
I can hear me now
telling me to stay away but begging me not to go far
There's nothing wrong with your life
Yes I'm putting all the squares in the circles
Freedom's only grieving for you now
Cause I'm not wasting no more lifetimes screaming at me
I can see me now
kissing and pouring me a bath.
I can hear me now
Telling me I'm alright
even when I break my heart.
No, theres nothing wrong with this life.
You can put all your worlds on circle.
I can never kiss me goodbye.
Cause I'll be spending my whole lifetime ...
Screaming at me.
Flesh only matters in life
You can't believe your whole world's on this circle very low.
Spirit's are bleeding from my mind
Cause I'm just wasting all my lifetimes...
Constantly wasting all my lifetimes
I'm just so tired of wasting all my lifetimes...
Screaming at me.
