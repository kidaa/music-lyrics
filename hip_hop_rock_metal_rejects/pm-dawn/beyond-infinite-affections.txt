Mr. Wonderfull you, you're thinking 'bout life
You're thinking 'bout love, 
you're thinkin' 'bout the ways to break it down...
You got 18 myths and 5 different ways into the mind.
But you're lookin for the verbs and nouns... 
Po' you, watcha wanna do switch rooms?
And walk around space with your black and blue balloons
No, from what I hear, you used to dance in the face of fear
But now you're runnin from the monkey on the moon
It's 12 o'clock, what makes a difference in the tides
Exploding paths to dismay, and if so
I'll never catch you with a runaround Sue
Playin peek-a-boo with ribbon in your fro...hell no
If I was to lie, if I was to cheat.
Would you see me with a flower in my hand
Then beyond infinite connecitons 
sit these excuses for all the lies
Understand
 chorus 
Do you love me...No. Could you love...No.
Would you try to love me...No
Then I don't think you understand.
Breaka one breaka two, tell me what to do.
The room's full check your psyche or get another spoonful.
Caress the silk lines until it turns pink. 
Another link that wants to push you to the brink.
If only distance likes to leave you in the clouds,
and fear was merely created by a man. 
Then beyond infinite connections there exists nothing
And nothing understands
 chorus
