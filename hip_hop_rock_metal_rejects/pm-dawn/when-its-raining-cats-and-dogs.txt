Falling leaves and broken hearts.
I believe you are the same.
Have you noticed streaks and blurs.
Interrupting all the pain...
Perish the thought of leaving you and living blind.
Ask me if I killed the questions of why the realm has lost it's shine...
Chorus
So when it's raining cats and dogs.
I won't complain and I won't mind.
When it's raining cats and dogs
I'll understand the reasons why...
If I'm looking for you and the pictures start to fade.
Pushing through the clouded hearts.
Still perplexed at what they've made...
Reading the words.
That describe my frame of mind.
Pull me through the fears of nowhere.
Leave me waiting for the rhymes...
So when it's raining cats and dogs.
I know it won't be no surprise.
When it's raining cats and dogs,
I kinda wonder if I'll cry...
Repeat Chorus
