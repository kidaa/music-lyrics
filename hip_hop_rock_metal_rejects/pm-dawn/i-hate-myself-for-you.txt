Don't waste your precious light, all my life
I've hated myself for you
Feel free that's alright, I'm terrified
I hate myself for you
Ooh...
Don't you see, I hate myself for you x2
Too weak, too divine
All my life, I hate myself for you
So why do they think I have this ";Buddha gene";
When I can hardly see the angels
I hate myself for you
They're amazed, I can rape my own emotions
So sometimes it's horrible to be me
Defending myself against me drives me crazy
Martyrdom is healthy
Martyrdom is healthy
Ooh...
Don't you see, I hate myself for you x2
Armageddon knows I'll b good to you
I can hardly see the angels
I hate myself for you
But I don't know the reasons why the angels sing to you
I feel just like Joseph
I feel just like Joseph
I hate myself for you
Ooh...
Don't you see, I hate myself for you x2
