Father now my day is through
So I take the time to talk to you
Cause there's so many questions on my mind
I need ot know that when I die
I'llbe with you among the sky
Where I can see all beauty through your eyes
All my life I've been around
A thoughtless world trying to bring me down
But you held my hand and promised me a better day
I try and give what you gave to me
A soul that lives through eternity
But they ignore my cries and they turn away
Father, will the pain subside?
Or is it all a waste of time
I think I know the answer
From the years of tears you've cried
Though I tried so hard to cure
For a disillusioned world I'm scared
Cause I see the disappointmentin your eyes.
Lord, is there a remedy
To cure this world of misery
And give our children something to look forward to?
And if I could I'd gladly give
I'd give my life so they could live
Away from all the sorrow like I wanted to
So I fold my hands and pray
For those who've throuw our world away
It's so hard to see a future
When we destroy it everyday
Lord, I try so hard to cure
For a disillusioned world I'm so scared
Cause I can see the disappointment in your eyes
Father, now I say goodbye
And I promise you that I will try
To make the world a better place to live again
And if I die would you please promise me
You'll save a place in eternity
Sitting by your side, amen.
