In anything that you do, I will be happy for you, so ecstatic for you
Whatever you are to be, I hope that you'll think of me within your
sweetest daydreams
Whenever you decide to die, I hope you're fortified with all you want
in life
Whenever you have to change, don't let it make you run away from
all that I have to say
Because they'll love you today, when all they really wanna do is ruin
everything
I just can't sleep at nite
Knowing the wolves are out to get you
And all the hurt awaiting with life
I just can't walk away knowing...
The pain might leave you broken
If there's anything you might hate, don't make my mistakes,
let it dissipate
All the things you'll go thru, I know that they'll punish me
more than they punish you
Anytime guilt is felt, don't touch thru no one else, they'll 
make you hurt yourself
Anything you might see looks that looks like it's defeating me,
don't be afraid of these things
Because you're stronger than me, and all they really wanna do is ruin
everything
I just can't sleep at nite
Knowing the wolves are out to get you
And all the hurt awaiting with life
I just can't walk away knowing...
The pain might leave you broken
Knowing...
The pain that left me broken
Because they'll love you today, when all they really wanna do is ruin
everything
In anything that you do, I will be happy for you...
so ecstatic for you
