I'll be a witness forever, you see I've always known
While convincing all these chambers there's no danger in being alone
Save me a gift in your ";never"; and I shall smile for you
I'll tell everyone the sun shines on me just protect me like I know
I know you'll always hate me but....I got love for you.
I know forever's moonlight, so I can dream I'm something special
Yes, you'll always hate me but....much more infinite is my love for you.
I'll be the victim for always....forever that belongs
For reasoning with all my burdons, sending tears to cure what's wrong
Send me forgiveness forever because I swear to God
I'm bleeding for no reason, no....I'm not scared at all.
I guess you'll always hurt me but...all my love's in you
I know forever's moonlight, so I can dream of something special
Yes you'll always hurt me but...much more infinite is my love for you
I know you'll always curse me but....all my love's in you
I know forever's moonlight, so I can dream of something special
Yes you'll always hurt me but....much more infinite is my love for you
