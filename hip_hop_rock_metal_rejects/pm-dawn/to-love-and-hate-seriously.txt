Seriously...
A fortune, says they love me too
I think the reason for the treason
is burning so lovely.
Yes I'm killing me with time
'cause on occasion I can see 
with desperation lives forever.
And only when you're here,
do I really miss them
And only when you're gone,
do I feel like they're close to me
Then in trust they hurt you
In love they hurt you
If in vain they hurt you
Then who loves you...?
Seriously...
I can love you
like none can love you
but if you can love you
who hurts you?
Seriously...
Seriously...
Sometimes, I know you cry
because there's nothing else to do
and breathing just won't convince you
I'm through, fighting with you
I really wish you didn't hate the 
way I listen in between you
And only when you're here,
do I really miss you
Only when you're gone,
do I feel like you're close to me
Then in trust they hurt you
In love they hurt you
If in vain they hurt you
Then who loves you...?
Seriously...
I can love you
like none can love you
but if you can love you
who hurts you?
Seriously...
Seriously..............?
