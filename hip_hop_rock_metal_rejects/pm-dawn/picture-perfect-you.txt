The epitome of beauty
An idea that soaks my soul
Your aura does consume me
And throws my mello out of control
I've waited all this life
To capture me a glimpse of the living end
You never say a word
So I replay my memory
Time and time again
I don't want to live another day
And make believe that everything's okay
Where's the good that left and went away
The perfect you, the perfect you, perfect you
A thought so very lovely
But a painful sight tosee
Ya always let me down
But I can't seem to let it be
I  long to see your smile
Since it's been gone this rhythm has no rhyme
You never say a word
Can I keep my soul, if I lose my mind
[repeat chorus]
