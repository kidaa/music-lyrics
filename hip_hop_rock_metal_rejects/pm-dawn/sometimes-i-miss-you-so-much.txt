There are only whispers and shadows for me
The way things are and the way things are
And with this I blow a kiss to disaster
Because I wish to perfect my heart...
I gotta check my mind...
Am I in tune with you?
Do we connect within the realm of the gods?
Electric word ";life"; that means forever
and thats a mighty long time when you've kissed divine
So divine...as with you
The Christ within will come in the clouds
Trusting ";divinity is always with me";
Trusting ";this is the here and now";
Mercy's right...I gotta check my love
and I'm trying to do as such
I don't let the demons get me down
it's just that sometimes I miss you so much...
I can envision all things to life
I can understand realistic ways
But I invent the next phase in forever
I like you, rewrite the next page
It's so pristine...it's so untouched
I'm an emmaculate sign of devotion
Still unseen...I'm thinking so what
Bless me cursed with colorful emotions
God said ";I guess you don't know I'm you
because you know the entire 360";
A Christ that's me
A Christ that's you
Reguardless...constantly within me
I'm so not responsible for this
I'm just a man in love with so much
I know love...you'll always be with me
It's just sometimes I miss you so much
