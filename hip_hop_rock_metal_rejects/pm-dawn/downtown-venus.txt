Downtown Venus
I'm Downtown Venus, And I'm trying to be by myself.....myself
Habitual dreamers, And no one dreams enought to get me home
I'm Downtown Venus, And they're trying to devine my self.....my self and they 
keep saying
chorus
You could be into you but you don't know what you're like
yeah.....you would be into you but you don't know what you're like.
I'm Downtown Venus, And it's alright to kiss my life.....my life
I got misdemeanors, Mounting up for sleeping on the ";nows";
I'm Downtown Venus, And I can't get behind my worth....my worth but they keep 
saying
chorus
I'm downtown Venus, where simplicity is always hurt....always hurt
I can't stop screamin', 'cause I'm failing to entertain all of my selves
I'm Downtown Venus And I constantly remind myself....my self
I could be into me but....I don't know what I'm like
Yeah...I could be into me but....I dont' know what I'm like.............
