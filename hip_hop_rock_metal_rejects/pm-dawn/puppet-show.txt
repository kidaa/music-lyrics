Baby works at the puppet show...and sometimes I can't go
Baby works at the puppet show...and sometimes I can't go
I know I can disappear like Shakespeare's Romeo
I know that good things always treat me bad
But don't you think it's strange that I don't know?
Baby works at the puppet show...and sometimes I don't go
Baby works at the puppet show...and sometimes I won't go
If I can't make it dissapear that I will have to go
I wonder if happiness will meet me there
But classify me strange 'cause I can't go
Baby awakes at the puppet show...and sometimes there's no show
Baby freaks from the puppet show...and sometimes there's no show
I know that I love you but I'm bleeding all I know
you do a great job of wanting me
But don't you think it's strange I told you so
Baby works at the puppet show....and sometimes I can't go
Baby plays at the puppet show...and sometimes I can't go
Baby works at the puppet show...and sometimes I can't go
Baby hurts at the pupet show...and I'm just trying to understand you
