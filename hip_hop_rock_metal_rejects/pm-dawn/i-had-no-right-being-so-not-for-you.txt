Why can't I keep you from the cold
Seem to know the difference faces
No matter what road you travel on
You go through the darkest places
I can't tell the angels it'll be good 
for you
But wanting to say blesses be the 
darkness
For bringing the life through
But I'd be lying to myself
I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the way 
I feel
I had no right being so uncontent, 
being so confused,
being so not for you
You're in love with all that you don't know
It animates your expectations
But what's the easiest way to hurt a man
Give him all he's ever wanted
Trying to tell the angels I don't 
know what to do
While convincing myself to believe 
all the sadness have purpose to
Makes me hate this
I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the 
way I feel
I had no right being so uncontent, 
being so confused,
being so not for you
And when you asked the angels to 
make you a better you
Dream all you want
Cause all the light you occupy
they will try and take it all from 
you
I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the 
way I feel
I had no right being so uncontent, 
being so confused,
being so not for you
