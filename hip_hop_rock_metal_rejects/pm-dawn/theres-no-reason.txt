Sometimes I cry for my people
What can you do to make them understand
Why can't they see things just like you do
And help their fellow man
Living in a world a world
Full of sin and seperation
Living in a world a world
Full of hate and bigotry
I look around
The I pray for my salvation
I close my eyes
And look beyond the skies
There's no reason we can't live together
There's no reason we can't make it better
If I could die for my people
And erase the pain they've left behind
To save us all, I'd gladly give it all
And die a thousand times...
Living in a world a world
Full of greed and false ambition
We're gonna lose our world
'Cause we're livin' so carefree
Then pray for your salvation
Close your eyes
And look beyond the skies
There's no reason we can't live together
There's no reason we can't make it better
