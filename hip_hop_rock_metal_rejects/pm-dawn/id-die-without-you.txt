Is it my turn to wish you were lying here.
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping.
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world.
Or even imagine your emotions.  Tell myself anything...
Is it my turn to hold you by the hands.
Tell you I love you and you not hear me...
Is it my turn to totally understand.
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing...
Chorus
If I've to give away...
The feeling that I feel.
If I've to sacrifice...
Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby.
If I've to take apart...
All that I am...
Is there anything that I would not do,
'Cause inside I'd die without you...
Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done.
But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning...
Is it my turn to be the one to cry.
Isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around...
So take every little piece of my heart...
So take every little piece of my soul...
So take every little piece of my mind...
'Cause if you're gone... inside...
I'd die without you...
Chorus
