They try and keep you down
But they don't know, they don't know your dreams
The pride that leps you get throught the day
Something a nickel or a dime can't take away
Understand love for what it is, and keep it universal
Yes I know
That you hate what you are
But don't you know
The promised land's not that far
Yes I know
Your pride has gone away
But there's always another day
So I say
Hey brother
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll help you turn it all around
You cn count on me
Hey brother
I'm here because I understand
I'll always treat you like a man
You can count on me
You can count on me
Don't let'em keep you down
Ya gotta try, as hard as it may seem
A victim of a world that's lost its mind
Still the same, you're just like me
They say love is eternal, but I bet it's longer than that
Yes I know
That you hate what you are
Don't you know
The promised land's not far
Yes I know
Your life has gone astray
There's always another day
So I say
[repeat chorus]
