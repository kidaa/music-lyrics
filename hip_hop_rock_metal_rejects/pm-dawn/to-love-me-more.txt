When you run away with someone
to the corners of your mind
Be it time or place or space of love.
I think you know, I think you know....
Whatever magnifies you.
My heart won't let it go so,
whatever the barriers,
whatever the forces are.
I know that they don't matter, 
but they do...And that's why....
 chorus 
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you......to love me more
If you could see what I see
when I rest my eyes on you.
Be it people words or anything
I think they know, I think they know...
If its you its you and only you
'Cause my emotions run my life.
So, wherever the rainbows go, 
wherever the teardrpos are
I bet they feel the love I get from you
And that's why...
 chorus 
It's funny you should say
I dream you all this time
'Cause all the time, I think I do...
It's funny you should say 
You see the love. I push to your heart...
I sure hope its in your nature
To love me more....to love me more...
to love me more...to love me more
