1999
I was dreaming when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
But when i woke up this morning could a sworn is was judgement day
The sky was all a purple there were people running everywhere
Trying to run from theyre destruction, and no I didn't even care
They say two thousand zero zero party's over oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like its 1999
They say two thousand zero zero, party's over oop out of time
So tonight I'm gonna cry like its 1999
Once in a Lifetime
Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by, 
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by.
You may find yourself living in a shack and shack
You may find yourself in another part of the world
You may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself with a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
You may ask yourself, how did I get here
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing under ground
Into the pool again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing under ground
You may ask your self where is this house
You may ask yourself where does this highway go
You mayask yourself am I right or wrong
You may ask yourself ";My God, what have I done?";
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing under ground
Into the pool again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing under ground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was........
