I should'a known not to watch that comet
I should'a known not to give you this
I should've known not to throw away my records
I should've never purchased compact discs
I can't remember inventing the atom
I don't remember what it's like to be God
I should'a known not to watch Jerry Springer
I should've never watched the People's Court
I don't remember inventing the wheel
But I remember making the Styrofoam
I should'a known not to watch that comet
I should'a known not to sex Amy Fisher
I should've never watched the OJ trial
I should've known not to shoot John Lennon
I should've never gotten AOL
I should remember not to blow up buildings
I should remember what it's like to be God
I should've known never sent the stork to the Dahmer's
I should'a known not to make free will
I can't remember my life as a Mormon
I can't remember five minutes ago
I should'a known not to watch that comet
I can't remember my days as an asshole
The same day I made the CIA
I should'a known not to watch that comet
I should've known better
