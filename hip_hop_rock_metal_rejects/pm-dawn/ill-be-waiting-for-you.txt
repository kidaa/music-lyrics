chorus
I'll be waiting for you, even if it takes you all of your life.
I'll be waiting for you, 'till you know within yourself that you are so divine.
Baby....baby, I know what you want from you.
Can yousee me? I'm divinity, and I can mean so much to you.
You're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun.
It'll more than just a lifetime to understand where we are.
So patience is nothing....
'Cause I'll do anything for you.
chorus
Baby.....tell me, why must there be pain with you?
Your precious emotions, when will they be free from you?
See you're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun.
And everything else I need that confuses me so much
So...
Baby....don't hate me
'Cause I've seen better things in you
chorus
See you're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun
And I can bet that you matter but I'm having too much fun,
so.....
Maybe love will save me
And I can keep your hate from you.
